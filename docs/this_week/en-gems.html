<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/0/0"><em>The Watchtower,</em></a> ]</strong></p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/0/0">3/1/2009, p. 17</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>A Tree “the Foliage of Which Does Not Wither”</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">According to the psalmist, first there are some things we must shun. He mentioned “the counsel of the wicked ones,” “the way of sinners,” and “the seat of ridiculers.” To be happy, we need to turn away from those who ridicule or even ignore God’s laws.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/1/0">1/1/2007, pp. 4-5</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>How You Can Be Successful</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>“Counsel of the Wicked Ones”</strong></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The psalmist warns of the danger of walking in “the counsel of the wicked ones.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007001/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 1:1</a>) The chief “wicked one” is Satan the Devil. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007001/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 6:13</a>) The Scriptures tell us that he is “the ruler of this world” and that “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007001/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 16:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007001/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 John 5:19</a>) Thus, it is not surprising that much of the counsel heard in the world reflects that wicked one’s thinking.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">What kind of advice do wicked ones offer? Generally, wicked ones disrespect God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007001/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 10:13</a>) Their counsel, which ignores or disrespects God, is all around us. Modern society promotes “the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one’s means of life.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007001/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 John 2:16</a>) The media bombard us with a materialistic “get all you can out of life” philosophy. Worldwide, companies spend over 500 billion dollars (U.S.) a year on advertising to persuade people to buy their products​—whether consumers need them or not. And this propaganda has done more than simply change people’s buying habits. It has warped the world’s view of success.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">As a result, even though many possess things that years ago could only be dreamed about, they still have an unquenchable thirst for more material things. The feeling is that unless you have these things, you cannot be happy or successful. This thinking is a lie and “does not originate with the Father, but originates with the world.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007001/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 John 2:16</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span id="page5" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>Our Creator knows what will make us truly successful. His counsel differs from “the counsel of the wicked ones.” Therefore, trying to gain God’s blessing while walking along the world’s path to success is like trying to walk on two different roads at the same time. It just cannot be done. No wonder the Bible warns: “Do not conform outwardly to the standards of this world”!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007001/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Romans 12:2</a>, <em>Today’s English Version.</em></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>Do Not Let the World Shape You</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The world under Satan’s influence tries to appear interested in our welfare. However, we need to be careful. Remember that Satan selfishly deceived the first woman, Eve, to serve his own interests. Then he used her to lead Adam down the path of sin. Today, Satan also uses humans to deliver his wicked counsel.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">For example, David, mentioned in the preceding article, was expected to work extra hours and to make frequent business trips. “I would leave early Monday morning and come back Thursday evening,” said David. Understanding that such sacrifices are needed in order to obtain worldly success, sincere friends, family members, and workmates urged David: “Do it for your family.” They reasoned that he would have to keep such a schedule for only a few years until he was established. David explained: “They rationalized that this would be better for my family because I could bring home more money​—I could be more successful. Although I was not with my family, my friends convinced me that I was actually giving more to my family.” Like David, many are working hard to give their family everything that they think their loved ones need. But does following this kind of advice lead to success? What does a family really need?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">David found out while away on a business trip. “I was on the phone with my daughter Angelica, who said: ‘Daddy, why don’t you want to stay home with us?’ It was traumatic,” said David. His daughter’s remark strengthened his desire to turn in his resignation. David decided to give his family what they really needed​—him.</p>

<strong>Do You Find Delight in “the Law of Jehovah”?</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>The Secret of Happiness</strong></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 3. According to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004523/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Psalm 1:1</a>, what are some reasons why a godly person is happy?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004523/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 1</a> shows why a godly person is happy. Giving some reasons for such happiness, the psalmist sings: “Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked ones, and in the way of sinners has not stood, and in the seat of ridiculers has not sat.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004523/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 1:1</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 4.

Zechariah and Elizabeth, who had the joyous privilege of becoming the parents of John the Baptizer, “were righteous before God because of walking blamelessly in accord with all the commandments and legal requirements of Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004523/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 1:5, 6</a>) We can be happy if we pursue a similar course and firmly refuse to ‘walk in the counsel of the wicked’ or to be guided by their ungodly advice.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 5.

What if we are tempted to join sinners in their unscriptural conduct? Then let us pray for God’s help to act in harmony with the apostle Paul’s words: “Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers. For what fellowship <span id="page11" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>do righteousness and lawlessness have?

Why should we be on guard respecting ridiculers?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> To please Jehovah, we surely ‘must not sit in the seat of ridiculers.’ Some ridicule godliness itself, but in these “last days,” former Christians who have become apostates often prove to be especially scornful in their ridicule. The apostle Peter warned fellow believers: “Beloved ones, . . . you know this first, that in the last days there will come ridiculers with their ridicule, proceeding according to their own desires and saying: ‘Where is this promised presence of his? Why, from the day our forefathers fell asleep in death, all things are continuing exactly as from creation’s beginning.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004523/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:1-4</a>) If we never ‘sit in the seat of ridiculers,’ we will avoid the disaster that is sure to befall them.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004523/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Proverbs 1:22-27</a>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 7.

In fact, we could then go from bad to worse. Our downward spiral might begin if we follow the counsel of the wicked. Then we might associate with them regularly. In time, we might even become faithless apostate ridiculers. Obviously, friendship with wicked ones can foster an ungodly spirit within us and can destroy our relationship with Jehovah God.

But his delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night. And he will certainly become like a tree planted by streams of water, that gives its own fruit in its season and the foliage of which does not wither, and everything he does will succeed.”</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Notice first of all that your associations play a big part. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999644/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Proverbs 13:20</a> says: “He that is walking with wise persons will become wise, but he that is having dealings with the stupid ones will fare badly.” This does not mean being cold, unfriendly, or rude to youths who are not Jehovah’s Witnesses. The Bible urges us to love our neighbors and to “be peaceable with all men.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999644/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Romans 12:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999644/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Matthew 22:39</a>) However, you may find yourself ‘walking in the counsel’ of those who do not follow Bible standards if you associate too closely with them.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/5/0">1/1/1979, p. 28</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>To Be Happy, Watch Your Associations</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Truly, then, if you desire genuine happiness and security, you have to avoid associating with persons who have no love for what is right. This point is forcefully made in the Bible. In the book of Psalms, for example, we read: “Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked ones, and in the way of sinners has not stood, and in the seat of ridiculers has not sat.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979008/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Happiness simply cannot be obtained by those who ignore God’s ways. As a loving Father, the Most High has given only such laws as promote the welfare of his intelligent creatures. Hence, the happy person is the one who refuses to adopt the advice or “counsel” of the ungodly as a guide for living. Since he firmly rejects their thinking, he is certainly not going to be ‘standing in the way of sinners.’ This means that he is not going to be found where they are; he does not want their companionship. Therefore, he does not step down to the level of being in their circle, sitting with them and ridiculing godliness.</p>

Do we want to be happy? We can be. How? There are twenty-four happinesses or beatitudes in the Psalms that tell us the secret of how to be happy with the happiness that will never end. It is instructive for us to hear some of these beatitudes! The very book of Psalms opens with a beatitude, “Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked ones, and in the way of sinners has not stood and in the seat of ridiculers has not sat. But his delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1, 2</a>) The beatitude in the Second Psalm is one that not only world rulers but all of us under the shadow of Armageddon ought to heed: “Serve Jehovah with fear and be joyful with trembling.

<strong>The Living Word</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> God’s words are powerful, living and effective: first, because they are from the Creator of the universe, Jehovah God Almighty, and are backed up by his power and almightiness and they are right; second, if received into good and honest hearts and minds they guide the servant of God in a proper course of action, which will result in lasting life to him and to the exultation of the God whose commandments are obeyed and thereby justified. The fact cannot be overemphasized that words symbolize ideas. God’s ideas must get into your <span id="page660" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="660" data-before-text="660"></span>mind, and in order for them to be powerful they must have an effect upon your thinking and your course of life. Therein is their power; but simply having a book called the Bible in the possession of individuals or of nations without applying the things that God has caused to be set out in that book is of no benefit to the possessors. The result of following God’s Word is the worship of Jehovah and hence life for his worshipers. Simple faith in the Scriptures, based on an understanding and appreciation of them and on love for God and uprightness, is the great requirement filled by the Word of God.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">14. In your own words state the contrasts set out in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953805/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalm 1:1-6</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> This is a contrast in two general courses of action and thought, set out in the very first Psalm in words as follows: “Blessed [happy] is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of scoffers.” This means that regardless of the extent to which wicked advice, sinful practices and scorn of God and his Word come to the attention of the man blessed by Jehovah, he will put these things aside. “But his delight is in the law of Jehovah; and on his law doth he meditate day and night.” In language symbolic, but which certainly conveys the proper thought, the end of such one is shown to be this: “And he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water, that bringeth forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also doth not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.” Wicked counselors, including the religionists that persistently advise you to disregard the study of God’s Word with Jehovah’s witnesses, are not fruitful trees that prosper. No, “the wicked are not so, but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. For Jehovah knoweth the way of the righteous; but the way of the wicked shall perish.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953805/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1-6</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>POWER</strong></p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">15.

As far as the individual is concerned, that depends measurably on whether or not he gets the sense of it. This is shown many times by Jesus, who, on one occasion, referred to “the one hearing the word and getting the sense of it, who really does bear fruit and produces, this one a hundredfold, that one sixty, the other thirty.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953805/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 13:23</a>, <em>NW</em>) What does it mean to get the sense of the Word of God? Jesus in a corresponding account makes it plain: “These are the ones that, after hearing the word with a right and good heart, retain it and bear fruit with endurance.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953805/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 8:15</a>, <em>NW</em>) To get the sense of God’s Word means to hear it with real perception and appreciation, to appreciate its signification, the purport, drift, the meaning that is rational, intelligible and in accord with all the rest of God’s Word and with Jehovah’s righteousness. It takes a right and good heart to do that, and such heart will retain the word. The power of God’s living Word is manifested as being in the heart of such a person by the fact that he bears fruit and has endurance through his service to Jehovah’s praise. “On this account take up the complete suit of armor from God, that you may be able to resist in the wicked day and, after you have done all things thoroughly, to stand firm.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953805/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Eph. 6:13</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">16.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953805/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Eph. <span id="page661" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="661" data-before-text="661"></span>6:17</a>, <em>NW</em>) The apostle Paul stated the same truth in this way: “The night is well along; the day has drawn near. Let us therefore put off the works belonging to darkness and let us put on the weapons of the light.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953805/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Rom. 13:12</a>, <em>NW</em>) Undoubtedly it was from the Hebrew prophets of God that the writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures drew for this representation of God’s Word as vital fighting equipment, because in Isaiah they read: “And he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a mantle.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953805/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isa. 59:17</a>, <em>AS</em>) The prophet also stated: “And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me: and he hath made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he kept me close.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953805/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Isa. 49:2</a>, <em>AS</em>) The mental and, therefore, vital protection of the truth is further shown in its renovating process as applied to the Christian’s mental disposition: “And quit being fashioned after this system of things, but be transformed by making your mind over, that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and complete will of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953805/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Rom. 12:2</a>, <em>NW</em>) This is a tremendous power exerted by Jehovah’s Word in the lives of his people.</p>

To make it seem less challenging, you might have broken it up into smaller, easier tasks. The same is true when it comes to reading the Bible.

What will help you to benefit from reading the Bible?</strong></h3><p id="p7" data-pid="7">To benefit the most from reading the Bible, we need to pause and think about what we are reading.

How can I apply this in my life? How can I use these verses to help others?’</p><h3 class="du-color--gold-700 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>3.

Some people make time to read the Bible early in the morning. Others choose a time later in the day, perhaps during their lunch break. Still others read the Bible in the evening before going to bed.

<strong>A Tree “the Foliage of Which Does Not Wither”</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Then we should delight in the law of Jehovah. When we delight in something or some activity, we look for every opportunity to engage in it, do we not? So to delight in God’s law means having a deep appreciation for God’s Word, a desire to learn more about it and to understand it better.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Finally, we need to read it “in an undertone day and night.” That means reading the Bible on a regular basis and meditating on what we read. We should feel about God’s Word the same way as did the psalmist who sang: “How I do love your law! All day long it is my concern.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009168/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 119:97</a>.</p>

<strong>How You Can Be Successful</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>Applying God’s Counsel Results in Success</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">How can you counteract the negative propaganda so prevalent in this world? The psalmist tells us that the successful and happy person is the one whose “delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007001/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 1:2</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">When God appointed Joshua as leader of the nation of Israel, he was told: “You must in an undertone read in [God’s Word] day and night.” Yes, reading and meditating on God’s Word was essential, but Joshua also needed to “take care to do according to all <span id="page6" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>that [was] written in it.” Of course, Bible reading in itself will not magically make you successful. You must apply what you read. Joshua was told: “Then you will make your way successful and then you will act wisely.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007001/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Joshua 1:8</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Picture a smiling child sitting on the lap of a loving parent as together they read a favorite story. No matter how many times they have read it before, they treasure such precious moments. Likewise, a person who loves God finds daily Bible reading to be a delightful experience​—an agreeable time spent with his heavenly Father. By following Jehovah’s counsel and guidance, such a person becomes “like a tree planted by streams of water, that gives its own fruit in its season and the foliage of which does not wither, and everything he does will succeed.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007001/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 1:3</a>.</p>

<strong>They Knew God’s Name</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Of course, the most high God requires more than our acknowledgment that his name is Jehovah (Iehovah). In the Bay Psalm Book, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992686/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 1:1, 2</a> says that a “blessed man” does not walk in the advice of the wicked, “but in the law of Iehovah, is his longing delight.” The revised New England Psalms of 1648 says: “But he upon Jehovah’s law doth set his whole delight.”</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Here the 20th-century <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</em> reads: “Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked ones, and in the way of sinners has not stood, and in the seat of ridiculers has not sat. But his delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">To be truly happy, a person must reject the counsel of wicked ones. He must not follow the example of sinners and cannot join in company with godless ridiculers. Among other things, he needs to avoid the association of those whose advice and conduct could lure him into sexual immorality, drug abuse, and other activities contrary to God’s law. Yes, genuine happiness depends on learning about the true God, whose name is Jehovah, and applying his law as revealed in the Bible.</p>

<strong>To Be Happy, Watch Your Associations</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Of course, the happiness of the righteous man is not to be found just in a life of negatives. No, he finds real pleasure in upbuilding things, filling his mind and heart with what is wholesome. The first psalm continues: “His delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979008/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 1:2</a>) The real pleasure of the righteous person results from his fulfilling a genuine desire to know the law of Jehovah and in applying it. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979008/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">James 1:25</a>.) Not a day passes without his giving consideration to spiritual matters.</p>

The psalmist says, concerning a really happy man, that “his delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.” The results? “Everything he does will succeed.” However, “the wicked are not like that”!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973242/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1-4</a>.</p>

<strong>Pursuing Peace Through Increased Knowledge</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> To have this kind of knowledge, one must study. Getting knowledge should not be viewed as a dreary task, delving into dry facts and volumes of reading. Rather, it is a spiritual meal we look forward to. We are eager to pursue after these treasures of Jehovah. Material food is enjoyed <span id="page523" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="523" data-before-text="523"></span>to the full if by preparing it carefully every accent of flavor is brought out. Time is involved in the preparation and eating of it if it is to be appreciated and meet up with our expectations. So it is with spiritual food. We must search and dig if we want the rewards that <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962642/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:4-6</a> promised: “If you keep seeking for it as for silver, and as for hid treasures you keep searching for it, in that case you will understand the fear of Jehovah, and you will find the very knowledge of God. For Jehovah himself gives wisdom; out of his mouth there are knowledge and discernment.”</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>URGENT NEED OF KNOWLEDGE</strong></p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">16. (a) What reasons are there to impel us to study regularly?

We live at the time when it is possible to see the end of this wicked world. Pressure is increasing; “the days are wicked.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962642/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Eph. 5:16</a>) We need knowledge. Professed servants of God have been destroyed because they lacked knowledge. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962642/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Hos. 4:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962642/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 9</a>) We cannot fool the God of wisdom. He is the Maker of requirements for life in his future paradise world. Then we should not deceive ourselves into thinking that increased knowledge is only for a chosen few. Physical food and drink are absolutely essential for everyone to stay alive; there is no substitute that will keep the body alive. Neither can we find an alternative for study to gain knowledge. There is no question about it, “this means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962642/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) Yet another reason that urges us to get knowledge is that our “delight is in the law of Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962642/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ps. 1:2</a>) If this is our attitude we will be very useful to Jehovah God in assisting many others to growth in his organization and in making known the way of peace to our neighbors. Often we have to urge persons to eat material food. “My son, eat honey, for it is good; and let sweet comb honey be upon your palate. In the same way, do know wisdom for your soul. If you have found it, then there exists a future, and your own hope will not be cut off.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962642/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Prov. 24:13, 14</a>.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">17-19.

When is the best time, how much time can I devote to study, and what time-improving method will bring me the greatest rewards of knowledge? Think of the time spent in study as being an investment that will bring you returns in abundance. Will you be careful and prudent about your time and yet not stingy so that you end up like the rich who die of malnutrition? Paul gives good advice at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962642/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:15, 16</a>: “So keep strict watch that how you walk is not as unwise but as wise persons, buying out the opportune time for yourselves, because the days are wicked.”</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> The time set aside needs to be sufficient to allow you to prepare for your Bible studies with your congregation every week. You want to read good upbuilding articles like those that appear in the <em>Watchtower</em> and <em>Awake!</em> magazines. Your desire for knowledge will lead you into study of Bible doctrines and questions that others ask you. All of this study requires time.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> There are many persons who attend meetings three evenings a week with their congregation and conduct a Bible study with a newly interested person on another evening and still they have three evenings to invest in study or other pursuits. But why not spend one of them with your family in a study of God’s Word?</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">20. If we cancel or postpone study periods, what should guide us in making such a decision?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> To accomplish something, these study <span id="page524" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="524" data-before-text="524"></span>arrangements have to be regular, established periods that are not postponed for everything else.

Do we want to be happy? We can be. How? There are twenty-four happinesses or beatitudes in the Psalms that tell us the secret of how to be happy with the happiness that will never end. It is instructive for us to hear some of these beatitudes! The very book of Psalms opens with a beatitude, “Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked ones, and in the way of sinners has not stood and in the seat of ridiculers has not sat. But his delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1, 2</a>) The beatitude in the Second Psalm is one that not only world rulers but all of us under the shadow of Armageddon ought to heed: “Serve Jehovah with fear and be joyful with trembling. Kiss the son, that He may not become incensed and you may not perish [from] the way, for his anger flares up easily. Happy are all those taking refuge in him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Ps. 2:11, 12</a>.</p><p id="p98" data-pid="98" class="qu">38.

Jehovah himself will guard him and preserve him alive. He will be pronounced happy in the earth, and you cannot possibly give him over to the soulful desire of his enemies.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Ps. 41:1, 2</a>, <em>margin</em>) Correction from Jehovah is meant to result in our happiness: “Happy is the able-bodied man whom you correct, O Jah, and whom you teach out of your own law, to give him quietness from days of calamity, until for the wicked one a pit is excavated.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/60/0" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Ps. 94:12, 13</a>) Obedience to God’s command results in unusual happiness: “Happy is the man in fear of Jehovah, in whose commandments he has taken very much delight.” “Happy are the ones faultless in [their] way, the ones walking in the law of Jehovah.

As we approach the day of days when Jehovah will make wars to cease to the extremity of the earth, breaking the enemy armaments to pieces and setting astonishing events in the earth, we need to keep united as his people and to meet together as often as can be arranged. “Look! how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Ps. 133:1</a>) To promote that goodness and pleasantness of unitedly dwelling together we should take hold of the opportunity and build one another up as fellow believers <span id="page637" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="637" data-before-text="637"></span>and fellow servants. We meet, not only to praise the universal Sovereign and his kingdom, but to help one another to praise him before people on the outside who need salvation. Our determination should be: “As for me, in my integrity I shall walk. O redeem me and show me favor.

<strong>Will You Get to Live on Earth Forever?</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[27]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> How can you keep from being vomited out of the land then? By separating from “those ruining the earth.” Fit into God’s purpose for the cleansed earth by reflecting God’s praise along with the earth. Start doing that now. Do it, not in the way that you think is right, but in the way that God says is right. Learn his way by studying his Word. It is by such study of <span id="page468" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="468" data-before-text="468"></span>the Bible that you will “quit being fashioned after this system of things, but be transformed by making your mind over, that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and complete will of God.” By this study “you should put away the old personality which conforms to your former course of conduct” and “you should be made new in the force actuating your mind, and should put on the new personality which was created according to God’s will in true righteousness and loving-kindness.” Then you will live “no more for the desires of men, but for God’s will. For the time that has passed by is sufficient for you to have worked out the will of the nations when you proceeded in deeds of loose conduct, lusts, excesses with wine, revelries, drinking matches, and idolatries that are without legal restraint. Because you do not continue running with them in this course to the same low sink of debauchery, they are puzzled and go on speaking abusively of you. But these people will render an account to the one ready to judge those living and those dead.” However, your study and changed way of thinking and acting will deliver you from Jehovah’s destructive judgments at Armageddon.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rom. 12:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Eph. 4:22-24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 1 Pet. 4:2-5</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="qu"> 5. What aspect of study is now neglected, but what does the Bible say about it?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[28]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> One aspect of study that is woefully neglected today is meditation. The Bible frequently counsels us to do it. Joshua was told to take the book of the law and “meditate therein day and night,” or, more accurately expressed, “in an undertone read in it day and night.” This reading in an undertone is like talking to yourself, an audible musing, and since it is slower than reading to yourself it keeps the idea on the mind longer to soak in and be absorbed more. Moreover, it enters the mind in two ways, through both the eye and the ear, which impresses it on the mind with greater force. It is said of the happy man: “In the law of Jehovah is his delight, and in his law doth he talk with himself [soliloquise, <em>margin</em>] day and night. So doth he become like a tree planted beside channels of waters, that yieldeth its fruit in its season.” Taking in Jehovah’s waters of truth will enable us to bring forth Christian fruitage. We should copy this psalmist’s example: “I commune with my heart in the night; I meditate and search my spirit.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Josh. 1:8</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 1:2, 3</a>, <em>RoPss;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps 77:6</a>, <em>RS</em>.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="qu"> 6. What shows that Jesus valued meditation, and found it difficult to do it at times?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Before talking to others it is best to talk to ourselves, to soliloquize. This will impress the truths on our own mind for the guidance of our tongue. Such meditation and self-preparation was done by Christ Jesus, the Greater David: “Of the glorious splendor of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works, I will meditate,” or, “soliloquise.” During Jesus’ forty-day fast and isolation in the wilderness after his baptism he meditated, trying to take in the full meaning of the things that the opened heavens had bared to his view. This meditation fortified him for what was ahead. The Bible shows that from time to time Jesus sought solitude for meditation and prayer: “He went up into the mountain by himself,” and, “He continued in retirement in the deserts and praying.” But it was difficult for Jesus to get the solitude he needed for meditation and prayer: “He went out and proceeded to a lonely place. But the crowds began hunting about for him and came out as far as he was,” and, “Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he rose up and went outside and left for a lonely place,” but “those with him hunted him down and found him.” To avoid city crowds “he continued outside in lonely places.

To make it seem less challenging, you might have broken it up into smaller, easier tasks. The same is true when it comes to reading the Bible. You may ask, ‘Where do I start?’ In this lesson, we will consider some simple things you can do that will help you enjoy reading and studying the Bible.</p><h3 class="du-color--gold-700 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>1. Why should we read the Bible regularly?</strong></h3><p id="p5" data-pid="5">A person who regularly reads the Bible, or <strong>“the law of Jehovah,”</strong> will be both happy and successful. (Read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021211/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 1:1-3</a>.) To start with, try reading for just a few minutes each day. The more you get familiar with God’s Word, the more you will enjoy your Bible reading.</p><h3 class="du-color--gold-700 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>2. What will help you to benefit from reading the Bible?</strong></h3><p id="p7" data-pid="7">To benefit the most from reading the Bible, we need to pause and think about what we are reading. We should both read it and <strong>“meditate on it.”</strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021211/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joshua 1:8</a>, footnote) As you read, ask yourself questions such as: ‘What does this tell me about Jehovah God? How can I apply this in my life? How can I use these verses to help others?’</p><h3 class="du-color--gold-700 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>3. How can you make time to read the Bible?</strong></h3><p id="p9" data-pid="9">Do you struggle to find time for Bible reading? Many of us do. Try to make <strong>“the best use of your time.”</strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021211/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:16</a>) You can do this by setting aside a specific time to read the Bible each day. Some people make time to read the Bible early in the morning. Others choose a time later in the day, perhaps during their lunch break. Still others read the Bible in the evening before going to bed. What would be the best time for you?</p><h2 class="du-color--coolGray-400 du-fontSize--basePlus1 du-letterSpacing--8 du-constrainStylesToTextWidth du-borderStyle-top--solid du-borderColor-top--coolGray-400 du-borderWidth-top--4 du-margin-top--12 du-padding-top--4" id="p10" data-pid="10"><span id="page46" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="46" data-before-text="46"></span><strong>DIG DEEPER</strong></h2><p id="p11" data-pid="11">Learn how to make your Bible reading more interesting.

<strong>Baptism—Only a Beginning</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Of first importance is the way you go about your <em>personal study</em> of the Bible, and your learning how to make a practical application of it in your daily life. Jesus always delighted to do God’s will, because he could say: “Your law is within my inward parts.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976607/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 40:8</a>) He had studied and could apply the Word of God. The same can be true of you, as mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976607/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 1:1-3</a>: “Happy is the man . . . [whose] delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.” Then it tells how that man will be like a tree that is ever fruitful and ever green, “and everything he does will succeed.” This means much more than a mere surface reading of the Bible. It calls for a continual combing over of all that is in God’s Word, as well as the spiritual food and counsel given by the “faithful and discreet slave,” and then seeing what bearing this has on every aspect of your life.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976607/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45-47</a>.</p>

<strong>How Can You Adjust to Your New Congregation?</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Think of this example: When trees are relocated, they experience stress. As a tree is removed from the ground, most of its roots are usually cut off to make it easier to transport. Once transplanted, the tree must immediately start growing new roots. Similarly, moving to another congregation may have caused you to experience stress. In your previous congregation, you had grown “roots” as you developed cherished friendships and settled into a familiar spiritual routine. Now you must grow new roots in order to flourish in a new environment. What will help you to do so? Applying Scriptural principles. Let us consider some.</p><blockquote><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><em>The person who regularly reads God’s Word is “like a tree planted by streams of water, a tree that produces fruit in its season, the foliage of which does not wither. And everything he does will succeed.”</em>​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017648/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1-3</a>.</p></blockquote><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Just as a tree must regularly draw from a water source to remain healthy, a Christian must regularly feed on God’s Word to remain spiritually strong. Therefore, continue to read the Bible daily and to attend congregation meetings regularly. Maintain your good habits of family worship and personal study. Whatever you needed spiritually in your previous location, you will need in your new one too.</p>

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page16" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span><strong>A Tree “the Foliage of Which Does Not Wither”</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">HAVE you ever seen a countryside covered with luxuriant green trees? You will likely agree that it is a most pleasing sight. If you see many large, leafy trees, would you imagine that there is a drought in the area? On the contrary, you would know that there must be an abundance of water that keeps the trees alive and healthy.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Appropriately, the Bible compares those who are spiritually healthy to large, luxuriant trees. Note, for example, this beautiful passage from the first three verses of the first Psalm:</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked ones, and in the way of sinners has not stood, and in the seat of ridiculers has not sat. But his delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night. And he will certainly become like a tree planted by streams of water, that gives its own fruit in its season and the foliage of which does not wither, and everything he does will succeed.”</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Similarly, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009168/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jeremiah 17:7, 8</a>, we read: “Blessed is the able-bodied man who puts his trust in Jehovah, and whose confidence Jehovah has become. And he will certainly become like a tree planted by the waters, that sends out its roots right by the watercourse; and he will not see when heat comes, but his foliage will actually prove to be luxuriant. And in the year of drought he will not become anxious, nor will he leave off from producing fruit.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In both passages, trees are used as an illustration to show what becomes of a person who does what is right, delights in God’s laws, and trusts in him fully. This leads us to ask, In what ways is such a person like a luxuriant tree, spiritually speaking? Let us examine these verses more closely.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>“Planted by Streams of Water”</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The trees spoken of are described as planted “by streams of water” or “by the waters,” not by just one river or stream. A similar word picture is found at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009168/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 44:3, 4</a>, where Jehovah God spoke of the way he would care for repentant Jews who returned from captivity in Babylon. Through the prophet Isaiah, Jehovah said: “I shall pour out water upon the thirsty one, and trickling streams upon the dry place. . . . And they will certainly spring up as among the green grass, like poplars by the water ditches.” Here “streams” and “water ditches” are said to make the blessed ones grow like leafy poplars.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Even today in agricultural areas, you can see water ditches and streams flowing from a large source of water, such as a deep well, a river, a lake, or a dam. Generally, they are part of an irrigation system for fields or <span id="page17" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>plantations. At times the channels of water are directed to an orchard of fruit trees. In some cases, the streams irrigate fields on one side and a row of leafy trees on the other, perhaps marking the border of the property.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">How do trees planted by such streams fare? <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009168/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 1:3</a> speaks of a tree “that gives its own fruit in its season.” In the Bible lands, there are fig, pomegranate, and apple trees, as well as date palms and olive trees. Though the fig tree can reach a height of 30 feet <strong>[9 m]</strong> with widespread branches, most other fruit trees do not grow very tall. Yet, they can be luxuriant and healthy and give an abundance of fruit at the proper time.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">In ancient times, large poplar trees grew along the banks of rivers and streams in Syria and Palestine. References to poplars in the Bible are usually associated with watercourses or ‘torrent valleys.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009168/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Leviticus 23:40</a>) Willows, which are of the same family as poplars, could also be found growing where water was abundant. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009168/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezekiel 17:5</a>) These large, luxuriant trees well represent the idea that both the psalmist and Jeremiah wanted to impart: Those who seek to follow God’s law and trust in him fully will stay spiritually healthy, ‘and all that they do will succeed.’ Is that not what we want​—success in life?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>Finding Delight in Jehovah’s Law</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Today people try to find success in many ways. They immerse themselves in pursuits that could bring them fame and fortune, which all too often prove to be illusive and disappointing. What, though, can bring true satisfaction and lasting happiness in life? Jesus’ words in the Sermon on the Mount provide the answer. He said: “Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need, since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009168/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 5:3</a>) Indeed, true happiness comes, not from possessing many material things, but from recognizing and satisfying our spiritual need so that we are spiritually healthy, like luxuriant trees that give their fruit in due season. How can we flourish spiritually?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">According to the psalmist, first there are some things we must shun. He mentioned “the counsel of the wicked ones,” “the way of sinners,” and “the seat of ridiculers.” To be happy, we need to turn away from those who ridicule or even ignore God’s laws.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Then we should delight in the law of Jehovah. When we delight in something or some activity, we look for every opportunity to engage in it, do we not? So to delight in God’s law means having a deep appreciation for God’s Word, a desire to learn more about it and to understand it better.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Finally, we need to read it “in an undertone day and night.” That means reading the Bible on a regular basis and meditating on what we read. We should feel about God’s Word the same way as did the psalmist who sang: “How I do love your law! All day long it is my concern.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009168/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 119:97</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Yes, when we acquire accurate knowledge and understanding of Jehovah God and develop full confidence in him and his promises, we will surely be spiritually healthy. In that case, we will be like the happy man described by the psalmist​—“everything he does will succeed.”</p>

By following Jehovah’s counsel and guidance, such a person becomes “like a tree planted by streams of water, that gives its own fruit in its season and the foliage of which does not wither, and everything he does will succeed.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007001/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 1:3</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The tree that is described by the psalmist does not spring up by accident.

And he will certainly become like a tree planted by streams of water, that gives its own fruit in its season and the foliage of which does not wither, and everything he does will succeed.” Do you see the point of that passage? It is easy to read those words and conclude that they merely paint a pretty picture of a peaceful setting​—a shade tree growing by a river. How pleasant it would be to take an afternoon nap in such a spot! But this psalm is not inviting us to think about rest. It is painting quite a different picture, one that suggests hard work. How so?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Notice that the tree here is not merely a shade tree growing by chance next to a river.

Ah, now the point comes into <span id="page21" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>focus! If in a spiritual sense we flourish like that tree, it is because much work has been done in our behalf. We are associated with an organization that brings the pure waters of truth right to us, but we must do our part. We need to put ourselves in a position to soak up this precious water, engaging in the meditation and research needed in order to bring the truths of God’s Word into our mind and heart. In that way, we too will produce good fruitage.</p>

For instance, some olive trees in the Mediterranean region are said to be from one to two thousand years old. Likewise, the baobab trees of central Africa attain great ages, and a bristlecone pine in California is believed to be some 4,600 years old. In a forest, mature trees are often beneficial to their surroundings. For example, tall trees provide protective shade for saplings, and the leaves that fall from the trees enrich the soil beneath.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The tallest trees in the world are usually found growing together in forests, where individual trees support one another. Since their roots may be intertwined, several trees collectively may resist a storm much better than can an isolated tree standing in a meadow. A large root system also enables a tree to obtain sufficient water and nutrients from the soil. In some cases, the roots may penetrate deeper into the ground than the height of the tree, or the roots may extend horizontally well beyond the spread of the tree’s foliage.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The apostle Paul may have alluded to a tree when he explained that Christians should “go on walking in union with him [Christ], rooted and being built up in him and being stabilized in the faith.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004164/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Colossians 2:6, 7</a>) Indeed, Christians can stand their ground only if they are firmly rooted in Christ.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004164/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:21</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In what other ways may God’s servants be likened to trees?

Those who meditate on Jehovah’s law day and night are like trees planted by an unfailing source of water.

Indeed, they are in a spiritual paradise, are refreshed spiritually, and are bearing spiritual fruitage to Jehovah’s praise. And just think! God is using his Witnesses to direct people away from the arid, parched, worldly organizations to this refreshing, well-watered spiritual paradise.</p>

<strong>The Sustaining Power of God’s Word</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A CUT flower can last only a few days before it withers and dies. But a tree planted in a well-watered area can grow large and strong and may live for hundreds or even thousands of years. Interestingly, the Bible likens the person whose “delight is in the law of Jehovah” to “a tree planted by streams of water, that gives its own fruit in its season and the foliage of which does not wither.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980563/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A tree having a good water supply is able to grow strong and maintain its fruitfulness. Similarly, a person who regularly drinks of the precious life-sustaining truth of God’s Word through serious study and meditation is able to grow strong spiritually and continue to bear fruitage.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Just as water is essential to sustaining both plant and animal life, so truth contained in God’s Word is vital to maintaining spiritual life. Today Jehovah’s servants are in a life-or-death struggle. As the apostle Paul pointedly said: “We have a wrestling, not against blood and flesh, but against . . . the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980563/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eph. 6:12</a>) Hence, Christians must wage spiritual warfare against powerful, superhuman creatures. In efforts to destroy the relationship that Jehovah’s servants have with God, these wicked spirits resort to violent frontal attacks like persecution and subtle pressures, such as temptations involving immorality and materialism.</p>

<strong>To Be Happy, Watch Your Associations</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Like all other humans, righteous persons experience trials, but they are able to endure these successfully just as a sound tree withstands comparatively strong winds. The psalmist appropriately compared the godly man to a strong tree in a well-watered location, saying: “He will certainly become like a tree planted by streams of water, that gives its own fruit in its season and the foliage of which does not wither, and everything he does will succeed.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979008/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 1:3</a>) A tree planted by an unfailing source of water will not dry up during a time of drought or in the summer heat, but it will bear fruit. Likewise, the strength of righteous persons comes from an unfailing source, namely, Jehovah God. With the help of God’s spirit, they are able to bear up under the pressure of trials and difficulties. In the end, they succeed in everything, because their main objective is to remain approved servants of the Almighty. The heat of opposition does not move them away from their resolve. They come off victorious as persons approved by Jehovah God.</p>

<strong>The Living Word</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> God’s words are powerful, living and effective: first, because they are from the Creator of the universe, Jehovah God Almighty, and are backed up by his power and almightiness and they are right; second, if received into good and honest hearts and minds they guide the servant of God in a proper course of action, which will result in lasting life to him and to the exultation of the God whose commandments are obeyed and thereby justified. The fact cannot be overemphasized that words symbolize ideas. God’s ideas must get into your <span id="page660" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="660" data-before-text="660"></span>mind, and in order for them to be powerful they must have an effect upon your thinking and your course of life. Therein is their power; but simply having a book called the Bible in the possession of individuals or of nations without applying the things that God has caused to be set out in that book is of no benefit to the possessors. The result of following God’s Word is the worship of Jehovah and hence life for his worshipers. Simple faith in the Scriptures, based on an understanding and appreciation of them and on love for God and uprightness, is the great requirement filled by the Word of God.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">14. In your own words state the contrasts set out in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953805/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalm 1:1-6</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> This is a contrast in two general courses of action and thought, set out in the very first Psalm in words as follows: “Blessed [happy] is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of scoffers.” This means that regardless of the extent to which wicked advice, sinful practices and scorn of God and his Word come to the attention of the man blessed by Jehovah, he will put these things aside. “But his delight is in the law of Jehovah; and on his law doth he meditate day and night.” In language symbolic, but which certainly conveys the proper thought, the end of such one is shown to be this: “And he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water, that bringeth forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also doth not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.” Wicked counselors, including the religionists that persistently advise you to disregard the study of God’s Word with Jehovah’s witnesses, are not fruitful trees that prosper. No, “the wicked are not so, but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. For Jehovah knoweth the way of the righteous; but the way of the wicked shall perish.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953805/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1-6</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>POWER</strong></p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">15.

As far as the individual is concerned, that depends measurably on whether or not he gets the sense of it. This is shown many times by Jesus, who, on one occasion, referred to “the one hearing the word and getting the sense of it, who really does bear fruit and produces, this one a hundredfold, that one sixty, the other thirty.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953805/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 13:23</a>, <em>NW</em>) What does it mean to get the sense of the Word of God? Jesus in a corresponding account makes it plain: “These are the ones that, after hearing the word with a right and good heart, retain it and bear fruit with endurance.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953805/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 8:15</a>, <em>NW</em>) To get the sense of God’s Word means to hear it with real perception and appreciation, to appreciate its signification, the purport, drift, the meaning that is rational, intelligible and in accord with all the rest of God’s Word and with Jehovah’s righteousness. It takes a right and good heart to do that, and such heart will retain the word. The power of God’s living Word is manifested as being in the heart of such a person by the fact that he bears fruit and has endurance through his service to Jehovah’s praise. “On this account take up the complete suit of armor from God, that you may be able to resist in the wicked day and, after you have done all things thoroughly, to stand firm.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953805/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Eph. 6:13</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">16.

Wicked ones may appear to prosper materially for a time, but they are not prospering spiritually. This is evident from the psalmist’s further words: “The wicked are not like that, but are like the chaff that the wind drives away. That is why the wicked ones will not stand up in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of righteous ones.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004523/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Psalm 1:4, 5</a>) Note that the psalmist says, “the wicked are not like that.” He means that they are not like godly people, who have just been compared to fruitful, long-lasting trees.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Even if wicked ones prosper materially, they have no lasting security. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004523/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Psalm 37:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004523/36/1" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 73:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004523/36/2" data-bid="37-3" class="b"> 12</a>) They are like the unreasonable rich man Jesus mentioned in an illustration when asked to arbitrate in a matter involving an inheritance. Jesus told those present: “Keep your eyes open and guard against every sort of covetousness, because even when a person has an abundance his life does not result from the things he possesses.” Jesus illustrated this point by saying that the land of a certain rich man produced so well that he planned to tear down his storehouses and build bigger ones to hold all his good things. The man then planned to eat, drink, and enjoy himself. But God said: “Unreasonable one, this night they are <span id="page14" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>demanding your soul from you. Who, then, is to have the things you stored up?” Making his powerful point, Jesus added: “So it goes with the man that lays up treasure for himself but is not rich toward God.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004523/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Luke 12:13-21</a>.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">19, 20. (a) Describe the ancient threshing and winnowing process.

After grain was harvested in ancient times, it was taken to a threshing floor, a flat area generally on high ground. There sledges with sharp stone or iron teeth on their underside were pulled over the grain by animals to break the stalks into pieces and loosen the kernels from the chaff. Next, a winnowing shovel was used to pick up the whole mixture and toss it into the air against the wind. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004523/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Isaiah 30:24</a>) The kernels fell back onto the threshing floor, while the breeze carried the straw off to the side and blew the chaff away. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004523/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Ruth 3:2</a>) After the grain was passed through a sieve to remove pebbles and the like, it was ready for storage or grinding. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004523/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Luke 22:31</a>) But the chaff was gone.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> Just as the kernels of grain dropped to the ground and were preserved while the chaff was blown away, so the righteous will remain and the wicked will be removed. Surely, though, we are happy that such evildoers will soon be gone forever. With them out of the way, people who take delight in Jehovah’s law will be greatly blessed. Indeed, obedient humans will eventually receive God’s gift of everlasting life.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004523/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Matthew 25:34-46;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004523/41/1" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> Romans 6:23</a>.</p>

<strong>Great Crowd</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">This poses the question: If the “great crowd” are persons who gain salvation and remain on earth, how could they be said to be ‘standing before God’s throne and before the Lamb’? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001762/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Re 7:9</a>) The position of ‘standing’ is sometimes used in the Bible to indicate the holding of a favored or approved position in the eyes of the one in whose presence the individual or group stands. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001762/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps 1:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001762/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 5:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001762/23/2" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> Pr 22:29</a>, <em>AT;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001762/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Lu 1:19</a>) In fact, in the previous chapter of Revelation, “the kings of the earth and the top-ranking ones and the military commanders and the rich and the strong ones and every slave and every free person” are depicted as seeking to hide themselves “from the face of the One seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb, because the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001762/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Re 6:15-17</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001762/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Lu 21:36</a>.) It thus appears that the “great crowd” is formed of those persons who have been preserved during that time of wrath and who have been able to “stand” as approved by God and the Lamb.</p>

<strong>Help for Bearing Up Under Suffering</strong><br/><p id="p71" data-pid="71" data-rel-pid="[127]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="52"><sup>52</sup></span> Since Jehovah God allows his loyal servants to undergo severe treatment to refine them and for them to demonstrate their devotion, how could we imagine that the “ungodly man and the sinner” inside the Christian congregation or “house of God” could even “make a showing” before Him along with “the righteous man” inside the same congregation? The psalmist states: “The wicked ones will not stand up in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of righteous ones.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101979008/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Psalm 1:5</a>) No, the wicked will not stand as approved but will be condemned. They may be found in the assembly of righteous ones, but they will never make a favorable “showing” before God. Because of what all believers must face in this world, their finally being saved for everlasting life takes real effort, love and faith in the way of righteousness. Hence, their salvation is “with difficulty.” Consequently it behooves all members of the Christian congregation (“house of God”) to avoid being “ungodly” and “sinners” in this “appointed time” of judgment.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101979008/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">1 Peter 4:17, 18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101979008/52/1" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> Proverbs 11:31</a>.</p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Consider what rocks, or shakes, the nations and what this shaking leads to. The Bible says that “the nations [have] been in tumult and the national groups themselves kept muttering an empty thing.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006368/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 2:1</a>) The “empty thing” they keep “muttering,” or meditating on, is the continuation of their own sovereignty. Nothing shakes them more than any threat to their rulership.</p>

The kings of earth take their stand and high officials themselves have massed together as one against Jehovah and against his anointed one.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004524/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 2:1, 2</a>.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2004524/0">a</a></p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">5, 6. The national groups have “kept muttering” what “empty thing”?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> What “empty thing” have the present-day national groups “kept muttering”? Instead of accepting God’s Anointed One​—the Messiah, or Christ—​the nations have “kept muttering,” or meditating on, the perpetuation of their own authority. These words of the second psalm also had an application in the first century C.E. when Jewish and Roman authorities worked together to kill God’s King-Designate, Jesus Christ. However, the major fulfillment began in 1914 when Jesus was installed as heavenly King. Since then, not one political entity on earth has acknowledged God’s enthroned King.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> What was meant when the psalmist asked ‘why national groups were muttering an empty thing’? It is their purpose that is empty; it is futile and doomed to failure. They cannot bring peace and harmony to this globe. Yet, they carry their actions so far as to oppose divine rulership. In fact, they have unitedly taken a belligerent stand and <span id="page17" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>massed themselves together against the Most High and his Anointed One.

The kings of the earth took their stand and the rulers massed together as one against Jehovah and against his anointed one.’ Even so, both Herod [Antipas] and Pontius Pilate with men of nations and with peoples of Israel were in actuality gathered together in this city against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004524/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 4:24-27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004524/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Luke 23:1-12</a>)<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2004524/1">b</a> Yes, there was a conspiracy against God’s anointed servant Jesus in the first century.

But what about our time? Present-day nations do not want to comply with the requirements of Jehovah and the Messiah. Therefore, they are represented as saying: “Let us tear their bands apart and cast their cords away from us!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004524/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 2:3</a>) Any restrictions imposed by God and his Anointed One would be opposed by rulers and nations. Of course, any efforts to tear apart such bands and cast away such cords will be futile.</p>

The prophetic words of David that were included in the prayer offered by the disciples of the Messiah nineteen centuries ago in Jerusalem had only an initial or a miniature fulfillment. It had involved King Herod and Governor Pontius Pilate and the Jewish people and the Roman soldiers whom these used in nailing Jesus the Messiah to a torture stake. In our twentieth century, the world events since the outbreak of World War I in the year 1914 furnish the proof that we have reached the final and full-scale fulfillment of those words of David found in Psalm Two. Now, more than at any time in the past, the issue of divine sovereignty is up for settlement. Our personal decision on the issue will be most serious in consequences to each one of us.</p>

When Passover celebrators under the coaching of their priests clamored for the Roman Governor Pontius Pilate to have the prisoner Jesus killed on a stake, Pilate asked them to reconsider the matter by saying: “Shall I impale your king?” The issue of sovereignty was now squarely before “the peoples of Israel.” Whose sovereignty would they choose? The Bible account indicates, when it says: “The chief priests answered: ‘We have no king but Caesar.’” Caesar’s representative, Pilate, went along with their decision, for the account says: “At that time, therefore, he handed him over to them to be impaled.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975761/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">John 19:12-16</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">16.

They have stubbornly refused to yield over their sovereignty to God’s rightful Ruler for the earth, his Messiah or Christ. They have continued to carry on their power struggle for world domination, even to the extent of fighting two world wars and threatening now the whole human race with a third.

The destruction of the throne city of Jerusalem and the desolating of its territory of Judah were completed by the month of October of 607 B.C. Hence those seven times of complete heathenish, Gentile domination of the earth would end 2,520 years from that time, or by October of 1914, in our own twentieth century.

In his own prophecy concerning the end of this world system Jesus Christ foretold that after the Kingdom’s establishment Jehovah God would have his witnesses on earth who would bear testimony to all the nations concerning the established kingdom.

They had hundreds of thousands of priests and preachers who regularly led hundreds of millions of church members in praying the Lord’s prayer, saying: “Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come.” Did they truly mean that prayer? Did they really want God’s kingdom, or men’s kingdom? Were the kings of Christendom, who required their subjects to recognize their claim to rule “by divine right,” willing to recognize the only one who had the “legal right,” the divine right to rule as king over all mankind, namely, the Christ or Anointed One of the Lord God? The events of 1914 and since then have shown the true, undeniable answer. The nations of Christendom have acted just as Bible prophecy foretold. Their actions have exposed their prayers as hypocritical.</p><p id="p103" data-pid="103" class="qu">38, 39.

John says: “Loud voices occurred in heaven saying: ‘The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will rule as king for ever and ever.’ And the twenty-four persons of advanced age who were seated before God upon their thrones fell upon their faces <span id="page627" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="627" data-before-text="627"></span>and worshiped God, saying: ‘We thank you, Jehovah God, the Almighty, the one who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and begun ruling as king.

Their hostile attitude to the kingdom of the Lord God and of his Christ has not changed since. A second world war, beginning with the nations of religious Christendom, erupted in 1939. Since its close in 1945 more than eighty nations, under leadership of the nations of Christendom, have massed together in the United Nations organization, not to support the heavenly kingdom in the hands of Christ, who has the legal right to it, but to maintain world domination by earthly men.</p>

They fear it because of having already experienced two world wars. They fear it because atomic weapons will be used. They fear it because there seems no way of escaping it. But what the majority of the people do not realize is that something far more terrible than another international war is impending. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951761/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951761/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 10</a>) As General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, on September 2, 1945, the day after the surrender of the Japanese, aboard the battleship “Missouri”, warned: “Men since the beginning of time have sought peace. . . . Military alliances, balance of power, leagues of nations, all in turn failed, leaving the only path to be by way of the crucible of war. We have had our last chance. If we will not devise some greater and more equitable system, our Armageddon will be at our door.” No “more equitable system” has been devised. The nations are having their “last chance”. Armageddon is at the door!</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Now let this fact be fully appreciated by all: Armageddon will be altogether different, separate and distinct from any prospective World War III, touched off and prosecuted by mere men. Armageddon will not be a war between Eastern and Western blocs of nations. It will not be communism against capitalism. It will not be a revolt of the laboring masses against the ruling classes. No, Armageddon will be the battle of God Almighty, the great and terrible war, when Jehovah completely destroys the nations and kingdoms that oppose and fight against his glorious theocratic rule.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951761/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Zeph. 3:8</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Armageddon will not be any local war limited to the literal valley of Megiddo in Palestine. Har–Magedon, or Armageddon, means the “mountain of the assembly of troops”, and it refers in a symbolic way to the capital organization of Zion where Jehovah God has enthroned Christ Jesus as earth’s rightful ruler. That great historical event took place in the year 1914, conclusive proof concerning this having already appeared in the columns of <em>The Watchtower</em>.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951761/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 45:3-7</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">So it is against the established kingdom under Christ that the nations under the control of the Devil and his demons now gather together for an all-out final, but futile, assault. Says the psalmist: “Why do the nations rage, and the peoples meditate a vain thing [conspiring to continue their rule]? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against Jehovah, and against his anointed [King], . . . He that sitteth in the heavens will laugh: the Lord will have them in derision. Then will he speak unto them in his wrath [at Armageddon], and vex them in his sore displeasure: Yet I have set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951761/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 2:1-6</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>THE GATHERING STORM</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">They do not realize it, but the hurried efforts of the rulers since 1914 in forming <span id="page614" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="614" data-before-text="614"></span>leagues of nations, creating confederacies, drawing up hemispheric pacts and international agreements, and pooling their strength in what they call a United Nations—all of such schemes having welded the nations together into a solid bloc in opposition to Christ’s kingdom—are in direct fulfillment of divine prophecy long ago recorded. And just as surely as we have seen the nations form these confederacies, just that surely will we see them dashed to pieces at Armageddon! “Associate yourselves, O ye people,” the prophet declared, “and ye shall be broken in pieces.” “Gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces.” “Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951761/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 8:9, 10</a>.</p>

Five days later they plainly declared publicly whose sovereignty they chose. When Passover celebrators under the coaching of their priests clamored for the Roman Governor Pontius Pilate to have the prisoner Jesus killed on a stake, Pilate asked them to reconsider the matter by saying: “Shall I impale your king?” The issue of sovereignty was now squarely before “the peoples of Israel.” Whose sovereignty would they choose? The Bible account indicates, when it says: “The chief priests answered: ‘We have no king but Caesar.’” Caesar’s representative, Pilate, went along with their decision, for the account says: “At that time, therefore, he handed him over to them to be impaled.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101975051/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">John 19:12-16</a>.</p><p id="p98" data-pid="98" class="qu">38.

<strong>One World, One Government, Under God’s Sovereignty</strong><br/><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> Today we have reached the climax in this divinely guided course of events that leads to “one world” under “one government” over which God is the Universal Sovereign. The prophetic words of David that were included in the prayer offered by the disciples of the Messiah nineteen centuries ago in Jerusalem had only an initial or a miniature fulfillment. It had involved King Herod and Governor Pontius Pilate and the Jewish people and the Roman soldiers whom these used in nailing Jesus the Messiah to a torture stake. In our twentieth century, the world events since the outbreak of World War I in the year 1914 furnish the proof that we have reached the final and full-scale fulfillment of those words of David found in Psalm Two. Now, more than at any time in the past, the issue of divine sovereignty is up for settlement. Our personal decision on the issue will be most serious in consequences to each one of us.</p>

Five days later they plainly declared publicly whose sovereignty they chose. When Passover celebrators under the coaching of their priests clamored for the Roman Governor Pontius Pilate to have the prisoner Jesus killed on a stake, Pilate asked them to reconsider the matter by saying: “Shall I impale your king?” The issue of sovereignty was now squarely before “the peoples of Israel.” Whose sovereignty would they choose? The Bible account indicates, when it says: “The chief priests answered: ‘We have no king but Caesar.’” Caesar’s representative, Pilate, went along with their decision, for the account says: “At that time, therefore, he handed him over to them to be impaled.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975761/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">John 19:12-16</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">16.

The kings of earth take their stand and high officials themselves have massed together as one against Jehovah and against his anointed one [his Christ, Greek <em>Septuagint Version</em>], saying: ‘Let us tear their bands apart and cast their cords away from us!’ The very One sitting in the heavens will laugh; Jehovah himself will hold them in derision.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969282/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 2:37-47</a>) It was no laughing matter for those same religious leaders when the preaching about Jesus the Messiah <span id="page241" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="241" data-before-text="241"></span>was carried right on into their temple in Jerusalem, particularly by the apostles Simon Peter and John the son of Zebedee. Especially the religious sect of the Sadducees disliked the preaching of the resurrection, the means by which Almighty God defeated the efforts of the religious and political enemies to do away forever with the promised Messiah, the Christ. They had the apostles Peter and John arrested, jailed and put on trial for their conduct. Finally the Jewish Court felt obliged to release the two apostles, but only after threatening them. Here now came the proof that God was laughing at the persecutors of the faithful followers of his Son the Messiah. How do we know?</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu">5, 6. (a) Why could not the religious leaders now laugh at the immediate effect that their mistreatment of Peter and John had upon Jerusalem Christians?

Did the religious authorities have reason to laugh over the effect of their fanatical handling of the matter, at how the Christians reacted to such official action? How could they? The record tells us: “After being released they [that is, Peter and John] went to their own people and reported what things the chief priests and the older men had said to them. Upon hearing this they with one accord raised their voices to God and said: ‘Sovereign Lord, you are the One who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in them, and who through holy spirit said by the mouth of our forefather David, your servant, “Why did nations become tumultuous and peoples meditate upon empty things? The kings of the earth took their stand and the rulers massed together as one against Jehovah and against his anointed one.” Even so, both Herod and Pontius Pilate with men of nations and with peoples of Israel were in actuality gathered together in this city against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, in order to do what things your hand and counsel had foreordained to occur. And now, Jehovah, give attention to their threats, and grant your slaves to keep speaking your word with all boldness, while you stretch out your hand for healing and while signs and portents occur through the name of your holy servant Jesus.’”</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> What followed could provoke no mirth or laughter among Herod Antipas, Pontius Pilate and the religious rulers of Jerusalem, for we read: “And when they had made supplication, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken; and they were one and all filled with the holy spirit and went speaking the word of God with boldness.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969282/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 3:1 to 4:31</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 7.

Almighty God could laugh derisively at the opposition to his Messiah and faithful followers of his Messiah. God did laugh, for the second Psalm, from which the disciples quoted in their prayer to Almighty God, foretold that He would laugh. Just as the disciples in their prayer commented on the fulfillment of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969282/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">the Ps 2:1, 2</a> first two verses of the inspired psalm written by King David of ancient Jerusalem, so the following verses of the same psalm must have then been undergoing fulfillment.

In that year, 2,520 years after ancient Jerusalem and Judah were first desolated by the Gentile Babylonians, the end came to the Gentile Times for trampling on Jerusalem or on the right of God’s kingdom to rule over the earth by means of God’s Anointed One, a descendant of King David.

Twentieth-century history shows why, for since the very year of 1914 C.E. notice has been served on all nations concerning the establishment of God’s Messianic kingdom in the heavens.

Would conditions and world trends be different on earth from what they are today? Yes! For all of God’s promises to those who submit to his Beloved Son, the enthroned Messianic King Jesus Christ, would have been fulfilled to them.

They have stubbornly refused to yield over their sovereignty to God’s rightful Ruler for the earth, his Messiah or Christ. They have continued to carry on their power struggle for world domination, even to the extent of fighting two world wars and threatening now the whole human race with a third. For world peace and security they have chosen to look to their League of Nations and its successor, the United Nations, considering it as the only practical substitute for God’s heavenly Messianic kingdom, a thing that their faithless hearts cannot visualize or appreciate.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">17.

They cannot prevent the heavenly Messianic kingdom from making them Christ’s footstool, to be crushed out of existence. God Almighty laughs at them derisively. Today all nations are in tumult because of choosing their own way, hence fighting against God’s way.

And I heard a sound out of heaven as the sound of many waters and as the sound of loud thunder; and the sound that I heard was as of singers who accompany themselves on the harp playing on their harps. And they are singing as if a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the older persons; and no one was able to master that song but the hundred and forty-four thousand, who have been bought from the earth. These are the ones that did not defile themselves with women; in fact, they are virgins. These are the ones that keep following the Lamb no matter where he goes.

Who is the symbolic Lamb? He is none other than the resurrected, glorified Jesus Christ. He is identified at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 5:5</a> as “the Lion that is of the tribe of Judah, the root of David.” When Jesus was on earth he was of the line of David and therefore had the legal right to the throne. Mount Zion was where the citadel of Jerusalem was situated when David was king of Israel. In the vision, however, Jesus does not come to be sacrificed as the Lamb. Nineteen centuries ago he was resurrected from death to life “in the spirit” and was laid in heavenly Zion as a ‘sure foundation,’ as the symbolic Tried, Precious Cornerstone. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2:6</a>) He is seen <em>standing</em> upon the Mount Zion. This means that he has begun to rule, the term being used in the Bible to mean that a king has taken power to reign. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Dan. 12:1</a>) David, in the second <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 2</a>, speaks about the opposition of nations to the rule of God’s “anointed one” (Jesus Christ), and then portrays Jehovah in anger, saying: “I, even I, have installed my king upon Zion, my holy mountain.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 2:2-6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Acts 4:19-30</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">How would this help us to understand the time of fulfillment of John’s vision? Well, it was the kingdom of the line of David that was overturned in 607 B.C.E. God said there would be a period of seven times in which the nations would exercise rule, during which period Jerusalem would be trampled on by the Gentile nations. Jerusalem, being the location of “Jehovah’s throne,” upon which David sat, came to be a symbol of Jehovah’s kingdom rulership in “the kingdom of the heavens.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 4:17</a>) When the times of the Gentiles ended, which time came in 1914 C.E., literal Jerusalem on earth was not liberated, but what ancient Jerusalem symbolized was restored to the one “who has the legal right,” namely, Jesus the Son of David, in the heavens.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ezek. 21:27</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Something in modern times paralleling events of 1,900 years ago gives us additional help in locating the fulfillment of John’s vision in the stream of time. On the Pentecost of 33 C.E., which was about three years eight months after being anointed with holy spirit, Jesus Christ began, in turn, to anoint with holy spirit men who were to be joint heirs with him, footstep followers of his who would, like <span id="page183" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="183" data-before-text="183"></span>him, maintain a course of integrity down to a sacrificial death, with prospects of reigning with him in the heavens.</p>

It says: “The kings of earth take their stand and high officials themselves have massed together as one against Jehovah and against his anointed one, saying: ‘Let us tear their bands apart and cast their cords away from us!’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962081/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 2:2, 3</a>) Rulers of Christendom may protest that they are not against God, that they do not reject his anointed Son, but God says they do. The history of man rule shows why.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">It was the first man, Adam, who rejected the law of God, deciding for himself what was good and what was bad. But particularly since the time of dictator Nimrod, who, following the flood of Noah’s day, set himself up as a mighty one, a ruler of his fellow men, have men tried to establish governments that would not be controlled by God. They have foolishly rejected the Supreme Sovereign from being the invisible Ruler over them and have refused to obey his laws. The difficulties to which this can lead are well illustrated in the nation of Israel.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>“GIVE US A KING”</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">For four centuries after their escape from Egypt, the nation of Israel was unique among the nations of the world. It had no visible king but was ruled by Jehovah <span id="page70" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="70" data-before-text="70"></span>God. His laws governed them, tying them closely to his sovereignty. Faithful men served as overseers to see that his will was carried out for the good of the people. As long as they obeyed their invisible Ruler they prospered. But instead of being content with this righteous King, they pleaded for a human ruler.</p>

The destruction of the throne city of Jerusalem and the desolating of its territory of Judah were completed by the month of October of 607 B.C. Hence those seven times of complete heathenish, Gentile domination of the earth would end 2,520 years from that time, or by October of 1914, in our own twentieth century. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960762/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Dan. 4:16,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960762/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 23,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960762/25/2" data-bid="26-3" class="b"> 25,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960762/25/3" data-bid="26-4" class="b"> 32</a>) In bringing this interruption of his kingdom to an end in 1914, God had a purpose. It was, as he stated to the king of Babylon, that world rulers might know “that the Most <span id="page626" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="626" data-before-text="626"></span>High is Ruler in the kingdom of mankind, and that to the one whom he wants to he gives it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960762/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Dan. 4:25,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960762/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 32</a>) World rulers of today do not yet appreciate that fact, and refuse to acknowledge it. Hence the rulership of the Most High God in the kingdom of mankind has become an issue, and there must be a universal war to decide who rules all creation.</p><p id="p101" data-pid="101" class="qu">36.

In his own prophecy concerning the end of this world system Jesus Christ foretold that after the Kingdom’s establishment Jehovah God would have his witnesses on earth who would bear testimony to all the nations concerning the established kingdom. The apostle Matthew quotes Jesus Christ as prophesying: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations, and then the accomplished end will come.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960762/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>) So this Kingdom witness has to take place and be finished before the “war of the great day of God the Almighty.” By then many will have found the true place of security.</p><p id="p102" data-pid="102" class="qu">37.

They had the Holy Bible by the hundreds of millions of copies. They had hundreds of thousands of priests and preachers who regularly led hundreds of millions of church members in praying the Lord’s prayer, saying: “Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come.” Did they truly mean that prayer? Did they really want God’s kingdom, or men’s kingdom? Were the kings of Christendom, who required their subjects to recognize their claim to rule “by divine right,” willing to recognize the only one who had the “legal right,” the divine right to rule as king over all mankind, namely, the Christ or Anointed One of the Lord God? The events of 1914 and since then have shown the true, undeniable answer. The nations of Christendom have acted just as Bible prophecy foretold. Their actions have exposed their prayers as hypocritical.</p><p id="p103" data-pid="103" class="qu">38, 39.

The kings of earth take their stand and high officials themselves have massed together as one against Jehovah and against his anointed one [his Christ].”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960762/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ps. 2:1, 2</a>; <em>margin.</em></p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" data-rel-pid="[103]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="39"><sup>39</sup></span> As foretold here, all nations were to be in a tumultuous rage, massed together against the heavenly kingdom. With this agrees the vision that the apostle John had of what would take place at the end of the seven times of the Gentiles in 1914. John says: “Loud voices occurred in heaven saying: ‘The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will rule as king for ever and ever.’ And the twenty-four persons of advanced age who were seated before God upon their thrones fell upon their faces <span id="page627" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="627" data-before-text="627"></span>and worshiped God, saying: ‘We thank you, Jehovah God, the Almighty, the one who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and begun ruling as king.

Their hostile attitude to the kingdom of the Lord God and of his Christ has not changed since. A second world war, beginning with the nations of religious Christendom, erupted in 1939. Since its close in 1945 more than eighty nations, under leadership of the nations of Christendom, have massed together in the United Nations organization, not to support the heavenly kingdom in the hands of Christ, who has the legal right to it, but to maintain world domination by earthly men.</p>

<strong>Jehovah’s Message Against Gog of Magog</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> All related facts show that the cryptic name “Gog” refers to Jehovah God’s arch enemy, Satan the Devil, since his ouster from heaven after A.D. 1914. Concerning this we read: “And war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels battled with the dragon, and the dragon and its angels battled but it did not prevail, neither was a place found for them any longer in heaven. So down the great dragon was hurled, the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan, who is misleading the entire inhabited earth; he was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down <span id="page462" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="462" data-before-text="462"></span>with him.” Hence, “woe for the earth and for the sea, because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing he has a short period of time.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956565/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rev. 12:7-9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956565/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 12</a>, <em>NW</em>) From and after A.D. 1914 even to the present day ‘darkness covers the earth and gross darkness the people.’ This is the period of time when the Devil, the god of darkness and despair, easily misleads earth’s inhabitants. The time since his being ousted from heaven is the “short period of time” just before the complete end of Satan’s system of things. Yes, this is the time referred to in Ezekiel’s prophecy as the “latter years” and “latter days” of the rule of darkness and oppression by “Gog, of the land of Magog.” In the prophecy the “land of Magog,” because of the uncertainty of its ancient location, well pictures the invisible, degraded region in the vicinity of the earth where Satan and his demons are now held under divine surveillance since their being thrown out of heaven.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 7. What elements make up Gog’s organization?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Gog of Magog is the invisible god and wicked ruler of the present global system of things.

It is therefore not at all surprising that the chieftains of the earth, the high and mighty, the visible rulers of the nations, give their full support and strength to the god of this world and his system.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 8.

Giants of commerce and industry, and the big investment and banking financiers of international power and intrigue, are also in this same satanic camp serving very well Gog of Magog and his organization. “Why do the nations rage, and the peoples meditate a vain thing?

They are not taught to pray for the continuation of this present devilish world that will soon pass away at Armageddon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956565/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">John 18:36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956565/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 17:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956565/13/2" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> Matt. 6:9, 10</a>, <em>NW</em>) But do the clergy of Christendom pray as Christ said they should? No, not at all! As a class they form a strong religio-political brotherhood with the temporal powers and thus endorse and put their stamp of approval on the present system of things, which is in opposition to Christ’s kingdom. Furthermore, they are continually heard to pray for this world’s prosperity and success. From their pulpits and over the radio the clergy laud the leaders of this world and bless anti-Christ schemes for peace such as the organization of the United Nations. Whenever in such countries as the United States of America the legislative bodies open their sessions the official voice of a clergyman is heard calling down divine blessings upon the deliberations. Thus <span id="page463" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="463" data-before-text="463"></span>by the company they keep the religious leaders of this world show they are also adulterous ‘friends of this world,’ hence enemies of Jehovah God.

Fanatical politicians found a “legal” way. They put a ban on the preaching work of Jehovah’s witnesses in 1933. It became a “crime” to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Many were arrested and imprisoned. The Nazis maintained that the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses (Earnest Bible Students) were inimical and ‘disturbed the National Socialistic construction.’ When Jehovah’s witnesses went into the courts to fight for their rights and some were set free, the Reich’s Ministry of Justice prepared a lengthy opinion to ensure that Jehovah’s witnesses could not be freed, saying, in conclusion: “The courts must not fail on account of merely apparent legal formalities; but must seek and find ways in spite of the formal difficulties, to fulfill their high duties.” This meant that true justice could not be had. Ten thousand suffered in the concentration camps. They did not try to take the law into their own hands and rise up against the government. Patiently they waited upon Jehovah for deliverance, never breaking faith with their God. Not capitulating, they were freed again at the end of World War II and their numbers have multiplied.</p><p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu">17.

In all such countries Jehovah’s witnesses find no justice. Judges are instructed what the verdict is to be before trials are called. Thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses are now unjustly imprisoned in eastern Europe. But Jehovah’s witnesses cannot break faith with Jehovah; so they continue to worship and preach as they are able, waiting upon Jehovah for salvation and taking strength from his precious promises in the Bible. They conduct Bible studies secretly outside of or in the prisons. Other prisoners join them in the ministry, often being baptized right in the prisons. So Jehovah’s witnesses continue to increase in numbers in all communistic lands. And the communistic persecution reveals clearly that Jehovah’s witnesses are not following men, but following the true “higher powers,” Jehovah and Christ Jesus, for many times those considered “leaders” by the Communists have been arrested and put away and almost immediately others with the spirit of Jehovah are raised up to continue with the witness work, and expansion goes on.</p>

<strong>Flight to Safety with the New World Society</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> The revolt of the Jews against their friend Caesar came in 66 (A.D.) for the outrages done them by his political governors. That same year the armies of the political part of the disgusting thing turned against them and made a preliminary assault against their holy city Jerusalem.

Had the religious clergy <span id="page562" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="562" data-before-text="562"></span>of Christendom examined the prophecies that Jehovah’s witnesses called to their attention, had they faced the facts of modern history and seen their import and shown loyalty to God’s will, they would have hailed his kingdom and would have recommended it as the only government entitled to world domination. To the contrary of this, they took sides with the political factors in total warfare for the domination of the earthly realm of God’s anointed King Jesus Christ. They led in persecuting Jehovah’s witnesses who stood loyal to God’s enthroned Ruler and they moved the sword-brandishing arm of the political state against Jehovah’s witnesses to try to exterminate them from the earth. They gave no reverential thought to Jesus’ words: “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953684/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matt. 25:40</a>) For fear of alienating the affections of their political friends the clergy preferred to hold to the warring kingdoms of this world and to accuse Jesus Christ of sedition against Caesar by accusing his true followers of this.</p>

They had the apostles Peter and John arrested, jailed and put on trial for their conduct. Finally the Jewish Court felt obliged to release the two apostles, but only after threatening them.

Did the religious authorities have reason to laugh over the effect of their fanatical handling of the matter, at how the Christians reacted to such official action? How could they? The record tells us: “After being released they [that is, Peter and John] went to their own people and reported what things the chief priests and the older men had said to them. Upon hearing this they with one accord raised their voices to God and said: ‘Sovereign Lord, you are the One who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in them, and who through holy spirit said by the mouth of our forefather David, your servant, “Why did nations become tumultuous and peoples meditate upon empty things? The kings of the earth took their stand and the rulers massed together as one against Jehovah and against his anointed one.” Even so, both Herod and Pontius Pilate with men of nations and with peoples of Israel were in actuality gathered together in this city against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, in order to do what things your hand and counsel had foreordained to occur. And now, Jehovah, give attention to their threats, and grant your slaves to keep speaking your word with all boldness, while you stretch out your hand for healing and while signs and portents occur through the name of your holy servant Jesus.’”</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> What followed could provoke no mirth or laughter among Herod Antipas, Pontius Pilate and the religious rulers of Jerusalem, for we read: “And when they had made supplication, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken; and they were one and all filled with the holy spirit and went speaking the word of God with boldness.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969282/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 3:1 to 4:31</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 7.

In that year, 2,520 years after ancient Jerusalem and Judah were first desolated by the Gentile Babylonians, the end came to the Gentile Times for trampling on Jerusalem or on the right of God’s kingdom to rule over the earth by means of God’s Anointed One, a descendant of King David.

Twentieth-century history shows why, for since the very year of 1914 C.E. notice has been served on all nations concerning the establishment of God’s Messianic kingdom in the heavens. Not in vain did Jesus Christ say, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969282/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.” What if the Gentile nations, particularly the nations of Christendom, had accepted that witness and had realistically conformed to it, yielding their sovereignty over to God’s heavenly Messianic kingdom, in the same way that Jehovah’s Christian witnesses have done? Would conditions and world trends be different on earth from what they are today? Yes! For all of God’s promises to those who submit to his Beloved Son, the enthroned Messianic King Jesus Christ, would have been fulfilled to them. History would not brand them as the shameless persecutors of true Christians bearing witness to the Kingdom since 1914.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">16.

They have stubbornly refused to yield over their sovereignty to God’s rightful Ruler for the earth, his Messiah or Christ. They have continued to carry on their power struggle for world domination, even to the extent of fighting two world wars and threatening now the whole human race with a third. For world peace and security they have chosen to look to their League of Nations and its successor, the United Nations, considering it as the only practical substitute for God’s heavenly Messianic kingdom, a thing that their faithless hearts cannot visualize or appreciate.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">17.

They cannot prevent the heavenly Messianic kingdom from making them Christ’s footstool, to be crushed out of existence. God Almighty laughs at them derisively. Today all nations are in tumult because of choosing their own way, hence fighting against God’s way. By pushing and propagandizing for their own schemes the national groups are meditating upon empty things, muttering empty things that will prove to be hollow.

Fanatical politicians found a “legal” way. They put a ban on the preaching work of Jehovah’s witnesses in 1933. It became a “crime” to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Many were arrested and imprisoned. The Nazis maintained that the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses (Earnest Bible Students) were inimical and ‘disturbed the National Socialistic construction.’ When Jehovah’s witnesses went into the courts to fight for their rights and some were set free, the Reich’s Ministry of Justice prepared a lengthy opinion to ensure that Jehovah’s witnesses could not be freed, saying, in conclusion: “The courts must not fail on account of merely apparent legal formalities; but must seek and find ways in spite of the formal difficulties, to fulfill their high duties.” This meant that true justice could not be had. Ten thousand suffered in the concentration camps. They did not try to take the law into their own hands and rise up against the government. Patiently they waited upon Jehovah for deliverance, never breaking faith with their God. Not capitulating, they were freed again at the end of World War II and their numbers have multiplied.</p><p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu">17.

In all such countries Jehovah’s witnesses find no justice. Judges are instructed what the verdict is to be before trials are called. Thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses are now unjustly imprisoned in eastern Europe. But Jehovah’s witnesses cannot break faith with Jehovah; so they continue to worship and preach as they are able, waiting upon Jehovah for salvation and taking strength from his precious promises in the Bible. They conduct Bible studies secretly outside of or in the prisons. Other prisoners join them in the ministry, often being baptized right in the prisons. So Jehovah’s witnesses continue to increase in numbers in all communistic lands. And the communistic persecution reveals clearly that Jehovah’s witnesses are not following men, but following the true “higher powers,” Jehovah and Christ Jesus, for many times those considered “leaders” by the Communists have been arrested and put away and almost immediately others with the spirit of Jehovah are raised up to continue with the witness work, and expansion goes on.</p>

<strong>Flight to Safety with the New World Society</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> The revolt of the Jews against their friend Caesar came in 66 (A.D.) for the outrages done them by his political governors. That same year the armies of the political part of the disgusting thing turned against them and made a preliminary assault against their holy city Jerusalem. That was the sight of the disgusting thing with its armies surrounding the holy city of Jerusalem that the Christians were to look for as notification that it was high time for them to flee to the mountains outside <span id="page561" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="561" data-before-text="561"></span>Judea for safety. Not knowing how soon the armies of the disgusting thing would come back and complete the desolation of Judea and Jerusalem, the Christian governing body and other obedient Christians moved out without having to do it on any inconvenient Jewish sabbath day or in wintertime. In the seventh century before Christ the Babylonish armies had come back to desolate Jerusalem the first time. In 70 (A.D) the Roman armies came back. During the spring and summer of that year the siege and complete destruction followed. By prompt, obedient action the Christians had escaped sharing in that horrible desolation.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953684/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Jer. 37:6-10</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>MODERN COUNTERPART</strong></p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">16.

To the contrary of this, they took sides with the political factors in total warfare for the domination of the earthly realm of God’s anointed King Jesus Christ. They led in persecuting Jehovah’s witnesses who stood loyal to God’s enthroned Ruler and they moved the sword-brandishing arm of the political state against Jehovah’s witnesses to try to exterminate them from the earth. They gave no reverential thought to Jesus’ words: “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953684/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matt. 25:40</a>) For fear of alienating the affections of their political friends the clergy preferred to hold to the warring kingdoms of this world and to accuse Jesus Christ of sedition against Caesar by accusing his true followers of this.</p>

<strong>Laughter</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Jehovah God is described as laughing in derision at the nations, at their boastful words, which come to nothing, and at the confusion their foolish course against him brings.

<strong>God’s Kingdom Purpose Triumphs</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Do these efforts of the nations to go ahead with their own sovereignty and form of rule worry God? He says: “The very One sitting in the heavens will laugh; Jehovah himself will hold them in derision.” He goes ahead with his purpose as though these rulers were nothing. However, he is not pleased with their attitude, for, at the time that they make efforts to counteract his purpose, “he will speak to them in his anger [as the sound of a terrible roll of thunder] and in his hot displeasure [as a great lightning stroke] he will disturb them.” What he declares greatly upsets them: “I, even I, have installed my king upon Zion, my holy mountain.” The throne over earth is already occupied by God’s own appointed king, his choice.

<strong>Making Men and Nations a Laughingstock</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> It was no laughing matter for the religious leaders of Jerusalem when about three thousand of the crowd whom Peter and his fellow witnesses addressed believed the good news about the resurrected, heavenly exalted Messiah, Jesus, and got baptized and became his followers. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969282/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 2:37-47</a>) It was no laughing matter for those same religious leaders when the preaching about Jesus the Messiah <span id="page241" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="241" data-before-text="241"></span>was carried right on into their temple in Jerusalem, particularly by the apostles Simon Peter and John the son of Zebedee. Especially the religious sect of the Sadducees disliked the preaching of the resurrection, the means by which Almighty God defeated the efforts of the religious and political enemies to do away forever with the promised Messiah, the Christ. They had the apostles Peter and John arrested, jailed and put on trial for their conduct. Finally the Jewish Court felt obliged to release the two apostles, but only after threatening them. Here now came the proof that God was laughing at the persecutors of the faithful followers of his Son the Messiah. How do we know?</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu">5, 6. (a) Why could not the religious leaders now laugh at the immediate effect that their mistreatment of Peter and John had upon Jerusalem Christians? (b) Why did Jehovah’s answer to the Christians’ prayer provide the rulers no cause for mirth?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> By what followed this official mistreatment of Christian apostles. Did the religious authorities have reason to laugh over the effect of their fanatical handling of the matter, at how the Christians reacted to such official action? How could they? The record tells us: “After being released they [that is, Peter and John] went to their own people and reported what things the chief priests and the older men had said to them. Upon hearing this they with one accord raised their voices to God and said: ‘Sovereign Lord, you are the One who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in them, and who through holy spirit said by the mouth of our forefather David, your servant, “Why did nations become tumultuous and peoples meditate upon empty things? The kings of the earth took their stand and the rulers massed together as one against Jehovah and against his anointed one.” Even so, both Herod and Pontius Pilate with men of nations and with peoples of Israel were in actuality gathered together in this city against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, in order to do what things your hand and counsel had foreordained to occur. And now, Jehovah, give attention to their threats, and grant your slaves to keep speaking your word with all boldness, while you stretch out your hand for healing and while signs and portents occur through the name of your holy servant Jesus.’”</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> What followed could provoke no mirth or laughter among Herod Antipas, Pontius Pilate and the religious rulers of Jerusalem, for we read: “And when they had made supplication, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken; and they were one and all filled with the holy spirit and went speaking the word of God with boldness.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969282/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 3:1 to 4:31</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 7. From the application that the disciples made in prayer of two verses of Psalm Two, how do we know that Jehovah was then laughing at the opposition to Christ and his followers?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Because of the boldness of these Christian disciples in the first century C.E. Almighty God could laugh derisively at the opposition to his Messiah and faithful followers of his Messiah. God did laugh, for the second Psalm, from which the disciples quoted in their prayer to Almighty God, foretold that He would laugh. Just as the disciples in their prayer commented on the fulfillment of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969282/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">the Ps 2:1, 2</a> first two verses of the inspired psalm written by King David of ancient Jerusalem, so the following verses of the same psalm must have then been undergoing fulfillment. Here is where the laugh comes in, for <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969282/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">verses two through six of Psalm 2</a>:2-6 Two say: “The kings of earth take their stand and high officials themselves have massed together as one against Jehovah and against his anointed one, saying: ‘Let us tear their bands apart and east their cords away from us!’ The very One sitting in the heavens will laugh; Jehovah himself will <span id="page242" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="242" data-before-text="242"></span>hold them in derision. At that time he will speak to them in his anger and in his hot displeasure he will disturb them, saying: ‘I, even I, have installed my king upon Zion, my holy mountain.’”</p>

No! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969282/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Acts 1:6, 7</a>) Jesus Christ had to wait in heaven until God’s fixed time arrived for those Gentile Times for trampling on Jerusalem to be fulfilled, terminated. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969282/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Heb. 10:12, 13</a>) God’s prefixed date was the year 1914 C.E. In that year, 2,520 years after ancient Jerusalem and Judah were first desolated by the Gentile Babylonians, the end came to the Gentile Times for trampling on Jerusalem or on the right of God’s kingdom to rule over the earth by means of God’s Anointed One, a descendant of King David. Then God’s Messianic kingdom must be restored, this time, not on earth, but in <span id="page244" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="244" data-before-text="244"></span>heaven. Then, instead of letting the Gentile nations trample on what was symbolized by Jerusalem, the Gentile nations themselves must be trampled on, must be made the footstool of the Anointed King of God’s Messianic kingdom. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969282/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1, 2</a>) Thus the year 1914 C.E. marked a change for both heaven and earth!.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">15. (a) Why have the Gentile nations no reason to be ignorant of all this? (b) How would it have made a difference on earth if the nations, particularly those of Christendom, had accepted and conformed to the Kingdom witness?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> The Gentile nations, including the Republic of Israel, have no reason to be ignorant of this. Twentieth-century history shows why, for since the very year of 1914 C.E. notice has been served on all nations concerning the establishment of God’s Messianic kingdom in the heavens. Not in vain did Jesus Christ say, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969282/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.” What if the Gentile nations, particularly the nations of Christendom, had accepted that witness and had realistically conformed to it, yielding their sovereignty over to God’s heavenly Messianic kingdom, in the same way that Jehovah’s Christian witnesses have done? Would conditions and world trends be different on earth from what they are today? Yes! For all of God’s promises to those who submit to his Beloved Son, the enthroned Messianic King Jesus Christ, would have been fulfilled to them. History would not brand them as the shameless persecutors of true Christians bearing witness to the Kingdom since 1914.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">16. What do world conditions and trends indicate has been the course of the nations since 1914 C.E.?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> The sad and frightening conditions and trends on earth today speak for themselves, testifying to the fact that, since the end of the Gentile Times in 1914 and despite the worldwide witness to the Kingdom as given in all the inhabited earth by Jehovah’s Christian witnesses, the Gentile nations, including Christendom and Jewry, have chosen their own way, not God’s way. They have stubbornly refused to yield over their sovereignty to God’s rightful Ruler for the earth, his Messiah or Christ. They have continued to carry on their power struggle for world domination, even to the extent of fighting two world wars and threatening now the whole human race with a third. For world peace and security they have chosen to look to their League of Nations and its successor, the United Nations, considering it as the only practical substitute for God’s heavenly Messianic kingdom, a thing that their faithless hearts cannot visualize or appreciate.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">17. (a) Since the Gentile Times ended in 1914, what has been the big issue before us? (b) Do all that they are permitted to do, what can the nations not undo or prevent on God’s part?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Since the end of the Gentile Times in 1914 the big, universal issue is, Jehovah God’s Messianic kingdom or domination of all the earth by Gentile nations, which? Will the Gentile nations win out? Can they win out? Let them, if they can, suppress the worldwide proclaimers of God’s Messianic kingdom, let them do whatever else they can in opposition to the Kingdom, yet they cannot unseat Jehovah’s anointed King, his Christ, now enthroned on the heavenly Mount Zion. They cannot prevent the heavenly Messianic kingdom from making them Christ’s footstool, to be crushed out of existence. God Almighty laughs at them derisively. Today all nations are in tumult because of choosing their own way, hence fighting against God’s way. By pushing and propagandizing for their own schemes the national groups are meditating upon empty things, muttering empty things that will prove to be hollow. Bible history, Bible prophecy, foretold this.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969282/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 2:1-6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969282/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Acts 4:25, 26</a>.</p>

<strong>Making Men and Nations a Laughingstock</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> It was no laughing matter for the religious leaders of Jerusalem when about three thousand of the crowd whom Peter and his fellow witnesses addressed believed the good news about the resurrected, heavenly exalted Messiah, Jesus, and got baptized and became his followers. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969282/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 2:37-47</a>) It was no laughing matter for those same religious leaders when the preaching about Jesus the Messiah <span id="page241" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="241" data-before-text="241"></span>was carried right on into their temple in Jerusalem, particularly by the apostles Simon Peter and John the son of Zebedee. Especially the religious sect of the Sadducees disliked the preaching of the resurrection, the means by which Almighty God defeated the efforts of the religious and political enemies to do away forever with the promised Messiah, the Christ. They had the apostles Peter and John arrested, jailed and put on trial for their conduct. Finally the Jewish Court felt obliged to release the two apostles, but only after threatening them. Here now came the proof that God was laughing at the persecutors of the faithful followers of his Son the Messiah. How do we know?</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu">5, 6. (a) Why could not the religious leaders now laugh at the immediate effect that their mistreatment of Peter and John had upon Jerusalem Christians?

Did the religious authorities have reason to laugh over the effect of their fanatical handling of the matter, at how the Christians reacted to such official action? How could they? The record tells us: “After being released they [that is, Peter and John] went to their own people and reported what things the chief priests and the older men had said to them. Upon hearing this they with one accord raised their voices to God and said: ‘Sovereign Lord, you are the One who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in them, and who through holy spirit said by the mouth of our forefather David, your servant, “Why did nations become tumultuous and peoples meditate upon empty things? The kings of the earth took their stand and the rulers massed together as one against Jehovah and against his anointed one.” Even so, both Herod and Pontius Pilate with men of nations and with peoples of Israel were in actuality gathered together in this city against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, in order to do what things your hand and counsel had foreordained to occur. And now, Jehovah, give attention to their threats, and grant your slaves to keep speaking your word with all boldness, while you stretch out your hand for healing and while signs and portents occur through the name of your holy servant Jesus.’”</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> What followed could provoke no mirth or laughter among Herod Antipas, Pontius Pilate and the religious rulers of Jerusalem, for we read: “And when they had made supplication, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken; and they were one and all filled with the holy spirit and went speaking the word of God with boldness.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969282/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 3:1 to 4:31</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 7.

Almighty God could laugh derisively at the opposition to his Messiah and faithful followers of his Messiah. God did laugh, for the second Psalm, from which the disciples quoted in their prayer to Almighty God, foretold that He would laugh. Just as the disciples in their prayer commented on the fulfillment of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969282/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">the Ps 2:1, 2</a> first two verses of the inspired psalm written by King David of ancient Jerusalem, so the following verses of the same psalm must have then been undergoing fulfillment. Here is where the laugh comes in, for <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969282/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">verses two through six of Psalm 2</a>:2-6 Two say: “The kings of earth take their stand and high officials themselves have massed together as one against Jehovah and against his anointed one, saying: ‘Let us tear their bands apart and east their cords away from us!’ The very One sitting in the heavens will laugh; Jehovah himself will <span id="page242" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="242" data-before-text="242"></span>hold them in derision.

In that year, 2,520 years after ancient Jerusalem and Judah were first desolated by the Gentile Babylonians, the end came to the Gentile Times for trampling on Jerusalem or on the right of God’s kingdom to rule over the earth by means of God’s Anointed One, a descendant of King David. Then God’s Messianic kingdom must be restored, this time, not on earth, but in <span id="page244" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="244" data-before-text="244"></span>heaven. Then, instead of letting the Gentile nations trample on what was symbolized by Jerusalem, the Gentile nations themselves must be trampled on, must be made the footstool of the Anointed King of God’s Messianic kingdom.

Twentieth-century history shows why, for since the very year of 1914 C.E. notice has been served on all nations concerning the establishment of God’s Messianic kingdom in the heavens. Not in vain did Jesus Christ say, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969282/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.” What if the Gentile nations, particularly the nations of Christendom, had accepted that witness and had realistically conformed to it, yielding their sovereignty over to God’s heavenly Messianic kingdom, in the same way that Jehovah’s Christian witnesses have done? Would conditions and world trends be different on earth from what they are today? Yes! For all of God’s promises to those who submit to his Beloved Son, the enthroned Messianic King Jesus Christ, would have been fulfilled to them. History would not brand them as the shameless persecutors of true Christians bearing witness to the Kingdom since 1914.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">16.

They have stubbornly refused to yield over their sovereignty to God’s rightful Ruler for the earth, his Messiah or Christ. They have continued to carry on their power struggle for world domination, even to the extent of fighting two world wars and threatening now the whole human race with a third. For world peace and security they have chosen to look to their League of Nations and its successor, the United Nations, considering it as the only practical substitute for God’s heavenly Messianic kingdom, a thing that their faithless hearts cannot visualize or appreciate.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">17.

They cannot prevent the heavenly Messianic kingdom from making them Christ’s footstool, to be crushed out of existence. God Almighty laughs at them derisively. Today all nations are in tumult because of choosing their own way, hence fighting against God’s way. By pushing and propagandizing for their own schemes the national groups are meditating upon empty things, muttering empty things that will prove to be hollow.

They fear it because of having already experienced two world wars. They fear it because atomic weapons will be used. They fear it because there seems no way of escaping it. But what the majority of the people do not realize is that something far more terrible than another international war is impending. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951761/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951761/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 10</a>) As General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, on September 2, 1945, the day after the surrender of the Japanese, aboard the battleship “Missouri”, warned: “Men since the beginning of time have sought peace. . . . Military alliances, balance of power, leagues of nations, all in turn failed, leaving the only path to be by way of the crucible of war. We have had our last chance. If we will not devise some greater and more equitable system, our Armageddon will be at our door.” No “more equitable system” has been devised. The nations are having their “last chance”. Armageddon is at the door!</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Now let this fact be fully appreciated by all: Armageddon will be altogether different, separate and distinct from any prospective World War III, touched off and prosecuted by mere men. Armageddon will not be a war between Eastern and Western blocs of nations. It will not be communism against capitalism. It will not be a revolt of the laboring masses against the ruling classes. No, Armageddon will be the battle of God Almighty, the great and terrible war, when Jehovah completely destroys the nations and kingdoms that oppose and fight against his glorious theocratic rule.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951761/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Zeph. 3:8</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Armageddon will not be any local war limited to the literal valley of Megiddo in Palestine. Har–Magedon, or Armageddon, means the “mountain of the assembly of troops”, and it refers in a symbolic way to the capital organization of Zion where Jehovah God has enthroned Christ Jesus as earth’s rightful ruler. That great historical event took place in the year 1914, conclusive proof concerning this having already appeared in the columns of <em>The Watchtower</em>.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951761/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 45:3-7</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">So it is against the established kingdom under Christ that the nations under the control of the Devil and his demons now gather together for an all-out final, but futile, assault. Says the psalmist: “Why do the nations rage, and the peoples meditate a vain thing [conspiring to continue their rule]? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against Jehovah, and against his anointed [King], . . . He that sitteth in the heavens will laugh: the Lord will have them in derision. Then will he speak unto them in his wrath [at Armageddon], and vex them in his sore displeasure: Yet I have set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951761/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 2:1-6</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>THE GATHERING STORM</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">They do not realize it, but the hurried efforts of the rulers since 1914 in forming <span id="page614" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="614" data-before-text="614"></span>leagues of nations, creating confederacies, drawing up hemispheric pacts and international agreements, and pooling their strength in what they call a United Nations—all of such schemes having welded the nations together into a solid bloc in opposition to Christ’s kingdom—are in direct fulfillment of divine prophecy long ago recorded. And just as surely as we have seen the nations form these confederacies, just that surely will we see them dashed to pieces at Armageddon! “Associate yourselves, O ye people,” the prophet declared, “and ye shall be broken in pieces.” “Gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces.” “Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951761/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 8:9, 10</a>.</p>

Serve Jehovah with fear and be joyful with trembling. Kiss the Son [the Messiah] that He [Jehovah] may not become incensed and you may not perish from the way, for his anger flares up easily.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101975078/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Psalm 2:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101975078/49/1" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> 10-12</a>) The nations have persistently held back from kissing the King whom Jehovah has universally announced to be his only-begotten Son, for the nations have done nothing to soften his face toward a reconciliation.

<strong>God’s Kingdom Purpose Triumphs</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Do these efforts of the nations to go ahead with their own sovereignty and form of rule worry God? He says: “The very One sitting in the heavens will laugh; Jehovah himself will hold them in derision.” He goes ahead with his purpose as though these rulers were nothing. However, he is not pleased with their attitude, for, at the time that they make efforts to counteract his purpose, “he will speak to them in his anger [as the sound of a terrible roll of thunder] and in his hot displeasure [as a great lightning stroke] he will disturb them.” What he declares greatly upsets them: “I, even I, have installed my king upon Zion, my holy mountain.” The throne over earth is already occupied by God’s own appointed king, his choice.

His enthronement took place in heaven in 1914 C.E.

Especially the religious sect of the Sadducees disliked the preaching of the resurrection, the means by which Almighty God defeated the efforts of the religious and political enemies to do away forever with the promised Messiah, the Christ. They had the apostles Peter and John arrested, jailed and put on trial for their conduct. Finally the Jewish Court felt obliged to release the two apostles, but only after threatening them. Here now came the proof that God was laughing at the persecutors of the faithful followers of his Son the Messiah. How do we know?</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu">5, 6.

The record tells us: “After being released they [that is, Peter and John] went to their own people and reported what things the chief priests and the older men had said to them. Upon hearing this they with one accord raised their voices to God and said: ‘Sovereign Lord, you are the One who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in them, and who through holy spirit said by the mouth of our forefather David, your servant, “Why did nations become tumultuous and peoples meditate upon empty things? The kings of the earth took their stand and the rulers massed together as one against Jehovah and against his anointed one.” Even so, both Herod and Pontius Pilate with men of nations and with peoples of Israel were in actuality gathered together in this city against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, in order to do what things your hand and counsel had foreordained to occur. And now, Jehovah, give attention to their threats, and grant your slaves to keep speaking your word with all boldness, while you stretch out your hand for healing and while signs and portents occur through the name of your holy servant Jesus.’”</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> What followed could provoke no mirth or laughter among Herod Antipas, Pontius Pilate and the religious rulers of Jerusalem, for we read: “And when they had made supplication, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken; and they were one and all filled with the holy spirit and went speaking the word of God with boldness.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969282/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 3:1 to 4:31</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 7.

Ask of me, that I may give nations as your inheritance and the ends of the earth as your own possession.

<strong>Gathered in Unity for Ministerial Work</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> The full limit is reached when, as Jesus said in his great prophecy, “the appointed times of the nations are fulfilled.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964483/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Luke 21:24</a>) This momentous turning point in the development of Jehovah’s purpose and in human history was reached in 1914, as abundantly testified by what took place here on earth in fulfillment of Bible prophecy. It was then that the rulership was given to Christ Jesus in heaven, as described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964483/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Daniel, chapter 7</a>, despite the opposition of fierce, beastlike kingdoms on earth. As also prophetically depicted by the psalmist, the nations and their rulers “massed together as one against Jehovah <span id="page399" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="399" data-before-text="399"></span>and against his anointed one,” but Jehovah laughed at them in derision and declared: “I, even I, have installed my king upon Zion, my holy mountain.” When Jehovah’s anointed king, Christ Jesus, was installed or enthroned, that was when the administration was set up. This did not take place at Zion, or Jerusalem, yonder in Palestine, but, as the scripture says, at “Mount Zion and a city of the living God, <em>heavenly</em> Jerusalem.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964483/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 2:2-6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964483/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Heb. 12:22</a>.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">15, 16.

That is true, as far as steps to that end are concerned. It began at Pentecost, 33 C.E., with the first members of the Christian congregation when God’s spirit was poured out upon them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964483/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Acts 2:1-4</a>) But neither while actively engaged in their ministry, nor at death, did they receive their full reward. As Paul wrote to Timothy: “From this time on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me as a reward in that day.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964483/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Tim. 4:8</a>) Jehovah’s great administration goes into full operation after the end of the Gentile Times in 1914.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> “That day” having arrived, what do we see? In the words of the symbolic vision as described by John we can now say by faith: “And I saw, and, look! the Lamb standing upon the Mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand having his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.” It was after 1914 that the administrative “new heavens,” with the enthroned Jesus Christ as God’s Administrator, cast Satan the Devil and his demon angels down to our earth and proceeded to the work of unification, particularly from 1919 onward, as modern history of Jehovah’s witnesses shows. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964483/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Rev. 14:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964483/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 12:1-13</a>) Thus the work of the administration sweeps ever onward, completely fulfilling the will of the Supreme One exactly as he caused it to be recorded long ago in these words: “In the name of Jesus every knee should bend of those in heaven and those on earth and those under the ground, and every tongue should openly acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964483/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Phil. 2:10, 11</a>.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">17.

Additionally, this emphasizes the need for the spirit of submission and cooperation. These lessons become more sharply defined as we look farther into what Paul says on this same theme.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="ss"><strong>THE RIGHT SPIRIT FOR THE RIGHT PURPOSE</strong></p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">18.

When mother Eve listened to what the serpent had to say about the forbidden fruit, it became not only a test of obedience, but also one of humility. Deceived by what she was told, she began to look at that fruit from a new viewpoint. It would give her, so she thought, a newly found independence, and the idea appealed to her. This is shown by the fact that she did not even wait to ask her husband about it, but went ahead on her own initiative. We can imagine her saying: ‘Why not? I have a mind of my own, have I not? I know my husband has not had any of this fruit yet, but leave it to me; I’ll see that he has.’ And she did!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964483/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Gen. 3:1-6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964483/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b">1 Tim. 2:14</a>.</p>

<strong>‘Fight a Fine Fight for the Faith’</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> On the other hand, it is not just the responsibility of overseers to aid people to remain Christians and to stay in Jehovah’s visible organization. It is the responsibility of every Christian within Jehovah’s organization to help each one. True, our love goes out to God, and Jesus said we should love Jehovah our God with all our heart, mind, soul and strength, but he also said we should love our neighbor as we love ourselves. If we really do this, then as Christians we must love and aid our neighbors to put up a fine fight for the faith. Why should Christians want to do this? Because, like Paul, Christians must be able to say: “I did not hold back from telling you any of the things that were profitable nor from teaching you publicly and from house to house.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963003/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Acts 20:20</a>) Christians will never “get a firm hold on the everlasting life” unless they keep on serving God in every way day by day. So it is necessary to help one another, especially in these perilous times, days that are hard to deal with, days in which every man’s hand is against his neighbor, days in which the love of the greater number grows cold, days in which immorality is rampant. So it is excellent admonition that Paul gave Timothy. Every Christian should help his <span id="page30" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="30" data-before-text="30"></span>brother to ‘fight the fine fight of the faith, to get a firm hold on the everlasting life.’ This is in full accord with the text that Jehovah’s witnesses have chosen for 1963: “Have faith to the preserving alive of the soul.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963003/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Heb. 10:39</a>) With these thoughts in mind it is hoped, not only that those who are now Jehovah’s witnesses will keep a firm hold on the real life, but also that hundreds of thousands, yes, millions of other persons still groping for the light will find it, if it pleases God. Bringing them the light is the great responsibility resting upon Jehovah’s witnesses. They must take the truth and light from the Word of God to the ends of the earth. This they will do by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness right on up to the end of this system of things. Jesus has declared that it will be done. Said he: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963003/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>.</p>

<strong>Foundation for a Righteous New World</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Why was the preliminary step of laying the new world’s foundation A.D. 33 so important? Because it was necessary that the foundation stone for the spiritual “new heavens” be a tried and tested foundation <span id="page68" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="68" data-before-text="68"></span>stone. Such a foundation must square with absolute righteousness. Jesus Christ was tested by his coming to the earth; this testing assured that the superstructure to be built upon the foundation would remain steadfast in righteousness, never turning to crookedness, never leading to disappointment.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The prophet Isaiah foretold that this foundation Stone would be tried and tested: “Here I am laying as a foundation in Zion a stone, a tried stone, the precious corner of a sure foundation.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962080/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 28:16</a>) The apostle Peter, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962080/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:6, 7</a>, makes direct application of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962080/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 28:16</a> to Jesus Christ. How was Jesus “tried” when he was on the earth? He was tempted by the Devil to turn unfaithful, to give in to the lure of unrighteousness. But Jesus resisted every attempt to turn him away from God and his standard of absolute righteousness. Jesus practiced exactly what he preached to others: “Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962080/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 6:33</a>) By meeting the test successfully, Jesus proved his love for God’s kingdom and His righteousness and God could therefore trust him with any responsibility, even that of being the “sure foundation” of the righteous new world. Thus <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962080/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Hebrews 5:8, 9</a> says: “Although he was a Son, he learned obedience from the things he suffered; and after he had been made perfect he became responsible for everlasting salvation to all those obeying him.”</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">That statement by the inspired writer of the book of Hebrews reveals another reason why Jesus came to earth and why the aforementioned event of A.D. 33 was so important. By proving faithful to death as a man Jesus vindicated his Father, and at the same time he provided a basis for “everlasting salvation.” How so? Because “he offered one sacrifice for sins perpetually.” Thus he redeemed or bought back all that unfaithful Adam had lost for his descendants by sinning and losing the right to perfect human life in a righteous world. To redeem those perfect human privileges on a paradise earth for them, the Son of God became a perfect man. If Jesus had not provided a ransom for “all those obeying him,” no superstructure comprised of any of Adam’s descendants could ever be built upon this “sure foundation”; and none of us could have hope for a righteous new world.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">And now in our day the new world is even more sure! Why? Because monumental developments have occurred concerning the “new heavens and a new earth” in our day! This journal has often explained, giving abundant Scriptural evidence, that the year A.D. 1914 marked the time when God enthroned his King Jesus Christ, in fulfillment of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962080/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 2:6</a>: “I, even I, have installed my king upon Zion, my holy mountain.” Did this mean that another major preliminary step to the full-scale laying of the new world’s foundation had taken place, even while Christ’s enemies are still active? Yes, indeed, for God’s command to his King was: “Go subduing in the midst of your enemies.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962080/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 110:2</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Did you know that Abraham looked forward to that time when God’s kingdom by Christ would subdue all enemies of righteousness? The Bible declares: “He was awaiting the city having real foundations, the builder and creator of which city is God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962080/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Heb. 11:10</a>) Do you, like Abraham, look to God and his King for a heavenly government to rule the world in righteousness? The Builder and Creator of the new world has laid as the basis of a stable and enduring government his tried Stone of a “sure foundation,” Jesus Christ the reigning King. Now is the time for men everywhere to realize that God’s foundation Stone is the only hope for everlasting life in an enduring new world of truth and righteousness.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"></p>

<strong>World Ruler Out of the “House of Bread”</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> How wonderful all of this is! This made it possible for Micah’s prophecy concerning the great Ruler out of little Bethlehem to be fulfilled on a larger scale, in our own time. Fully worthy of mention in universal history was the Ruler’s human birth in Bethlehem nineteen centuries ago. Yet his coming out of a Greater Bethlehem in the capacity of an installed Ruler in the established kingdom of God in heaven is still more worthy of mention. It is an event of greater importance to the universe, and especially to mankind, whose blood and flesh the Ruler once shared. Timed by accurate Bible prophecies, this far more important event occurred in our own generation, in the year 1914. Far more than being remembered as the year when the disastrous first world war broke out, 1914 deserves rather to be remembered as the year for the end of the Gentile Times or <span id="page45" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="45" data-before-text="45"></span>“the appointed times of the nations” and for the birth of God’s kingdom in the heavens, as pictorially foretold in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962042/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Revelation, chapter twelve</a>. Concerning the worldly nations that then got into a tumult and concerning the kings of the earth that then took a stand against Jehovah and his newly installed Christ or Anointed One, King David long ago said prophetically, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962042/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Psalm 2:1-9</a>:</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> “Jehovah himself will hold them in derision.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962042/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Gen. 35:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962042/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 29:35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962042/24/2" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> 49:8</a>) For mankind that House of Bread means much, yes, life itself. Mankind needs a minister, a ruler from that Greater House of Bread. What is needed for mankind to live is not mere bread of wheat, barley or rye. Jesus Christ himself emphasized that fact, for, at the close of his forty-day fast, he refused to make miraculous bread for himself, but repeated the words of his heavenly Father and said: “Not by bread alone does man live but by every expression of Jehovah’s mouth does man live.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962042/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Deut. 8:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962042/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Matt. 4:1-4</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> When Jesus came to earth as a man he came bringing the expressions of Jehovah’s mouth, which are life-giving.

The heavenly House of Bread is all-necessary for mankind. They absolutely need Jehovah’s Ruler from there. It is a fruitful place, a fertile place, as indicated by the associated name Ephrathah; and it produces and holds forth much life-sustaining fruitage. As Bethlehem Ephrathah was located in the territory of Judah, so the House of Bread is located in the holy heavens, where Jehovah is lauded by all his hosts of angels.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">20.

<strong>Jehovah Has Become King</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Jehovah God reigns by and through his Son Jesus Christ. So, when Jesus ascended into heaven, forty days after his resurrection, God said to him: “Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.” When that time came the prophetic words were fulfilled: “I, even I, have installed my king upon Zion, my holy mountain. . . . You are my son; I, today, I have become your father. Ask of me, that I may give nations as your inheritance <span id="page311" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="311" data-before-text="311"></span>and the ends of the earth as your own possession.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 2:6-8</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">In keeping with these prophecies Jesus Christ likened himself to a nobleman who went to a far country to receive a kingdom and then returned, thereby clearly tying in the beginning of God’s kingdom with the return of Christ. When was he to return? In answer to that question Jesus gave the prophecies recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 24,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 25,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/12/2" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> Mark 13 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/12/3" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> Luke 21</a>. Among the various evidences marking the sign of his return Jesus listed wars, famine, earthquakes and pestilence. He also foretold that lawlessness would greatly increase and that “this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations.” The facts show that all these words of Jesus are seeing a most striking fulfillment since the year 1914.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Since that year we are also seeing the fulfillment of Paul’s prophecy: “But know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, . . . without self-control, fierce, . . . lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God, having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1-5</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Many scoff, ridicule and mock when such things are brought to their attention, but they cannot point to another period of time in world history when these prophecies have had such thorough-going fulfillment. In fact, their very ridicule is further evidence, for it also was foretold: “In the last days there will come ridiculers with their ridicule, proceeding according to their own desires and saying: ‘Where is this promised presence of his? Why, from the day our forefathers fell asleep in death, all things are continuing exactly as from creation’s beginning.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>KINGDOM ESTABLISHED IN THE HEAVENS</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">That 1914 indeed marks the year Jehovah became King is conclusively proved by the voices in heaven that John in his apocalyptic vision heard: “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will rule as king for ever and ever.” “We thank you, Jehovah God, the Almighty, the one who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and begun ruling as king. But the nations became wrathful, and your own wrath came, and the appointed time . . . to bring to ruin those ruining the earth.” Without doubt, 1914 marks the time when the nations became wrathful as never before.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Rev. 11:15-18</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">What actually took place in the heavens at that time the apostle John goes on to tell. After introducing God’s heavenly organization of angelic creatures under the symbol of “a woman arrayed with the sun,” and Satan the Devil as “a great fiery-colored dragon,” he describes the beginning of God’s kingdom as the birth of a son “who is destined to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod.”</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Since Satan had been ruler of this wicked world or system of things without any interruption since 607 B.C., it is not to be expected that he would let the birth of God’s kingdom take place without putting up a fight. And so we read that “war broke out in heaven: Michael [Jesus Christ] and his angels battled with the dragon, and the dragon and its angels battled but it did not prevail, neither was a place found for them any longer in heaven. So down the great dragon was hurled, the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan, who is misleading the entire inhabited earth; he was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him.” That this conflict was a real fight can be seen from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Daniel 10:13</a>, which tells of an instance where one of God’s angels was held up for <span id="page312" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="312" data-before-text="312"></span>twenty-one days by one of Satan’s demons.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Rev. 12:7-9</a>.</p>

Zion was the capital therefor, and as such was capital of Jehovah’s kingdom over that comparatively small part of the earth. Israel’s kings sat on Jehovah’s throne. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953325/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:23</a>, <em>AS</em>) To and through them there was promised an everlasting rulership, and yet this kingdom which was typical ended in violence in 607 B.C.

And thou, O deadly wounded wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day is come, in the time of the iniquity of the end, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Remove the mitre, and take off the crown; this shall be no more the same; exalt that which is low, and abase that which is high. I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: this also shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953325/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezek. 21:24-27</a>, <em>AS</em>) Thus began the “appointed times of the nations” that were to run for a set length and would terminate with the establishment of the antitypical theocratic kingdom of God over earth, the birth by Jehovah’s great universal organization, his righteous woman Zion, his wife, of the Kingdom man-child. <span id="page274" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="274" data-before-text="274"></span>In the interval until then Zion would be as a barren woman.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="qu"> 3.

While Zion was barren respecting the Kingdom man-child, God’s appointed King sat down, as it were, waiting. “Jehovah saith unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. Jehovah will send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion: Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953325/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1, 2</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="qu"> 4. What timely birth gives importance to the date 1914?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> The setting of Christ Jesus as God’s heavenly King upon his holy hill of heavenly Zion to rule is a bringing forth or birth by Zion: “Yet I have set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. I will tell of the decree: Jehovah said unto me, Thou art my son; this day have I begotten thee. Ask of me, and I will give thee the nations for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953325/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 2:6-8</a>, <em>AS</em>) So the Kingdom is born in heaven by virtue of the heavenly King’s taking his power in Jehovah’s due time. It is a successful birth, a timely one. It is the cause for the greatest rejoicing by the Father, the mother, the King of the newly born rule, and by all recognizing it and being for it. Christ Jesus looked forward to that time, and of this Paul the apostle states: “Jesus. For the joy that was set before him he endured a torture stake, despising shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953325/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Heb. 12:2</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu"> 5.

In reading Revelation’s prophecy, have in mind God’s woman-organization and her Kingdom man-child. “And a great sign was seen in heaven, a woman arrayed with the sun, and the moon was beneath her feet, and on her head was a crown of twelve stars, and she was pregnant. And she cries out in her pains and in her agony to give birth. And she gave birth to a son, a male, who is destined to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod. And her child was caught away to God and to his throne. And I heard what was as a voice of a great crowd and as a sound of many waters and as a sound of heavy thunders. They said: ‘Praise Jah, you people, because Jehovah our God, the Almighty, has begun to rule as king. Let us rejoice and be overjoyed, and let us give him the glory, because the marriage of the Lamb has arrived and his wife has prepared herself.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953325/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rev. 12:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953325/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953325/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 19:6, 7</a>, <em>NW</em>) Thus the birth of the man-child ends the barrenness of God’s woman as to his Kingdom rule over earth. There is work to be done under the heavenly Kingdom organization respecting Christians and all persons of good will and honest heart who may become Christians, that is, who may join in what should now be the order of the day, namely, the worship of Jehovah.

<strong>Son(s) of God</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><strong><em>Individual Israelite ‘sons.’</em></strong> God also designated certain individuals within Israel as his ‘sons,’ in a special sense. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Psalm 2</a>, attributed to David at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Acts 4:24-26</a>, evidently applies to him initially when speaking of God’s “son.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Ps 2:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/42/1" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 7-12</a>) The psalm was later fulfilled in Christ Jesus, as the context in Acts shows. Since the context in the psalm shows that God is speaking, not to a baby, but to a grown man, in saying, “You are my son; I, today, I have become your father,” it follows that David’s entry into such sonship resulted from God’s special selection of him for the kingship and from God’s fatherly dealings with him. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Ps 89:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/43/1" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> 19-27</a>.)

<strong>Son(s) of God</strong><br/><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">However, about 30 years after his birth as a human, when he was immersed by John the Baptizer, God’s spirit came upon Jesus and God spoke, saying: “You are my Son, the beloved; I have approved you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/107/0" data-bid="108-1" class="b">Lu 3:21-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/107/1" data-bid="108-2" class="b"> Mt 3:16, 17</a>) Evidently Jesus, the man, was then “born again” as a spirit-begotten Son with the hope of returning to life in heaven, and he was anointed by spirit to be God’s appointed king and high priest. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/108/0" data-bid="109-1" class="b">Joh 3:3-6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/108/1" data-bid="109-2" class="b"> compare 17:4, 5</a>; see <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/13">JESUS CHRIST</a> [His Baptism].)

<strong>Do You Effectively Reason From the Scriptures?</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Paul introduced Jesus as an offspring of David and as one identified by John the <span id="page30" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="30" data-before-text="30"></span>Baptizer, whom the people generally acknowledged to have been a prophet of God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986167/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Acts 13:22-25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986167/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Luke 20:4-6</a>) But Paul knew that his audience was aware that Jesus had been rejected by the rulers in Jerusalem, so the apostle himself brought this matter up and explained that even the rejection and execution of Jesus were in fulfillment of prophecy. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986167/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Acts 13:27-29</a>) He pointed out that God himself had then acted on behalf of Jesus by raising him from the dead and that there were eyewitnesses among the Jews of the fact that Jesus had been raised. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986167/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Acts 13:30, 31</a>) Paul was well aware that this could be a difficult matter for many to accept, so he explained that what he was talking about was “the good news about the promise made to the forefathers.” He demonstrated that this was the case, quoting first from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986167/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Psalm 2:7</a>, then <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986167/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:3</a>, and finally <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986167/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Psalm 16:10</a>. He reasoned on the last of those texts, showing that it could not have been fulfilled in David because he “did see corruption.” So it must apply to the one who “did not see corruption” because of having been raised up from the dead by God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986167/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Acts 13:32-37</a>) Having presented that point, Paul delivered a motivating conclusion.

The King then refers to his title to the kingship, for God has said to him: “Ask of me, that I may give nations as your inheritance and the ends of the earth as your own possession.” He has the inheritance as the one whom God has made firstborn; all he has to do is request it, which he does because of his great desire to carry out God’s will toward the earth.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979042/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 2:7, 8</a>.</p>

<strong>Do We Need a Priesthood?</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">But Jesus was not of the tribe of Levi, the priestly tribe, and of the family of Aaron, through whose line the priesthood ran.

So too the Christ did not glorify himself by becoming a high priest, but was glorified by him who spoke with reference to him: ‘You are my son; I, today, I have become your father.’ Just as he says also in another place: ‘You are a priest forever according to the manner of Melchizedek.’”</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">By resurrecting Jesus Christ from the dead, Almighty God fulfilled those words quoted from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974167/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 2:7</a> as written by David. Thus God became an everlasting Father to the resurrected Jesus Christ, and this one, being raised incorruptible, became the everlasting Son of his heavenly Life-Giver, Jehovah God.

It is the Hebrew word <em>hhil,</em> which, according to Hebrew authorities, means basically, “to have labor pains.” The form of this verb in the Hebrew text here has a sort of reflexive force in which the performer of the act suffers the accompanying sensations. In other words, he experiences the labor pains or childbirth pains. That is why the word is also defined as “to bring forth (in pain).”—Young’s <em>Analytical Concordance to the Bible.</em></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">This same word is found at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:18</a>, which reads: “The Rock who fathered you, you proceeded to forget, and you began to leave God out of memory, the One bringing you forth with childbirth pains,” without doubt referring to the miracles Jehovah wrought in Egypt in connection with the deliverance of the nation of Israel. Also, we find this Hebrew term at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Isaiah 51:2</a>, where we read: “Look to Abraham your father and to Sarah who gradually brought you forth with childbirth pains.” Also at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Proverbs 25:23</a>: “The wind from the north brings forth as with labor pains a downpour.”</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">From the foregoing references we can see the use of these words particularly in poetic writing, and we see that they are full of meaning, expressive indeed. Modern translations hide the force of these expressions by their free renderings.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Regarding the use of these terms in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Psalm 90:2</a>, it might be said that, judged by human standards, the producing of this earth and the productive land with all its complicated mechanisms and chemistry would certainly call for a great deal of effort, painful effort, as measured even by scientists today. The psalmist here speaks from a purely human standpoint and thereby shows both an active imagination and great respect for the amount of work involved for Jehovah to create these things; with what expenditure of time, of course, we do not know.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"></p>

<strong>World Ruler Out of the “House of Bread”</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> How wonderful all of this is! This made it possible for Micah’s prophecy concerning the great Ruler out of little Bethlehem to be fulfilled on a larger scale, in our own time. Fully worthy of mention in universal history was the Ruler’s human birth in Bethlehem nineteen centuries ago. Yet his coming out of a Greater Bethlehem in the capacity of an installed Ruler in the established kingdom of God in heaven is still more worthy of mention. It is an event of greater importance to the universe, and especially to mankind, whose blood and flesh the Ruler once shared. Timed by accurate Bible prophecies, this far more important event occurred in our own generation, in the year 1914. Far more than being remembered as the year when the disastrous first world war broke out, 1914 deserves rather to be remembered as the year for the end of the Gentile Times or <span id="page45" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="45" data-before-text="45"></span>“the appointed times of the nations” and for the birth of God’s kingdom in the heavens, as pictorially foretold in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962042/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Revelation, chapter twelve</a>. Concerning the worldly nations that then got into a tumult and concerning the kings of the earth that then took a stand against Jehovah and his newly installed Christ or Anointed One, King David long ago said prophetically, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962042/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Psalm 2:1-9</a>:</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> “Jehovah himself will hold them in derision.

Ask of me, that I may give nations as your inheritance and the ends of the earth as your own possession. You will break them with an iron scepter, as though a potter’s vessel you will dash them to pieces.’”</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">17, 18. (a) At his installation how did Jesus come out of a Greater Bethlehem? (b) According to Jesus’ own statements, what greater bread does all mankind need?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> When the foretold Ruler was installed in the Kingdom at God’s right hand, then he came out to Jehovah God from a Bethlehem of an importance greater than that of earthly Bethlehem. The name Bethlehem means House of Bread. Ephrathah, with which Bethlehem is connected, means Fruitful; Fertility. Judah, in the territory of which Bethlehem Ephrathah was located, means [Jehovah-] Lauded. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962042/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Gen. 35:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962042/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 29:35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962042/24/2" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> 49:8</a>) For mankind that House of Bread means much, yes, life itself. Mankind needs a minister, a ruler from that Greater House of Bread. What is needed for mankind to live is not mere bread of wheat, barley or rye. Jesus Christ himself emphasized that fact, for, at the close of his forty-day fast, he refused to make miraculous bread for himself, but repeated the words of his heavenly Father and said: “Not by bread alone does man live but by every expression of Jehovah’s mouth does man live.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962042/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Deut. 8:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962042/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Matt. 4:1-4</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> When Jesus came to earth as a man he came bringing the expressions of Jehovah’s mouth, which are life-giving. Also, he said to those who came looking for perishable earthly bread: “I am the living bread that came down from heaven; if anyone eats of this bread he will live forever; and, for a fact, the bread that I shall give is my flesh in behalf of the life of the world.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962042/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">John 6:51</a>.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">19. How was it possible for Jesus to come out of a Greater House of Bread for mankind in 1914, and how do the names Ephrathah and Judah associated with Bethlehem reflect on this House of Bread?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> When Jesus returned to heaven and reappeared in God’s presence, he presented the value of his fleshly human sacrifice in behalf of the dying race of mankind. So now, after being installed as King in 1914, Jesus could come forth from a House of Bread, a Bread Supply, that can give to all who eat of it by faith on earth everlasting life in God’s new world. The heavenly House of Bread is all-necessary for mankind. They absolutely need Jehovah’s Ruler from there. It is a fruitful place, a fertile place, as indicated by the associated name Ephrathah; and it produces and holds forth much life-sustaining fruitage. As Bethlehem Ephrathah was located in the territory of Judah, so the House of Bread is located in the holy heavens, where Jehovah is lauded by all his hosts of angels.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">20. How is this Greater Bethlehem out of which Jesus Christ comes like the earthly Bethlehem in relationship to the thousands of Judah?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> Chief among those heavenly praisers of Jehovah God is the Ruler out of Bethlehem. As Ruler he will teach all his subjects on earth to praise Jehovah too. He comes forth to Jehovah God as the representative of a small group, a representative not of earthly Bethlehem but of the house of his spiritual brothers. These are the 144,000 footstep followers who become joint heirs with him in the heavenly Kingdom. <span id="page46" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="46" data-before-text="46"></span>(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962042/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Rev. 7:4-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962042/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 14:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962042/27/2" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> 3</a>) Among the ten thousand times ten thousand of heavenly hosts, such a group is small indeed, almost too small to be thought worth numbering among the vast host of heavenly praisers.

They become God’s capital organization over all His universal organization. They will serve in bringing the “bread of life” to mankind that is starving for eternal life. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962042/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">John 6:48-50</a>) Jesus Christ, the Ruler out of this Greater Bethlehem, will thus fulfill an important role among the countless thousands of angelic praisers of God in the heavens.</p>

Nevertheless, the true unity should be found among this “little flock,” this little thing or organization of today, the same as in the first century of our Common Era. Hence we waste our time and look the wrong way by looking at that big organization, Christendom swollen with hundreds of millions of members, for <span id="page751" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="751" data-before-text="751"></span>the exhibition of true unity for all mankind.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="qu">11, 12.

The Leader and Head of the “little flock” himself prayed to God that its unity might persist.

Also I have given them the glory which you have given me, in order that they may be one just as we are one.

Because it was not for Christendom of more than a thousand sects that Jesus Christ was praying. He was not praying for persons guilty of falling away from the truth and persons who follow men speaking twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves and from Christ. He was praying for the continuous unity of his little flock as it took in more spiritual sheep into the fold under Christ as their Shepherd.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="qu">14.

So in his prayer he said: “I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world and I am coming to you. Holy Father, watch over them out of respect for your own name which you have given me, in order that they may be one just as we are. . . . now I am coming to you, and I am speaking these things in the world in order that they may have my joy in themselves to the full.

<strong>Jehovah Has Become King</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Jehovah God reigns by and through his Son Jesus Christ. So, when Jesus ascended into heaven, forty days after his resurrection, God said to him: “Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.” When that time came the prophetic words were fulfilled: “I, even I, have installed my king upon Zion, my holy mountain. . . . You are my son; I, today, I have become your father. Ask of me, that I may give nations as your inheritance <span id="page311" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="311" data-before-text="311"></span>and the ends of the earth as your own possession.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 2:6-8</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">In keeping with these prophecies Jesus Christ likened himself to a nobleman who went to a far country to receive a kingdom and then returned, thereby clearly tying in the beginning of God’s kingdom with the return of Christ. When was he to return? In answer to that question Jesus gave the prophecies recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 24,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 25,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/12/2" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> Mark 13 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/12/3" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> Luke 21</a>. Among the various evidences marking the sign of his return Jesus listed wars, famine, earthquakes and pestilence. He also foretold that lawlessness would greatly increase and that “this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations.” The facts show that all these words of Jesus are seeing a most striking fulfillment since the year 1914.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Since that year we are also seeing the fulfillment of Paul’s prophecy: “But know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, . . . without self-control, fierce, . . . lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God, having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1-5</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Many scoff, ridicule and mock when such things are brought to their attention, but they cannot point to another period of time in world history when these prophecies have had such thorough-going fulfillment. In fact, their very ridicule is further evidence, for it also was foretold: “In the last days there will come ridiculers with their ridicule, proceeding according to their own desires and saying: ‘Where is this promised presence of his? Why, from the day our forefathers fell asleep in death, all things are continuing exactly as from creation’s beginning.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>KINGDOM ESTABLISHED IN THE HEAVENS</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">That 1914 indeed marks the year Jehovah became King is conclusively proved by the voices in heaven that John in his apocalyptic vision heard: “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will rule as king for ever and ever.” “We thank you, Jehovah God, the Almighty, the one who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and begun ruling as king. But the nations became wrathful, and your own wrath came, and the appointed time . . . to bring to ruin those ruining the earth.” Without doubt, 1914 marks the time when the nations became wrathful as never before.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Rev. 11:15-18</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">What actually took place in the heavens at that time the apostle John goes on to tell. After introducing God’s heavenly organization of angelic creatures under the symbol of “a woman arrayed with the sun,” and Satan the Devil as “a great fiery-colored dragon,” he describes the beginning of God’s kingdom as the birth of a son “who is destined to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod.”</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Since Satan had been ruler of this wicked world or system of things without any interruption since 607 B.C., it is not to be expected that he would let the birth of God’s kingdom take place without putting up a fight. And so we read that “war broke out in heaven: Michael [Jesus Christ] and his angels battled with the dragon, and the dragon and its angels battled but it did not prevail, neither was a place found for them any longer in heaven. So down the great dragon was hurled, the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan, who is misleading the entire inhabited earth; he was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him.” That this conflict was a real fight can be seen from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Daniel 10:13</a>, which tells of an instance where one of God’s angels was held up for <span id="page312" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="312" data-before-text="312"></span>twenty-one days by one of Satan’s demons.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Rev. 12:7-9</a>.</p>

He is the one with whom Jehovah, the Ancient of Days, has made a covenant for a kingdom, as pictured by the covenant for the kingdom made with King David, David being a prophetic picture of Jesus Christ. Through the inspired King David, Jehovah had prophetically invited his Son Jesus Christ to ask of Him at the right time for the nations as his inheritance and the ends of the earth as his own possession. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959606/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 2:7, 8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959606/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Acts 4:24-26</a>) The time is the close of the “appointed times of the nations” in 1914. Now, at the time for which Jesus Christ had waited in heaven, he appears in the court of the Ancient of Days. He asks the Judge for the things that are due to him according to the covenant for the kingdom over all the earth. All the evidence visible and spiritual proves that he was given the dominion over all earth’s inhabitants, to fulfill Daniel’s vision.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu">32.

According to the vision, the symbolic fourth beast, namely, the Anglo-American dual world power and the other ten “horns” or “kings” that sprang from the Roman Empire and that are still claiming sovereignty and maintaining themselves on earth, must be destroyed. They must disappear as if hurled into a fiery lake that burns with sulphur.

Alexander the Great died at Babylon in 323 B.C. Turning Babylonish, he had wanted to make Babylon the capital of his empire, but God’s decree was against Babylon. Persia, too, has had a continuous history since Alexander’s death, down to the kingdom of Iran today. Alexander’s successor, General Seleucus Nicator, who died in 280 B.C., transferred his capital from Babylon to Seleucia in Syria, a new city that he had built. Greece has kept its existence till today, and the Republic of Iraq occupies the territory of ancient Babylon.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">34.

How, then, can the mighty seventh world power and the terrifying Communist power and all other political powers of men, all of them being lower than the angels, succeed on earth? How can they win out against the divine will that Jehovah’s kingdom by Christ should take over exclusive control and possession of the earth? The Most High God was able to control and regulate superhuman, angelic creatures. He has held onto his position of Most High and Almighty even among legions of enemy angels, the demons. He tolerated Satan the Devil up in heaven for about 5,938 years. With all his diabolical opposition during all that time, where and how high has the Devil got by this year 1959? As high as God’s <span id="page111" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="111" data-before-text="111"></span>footstool, the earth, down to which the Devil was violently ousted from heaven since 1914.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Down here, in rage at his humiliation, he eggs on men to a race into outer space to see how high they can get, for selfish advantages, without regard for God’s will.

Since 1914 he has given this earth to theocracy, to the rule of God by Jesus Christ, not by the priests and clergy of Christendom.

Let them fight against Christ’s acceptance of God’s invitation and taking over the earth.

In 1914 Jesus Christ had on his hands a bigger fight than one with Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany or with Czar Nicholas II of Russia.

Let us rejoice and be overjoyed, and let us give him the glory, because the marriage of the Lamb has arrived and his wife has prepared herself.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953325/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rev. 12:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953325/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953325/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 19:6, 7</a>, <em>NW</em>) Thus the birth of the man-child ends the barrenness of God’s woman as to his Kingdom rule over earth. There is work to be done under the heavenly Kingdom organization respecting Christians and all persons of good will and honest heart who may become Christians, that is, who may join in what should now be the order of the day, namely, the worship of Jehovah.

Shall a land be born in one day? shall a nation be brought forth at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children. Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith Jehovah: shall I that cause to bring forth shut the womb? saith thy God. Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn over her; that ye may suck and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.

<strong>Evidences of the Year’s Correctness</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Right after speaking of the “appointed times of the nations”, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952323/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 21:24</a> (<em>NW</em>), Jesus makes a key revelation at the 27th <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952323/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Lu 21 verse 27</a> by saying: “And <em>then</em> they will see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.” The coming of the Son of man in the clouds with power was the great sign of the sovereign-empowered Messiah or Christ spoken of by <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952323/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Daniel (7:13, 14</a>) and which the priests and Pharisees were looking for during Jesus’ ministry on earth. But as to Christ’s first presence Jesus said the only sign they would get would be that of Jonah the prophet. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952323/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 12:39</a>, <em>NW</em>) However, when Jesus was being tried before the Jewish Sanhedrin on the false charge of blasphemy the high priest said, “By the living God I put you under oath to tell us whether you are the Christ the Son of God!” Jesus said to him: “That was for you to say. Yet I say to you men, From <em>henceforth</em> you will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952323/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 26:63, 64</a>, <em>NW</em>) Here Jesus openly admitted that as the Christ he would make a second presence as to affairs of the earth after a waiting period at God’s right hand. “Jehovah saith unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952323/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1</a>, <em>AS</em>) The waiting period ended at the conclusion of the “appointed times of the nations” in 1914, his enemies were put where they belong under his feet, and from then has been seen the sign of the sovereign-empowered <span id="page274" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="274" data-before-text="274"></span>Christ coming on the clouds of heaven.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 6. What information is obtained from Bible prophecies as to the enthronement of Christ Jesus in 1914?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Time had come in the fall of 1914 for Jehovah the Universal Sovereign himself to act! Action on a global scale, yes, on a universal scale, was due to take place. The waiting period was over, and now the desire of all righteous ones came. Christ Jesus, the proved and tested new world’s King, was enthroned and empowered with sovereignty from on high. At last the kingdom of heaven was established in the person of its anointed ruler, Christ the King. Now for the first time in nearly six thousand years there is in existence, as respects the entire earth, a new theocratic government with ruling right from God the true Sovereign. What tremendous good this bodes for righteous mankind! “The Eternal’s [Jehovah’s, <em>AS</em>] edict let me tell: ‘I, I have installed my king on Sion, on my sacred hill.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952323/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 2:6, 7</a>, <em>Mo</em>) The Bible even gives us a glimpse of the glorious enthronement proceedings which occurred in 1914. “I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like unto a son of man [Christ Jesus, and he came even to the ancient of days [Jehovah God], and they brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952323/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Dan. 7:13, 14</a>, <em>AS</em>) Thus about October 1, 1914, just 2,520 years after the last vestige of typical Jewish sovereignty expired, the “iron and bronze band” of abeyance was removed from the “tree stump” and once again divine sovereignty empowered a theocratic government to take over the control of the entire earth. The “lowest of mankind”, Christ Jesus, was now exalted with kingdom right forever. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952323/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isa. 53:7-9</a>) What joy there was in heaven! “And loud voices occurred in heaven saying: ‘The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will rule as king for ever and ever.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952323/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Rev. 11:15</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 7. What events occurred in heaven upon the establishment of the Kingdom?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> The establishment of the kingdom of heaven immediately set in motion a chain of events both in heaven and on earth. These events were to occur in a transition period during which a great tribulation would come upon Satan’s entire organization leading up to the final test of power at Armageddon which results in its utter defeat and destruction. The birth of the Kingdom government in 1914 is likened to God’s woman, his organization Zion, bringing forth a male child whom Satan’s dragonlike organization is seeking to destroy. “And the dragon kept standing before the woman who was about to give birth, that, when she did give birth, it might devour her child. And she gave birth to a son, a male, who is destined to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod. And her child was caught away to God and to his throne.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952323/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rev. 12:4, 5</a>, <em>NW</em>) From this scripture we see that the Kingdom has a safe empowerment of sovereignty and that it is destined to take violent action in breaking up all opposing governments on earth as with a rod of iron. But wait! The false sovereign behind these nations still in heaven must be dealt with first. The Scripture next says: “And war broke out in heaven: Michael [Christ Jesus] and his angels battled with the dragon, and the dragon and its angels battled but it did not prevail, neither was a place found for them any longer in heaven. So down the great dragon was hurled, the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan, who is misleading the entire inhabited earth; he was <span id="page275" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="275" data-before-text="275"></span>hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him. And I heard a loud voice in heaven say: ‘Now have come to pass the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952323/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Rev. 12:7-10</a>, <em>NW.</em></p>

<strong>God’s Kingdom Purpose Triumphs</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Then the King Jesus Christ himself speaks: “Let me refer to the decree of Jehovah [God had already made with his Son a covenant for the Kingdom]; he has said to me: ‘You are my son; I, today, I have become your father.’” The King, then, is God’s own Son, the one holding the position closest to Him, his tried and loyal, reliable One. The King then refers to his title to the kingship, for God has said to him: “Ask of me, that I may give nations as your inheritance and the ends of the earth as your own possession.” He has the inheritance as the one whom God has made firstborn; all he has to do is request it, which he does because of his great desire to carry out God’s will toward the earth.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979042/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 2:7, 8</a>.</p>

<strong>God’s Kingdom Purpose Triumphs</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Then the King Jesus Christ himself speaks: “Let me refer to the decree of Jehovah [God had already made with his Son a covenant for the Kingdom]; he has said to me: ‘You are my son; I, today, I have become your father.’” The King, then, is God’s own Son, the one holding the position closest to Him, his tried and loyal, reliable One. The King then refers to his title to the kingship, for God has said to him: “Ask of me, that I may give nations as your inheritance and the ends of the earth as your own possession.” He has the inheritance as the one whom God has made firstborn; all he has to do is request it, which he does because of his great desire to carry out God’s will toward the earth.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979042/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 2:7, 8</a>.</p>

<strong>The One Government for One World Under God’s Sovereignty</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> That was the miniature fulfillment of the prophetic words of King David in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975761/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 2:1, 2</a>.

Satan the rebel sovereign has had his day in the bruising of the heel of the promised “Seed” of God’s “woman.” Now this Great Serpent, the heel bruiser, must have his own head bruised, and that affects all the “seed” of this Serpent at the same time. The same Second <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975761/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 2</a> indicates how the crushing of the visible “seed” of the Great Serpent would be done.

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page451" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="451" data-before-text="451"></span><strong>“Happy Are the Mild-tempered Ones”</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHAT food for thought is found in the “beatitudes” or felicities, the “happinesses” that Jesus Christ spoke in his Sermon on the Mount! We can study and ponder over them with much profit to mind and heart, for they are literally loaded with divine wisdom, inspired prophecy and right principles. All such is true, for example, of the third of these felicities, “Happy are the mild-tempered ones, since they will inherit the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966560/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 5:5</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What does it mean to be mild-tempered, and who are the mild-tempered ones that will inherit the earth? To be mild-tempered is to exercise gentleness in conduct or action, not being harsh or unfeeling. The Greek word here rendered “mild-tempered” is <em>praús.</em> It has the meaning of gentleness coupled with power; strength under control. It is a word that is also used to describe a wild animal that has been tamed.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Who are the mild-tempered that will inherit the earth? Certainly they would include Jesus Christ himself, for, above all men that ever lived on this earth, he was mild-tempered. As he himself said: “Come to me, . . . for I am mild-tempered.” Concerning him and his triumphal ride into Jerusalem, it was written: “Look! Your King is coming to you, mild-tempered.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966560/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 11:28, 29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966560/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 21:5</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">That Jesus Christ, as the preeminent mild-tempered one, will inherit the earth other scriptures make clear. Jehovah God has appointed him to be “heir of all things,” including this earth. In fact, ‘the nations are to be his inheritance, and the ends of the earth his possession.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966560/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb. 1:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966560/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ps. 2:7, 8</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">This inheritance Jesus Christ shares, even as he does his Kingdom rule, with his anointed footstep followers, for they are to be “heirs indeed of God, but joint heirs with Christ.” These are the ones the apostle John saw in vision standing upon heavenly Mount Zion and who number 144,000.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966560/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rom. 8:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966560/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Rev. 14:1</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">While the statement “happy are the mild-tempered ones” is thus seen to have specific and primary application to Jesus Christ and his Kingdom associates, it, nevertheless, states a principle that has wider application. As the psalmist David wrote: “Just a little while longer, and the wicked one will be no more; and you will certainly give attention to his place, and he will not be. But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966560/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 37:10, 11</a>.</p>

<strong>The Kingdom of God in the Hands of Christ</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">That Christ is no “puppet ruler” can be seen from his own words, after his resurrection and just prior to ascending to Jehovah’s heavenly courts, when he told his disciples: “All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966161/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 28:18</a>) For that reason the command is given in Daniel’s vision that “the peoples, national groups and languages should all serve even him.” Christ, therefore, derives none of his power from the “consent of the governed,” as in a democracy or earthly <span id="page135" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="135" data-before-text="135"></span>limited monarchy, but derives it directly from the true Source of Authority, Jehovah God. He obtained this authority by making request to his Father, in fulfillment of God’s invitation expressed at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966161/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 2:8, 9</a>: <em>“Ask</em> of me, that I may give nations as your inheritance and the ends of the earth as your own possession. You will break them with an iron scepter, as though a potter’s vessel you will dash them to pieces.”</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">In one of his parables Jesus pictured himself as a “certain man of noble birth [who] traveled to a distant land [that is, to heaven] to secure kingly power for himself and to return.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966161/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Luke 19:12</a>) He showed that his kingship would be rejected by the majority of earth’s inhabitants, however, when he added: “But his citizens hated him and sent out a body of ambassadors after him, to say, ‘We do not want this man to become king over us.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966161/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Lu 19 Vs. 14</a>) Because of just such opposition to his divinely invested authority, the King Christ Jesus will be obliged to dash earthly governments to pieces in the coming war of Armageddon.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966161/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Dan. 2:44;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966161/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Rev. 16:14-16</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">But Jesus said that all authority was given to him, not only on the earth, but also “in heaven.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966161/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matt. 28:18</a>) What does this mean? Does it make him the Absolute Monarch of all the universe?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Christ’s authority in the heavens is shown in the statement at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966161/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Philippians 2:10</a> that “in the name of Jesus every knee should bend of those <em>in heaven</em> and those on earth and those under the ground.” As with all of earth’s inhabitants, so, too, the millions of God’s angelic sons are all subject to Christ’s rule. (See also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966161/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:4-6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966161/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 13, 14</a>.) Yet One in the heavens is excepted, and this places the only limitation on Christ’s kingship. For this reason the next <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966161/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">verse 11 of Philippians chapter two</a> adds: “And every tongue should openly acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord <em>to the glory of God the Father.”</em>—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966161/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Phil. 2:11</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Yes, though all others in God’s universe are subject to the Son’s rule, Christ Jesus himself remains subject to his Father and God, the sole Absolute Monarch. As the apostle Paul explains: “God ‘subjected all things under his [Christ’s] feet.’ But when he says that ‘all things have been subjected,’ it is evident that it is with the exception of the one who subjected all things to him. But when all things will have been subjected to him, then the Son himself will also subject himself to the One who subjected all things to him, that God may be all things to everyone.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966161/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:27, 28</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Throughout all time and space Jehovah God will continue to be the sole and legitimate Sovereign Ruler. What good purpose, then, is there in his having his Son represent him and serve as the anointed Executor of God’s will? Certainly it is not to relieve Jehovah of responsibility or to reduce in any way his work. How could that be, when he continues to be the very Source of all his Son’s power? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966161/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Isa. 40:28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966161/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Heb. 1:8</a>) Evidently, then, this arrangement is an expression of Jehovah’s wonderful love whereby he extends this grand privilege to his Son. His Son has been trained at his Father’s right hand; he has been tested to the limit, perfected for the position; he has the ability and the wisdom required for the task. Now his Father lovingly exalts him to a position that allows this Son to use these assets to the widest possible extent and for the greatest good of all. He displays absolute confidence in him, knowing that his Son’s proven attitude is: “To do your will, O my God, I have delighted, and your law is within my inward parts.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966161/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ps. 40:8</a>; see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966161/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Hebrews 5:7-9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966161/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 10:5-7</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">At the same time this arrangement vindicates Jehovah’s position as the true Sovereign, which was challenged by Satan from the time of the historic rebellion in <span id="page136" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="136" data-before-text="136"></span>Eden forward. How false the Opposer’s claim that he could achieve and legitimately maintain the position of a rival sovereign by inciting men to act independently of God and by even creating disaffection among some of God’s heavenly sons! What a crushing defeat that one experienced when God’s Son on earth rejected his every temptation and endured all of Satan’s insidious efforts to crack his integrity, dying loyal to his Father’s sovereignty! Though Satan has set himself up as the “ruler of this world,” by his integrity-keeping course Christ Jesus “conquered the world” and has proved its ruler to be worthy only of destruction.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966161/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Job 1:6-11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966161/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> Rev. 12:3, 4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966161/28/2" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> John 12:31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966161/28/3" data-bid="29-4" class="b"> 16:33</a>.</p>

<strong>Jehovah Has Become King</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Jehovah God reigns by and through his Son Jesus Christ. So, when Jesus ascended into heaven, forty days after his resurrection, God said to him: “Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.” When that time came the prophetic words were fulfilled: “I, even I, have installed my king upon Zion, my holy mountain. . . . You are my son; I, today, I have become your father. Ask of me, that I may give nations as your inheritance <span id="page311" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="311" data-before-text="311"></span>and the ends of the earth as your own possession.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 2:6-8</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">In keeping with these prophecies Jesus Christ likened himself to a nobleman who went to a far country to receive a kingdom and then returned, thereby clearly tying in the beginning of God’s kingdom with the return of Christ. When was he to return? In answer to that question Jesus gave the prophecies recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 24,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 25,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/12/2" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> Mark 13 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/12/3" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> Luke 21</a>. Among the various evidences marking the sign of his return Jesus listed wars, famine, earthquakes and pestilence. He also foretold that lawlessness would greatly increase and that “this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations.” The facts show that all these words of Jesus are seeing a most striking fulfillment since the year 1914.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Since that year we are also seeing the fulfillment of Paul’s prophecy: “But know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, . . . without self-control, fierce, . . . lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God, having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1-5</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Many scoff, ridicule and mock when such things are brought to their attention, but they cannot point to another period of time in world history when these prophecies have had such thorough-going fulfillment. In fact, their very ridicule is further evidence, for it also was foretold: “In the last days there will come ridiculers with their ridicule, proceeding according to their own desires and saying: ‘Where is this promised presence of his? Why, from the day our forefathers fell asleep in death, all things are continuing exactly as from creation’s beginning.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>KINGDOM ESTABLISHED IN THE HEAVENS</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">That 1914 indeed marks the year Jehovah became King is conclusively proved by the voices in heaven that John in his apocalyptic vision heard: “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will rule as king for ever and ever.” “We thank you, Jehovah God, the Almighty, the one who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and begun ruling as king. But the nations became wrathful, and your own wrath came, and the appointed time . . . to bring to ruin those ruining the earth.” Without doubt, 1914 marks the time when the nations became wrathful as never before.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Rev. 11:15-18</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">What actually took place in the heavens at that time the apostle John goes on to tell. After introducing God’s heavenly organization of angelic creatures under the symbol of “a woman arrayed with the sun,” and Satan the Devil as “a great fiery-colored dragon,” he describes the beginning of God’s kingdom as the birth of a son “who is destined to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod.”</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Since Satan had been ruler of this wicked world or system of things without any interruption since 607 B.C., it is not to be expected that he would let the birth of God’s kingdom take place without putting up a fight. And so we read that “war broke out in heaven: Michael [Jesus Christ] and his angels battled with the dragon, and the dragon and its angels battled but it did not prevail, neither was a place found for them any longer in heaven. So down the great dragon was hurled, the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan, who is misleading the entire inhabited earth; he was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him.” That this conflict was a real fight can be seen from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Daniel 10:13</a>, which tells of an instance where one of God’s angels was held up for <span id="page312" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="312" data-before-text="312"></span>twenty-one days by one of Satan’s demons.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Rev. 12:7-9</a>.</p>

You shall break them with a rod of iron, and dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.” So this is what Christ has received from his Father, authority over the nations to smash them at Armageddon, and this same authority is extended to the resurrected anointed ones now with Christ in heaven.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956774/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 2:8, 9</a>, <em>RS.</em></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The same truth is understood in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956774/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 17:12-14</a> (<em>NW</em>): “And the ten horns that you saw mean ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom, but they do receive authority as kings one hour with the wild beast.

For the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly, but powerful by God for overturning strongly entrenched things. For we are overturning reasonings and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and we are bringing every thought into captivity to make it obedient to the Christ.” Jehovah’s earthly witnesses, whether of the heavenly or of the earthly class, expose religious falsehood, point the way to true worship, and warn the unrepentant nations of their coming smashup at Armageddon. Only the invisible heavenly forces with Christ, including the resurrected anointed ones, fight at Armageddon and dash the nations to pieces like a potter’s vessel.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956774/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Cor. 10:3-5</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"></p>

Zion was the capital therefor, and as such was capital of Jehovah’s kingdom over that comparatively small part of the earth. Israel’s kings sat on Jehovah’s throne.

And thou, O deadly wounded wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day is come, in the time of the iniquity of the end, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Remove the mitre, and take off the crown; this shall be no more the same; exalt that which is low, and abase that which is high.

While Zion was barren respecting the Kingdom man-child, God’s appointed King sat down, as it were, waiting. “Jehovah saith unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. Jehovah will send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion: Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953325/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1, 2</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="qu"> 4.

It is a successful birth, a timely one. It is the cause for the greatest rejoicing by the Father, the mother, the King of the newly born rule, and by all recognizing it and being for it. Christ Jesus looked forward to that time, and of this Paul the apostle states: “Jesus. For the joy that was set before him he endured a torture stake, despising shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953325/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Heb. 12:2</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu"> 5.

In reading Revelation’s prophecy, have in mind God’s woman-organization and her Kingdom man-child. “And a great sign was seen in heaven, a woman arrayed with the sun, and the moon was beneath her feet, and on her head was a crown of twelve stars, and she was pregnant. And she cries out in her pains and in her agony to give birth. And she gave birth to a son, a male, who is destined to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod. And her child was caught away to God and to his throne. And I heard what was as a voice of a great crowd and as a sound of many waters and as a sound of heavy thunders. They said: ‘Praise Jah, you people, because Jehovah our God, the Almighty, has begun to rule as king. Let us rejoice and be overjoyed, and let us give him the glory, because the marriage of the Lamb has arrived and his wife has prepared herself.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953325/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rev. 12:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953325/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953325/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 19:6, 7</a>, <em>NW</em>) Thus the birth of the man-child ends the barrenness of God’s woman as to his Kingdom rule over earth. There is work to be done under the heavenly Kingdom organization respecting Christians and all persons of good will and honest heart who may become Christians, that is, who may join in what should now be the order of the day, namely, the worship of Jehovah.

Jesus refused to interfere with God’s allowance of “seven times” for Gentile domination. So he did not then “restore again the kingdom to Israel”. He prophesied that they would run their full length, which would be till the fall of A.D. 1914. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950923/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">John 19:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950923/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Acts 1:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950923/21/2" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> Luke 21:24</a>) “But this man offered one sacrifice for sins perpetually and sat down at the right hand of God, from then on awaiting until his enemies should be made a stool for his feet.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950923/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Heb. 10:12, 13</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950923/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1, 2</a>) That meant that Jesus at God’s right hand had to wait till 1914, because Jehovah God does not change but faithfully keeps to his appointed times and seasons. In 1914 was the time for God to give the kingdom to his faithful Son, “whose right it is,” and for the Son to come into the kingdom in fulfillment of the covenant with his forefather David. At that date was the time for him to act on his heavenly Father’s invitation: “Ask of me, and I will give thee the nations for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950923/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ps. 2:7-9</a>, <em>AS</em>) Since he received the nations of earth in order to break and dash them to pieces like pottery smashed with an iron rod, it would indicate that the “appointed times of the nations” had ended.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">17.

He ousted him from the “throne of Jehovah” and let the Babylonian Gentiles smash Jerusalem to pieces and let it be trampled on by the nations. Hence the end of those times in 1914 meant just the reverse. There God Almighty took again to himself his great power. He began ruling as king, not at earthly Jerusalem or over the former promised land of Palestine, but over all the earth and all its nations inside and outside of Christendom. He did this in remembrance of his kingdom covenant with David and by installing the worthy Son of David, Jesus Christ, as King of the new world. Not as King on a material throne in an earthly Jerusalem, but on the “throne of Jehovah” which is in heaven and where Jesus had been sitting waiting for all his enemies to be made his footstool. “The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool,” says Jehovah.

<strong>The Meaning of Christ’s Return</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Christ’s return additionally means that he turns his attention to his surviving disciples and to other joint heirs who sleep in earthly graves. The apostle tells us: “We <span id="page71" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="71" data-before-text="71"></span>the living who survive to the presence of the Lord shall in no way precede those who have fallen asleep in death; because the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a commanding call, with an archangel’s voice and with God’s trumpet, and those who are dead in union with Christ will rise first.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966081/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Thess. 4:15, 16</a>) When on earth Jesus stood before the door of Lazarus’ tomb and called for him to come out. Now, from his heavenly position of power he can send down this call simultaneously to thousands of graves all over the globe and, by means of God’s spirit, cause his anointed followers to rise from death to life as spirit sons of God and to join him in his heavenly rule. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966081/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Rev. 14:1</a>) Bible evidence indicates that he began to do so from 1918 C.E. onward.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">His return also means a time for showing favor to the faithful Christians yet alive on earth, and so, in the verse following those just quoted, we read: “Afterward we the living who are surviving will, together with them, be caught away in clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we shall always be with the Lord.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966081/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Thess. 4:17</a>) This does not mean that these living Christians will be exempted from having to prove faithful until death, but, rather, means that their King now expresses his approval of them and unites them with himself spiritually, in a way that is as invisible to human eyes as the air itself is. He frees them from any captivity to modern “Babylon the Great,” the world empire of false religion, and elevates them to a position of honor aS the approved representatives of his glorious kingdom. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966081/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Revelation 11:11, 12</a> symbolically shows that even their enemies are obliged to behold the evidence of the King’s favor manifested toward these loyal subjects.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Eventually his return will also mean complete relief from all persecution and suffering for such faithful Christians who now fearlessly witness about his kingdom. The apostle Paul promised: “To you who suffer tribulation, relief along with us at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his powerful angels.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966081/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Thess. 1:7</a>) In this age of electronically controlled “ground-to-air” and “air-to-ground” missiles, Christ Jesus, with ‘all authority in heaven and earth’ invested in him, will not have to abandon his heavenly throne and travel to a position geographically near the enemy opposers of his servants on earth in order to eliminate such wicked ones. Like a “sharp long sword” and a rod of iron, his power by God’s spirit and through the mighty angelic hosts will reach all such ones and crush them like ‘grapes in a winepress.’ His return will therefore mean destruction for them at the coming battle of Armageddon.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966081/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matt. 28:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966081/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Rev. 19:11-15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966081/19/2" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 16:14-16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966081/19/3" data-bid="20-4" class="b"> Ps. 2:8, 9</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Christ’s return in Kingdom power will have a wonderful meaning for an unnumbered multitude of persons who love righteousness and who will serve him as earthly subjects.

<strong>Ruler from the House of David</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">As foretold by Isaiah, he was “despised and shunned” by the Hebrews. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isa. 53:3</a>, <em>Leeser</em>) They “esteemed him not” because they mistakenly expected the Messiah to come in power and glory in the first century and deliver them from the yoke of Rome. This is confirmed by the <em>Daily Prayer Book,</em> which says on pages 145 and 146: “The rebuilding of Jerusalem as the City of Righteousness would usher in the Messianic era. . . . In that New Jerusalem, the Messianic King would establish his throne. Throughout the days of the Second Temple, this feeling prevailed, and it grew in intensity during the tyranny of the Herods, the Roman puppet-kings of Judea.” The Hebrews failed to see that the humble coming of the Messiah in the first century, which they rejected, was preparatory to <span id="page457" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="457" data-before-text="457"></span>the more glorious coming due in the time future to their day.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">As foretold at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 69:22</a> in the <em>Leeser</em> translation (verse 21 in others), he was given vinegar to drink by his enemies.

As foretold at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Isaiah 53:9</a>, he was buried with the rich by being placed in a rich man’s empty tomb. He and his earthly mother could have no control over these things that happened to him in fulfillment of the prophecies.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">As foretold by <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>, he was a prophet like Moses, and as such he foretold the siege and destruction of Jerusalem. This took place more than thirty-five years later when the Romans burned the temple in 70 C.E. With the destruction of Jerusalem, Jesus Christ was proved a true prophet through whom God spoke. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Luke 21:20-24</a>) He was not God in the flesh, as some persons have mistakenly claimed, for he said: “I am ascending to my Father and your Father and to my God and your God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">John 20:17</a>) Nevertheless, he was the foretold Messiah.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Jesus fulfilled more than a hundred prophecies that were given to identify the Messiah. The chance that one man would fulfill them by accident is infinitesimally small. The fact that Jesus fulfilled them at a time when the genealogical records were in existence that proved his ancestry is further evidence identifying him as the promised Ruler from the house of David.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">The kingdom of Messiah was not established by God in the first century because God’s appointed time for this had not then come. People had to be instructed and shown the need for repentance because of their disobedience to God, just as in Jeremiah’s day. Unlike Jeremiah’s preparatory work, which took forty years and was limited mainly to Judea, the preparatory work for the Messiah’s kingdom was to be done earth-wide. That takes time. When the work is finished, the Messiah will then institute the revolutionary changes that will affect all mankind. As foretold at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Psalm 2:9</a>, he will smash the political governments man has made “like a potter’s vessel,” and he will bless people of all nations with a rule of justice, righteousness and peace, as foretold at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Isaiah 9:5, 6</a> in the <em>Leeser</em> translation (verses 6 and 7 in others).</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">It is during the second presence of the Messiah, when ruling from his glorious heavenly throne, that he will do what Hebrews mistakenly expected him to do in the first century. So the King Messiah is yet to bring to an end wicked rulers, oppression, injustice, wars and human suffering. To benefit from the changes he will bring, you must exercise faith in him and permit yourself to be guided by the preparatory work for his kingdom rule that he began more than 1900 years ago, at which time he fulfilled the prophecies that identify the Messiah. Your exercising faith in this Ruler from the house of David and in his God means eternal life under the righteous rule of his kingdom.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sd">Said a man who was trained at the feet of the famous Jewish Law teacher Gamaliel in the first century C.E.: “So we are declaring to you the good news about the promise made to the forefathers, that God has entirely fulfilled it to us their children in that he resurrected Jesus; even as it is written in the second psalm, ‘You are my son, I have become your Father this day.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Acts 13:32, 33</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb"></p>

How, then, can the mighty seventh world power and the terrifying Communist power and all other political powers of men, all of them being lower than the angels, succeed on earth? How can they win out against the divine will that Jehovah’s kingdom by Christ should take over exclusive control and possession of the earth? The Most High God was able to control and regulate superhuman, angelic creatures. He has held onto his position of Most High and Almighty even among legions of enemy angels, the demons. He tolerated Satan the Devil up in heaven for about 5,938 years. With all his diabolical opposition during all that time, where and how high has the Devil got by this year 1959? As high as God’s <span id="page111" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="111" data-before-text="111"></span>footstool, the earth, down to which the Devil was violently ousted from heaven since 1914.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Down here, in rage at his humiliation, he eggs on men to a race into outer space to see how high they can get, for selfish advantages, without regard for God’s will.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Will the resurrected ones of the anointed class now with Christ in heaven share in the destruction work of Armageddon?—K. R., United States.</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This question has recently been asked by many because of the statement on pages 338 and 339 of <em>You May Survive Armageddon into God’s New World,</em> as follows: “On the other side will visibly be seen the remnant of spiritual Israel and an unnumbered crowd of ‘other sheep,’ their companions, all backed up by the unseen hosts of heaven under Jesus Christ, the King of kings and Lord of lords, together with those of his anointed followers already resurrected.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956774/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezekiel 38:8-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956774/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Revelation 2:26-29</a>.”</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">What is there said may not specifically answer the question in so many words, but the scripture cited, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956774/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Revelation 2:26-29</a>, does.

You shall break them with a rod of iron, and dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.” So this is what Christ has received from his Father, authority over the nations to smash them at Armageddon, and this same authority is extended to the resurrected anointed ones now with Christ in heaven.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956774/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 2:8, 9</a>, <em>RS.</em></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The same truth is understood in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956774/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 17:12-14</a> (<em>NW</em>): “And the ten horns that you saw mean ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom, but they do receive authority as kings one hour with the wild beast. These have one purpose, and so they give their power and authority to the wild beast. These will battle with the Lamb, but, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings, the Lamb will conquer them. Also those called and chosen and faithful with him will do so,” namely, all the 144,000.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Neither the anointed remnant nor the other sheep on earth when Armageddon strikes will fight the political nations in a fleshly way. “Though we walk in the flesh, we do not wage warfare according to what we are in the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly, but powerful by God for overturning strongly entrenched things. For we are overturning reasonings and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and we are bringing every thought into captivity to make it obedient to the Christ.” Jehovah’s earthly witnesses, whether of the heavenly or of the earthly class, expose religious falsehood, point the way to true worship, and warn the unrepentant nations of their coming smashup at Armageddon. Only the invisible heavenly forces with Christ, including the resurrected anointed ones, fight at Armageddon and dash the nations to pieces like a potter’s vessel.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956774/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Cor. 10:3-5</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"></p>

We may not now resort to human refuges and become like the faithless people of this world. We must make known that Jehovah of hosts is the God of victory and is with us and is our secure retreat. This we will do, not by bragging about our organization, but by taking him at his Word and displaying our confidence in him. He is with us if we are with him, not becoming part of this doomed world or indulging in friendship with it, but adhering unwaveringly to his organization and expanding his pure worship. By our course of action as well as by our words we must demonstrate that our trust is not in weapons of carnal warfare but that we are fighting on Jehovah’s side with the spiritual armor from him. It helps to build up the confidence of all the scattered sheep in Jehovah the Great Shepherd when we ourselves show no worldly fear but manifest unshakable reliance upon him.

So keep calm and go on peacefully about your work as his ministers of good news. As never before, make the time count now, for the time in which he is showing patience and may yet be found is short. He will never forsake his faithful ones, but will help us, “and that right early.”</p>

Therefore the decision of the trial court and of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed and thus make the members of this Court witnesses to the name, majesty, and supremacy of ‘the Most High, whose name alone is Jehovah.’”<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966883/1">b</a></p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">19.

It handed down a decision recognizing Christian conscience even when it considers the saluting of the flag of any country to be an act of idolatry and so a violation of God’s Supreme Law.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966883/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 John 5:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966883/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Ex. 20:1-5</a>.<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966883/2">c</a></p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>GOD’S LAW CALLS FOR FIRST OBEDIENCE</strong></p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">20, 21.

The apostle Peter, whom the Roman Catholic Church claims as its first pope, was the one who said to the Supreme Court in Jerusalem: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966883/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 5:29</a>) And in this regard Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere follow the example of Peter.</p>

Do we want to be happy? We can be. How? There are twenty-four happinesses or beatitudes in the Psalms that tell us the secret of how to be happy with the happiness that will never end. It is instructive for us to hear some of these beatitudes! The very book of Psalms opens with a beatitude, “Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked ones, and in the way of sinners has not stood and in the seat of ridiculers has not sat. But his delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1, 2</a>) The beatitude in the Second Psalm is one that not only world rulers but all of us under the shadow of Armageddon ought to heed: “Serve Jehovah with fear and be joyful with trembling. Kiss the son, that He may not become incensed and you may not perish [from] the way, for his anger flares up easily. Happy are all those taking refuge in him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Ps. 2:11, 12</a>.</p><p id="p98" data-pid="98" class="qu">38.

As we approach the day of days when Jehovah will make wars to cease to the extremity of the earth, breaking the enemy armaments to pieces and setting astonishing events in the earth, we need to keep united as his people and to meet together as often as can be arranged. “Look! how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Ps. 133:1</a>) To promote that goodness and pleasantness of unitedly dwelling together we should take hold of the opportunity and build one another up as fellow believers <span id="page637" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="637" data-before-text="637"></span>and fellow servants. We meet, not only to praise the universal Sovereign and his kingdom, but to help one another to praise him before people on the outside who need salvation.

<strong>The Way to Remain Fearless to the Final End</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> Just try to imagine the fear you might have toward these evil worldly powers. Go to the limit in your imagining, and then realize with all the force <span id="page90" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="90" data-before-text="90"></span>possible that the fear of Jehovah must be far greater than all that. Does not ordinary sense convey to us that Jehovah the Life-giver can just as easily take away our life as he can give it? Faithful Job gave expression thus: “Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: Jehovah gave, and Jehovah hath taken away; blessed be the name of Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950202/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Job 1:21</a>, <em>Am. Stan. Ver.</em>) Knowledge of the great Creator is so essential, and those knowing him best trust him most, and fear is with all. No one is exempt from fearing Jehovah, not even the beloved and precious Son of God, for it is written: “Who in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear, though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950202/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Heb. 5:7, 8</a>, <em>Am. Stan. Ver.</em>) Yes, he was heard for his godly fear, his reverent fear.</p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">22. What is the full force of “fear”, that is, fear of Jehovah?</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> Sometimes there is an inclination to water down this expression “fear” and say it means just “reverence” of Jehovah. True, reverence must be included in our fear of him, but fear also means dread, awe. Take, for example, the scripture at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950202/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Isaiah 8:13</a>: “Let him be your fear.” The word “fear” here is a translation of the Hebrew word <em>mo·rawʹ</em> and means also “dread, terribleness, terror”. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950202/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Psalm 2:11</a> the word “fear”, translated from <em>yi·rawʹ,</em> is derived from the same Hebrew verb <em>yi·rehʹ</em> meaning “to fear, reverence, honor”.</p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">23. Is fear of him opposed to love? Why is that?</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> The many recorded works of Jehovah clearly teach that creatures should have proper, intelligent fear toward God. They should stand in awe before him and bow down before his great and terrible name Jehovah, for no one should willfully cause his displeasure. Disobedience is punishable by death. Has he not the right and power to destroy? While fearing to incur his anger for rebellion, stubbornness, idolatry and all forms of disobedience, yet God’s children must love him. Perfect or complete love will cast out all slavish fear and give the creature a proper appreciation of his relationship to his Creator. No one who really has an awe, a dread, a reverence, yes, fear of Jehovah, has fear of man or conditions in the world. Those who are the loyal and faithful children of the Most High God know from scriptures and experience that fear and love of Jehovah go hand in hand, and are not, in His case, in opposition. They fear to do anything contrary to his will, for he can destroy; yet they love him with all they have. If we maintain fear of God we shall be kept fearless of men; and at this world’s end this is most important.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="ss"><strong>A MODERN EXAMPLE OF FEARLESSNESS</strong></p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">24. Since when has our fearlessness specially been shown? How?</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> In these years since the close of World War I in 1918 true lovers and fearers of Jehovah have many times demonstrated their fearlessness toward men. They have been taught to know him and to make him their strong tower. His purposes in his people are clearly seen. Evidences of his guiding hand in their affairs pile up. They wait on him and are nourished for future service, even as the apostle Paul declared: “For God has not given us a timid spirit but a spirit of power and love and discipline. So do not be ashamed to testify to our Lord, and do not be ashamed of a prisoner of the Lord like myself; join me in bearing suffering for the gospel, by the power of the God who has saved us.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950202/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">2 Tim. 1:7-9</a>, <em>Moff.</em>) But how little they realized the need they would have for all these favors and assurances. Great opposition was being organized in 1933 against the Lord’s anointed, and it broke out in fury a few years later. Furious demonized mobs attacked these peaceful Christians until the persecution became a national issue in America. Bitterness, hatred and all forms of slander and evilspeaking were heaped on these faithful witnesses, both young and old, male and female. It required fearlessness to withstand such brutal oppression; those who had no strength were granted it by the Almighty in whom they had trusted. Their trust and confidence were rewarded and the abuse and hurt turned out to be a testimony against their enemies.</p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">25. Under what developments and how did God become very real to them?</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"><sup>25</sup></span> On came World War II, but no one had grasped how far-reaching it would be when the peace was broken. Totalitarian hordes overran Europe. Jehovah’s witnesses were arrested in large numbers, and overnight cast into prisons or concentration camps. The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society’s work was interfered with and some Branch offices occupied by the gunmen. But God’s work could not stop. His commandments were final. Bitter and terrible persecution came on Jehovah’s witnesses in most countries, yet what happened to God’s faithful servants? Did they discontinue doing Jehovah’s service? Certainly not! The whole world was against them, yet they trusted in the Most High God. In themselves they were subject to human frailties, fear and doubts, but looking to the Lord and relying on his might and strength, they went on confident that he was their support and was truly backing them up. It is a fact that in all countries where Jehovah’s servants carried on the gospel-preaching work to the best of their ability Jehovah God became, as it were, very real. Assurance was supplied, so that no one could doubt that God was with us. We knew.</p><p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu">26. How were faith in him and love toward him strengthened in us?</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"><sup>26</sup></span> Over and over again, as the loyal brethren all <span id="page91" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="91" data-before-text="91"></span>know, the Lord comforted and gave such marvelous demonstrations of his working with us, of his power manifested on our behalf, that we were strengthened to go on. How many times it could be recalled that a seemingly impossible situation would arise, yes, often involving the service of Jehovah and the interests and well-being of the brethren; yet a way out was provided! And at knowing it was no one but Jehovah who had so acted gratitude would fill the heart; our love for him would grow deeper and stronger and true fear of the Lord brought forward its own rich reward. “Oh love Jehovah, all ye his saints: Jehovah preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth him that dealeth proudly. Be strong, and let your heart take courage, all ye that hope in Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950202/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Ps. 31:23, 24</a>, <em>Am. Stan. Ver.</em>) The anointed knew their calling and promised reward in the kingdom of heaven, and the Lord’s “other sheep” had been strengthened in their hope of the new world blessings and Jehovah’s favors. “I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of Jehovah in the land of the living. Wait for Jehovah: Be strong, and let thy heart take courage; yea, wait thou for Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950202/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Ps. 27:13, 14</a>, <em>Am.

<strong>The Peace on Which World Unity Hinges</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">God even appeals to national rulers, saying: “And now, O kings, exercise insight; let yourselves be corrected, O judges of the earth. Serve Jehovah with fear and be joyful with trembling. Kiss the son, that He may not become incensed and you may not perish from the way.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979882/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 2:10-12</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">From the statement in this psalm and from many other scriptures, we can see that, for the nations to gain world peace, they must first make peace with God. For peace, the prime essential is heart harmony and unity with the Creator and Sovereign. He knows what is necessary for the contentment and happiness of those whom he has created. This has become more obvious in our present time when it is seen that man’s efforts in connection with the ecology have often amounted to <span id="page5" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>stupid or greedy blundering and have become a threat even to comfortable living on the earth.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The appeal in the second Psalm, to kings and judges of the earth, gives the rulers of political nations an opportunity to make peace with God and his Son. But history shows that no entire nation has done so, and prophecy indicates that no political nation will ever do so. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979882/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 2:2, 3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979882/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Rev. 16:13-16</a>) Therefore, the nations themselves will never be at peace with God or with one another.

<strong>God’s Kingdom Purpose Triumphs</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>A MERCIFUL INVITATION</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The rulers are therefore advised that, instead of massing together in opposition, they should “kiss the son, that He [God] may not become incensed and you may not perish from the way.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979042/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 2:12</a>) Jehovah the great Sovereign should be heeded when he makes a decree. When he set his Son upon the throne, the rulers of the earth should have quit “muttering an empty thing.” They should have acknowledged the King immediately, rendering him complete obedience.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Those who refuse to recognize the authority of the King that God has chosen actually insult the Most High. They deny his universal sovereignty and his ability and authority to choose the king that is the best ruler for mankind. Such ones will find that Jehovah’s fury will overtake them suddenly, when they are pursuing the way to carry out their own devices, “for his anger flares up easily,” or, is quick to blaze, irresistibly. Certainly this is a fair warning and one that they should accept gratefully, for it means life to them to heed it.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979042/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 2:12a</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">There is still time, then, for those who have been going along tacitly with the plans of the nations​—even for those who may have opposed the kingdom of God’s appointed One—​to find safety. In the danger that impends, these can flee to Jehovah, for he willingly provides refuge under the kingdom of his Son, before this kingdom smashes the opposing nations.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">How can this place of refuge be reached, and what does it mean for the one seeking shelter in it? The psalmist concludes: “Happy are all those taking refuge in him [Jehovah].” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979042/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 2:12b</a>) This protection is not hard to find. But how is it to be found? A person must first see the need for something better than what the worldly nations have to offer. Then, he must sincerely look into the Bible to find out how his life can be conformed to God’s way. This does not mean living an abnormal life in any way.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Those who study the Bible, where God’s guidance is found, can live a more satisfying life. Following the Bible’s counsel gives them happier family relations, freedom from many of the fears and worries that beset the world today, and a knowledge and confidence that they are pleasing the Creator. No one other than the universal Sovereign can give a guarantee of “the life now and that which is to come [after his anger clears the earth of those who oppose what is right by rejecting his rule].” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979042/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:8</a>) As the Creator, who knows what is best for the people, he will accomplish his purpose to bless them with peace, lasting security and contentment under the kingdom of his Son. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979042/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 6:33</a>) Truly, it is high time to “exercise insight,” yes, to “kiss the Son,” before Jehovah God, in his anger, consumes earth’s rulers and <em>their</em> kingdoms.</p>

<strong>Our Refuge Under the Incorruptible “Kingdom of the Heavens”</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> That is it! That “kingdom of God” deserves our fullest attention. Who is the king of that kingdom? Just preceding the above-quoted words, Jesus, referring to himself, said: “Then they will see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.” And following his prophecy he gave three parables, concluding with the one respecting the sheep and the goats, introduced as follows: “When the Son of man arrives in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit down on his glorious throne.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975844/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Luke 21:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975844/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Matt. 25:31</a>) There is no doubt as to who is the anointed King of God’s kingdom. And there is no doubt as to his worthiness! First, he willingly emptied himself of his previous heavenly glory and then, “when he found himself in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient as far as death, yes, death on a torture stake. For this very reason also God exalted him to a superior position and kindly gave him the name that is above every other name.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975844/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Phil. 2:5-11</a>) He is a living person of today​—yes, and highly interested in the fulfillment of his own inspired prophecy! His life on earth was a marked life and had been foretold, in its vitally important aspects, in the inspired Hebrew Scriptures, in order to identify clearly who the Messiah was. One of these scriptures foretells our day when “the kings of earth take their stand and high officials themselves have massed together as one against Jehovah and against his anointed one”; then, in reply and with a derisive, angry laugh, Jehovah tells these enemies they are too late. He says: “I, even I, have installed my king upon Zion, my holy mountain.” For further identification, Jehovah says to this anointed king: “You are my son.” The opposing nations are given to him to “dash them to pieces.” But the psalm comes to a fine conclusion: “Happy are all those <em>taking refuge</em> in him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975844/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 2:1-12</a>) Many other psalms, such as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975844/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 91:1, 2</a>, speak of Jehovah as our refuge, or “my refuge,” but the means by which he has provided refuge in this day is his kingdom in the hands of his anointed and reigning Son, Christ Jesus.​—See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975844/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 110:1-4</a>.</p>

<strong>Is International Unity Possible?</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Now we are in the time when unity is essential, and not only for ‘spiritual Israel.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973326/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Gal. 6:16</a>) This world, to survive, would have to achieve real unity, but it cannot. Neither the divided sects of Christendom’s religions, nor politics nor science <span id="page283" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="283" data-before-text="283"></span>has the formula. However, Christ’s followers do, not from their own wisdom, but from God’s Word. Jehovah’s witnesses have been preaching Christ the ‘one king’s’ presence in Kingdom power for nearly sixty years now. They have proclaimed the need for all to come under the service and favor of the “one king” whom God has appointed, as the psalmist wrote: “And now, O kings, exercise insight; let yourselves be corrected, O judges of the earth. Serve Jehovah with fear . . . Kiss the son, that He may not become incensed and you may not perish from the way.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973326/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 2:10-12</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">All people have opportunity to come into unity under “one king” if they so desire. Since 1935 C.E. a “great crowd” of people have overcome racial, national, tribal and language barriers and distinctions. These hope to survive the destruction of the disunited world. These, having the unity essential for an internationally united human race, constitute an example and an evidence that such a human race is possible. Yes. It is more than possible. It is <em>sure,</em> because God purposes it.</p>

For long enough now Jehovah’s enemies have greatly reproached his name. In defiance, they are “massed together as one against Jehovah and against his anointed one.” The time has come for those enemies to be subdued. “Jehovah himself at your [Christ Jesus’] right hand will certainly break kings to pieces on the day of his anger. He will execute judgment among the nations; he will cause a fullness of dead bodies.” However, before this final execution, a final appeal and warning is given to all opposers to subject themselves to Jehovah, and to “kiss the son [in fealty], that He [Jehovah] may not become incensed and you may not perish from the way, for his anger flares up easily [when the time limit is reached].”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972204/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 2:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972204/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972204/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 110:5, 6</a>.</p>

Ask of me, that I may give nations as your inheritance and the ends of the earth as your own possession. You will break them with an iron scepter, as though a potter’s vessel you will dash them to pieces.’ And now, O kings, exercise insight; let yourselves be corrected, O judges of the earth.

Is that not the spirit of the world today, both nationally and individually? Even the smallest nations are demanding their sovereign rights and independence. That same spirit, too, is often shown by individuals who say, in effect: ‘I have the right to live my own life my own way.’ That is the underlying reason why many will not heed the message brought to them by Jehovah’s witnesses. They know it will interfere with their independence. They and their rulers, similar to Eve, would rather listen to the boastful, froglike “unclean inspired expressions” that are inspired by the lying demons. Such propaganda stirs their spirit of proud independence and results in their being ‘gathered together to the war of the great day of God the Almighty.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964483/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Rev. 16:13, 14</a>.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">20.

Using Jesus’ other illustration, fulfilled in this day when he is enthroned as King, we see that he described the “other sheep” as those who support and give good cooperation to even the “least of these my brothers,” or followers.

Notice the answer given: “That we should serve [literally, be] for the praise of his glory.” Then observe in what immediately follows that we are told how to serve God’s purpose acceptably.

Do we want to be happy? We can be. How? There are twenty-four happinesses or beatitudes in the Psalms that tell us the secret of how to be happy with the happiness that will never end.

Serve Jehovah with fear and be joyful with trembling. Kiss the Son [the Messiah] that He [Jehovah] may not become incensed and you may not perish from the way, for his anger flares up easily.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101975078/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Psalm 2:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101975078/49/1" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> 10-12</a>) The nations have persistently held back from kissing the King whom Jehovah has universally announced to be his only-begotten Son, for the nations have done nothing to soften his face toward a reconciliation. They have refused to surrender to him their sovereignties over their claimed territories. The clock of God’s timetable strikes the hour for Him to <span id="page348" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="348" data-before-text="348"></span>‘speak to the nations in his anger and disturb them in his hot displeasure.’ So now let the rule of the “iron scepter” go into operation. Let Jehovah’s installed royal Son break the nations, dash them to pieces like a potter’s earthenware vessel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101975078/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Psalm 2:5-9</a>) At once, then, let the Son of God with the iron scepter engage the enemy forces in battle!</p>

<strong>Head</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>‘Lifting Up the Head.’</strong> King David, bowed in humiliation and trouble, looked to Jehovah as his Shield and the One <em>‘lifting up his head,’</em> enabling him to hold his head high again.

<strong>Complete Trust in Jehovah Inspires Confidence</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> But David is confident because he has implicit trust in God.

Yes, the aging king is fleeing, his head covered and bent down in humiliation. But the Most High will change David’s condition to one of glory. Jehovah will enable him to stand erect, to raise his head and hold it high once again. David calls out with confidence that God will answer him. Do you display such trust in Jehovah?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> By the words “the One lifting up my head,” David ascribes to Jehovah the help he expects to receive. <em>Today’s English Version</em> reads: “But you, O LORD, are always my shield from danger; you give me victory and restore my courage.” With regard to the expression “the One lifting up my head,” one reference work says: “When God lifts up . . . one’s ‘head,’ He fills one with hope and confidence.” Forced from Israel’s throne, <span id="page29" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>David has reason to be despondent. However, ‘the lifting up of his head’ will result in renewed courage, confidence, and complete trust in God.</p>

<strong>Confidence in the Face of Danger</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The situation was so threatening that many Israelites concluded that not even the Most High could deliver David from falling before Absalom and his men. Commenting on this, David said: “Many are saying of my soul: ‘There is no salvation for him by God.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979087/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 3:2</a>) But did this weaken David’s confidence? No, for he continued: “And yet you, O Jehovah, are a shield about me, my glory and the One lifting up my head. With my voice I shall call to Jehovah himself, and he will answer me from his holy mountain.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979087/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 3:3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">David viewed Jehovah as the One who would safeguard him from calamity, protecting him just as a shield protects a warrior.

Still, David did not doubt that the Most High would change his state to one of glory and raise up his head, enabling him to hold his head high, erect. That is why he called out to Jehovah for help, confident that he would answer. Since the ark of the covenant, a symbol of Jehovah’s presence, had been taken back to Mount Zion, David appropriately referred to having his prayer answered from God’s holy mountain.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979087/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Sam. 15:24, 25</a>.</p>

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page133" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="133" data-before-text="133"></span><strong>‘Have Your Say in Your Heart’</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">AT TIMES the words and actions of others can make a person very angry. When faced with such provocation, what should you do? The Bible recommends: “Be agitated, but do not sin. Have your say in your heart, upon your bed, and keep silent.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976161/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 4:4</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">There is real wisdom in this counsel. A person may rightly be disturbed. But it is especially then that self-control is needed. The danger exists that one will lash out against the person causing the disturbance, retaliating in kind and thus sinning against him. This could lead to a violent quarrel. In a state of great agitation people often do things that they later deeply regret. It is not uncommon these days to hear about people seriously injuring or even killing relatives and friends in a fit of anger. Yes, wise is the counsel for a person to calm his agitation during the quiet hours of the night.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">So that we do not act rashly we need to give thought to the consequences of what we say or do. When God’s servant David on one occasion failed to do this and got heated up against the man, Nabal, he almost incurred bloodguilt. This is what happened:</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">David and his men had been as a protective wall around Nabal’s flock and shepherds. Later, in view of the kindnesses rendered to Nabal, David sent messengers to him, wishing him well and asking for whatever material aid he might want to give. Disregarding the benefits that had come to him from David and his men, Nabal screamed rebukes at the messengers. Receiving report of this, David determined to kill Nabal along with all the males of his household. But Nabal’s wife Abigail quickly got a supply of food ready, approached David and pleaded with him not to take matters into his own hands.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976161/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Sam. 25:5-31</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Her words reached David’s heart, prompting him to say: “Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel, who has sent you this day to meet me! And blessed be your sensibleness, and blessed be you who have restrained me this day from entering into bloodguilt and having my own hand come to my salvation.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976161/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Sam. 25:32, 33</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">As in the case of David, keeping one’s anger in check is not always easy. It does help greatly, however, to avoid taking oneself too seriously and not to have an exaggerated concern for one’s name. This is well illustrated in the case of King Saul. When first chosen to be king of Israel, he was a modest and humble man. Prior to his anointing as king he said to the prophet Samuel: “Am I not a Benjaminite of the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and my family the most insignificant of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976161/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Sam. 9:21</a>) This modest attitude later helped him to avoid rash action when certain men talked disrespectfully about him. The Scriptures report: “Some worthless fellows said, ‘How can this man save us?’ And they despised him, and brought him no <span id="page134" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="134" data-before-text="134"></span>present. But he held his peace.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976161/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Sam. 10:27</a>, <em>Common Bible.</em></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Important, too, in calming one’s agitation is remembering one’s relationship with the Creator. Jehovah God does not look with favor upon those who rejoice over the disaster of an enemy, as such rejoicing reflects a vengeful spirit. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976161/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Proverbs 24:17, 18</a>, we are cautioned: “When your enemy falls, do not rejoice; and when he is caused to stumble, may your heart not be joyful, that Jehovah may not see and it be bad in his eyes.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">A person could jeopardize his standing with Jehovah God by permitting his agitation to grow to the point of harboring bitter animosity. Were he to do so, he would be claiming as his right something that God has reserved for himself. “Vengeance is mine; I will repay, says Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976161/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rom. 12:19</a>) That is why <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976161/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 24:29</a> counsels: “Do not say: ‘Just as he did to me, so I am going to do to him. I shall repay to each one according to his acting.’” The person who thus takes matters into his own hands could forfeit the opportunity of receiving mercy from Jehovah God when he comes into judgment.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Failure to exercise self-control may also lead to loss of personal dignity. A Bible proverb puts it this way: “It is a foolish person that makes known his vexation in the same day, but the shrewd one is covering over a dishonor.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976161/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Prov. 12:16</a>) One who gets overly excited about some personal affront and then acts rashly makes himself appear foolish in the eyes of others. But the wise person ignores provocative remarks and actions. By bridling his tongue and restraining his actions, he does not make a big issue about his being dishonored. The dishonor is allowed to die down as if it never occurred. The individual preserves his dignity as well as his peace of mind, and does not degrade himself by resorting to disgraceful words.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Furthermore, the one maintaining self-control gains a moral victory. This was certainly true of Jesus Christ. He could say to his disciples: “Take courage! I have conquered the world.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976161/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 16:33</a>) Though faced with threats and reviling, Jesus never adopted the wicked ways of the world. Regarding him, the apostle Peter wrote: “When he was being reviled, he did not go reviling in return. When he was suffering, he did not go threatening, but kept on committing himself to the one who judges righteously.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976161/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:23</a>) Since the world did not succeed in getting Jesus to react in kind, it went down in defeat before him. He came off as the victor. Our gaining a like victory is something truly worth while.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">At times even persons responsible for our becoming disturbed can be benefited by our remaining calm. The good effect that kindness can have on them is highlighted at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976161/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Proverbs 25:21, 22</a>: “If the one hating you is hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink. For coals are what you are raking together upon his head, and Jehovah himself will reward you.” Because of his being treated kindly, the person responsible for needless agitation may become ashamed and start to think seriously about his words and actions. This may cause him to change and may bring out his better qualities. Even if this is not the case, the person who maintains self-control and does not retaliate can look confidently to the Creator to reward him.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Truly, we are wise when we have ‘our say in our hearts’ and maintain self-control. To this end, we do well to cultivate modesty and humility. We also need to be on guard lest we become hasty in our speech and actions. Thereby we will avoid jeopardizing our standing before Jehovah God, and we will preserve our dignity, and gain a moral victory, and may even aid those responsible for provocation to change their ways for the better.</p>

Have your say in your heart, upon your bed, and keep silent.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101997029/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b"><em>Psalm 4:4</em></a>) In most cases involving minor offenses, it may be wise to restrain your words, thus avoiding an emotional confrontation.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/241/0">11/22/1997, p. 18</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>How Can I Deal With Favoritism?</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">However, the Bible cautions: “Be agitated, but do not sin. Have your say in your heart, upon your bed, and keep silent.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101997846/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 4:4</a>) When you are upset and angry, you are much more likely to say or do something that you might later regret. Recall how Cain became agitated over the favored position that his brother, Abel, enjoyed with God. God warned him: “There is sin crouching at the entrance, and for you is its craving; and will you, for your part, get the mastery over it?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101997846/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 4:3-16</a>) Cain failed to master his feelings, and the result was disastrous!</p>

<strong>Is It Always Wrong to Get Angry?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>A Balanced View</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The Bible’s treatment of this subject is not so simplistic. Notice, for example, Paul’s words at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101994246/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:26</a>: “Be wrathful, and yet do not sin.” This verse would be quite puzzling if anger were automatically a “deadly sin,” one meriting eternal punishment.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Paul was quoting from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101994246/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 4:4</a>, which reads: “Be agitated, but do not sin.” According to <em>Vine’s Expository Dictionary of Biblical Words,</em> the Hebrew word translated here “be agitated,” <em>ra·ghazʹ,</em> means to “quiver with strong emotion.” But which strong emotion? Was it anger? In the <em>Septuagint</em> translation of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101994246/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 4:4</a>, <em>ra·ghazʹ</em> was rendered in Greek as “be made wrathful,” and that is clearly what Paul intended here.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/243/0">7/8/1993, p. 25</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Is It Wrong to Daydream?</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Has someone offended you or made you angry? Note the advice given at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101993488/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 4:4</a>: “Be agitated, but do not sin. Have your say in your heart, upon your bed, and keep silent.” This does not mean endlessly replaying hurtful scenes in your mind, nor does it mean dwelling on vivid mental images of thrashing someone with clever comeback lines. After all, Jesus warned that “everyone who continues wrathful with his brother will be accountable,” as will “whoever addresses his brother with an unspeakable word of contempt.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101993488/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 5:22</a>) But mentally rehearsing your options​—which may include simply forgiving the offender—​may help you resolve matters with him in a calm, reasonable manner.</p>

<strong>Light</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The Scriptures contain many figurative references to light. Ability to see is meant by the words “the light of my own eyes.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Ps. 38:10</a>) For God to “give light” to someone means that he gives them life or allows them to continue living. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Job 3:20,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/49/1" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> 23</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Psalm 56:13</a>.) “Children that have seen no light” are those who are born dead.

Darkness is their “light,” for they are accustomed to carry out their evil deeds under its cover and this figurative “light” is taken from them by the literal light of dawn.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Job 38:12-15</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Job 24:15-17</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">As the light of the sun is clearly observable, thus Jehovah’s adverse judgments are obvious.

For instance, ‘Judah and Israel dwelt in security’ during Solomon’s reign. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011368/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">1 Ki. 4:25</a>) Those trusting in God enjoyed peace even when neighboring nations were hostile.

<strong>Let “the Peace of God” Guard Your Heart</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Throughout the nation’s history, Israelites who faithfully tried to keep Jehovah’s statutes did enjoy peace with him, and that often brought many other blessings. During the early years of King Solomon’s reign, peace with God brought material prosperity as well as rest from wars with Israel’s neighbors. Describing that time, the Bible says: “Judah and Israel continued to dwell in security, everyone under his own vine and under his own fig tree, from Dan to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991165/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">1 Kings 4:25</a>) Even when hostilities broke out with neighboring lands, faithful Israelites still had the peace that really matters, peace with God. Thus, King David, a noted warrior, wrote: “In peace I will both lie down and sleep, for you yourself alone, O Jehovah, make me dwell in security.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991165/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Psalm 4:8</a>.</p>

<strong>Do You Have Trouble Sleeping?</strong><br/><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">So if you are having trouble sleeping, do not become discouraged. There are a number of possible remedies, or adjustments in your life that you might make, to correct the problem. And do not overlook the part that faith in God can play in enjoying good sleep, as the Bible psalmist experienced: “In peace I will both lie down and sleep, for you yourself alone, O Jehovah, make me dwell in security.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101975163/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 4:8</a>.</p>
