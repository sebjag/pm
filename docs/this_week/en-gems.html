<strong>Son(s) of God</strong><br/><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb"><strong><em>False charge of blasphemy.</em></strong> Because of Jesus’ references to God as his Father, certain opposing Jews leveled the charge of blasphemy against him, saying, “You, although being a man, make yourself a god.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/116/0" data-bid="117-1" class="b">Joh 10:33</a>) Most translations here say “God”; Torrey’s translation lowercases the word as “god,” while the interlinear reading of <em>The Emphatic Diaglott</em> says “a god.” Support for the rendering “a god” is found principally in Jesus’ own answer, in which he quoted from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/117/0" data-bid="118-1" class="b">Psalm 82:1-7</a>. As can be seen, this text did not refer to persons as being called “God,” but “gods” and “sons of the Most High.”</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">According to the context, those whom Jehovah called “gods” and “sons of the Most High” in this psalm were Israelite judges who had been practicing injustice, requiring that Jehovah himself now judge ‘in the middle of such gods.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/118/0" data-bid="119-1" class="b">Ps 82:1-6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/118/1" data-bid="119-2" class="b"> 8</a>) Since Jehovah applied these terms to those men, Jesus was certainly guilty of no blasphemy in saying, “I am God’s Son.” Whereas the works of those judicial “gods” belied their being “sons of the Most High,” Jesus’ works consistently proved him to be in union, in harmonious accord and relationship, with his Father.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/119/0" data-bid="120-1" class="b">Joh 10:34-38</a>.</p>

<strong>Elohim</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">When applying to Jehovah, <em>ʼElo·himʹ</em> is used in the sense of majesty, dignity or excellence, and takes the singular verb, adjective and pronoun. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 7:9</a> it is used with an adjective in the singular number: <em>ʼElo·himʹ tsad·diqʹ,</em> ‘righteous God.’ On this Gesenius-Kautzsch’s <em>Hebrew Grammar,</em> 1949 edition, pages 398, 399, paragraph “g,” says: “The <em>pluralis excellentiae</em> or <em>maiestatis,</em> as has been remarked above, is properly a variety of the abstract plural, since it sums up the several characteristics belonging to the idea, besides <span id="page514" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="514" data-before-text="514"></span>possessing the secondary sense of an <em>intensification</em> of the original idea. It is thus closely related to the plurals of amplification, . . . which are mostly found in poetry. So especially <em>El·o·himʹ Godhead, God</em> (to be distinguished from the numerical plural <em>gods,</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Exodus 12:12</a>, &amp;c.). The supposition that <em>El·o·himʹ</em> is to be regarded as merely a remnant of earlier polytheistic views (that is, as originally only a numerical plural) is at least highly improbable, and, moreover, would not explain the analogous plurals. . . . That the language has entirely rejected the idea of numerical plurality in <em>El·o·himʹ</em> (whenever it denotes <em>one</em> God), is proved especially by its being almost invariably joined with a singular attribute . . . , for example, <em>El·o·himʹ tsad·diqʹ,</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 7:10</a> [9, English], &amp;c. Hence <em>El·o·himʹ</em> may have been used originally not only as a numerical but also as an abstract plural (corresponding to the Latin <em>numen,</em> and our <em>Godhead</em>), and, like other abstracts of the same kind, have been transferred to the concrete single god (even of the heathen).”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><em>The International Standard Bible Encyclopaedia,</em> Volume II, page 1265, comments: “It is characteristic of Heb[rew] that extension, magnitude and dignity, as well as actual multiplicity, are expressed by the pl[ural]. It is not reasonable, therefore, to assume that plurality of form indicates primitive Sem[itic] polytheism. On the contrary, historic Heb[rew] is unquestionably and uniformly monotheistic.” Moses wrote at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>: “Jehovah our God is one Jehovah.”</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">As applied to Jehovah, the title <em>ʼElo·himʹ</em> draws attention to him as the Creator. It appears thirty-five times in the account of creation, and every time the verb describing what he said and did is in the singular number. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 1:1–2:4</a>) In Him resides the sum and substance of infinite forces.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>ANGELS</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 8:4, 5</a>, the angels are also referred to as <em>ʼelo·himʹ,</em> as is confirmed by Paul’s quotation of the passage at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Hebrews 2:6-8</a>. They are called <em>b<sup>e</sup>nehʹ ha-ʼElo·himʹ,</em> “sons of God,” <em>AV;</em> “sons of the true God,” <em>NW</em>, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Genesis 6:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Job 1:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/10/3" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 2:1</a>. Of this phrase, the above-quoted Gesenius’ <em>Hebrew Grammar</em> on p. 418, par. 2, says that it “properly means not <em>sons of god</em>(<em>s</em>), but beings of the class of <em>elohimʹ.” Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros,</em> by Koehler and Baumgartner (1953 ed.), page 134, says: “(<em>individual) divine beings, gods.”</em> And on page 51: <em>“the</em> (<em>single</em>) <em>gods</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Genesis 6:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Job 1:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 2:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/11/3" data-bid="12-4" class="b"> 38:7</a>.” Hence, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 8:5</a> it is rendered “angels,” <em>LXX;</em> “godlike ones,” <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>OTHERS</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The word <em>ʼelo·himʹ</em> is also used when referring to idol gods. Sometimes this plural form means simply “gods.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ex. 12:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 20:23</a>) At other times it is the plural of excellence and only one god (or goddess) is referred to; these gods were not trinities. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Sam. 5:7b</a> [Dagon]; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Ki. 11:5</a> [“goddess” Ashtoreth]; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Dan. 1:2b</a> [Marduk]) In view of this, the use of the plural <em>ʼElo·himʹ,</em> when referring to Jehovah, cannot be cited in support of the trinity doctrine. Furthermore, when trinitarians, who oppose polytheism, argue that <em>ʼElo·himʹ,</em> when referring to the true God, signifies the numerical plural “gods,” they make themselves polytheists, contrary to the definition of their trinity doctrine that there are three <em>persons</em> in <em>one God,</em> not three <em>gods.</em></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 82:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 6</a>, <em>ʼelo·himʹ</em> is used of men, human judges in Israel. Jesus quoted from this Psalm at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">John 10:34, 35</a>.

Had he claimed to be God, then the Jews would have been right in stoning him for blasphemy. But Jesus argues that he claimed to be less than God.

But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.” In this psalm the Most High God speaks to the unjust judges on earth, mere men, and calls them “gods,” or <em>elohím</em> in the Hebrew, and he tells them to correct their legal practice.

And yet, when Jesus Christ, who performed so many wonderful good works among the Jews, spoke of God as his Father and spoke of himself as merely the Son of God, they said he blasphemed and were ready to stone him as a blasphemer.

It was instrumental in bringing back to life the “abomination that makes desolate” in the form of the United Nations organization in 1945. It also carried forward the persecutions upon Jehovah’s “sanctuary” class of faithful anointed Christians. To the help on earth of this spirit-anointed sanctuary class there has come a great crowd of sheeplike believers, “other sheep,” with the destiny of everlasting life on earth under God’s kingdom. Some persons have temporarily joined themselves to the sanctuary class with flatteries, but the “other sheep” stick to Jehovah’s sanctuary class, even though the persecution of some of these to a violent death has furnished a great test of their unbreakable devotion to Jehovah God. Thus these faithful, dedicated Christians have been purified by this fiery persecution at the hands of the symbolic king of the north.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="qu">44.

He wants to know no will or pleasure but his own. To this end he uses conscienceless means to take to himself totalitarian, dictatorial power in government. This was true of him not only in the Nazi and Fascist realm after World War I. It has also been true of him in his Communist fashion since World War II.

In fact, if not in word, he denies God’s existence. By his declaration of his aims for world domination to the exclusion of God’s kingdom in the hands of Christ, he speaks against Jehovah, whose established kingdom Jehovah’s witnesses are preaching to all nations. For Jehovah’s dedicated people he does not believe in the principle stated by Jesus: “Pay back Caesar’s things to Caesar, but God’s things to God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960126/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 20:25</a>) He denies God’s right to anything.

Since putting man-made sputniks or satellites into space since October 4, 1957, he feels like the lord of the universe, especially since his sputniks have not encountered the person of the invisible God in space between earth and sun. He has prospered to bringing one third of the earth under Communist forms of government, not knowing that God in the heavens laughs and permits this “till the indignation be at an end; for that which is determined will be accomplished.” In the “war of the great day of God the Almighty” Jehovah will bring his indignation and denunciation to an end. What will be accomplished there will be, not what the king of the north determined, but what Almighty God determined.</p>

As there is every reason to condemn Satan the Devil the god of this system of things, there is every reason to praise Jehovah the God of the new world.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 4, 5.

But this fear is not mixed with the fear of Jehovah. Besides fearing the things they discern as about to come upon the earth, they fear their visible gods, the mighty ones that they idolize in politics, in business, in militarism and in popular religion. These deified ones instill fear of themselves into the hearts of the populace to keep themselves prominent and in the power to control. To these the people ascribe the power and works and adoration that belong only to the one living and true God, Jehovah. The fear that the people have toward these earthly gods is merely a fear of awesome men, mere human creatures who will die. But Jehovah is to be “feared more than all other gods.” As he once executed judgment on all the false gods of Egypt, so he is now judging these earthly gods, to the point of exposing their utter inability and falsity. “God standeth in the congregation of God; he judgeth among the gods.” To the mighty, adored ones in Christendom who profess to be sons of the God of heaven he directs this message: “I said, Ye are gods, and all of you sons of the Most High.

<strong>Prehuman Existence</strong><br/><p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[64]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="64"><sup>64</sup></span> The very argument of Jesus here <span id="page566" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="566" data-before-text="566"></span>proves he did not claim to be God. Had he claimed to be God, then the Jews would have been right in stoning him for blasphemy. But Jesus argues that he claimed to be less than God. To prove this, Jesus quoted to them from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962683/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalm 82, verses 1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962683/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 6, 7</a> (<em>AV</em>) of which read: “God [<em>Elohím</em>] standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods [<em>elohím</em>]. How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? . . . I have said, Ye are gods [<em>elohím</em>]; and all of you are children of the most High. But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.” In this psalm the Most High God speaks to the unjust judges on earth, mere men, and calls them “gods,” or <em>elohím</em> in the Hebrew, and he tells them to correct their legal practice. Because those judges fail of their duty, it becomes necessary for the Most High God to arise and judge the peoples of the earth.</p><p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu">65. Despite their being “gods,” what will happen to those judges and for whose death were such kind of Jewish gods responsible?</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="65"><sup>65</sup></span> Their being called “gods” will not save these judges; neither will their considering themselves to be “sons of the Most High” or sons of God. That gives them no immortality. They are still mortal and will die just like other men. They will fall in death just like other judicial princes on earth, and this by the execution of God’s judgment. God’s word was against them in adverse judgment. It was human gods like these, among the Jews, that caused Jesus to be put to death at the hands of the Romans.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962683/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ex. 22:28</a>, <em>AV; Dy.</em></p><p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">66, 67.

Jesus said to them: “No one will snatch them [my sheep] out of my hand. What my Father has given me is something greater than all other things, and no one can snatch them out of the hand of the Father. I and the Father are one.”</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="67"><sup>67</sup></span> After Jesus said that, his very argument that followed proved that he was not claiming to be God, nor was he saying that he and his heavenly Father were one God, a trinitarian God in which he and his Father were two Persons along with a third Person, “God the Holy Ghost.” Jesus did not say, I and the Father and the Holy Ghost are one. He mentioned no “Holy Ghost.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962683/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">John 10:28-30</a>.</p><p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu">68.

How so? Because Jesus told those Jews that he was calling himself less than God his Father. He told those Jews that their own law in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962683/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Psalm 82:6</a> called the men against whom God’s word came in criticism “gods,” and that the Jews could not annul this scripture that called human judges by the title of “gods”; nor could they deny that this scripture said this, and they could not take this scripture out of the inspired Scriptures. And yet, when Jesus Christ, who performed so many wonderful good works among the Jews, spoke of God as his Father and spoke of himself as merely the Son of God, they said he blasphemed and were ready to stone him as a blasphemer.

How did the apostle John himself view such a prospect? How are we today to view it? Are we not deeply disappointed in the judicial system that obtains today, even in Christendom? In our time, as at no previous time, is when the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101973017/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 82:5</a> have come true as a prophecy with respect to men in a judicial capacity who are like “gods” but who have proved false to their office: “They have not known, and they do not understand; in darkness they keep walking about; all the foundations of the earth are made to totter.” Or, as the Roman Catholic Jerusalem Bible puts this Bible verse: “Ignorant and senseless, they carry on blindly, undermining the very basis of earthly society.”</p>

<strong>Son(s) of God</strong><br/><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb"><strong><em>False charge of blasphemy.</em></strong> Because of Jesus’ references to God as his Father, certain opposing Jews leveled the charge of blasphemy against him, saying, “You, although being a man, make yourself a god.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/116/0" data-bid="117-1" class="b">Joh 10:33</a>) Most translations here say “God”; Torrey’s translation lowercases the word as “god,” while the interlinear reading of <em>The Emphatic Diaglott</em> says “a god.” Support for the rendering “a god” is found principally in Jesus’ own answer, in which he quoted from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004182/117/0" data-bid="118-1" class="b">Psalm 82:1-7</a>.

<strong>The Death of a God</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">For holding himself up as a god, the “man of lawlessness” must be judged by Jehovah the Almighty God. Jesus Christ referred to the Psalms, which spoke of mighty men who were ranked as “gods.” These men, who were leaders and judges, were unjust men, and the psalm, addressing them as “gods,” goes ahead to say: “Surely you will die just as men do; and like any one of the princes you will fall!”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975324/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 82:1-7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975324/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> John 10:34-36</a>.</p>

<strong>Elohim</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">When applying to Jehovah, <em>ʼElo·himʹ</em> is used in the sense of majesty, dignity or excellence, and takes the singular verb, adjective and pronoun. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 7:9</a> it is used with an adjective in the singular number: <em>ʼElo·himʹ tsad·diqʹ,</em> ‘righteous God.’ On this Gesenius-Kautzsch’s <em>Hebrew Grammar,</em> 1949 edition, pages 398, 399, paragraph “g,” says: “The <em>pluralis excellentiae</em> or <em>maiestatis,</em> as has been remarked above, is properly a variety of the abstract plural, since it sums up the several characteristics belonging to the idea, besides <span id="page514" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="514" data-before-text="514"></span>possessing the secondary sense of an <em>intensification</em> of the original idea. It is thus closely related to the plurals of amplification, . . . which are mostly found in poetry. So especially <em>El·o·himʹ Godhead, God</em> (to be distinguished from the numerical plural <em>gods,</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Exodus 12:12</a>, &amp;c.). The supposition that <em>El·o·himʹ</em> is to be regarded as merely a remnant of earlier polytheistic views (that is, as originally only a numerical plural) is at least highly improbable, and, moreover, would not explain the analogous plurals. . . . That the language has entirely rejected the idea of numerical plurality in <em>El·o·himʹ</em> (whenever it denotes <em>one</em> God), is proved especially by its being almost invariably joined with a singular attribute . . . , for example, <em>El·o·himʹ tsad·diqʹ,</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 7:10</a> [9, English], &amp;c. Hence <em>El·o·himʹ</em> may have been used originally not only as a numerical but also as an abstract plural (corresponding to the Latin <em>numen,</em> and our <em>Godhead</em>), and, like other abstracts of the same kind, have been transferred to the concrete single god (even of the heathen).”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><em>The International Standard Bible Encyclopaedia,</em> Volume II, page 1265, comments: “It is characteristic of Heb[rew] that extension, magnitude and dignity, as well as actual multiplicity, are expressed by the pl[ural]. It is not reasonable, therefore, to assume that plurality of form indicates primitive Sem[itic] polytheism. On the contrary, historic Heb[rew] is unquestionably and uniformly monotheistic.” Moses wrote at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>: “Jehovah our God is one Jehovah.”</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">As applied to Jehovah, the title <em>ʼElo·himʹ</em> draws attention to him as the Creator.

Of this phrase, the above-quoted Gesenius’ <em>Hebrew Grammar</em> on p. 418, par. 2, says that it “properly means not <em>sons of god</em>(<em>s</em>), but beings of the class of <em>elohimʹ.” Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros,</em> by Koehler and Baumgartner (1953 ed.), page 134, says: “(<em>individual) divine beings, gods.”</em> And on page 51: <em>“the</em> (<em>single</em>) <em>gods</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Genesis 6:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Job 1:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 2:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/11/3" data-bid="12-4" class="b"> 38:7</a>.” Hence, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 8:5</a> it is rendered “angels,” <em>LXX;</em> “godlike ones,” <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>OTHERS</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The word <em>ʼelo·himʹ</em> is also used when referring to idol gods.

Furthermore, when trinitarians, who oppose polytheism, argue that <em>ʼElo·himʹ,</em> when referring to the true God, signifies the numerical plural “gods,” they make themselves polytheists, contrary to the definition of their trinity doctrine that there are three <em>persons</em> in <em>one God,</em> not three <em>gods.</em></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 82:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 6</a>, <em>ʼelo·himʹ</em> is used of men, human judges in Israel.

<strong>Son(s) of God</strong><br/><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sb">According to the context, those whom Jehovah called “gods” and “sons of the Most High” in this psalm were Israelite judges who had been practicing <span id="page1531" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1531" data-before-text="1531"></span>injustice, requiring that Jehovah himself now judge ‘in the middle of such gods.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014086/104/0" data-bid="105-1" class="b">Ps. 82:1-6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014086/104/1" data-bid="105-2" class="b"> 8</a>) Since Jehovah applied these terms to those men, Jesus was certainly guilty of no blasphemy in saying, “I am God’s Son.” Whereas the works of those judicial “gods” belied their claim to being “sons of the Most High,” Jesus’ works consistently proved him to be in union, in harmonious accord and relationship, with his Father.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014086/105/0" data-bid="106-1" class="b">John 10:34-38</a>.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Prehuman Existence</strong><br/><p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[64]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="64"><sup>64</sup></span> The very argument of Jesus here <span id="page566" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="566" data-before-text="566"></span>proves he did not claim to be God. Had he claimed to be God, then the Jews would have been right in stoning him for blasphemy. But Jesus argues that he claimed to be less than God. To prove this, Jesus quoted to them from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962683/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalm 82, verses 1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962683/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 6, 7</a> (<em>AV</em>) of which read: “God [<em>Elohím</em>] standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods [<em>elohím</em>]. How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? . . . I have said, Ye are gods [<em>elohím</em>]; and all of you are children of the most High. But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.” In this psalm the Most High God speaks to the unjust judges on earth, mere men, and calls them “gods,” or <em>elohím</em> in the Hebrew, and he tells them to correct their legal practice. Because those judges fail of their duty, it becomes necessary for the Most High God to arise and judge the peoples of the earth.</p><p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu">65. Despite their being “gods,” what will happen to those judges and for whose death were such kind of Jewish gods responsible?</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="65"><sup>65</sup></span> Their being called “gods” will not save these judges; neither will their considering themselves to be “sons of the Most High” or sons of God. That gives them no immortality. They are still mortal and will die just like other men. They will fall in death just like other judicial princes on earth, and this by the execution of God’s judgment. God’s word was against them in adverse judgment. It was human gods like these, among the Jews, that caused Jesus to be put to death at the hands of the Romans.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962683/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ex. 22:28</a>, <em>AV; Dy.</em></p><p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">66, 67.

Jesus said to them: “No one will snatch them [my sheep] out of my hand. What my Father has given me is something greater than all other things, and no one can snatch them out of the hand of the Father. I and the Father are one.”</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="67"><sup>67</sup></span> After Jesus said that, his very argument that followed proved that he was not claiming to be God, nor was he saying that he and his heavenly Father were one God, a trinitarian God in which he and his Father were two Persons along with a third Person, “God the Holy Ghost.” Jesus did not say, I and the Father and the Holy Ghost are one. He mentioned no “Holy Ghost.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962683/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">John 10:28-30</a>.</p><p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu">68.

How so? Because Jesus told those Jews that he was calling himself less than God his Father.

And yet, when Jesus Christ, who performed so many wonderful good works among the Jews, spoke of God as his Father and spoke of himself as merely the Son of God, they said he blasphemed and were ready to stone him as a blasphemer. Still he was more than those men whom <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962683/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Psalm 82</a> had called “gods,” because he, Jesus, was the one whom the heavenly Father had sanctified and sent into the world.

Since unjust judges on earth against whom God’s word of judgment came were Scripturally called “gods” (<em>elohím</em>), the Word or Logos whom God has appointed to be a just Judge and by whom God’s word has come to us is also Scripturally called “a god.” He is more mighty than human judges.</p>

These deified ones instill fear of themselves into the hearts of the populace to keep themselves prominent and in the power to control. To these the people ascribe the power and works and adoration that belong only to the one living and true God, Jehovah. The fear that the people have toward these earthly gods is merely a fear of awesome men, mere human creatures who will die. But Jehovah is to be “feared more than all other gods.” As he once executed judgment on all the false gods of Egypt, so he is now judging these earthly gods, to the point of exposing their utter inability and falsity. “God standeth in the congregation of God; he judgeth among the gods.” To the mighty, adored ones in Christendom who profess to be sons of the God of heaven he directs this message: “I said, Ye are gods, and all of you sons of the Most High.

How could they, since they received their “theology,” not from pagan sources, but from God himself, who made plain man’s mortal nature both by warning him of death in the event he sinned and by sentencing him, after he had sinned, to return to the dust from which man had been taken.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. 2:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 3:19</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><em>Enósh</em> always has an unfavorable connotation and, therefore, is never used in a complimentary sense. Fittingly, it is frequently coupled with <em>adám,</em> human, when man is contrasted with his immortal Maker, Jehovah God. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalms 8:4 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Ps 144:3</a> are typical of this coupling of <em>enósh</em> with <em>adám</em> when contrasting man with God. Thus also Moses wrote: “You make mortal man [<em>enósh</em>] go back to crushed matter, and you say: ‘Go back, you sons of men [<em>adám</em>].’” Because of the wickedness of man God warned that he would make <em>‘enósh</em> scarcer than refined gold and <em>adám</em> scarcer than the gold of Ophir.’ Putting both <em>enósh</em> and <em>adám</em> in their places are the words of Jehovah to Isaiah: “I myself am the One that is comforting you people. Who are you that you should be afraid of a mortal man [<em>enósh</em>] that will die, and of a son of mankind [<em>adám</em>] that will be rendered as mere green grass?

<strong>Prehuman Existence</strong><br/><p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[64]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="64"><sup>64</sup></span> The very argument of Jesus here <span id="page566" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="566" data-before-text="566"></span>proves he did not claim to be God. Had he claimed to be God, then the Jews would have been right in stoning him for blasphemy. But Jesus argues that he claimed to be less than God. To prove this, Jesus quoted to them from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962683/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalm 82, verses 1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962683/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 6, 7</a> (<em>AV</em>) of which read: “God [<em>Elohím</em>] standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods [<em>elohím</em>]. How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? . . . I have said, Ye are gods [<em>elohím</em>]; and all of you are children of the most High. But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.” In this psalm the Most High God speaks to the unjust judges on earth, mere men, and calls them “gods,” or <em>elohím</em> in the Hebrew, and he tells them to correct their legal practice. Because those judges fail of their duty, it becomes necessary for the Most High God to arise and judge the peoples of the earth.</p><p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu">65.

That gives them no immortality. They are still mortal and will die just like other men. They will fall in death just like other judicial princes on earth, and this by the execution of God’s judgment. God’s word was against them in adverse judgment. It was human gods like these, among the Jews, that caused Jesus to be put to death at the hands of the Romans.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962683/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ex. 22:28</a>, <em>AV; Dy.</em></p><p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">66, 67.

Jesus said to them: “No one will snatch them [my sheep] out of my hand. What my Father has given me is something greater than all other things, and no one can snatch them out of the hand of the Father. I and the Father are one.”</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="67"><sup>67</sup></span> After Jesus said that, his very argument that followed proved that he was not claiming to be God, nor was he saying that he and his heavenly Father were one God, a trinitarian God in which he and his Father were two Persons along with a third Person, “God the Holy Ghost.” Jesus did not say, I and the Father and the Holy Ghost are one. He mentioned no “Holy Ghost.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962683/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">John 10:28-30</a>.</p><p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu">68.

And yet, when Jesus Christ, who performed so many wonderful good works among the Jews, spoke of God as his Father and spoke of himself as merely the Son of God, they said he blasphemed and were ready to stone him as a blasphemer.

More and more these witnesses are learning to know how great Jehovah is. With their own growth in knowledge they appreciate more that He is very much to be praised.

But this fear is not mixed with the fear of Jehovah. Besides fearing the things they discern as about to come upon the earth, they fear their visible gods, the mighty ones that they idolize in politics, in business, in militarism and in popular religion. These deified ones instill fear of themselves into the hearts of the populace to keep themselves prominent and in the power to control. To these the people ascribe the power and works and adoration that belong only to the one living and true God, Jehovah. The fear that the people have toward these earthly gods is merely a fear of awesome men, mere human creatures who will die. But Jehovah is to be “feared more than all other gods.” As he once executed judgment on all the false gods of Egypt, so he is now judging these earthly gods, to the point of exposing their utter inability and falsity. “God standeth in the congregation of God; he judgeth among the gods.” To the mighty, adored ones in Christendom who profess to be sons of the God of heaven he directs this message: “I said, Ye are gods, and all of you sons of the Most High.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/85/0" data-bid="86-1" class="b">Acts 6:6</a>) Timothy was appointed to a position of oversight by the body of older men in the congregation.

<strong>Tyre—A Treacherous City</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">But friendly relations between Tyre and God’s covenant people Israel did not continue. Treacherously, Tyre eventually allied herself with Israel’s enemies. The inspired psalmist wrote: “Against your [God’s] people they plot craftily; they conspire against those whom you protect. They say, ‘Come, let us destroy their nation; let the name of Israel be remembered no more!’ Yes, they consult together with one mind, and against you they are allied: The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the people of Hagar, Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, Philistia, with the inhabitants of Tyre.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976448/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 83:4-8</a>, <em>New American Bible.</em></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The treachery of Tyre went to the point where her slave markets were selling Israelites to the Greeks and the Edomites. There being no Scriptural reference to any direct warfare between Tyre and Israel, those sold may have been taken as captives by other peoples, thereafter coming into the hands of Tyrian slave traders. Or, it may be that the Tyrians made slaves of fleeing Israelites who sought refuge in Tyre and its vicinity.</p>

<strong>A Strong Refuge Today</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Encourage yourself in his name by calling to mind what it means and what is involved in it. It is very necessary to encourage and strengthen ourselves. Of King David it is written: “And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, . . . but David strengthened himself in Jehovah his God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952727/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Sam. 30:6</a>, <em>AS</em>) He would call to mind that he had asked Jehovah whether he should go and smite the Philistines, and had been told to go, and now the Amalekites had made their raid and wrought much havoc; so he strengthened himself. (See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952727/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 42:6-8</a>.) We must do the same thing. It is so necessary <span id="page597" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="597" data-before-text="597"></span>to call to mind the course we have taken, how it was tested to the best of our ability to make sure it was in harmony with God’s will, and, being assured, we stand firm. Then trust, be confident, do not doubt, realize fully the name Jehovah can be relied upon as a strong tower, and in it we are safe.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 5. Mention some of the promises Jehovah has made in which we must have confidence. Why must our trust be complete?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Remember how the name stands for the Eternal One. He who does whatever he pleases, the all-powerful, all-wise, ever-loving Supreme Sovereign. This God is our God, our protector at all times. His eye never sleeps, his ear is always open and he can never be caught off guard. Recall some of his promises, such as: “He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of Jehovah, He is my refuge and my fortress; my God, in whom I trust. For thou, O Jehovah, art my refuge! Thou hast made the Most High thy habitation; there shall no evil befall thee, . . . He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble: I will deliver him, and honor him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952727/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 91:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952727/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 9, 10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952727/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 15</a>, <em>AS</em>) These true, Jehovah-given promises are to encourage his people in all extremities, pressures, troubles, assaults, and dangers. So, they may have assurance to put confidence in him. The name is an invisible fortress, and by relying completely on what the name means we are thereby putting ourselves in the strong tower. But our trust must be entire. His mercy and faithfulness will be our portion if we claim it.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 6. What are some of the scriptures showing opposition to God’s people from the nations? and how has this been fulfilled in a measure?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Opposition to us is national and international, for this world hates Jehovah and his people. This is described in the Psalms: “Why do the nations rage, and the peoples meditate a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against Jehovah, and against his anointed, saying, Let us break their bonds asunder, and cast away their cords from us.” “Forget not the voice of thine adversaries: the tumult of those that rise up against thee ascendeth continually.” “For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult; and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. They take crafty counsel against thy people, and consult together against thy hidden ones. They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952727/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 2:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952727/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 74:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952727/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 83:2-4</a>, <em>AS</em>) The enemies of Jehovah have tried more than once to cut God’s people off, one recent attempt being 1917-1918. It failed, for Jehovah heard the cry of those trusting in him and rescued them from the pit of death. Again, in 1933, when the sadistic demonized boasters, with the infamous, abominable Nazi organization, broke into the ranks of Jehovah’s people, they did their utmost to destroy them. They failed miserably, for those in Jehovah’s organization trusted in the name, and these enemies were cut off. Then again in 1939, and during World War II, the enemies of God’s kingdom tried to cut them off by their inhuman persecution, prisons, bans, tortures and deaths. Again they failed to cut off the holy nation, which was strictly holding to the truth. This nation had come to know the name and what it meant, and was trusting in it.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 7.

<strong>Birth of the Royal Nation on a Newborn Land</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> Is there a modern counterpart of the “birth” of the restored Israelites as a “nation” in 537 BCE? Yes, for in the year following the first world war of 1914-1918 a spiritual “nation” was born, under the Greater Cyrus, the enthroned King Jesus Christ! How so? Well, during the war the headquarters of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, the publication agency of the International Bible Students, had been dismantled at Brooklyn, New York, and moved back to smaller quarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Its latest pieces of literature had been banned in Canada and the United States of America, and the Society’s president, its secretary-treasurer, and six other members of the headquarters’ staff of workers had been sentenced in 1918 to long terms of imprisonment. The intent of the enemies behind all of this was like that expressed in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982486/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Psalm 83:4</a>: “Let us efface them from being a nation, that the name of Israel may be remembered no more.” But in the spring of 1919, to the shocking surprise of Christendom, there came release! That same year the persecuted International Bible Students held their first postwar convention in Cedar Point, Ohio. To the conventioners the publication of a new magazine, in addition to the <em>Watch Tower</em> magazine, was announced, namely, <em>The Golden Age</em> (now called <em>Awake!</em>).</p>

<strong>Tyre—A Treacherous City</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">But friendly relations between Tyre and God’s covenant people Israel did not continue. Treacherously, Tyre eventually allied herself with Israel’s enemies. The inspired psalmist wrote: “Against your [God’s] people they plot craftily; they conspire against those whom you protect. They say, ‘Come, let us destroy their nation; let the name of Israel be remembered no more!’ Yes, they consult together with one mind, and against you they are allied: The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the people of Hagar, Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, Philistia, with the inhabitants of Tyre.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976448/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 83:4-8</a>, <em>New American Bible.</em></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The treachery of Tyre went to the point where her slave markets were selling Israelites to the Greeks and the Edomites. There being no Scriptural reference to any direct warfare between Tyre and Israel, those sold may have been taken as captives by other peoples, thereafter coming into the hands of Tyrian slave traders. Or, it may be that the Tyrians made slaves of fleeing Israelites who sought refuge in Tyre and its vicinity.</p>

<strong>Moab</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Unlike Mesha’s propagandistic inscription, the Scriptures report that the Moabites suffered humiliating defeat. Enlisting the aid of King Jehoshaphat of Judah and the king of Edom in putting down the Moabite revolt, Jehoram (who became king of Israel about two years after Ahab’s death) marched against Moab from the S, by way of the wilderness of Edom. But the allied armies and their animals almost perished for lack of water. The prophet Elisha’s aid was then sought and, in fulfillment of his prophecy that Jehovah would help on account of Jehoshaphat, the torrent valley became filled with water. The next morning the reflection of the sun upon the water made it look like blood to the Moabites. Wrongly concluding that the allied armies had slaughtered one another, the Moabites abandoned all caution and came to the Israelite camp, only to be put to flight. As the <span id="page1171" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1171" data-before-text="1171"></span>battle progressed Moabite cities were ruined, good tracts of land were filled with stones, trees were cut down and springs were stopped up. When King Mesha found himself penned up in the city of Kir-hareseth with the battle going against him, he, with seven hundred men, unsuccessfully tried to break through to the king of Edom. Finally he took his firstborn son and offered him up as a burnt sacrifice upon the wall. For this or some other reason there “came to be great indignation against Israel” and the siege was abandoned.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">2 Ki. 3:6-27</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">As this humiliating defeat did not take place on foreign soil but brought devastation to the land of Moab, reasonably a considerable period of time would have been required for recovery.

One Jewish tradition, though, does link the event mentioned by Amos with the war waged against Mesha and claims that sometime after this conflict the Moabites dug up the bones of the king of Edom and then burned them for lime. But the Bible record provides no basis for determining the time involved.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/66/0" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Isaiah (chaps. 15 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/66/1" data-bid="67-2" class="b"> 16</a>), apparently around the time of King Ahaz’s death and while Assyria dominated in the eighth century B.C.E., referred to one Moabite city after another as being in line for calamity.

However, there is evidence that Moab did come under the Assyrian yoke. Assyrian King Tiglath-pileser III mentions Salamanu of Moab among those paying tribute to him. Sennacherib claims to have received tribute from Kammusunadbi the king of Moab. And Assyrian monarchs Esar-haddon and Ashurbanipal refer to Moabite Kings Musuri and Kamashaltu as being subject to them. There is also archaeological evidence that many places in Moab were depopulated about the eighth century B.C.E.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">Jeremiah’s prophecy of the seventh century B.C.E. pointed to the time when Jehovah would hold an accounting against Moab (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/68/0" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Jer. 9:25, 26</a>), doing so by means of the Babylonians under King Nebuchadnezzar.

The house of Judah is like all the other nations.” For thus failing to recognize that the judgment was really God’s and that the inhabitants of Judah were his people, the Moabites were to experience disaster and thereby ‘come to know Jehovah.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/71/0" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Ezek. 25:8-11</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/72/0" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Ezekiel 24:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">The Jewish historian Josephus writes that, in the fifth year after desolating Jerusalem, Nebuchadnezzar returned to war against Coelesyria, Ammon and Moab and thereafter attacked Egypt. (<em>Antiquities of the Jews,</em> Book X, chap.

From the sixth century on, nomads wandered through the land until political and economic factors made sedentary life possible again in the last centuries B.C.”—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/73/0" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Ezekiel 25:8-11</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">Later, in fulfillment of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/74/0" data-bid="75-1" class="b">Jeremiah 48:47</a>, Cyrus, the conqueror of Babylon, likely permitted Moabite exiles to return to their homeland.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">The accurate fulfillment of the prophecies concerning Moab cannot be denied. Centuries ago the Moabites ceased to exist as a people. Today what are considered to have been such Moabite cities as Nebo, Heshbon, Aroer, Beth-gamul and Baal-meon are represented by ruins. Many other places are now unknown.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">The sole explanation for the disappearance of the Moabites as a people is provided by the Bible. Noted the <em>Encyclopædia Britannica</em> (11th ed., Vol. XVIII, p. 632): “Israel remained a great power in religious history while Moab disappeared. It is true that Moab was continuously hard pressed by desert hordes; the exposed condition of the land is emphasized by the chains of ruined forts and castles which even the Romans were compelled to construct. The explanation of the comparative insignificance of Moab, however, is not to be found in purely topographical considerations. Nor can it be sought in political history, since Israel and Judah suffered as much from external movements as Moab itself. The explanation is to be found within Israel itself, in factors . . . to be found in the work of the prophets.”</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">In view of the disappearance of the Moabites as a people, the inclusion of Moab at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/75/0" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Daniel 11:41</a> among nations in the “time of the end” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/76/0" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Dan. 11:40</a>) is logically to be regarded in a figurative sense.

<strong>Reasons for National Happiness</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Since race and nationality of a person according to the flesh no longer determined whom God could induct into this new nation, the ties that bound these members together as fellow citizens of one nation were spiritual. It was a spiritual nation. It was not only anointed with God’s holy spirit to proclaim everywhere the good news of God’s kingdom but also begotten of God’s spirit to be God’s spiritual children, <span id="page694" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="694" data-before-text="694"></span>with the hope and promise of membership in God’s heavenly kingdom with Jesus Christ. For that reason the apostle Paul could write to them and say: “As for us, our citizenship exists in the heavens, from which place also we are eagerly waiting for a savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968843/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Phil. 3:20</a>) This “holy nation,” therefore, is the spiritual Israel of God.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu">15.

Consequently, when the Roman legions under General Titus destroyed Jerusalem and its temple and devastated the land of Judea and thus the nation of natural, circumcised Israel was destroyed, there was no need for Jehovah God to give a rebirth to that rejected nation, either back there or today. At the destruction of the Jewish nation in the year 70 C.E. Jehovah God had already had for thirty-seven years his “holy nation” of spiritual Israel.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu">16.

To the praise and glory of Jehovah God and owing to his protection and preservation, a remnant of this spiritual “Israel of God” does exist today, and it is experiencing the unspeakable happiness of the “nation whose God is Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968843/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 33:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968843/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Gal. 6:16</a>.</p>

<strong>A Strong Refuge Today</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Encourage yourself in his name by calling to mind what it means and what is involved in it. It is very necessary to encourage and strengthen ourselves. Of King David it is written: “And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, . . . but David strengthened himself in Jehovah his God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952727/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Sam. 30:6</a>, <em>AS</em>) He would call to mind that he had asked Jehovah whether he should go and smite the Philistines, and had been told to go, and now the Amalekites had made their raid and wrought much havoc; so he strengthened himself. (See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952727/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 42:6-8</a>.) We must do the same thing. It is so necessary <span id="page597" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="597" data-before-text="597"></span>to call to mind the course we have taken, how it was tested to the best of our ability to make sure it was in harmony with God’s will, and, being assured, we stand firm. Then trust, be confident, do not doubt, realize fully the name Jehovah can be relied upon as a strong tower, and in it we are safe.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 5. Mention some of the promises Jehovah has made in which we must have confidence. Why must our trust be complete?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Remember how the name stands for the Eternal One. He who does whatever he pleases, the all-powerful, all-wise, ever-loving Supreme Sovereign. This God is our God, our protector at all times. His eye never sleeps, his ear is always open and he can never be caught off guard. Recall some of his promises, such as: “He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of Jehovah, He is my refuge and my fortress; my God, in whom I trust. For thou, O Jehovah, art my refuge! Thou hast made the Most High thy habitation; there shall no evil befall thee, . . . He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble: I will deliver him, and honor him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952727/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 91:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952727/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 9, 10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952727/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 15</a>, <em>AS</em>) These true, Jehovah-given promises are to encourage his people in all extremities, pressures, troubles, assaults, and dangers. So, they may have assurance to put confidence in him. The name is an invisible fortress, and by relying completely on what the name means we are thereby putting ourselves in the strong tower. But our trust must be entire. His mercy and faithfulness will be our portion if we claim it.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 6. What are some of the scriptures showing opposition to God’s people from the nations? and how has this been fulfilled in a measure?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Opposition to us is national and international, for this world hates Jehovah and his people. This is described in the Psalms: “Why do the nations rage, and the peoples meditate a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against Jehovah, and against his anointed, saying, Let us break their bonds asunder, and cast away their cords from us.” “Forget not the voice of thine adversaries: the tumult of those that rise up against thee ascendeth continually.” “For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult; and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. They take crafty counsel against thy people, and consult together against thy hidden ones. They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952727/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 2:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952727/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 74:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952727/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 83:2-4</a>, <em>AS</em>) The enemies of Jehovah have tried more than once to cut God’s people off, one recent attempt being 1917-1918. It failed, for Jehovah heard the cry of those trusting in him and rescued them from the pit of death. Again, in 1933, when the sadistic demonized boasters, with the infamous, abominable Nazi organization, broke into the ranks of Jehovah’s people, they did their utmost to destroy them. They failed miserably, for those in Jehovah’s organization trusted in the name, and these enemies were cut off. Then again in 1939, and during World War II, the enemies of God’s kingdom tried to cut them off by their inhuman persecution, prisons, bans, tortures and deaths. Again they failed to cut off the holy nation, which was strictly holding to the truth. This nation had come to know the name and what it meant, and was trusting in it.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 7. To make Jehovah’s purposes our purposes involves what?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Some of Jehovah’s people suffered bitterly, and some were put to death by their enemies, but the purpose of Jehovah has not been hindered and the destiny of the faithful is sure—just as sure as Abraham’s, David’s, Daniel’s, and many others’. They all died in faith, knowing his name. We all <span id="page598" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="598" data-before-text="598"></span>must understand as these did that our interests must be completely submerged in Jehovah’s purposes. As long as these prosper we are happy, whether we live or die, for our everlasting life is assured to us if faithful. No promise has been made that we shall never on any account be persecuted or hurt mentally or physically. Indeed, all the faithful before this time have suffered, and Paul’s warning is: “In fact, all those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952727/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:12</a>, <em>NW</em>) But we have been definitely promised protection if we trust in Jehovah with all our heart.</p>

<strong>Tyre—A Treacherous City</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">But friendly relations between Tyre and God’s covenant people Israel did not continue. Treacherously, Tyre eventually allied herself with Israel’s enemies. The inspired psalmist wrote: “Against your [God’s] people they plot craftily; they conspire against those whom you protect. They say, ‘Come, let us destroy their nation; let the name of Israel be remembered no more!’ Yes, they consult together with one mind, and against you they are allied: The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the people of Hagar, Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, Philistia, with the inhabitants of Tyre.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976448/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 83:4-8</a>, <em>New American Bible.</em></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The treachery of Tyre went to the point where her slave markets were selling Israelites to the Greeks and the Edomites. There being no Scriptural reference to any direct warfare between Tyre and Israel, those sold may have been taken as captives by other peoples, thereafter coming into the hands of Tyrian slave traders. Or, it may be that the Tyrians made slaves of fleeing Israelites who sought refuge in Tyre and its vicinity.</p>

He weaves together two decisive victories of Israel over its enemies near the ancient city of Megiddo, which dominated a valley plain of the same name. During the summer, the dry bed of the Kishon River can be seen winding through the valley plain. After a winter downpour, the river floods the plain. Perhaps for that reason, the river is also called “the waters of Megiddo.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008763/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Judg. 4:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008763/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 5:19</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> About ten miles <strong>[15 km]</strong> across the valley from Megiddo lies the hill of Moreh where in the days of Judge Gideon, the combined troops of Midianites, Amalekites, and Easterners gathered to wage war.

How? Following God’s direction, they surrounded the enemy camp at night holding jars that concealed flaming torches. When Gideon gave the signal, his men smashed the jars and the hidden torches were suddenly revealed. At the same time, they blew their horns and shouted: “Jehovah’s sword and Gideon’s!” The enemy were thrown into confusion, and they turned to killing one another; survivors fled across the Jordan River. Meanwhile, more Israelites joined in pursuit of the enemy. Altogether, 120,000 enemy soldiers were slaughtered.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008763/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Judg. 7:19-25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008763/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 8:10</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Some four miles <strong>[6 km]</strong> beyond the hill of Moreh, across the valley from Megiddo, lies <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>Mount Tabor. There, Judge Barak had earlier gathered 10,000 Israelite troops to confront the army of Jabin, the Canaanite king of Hazor, under the command of his military chief Sisera. This Canaanite army had 900 war chariots equipped with deadly long blades of iron that turned with the wheels. As Israel’s poorly equipped troops assembled on Mount Tabor, Sisera’s army was lured into the valley. Then, “Jehovah began to throw Sisera and all his war chariots and all the camp into confusion.” Likely, a sudden downpour of rain caused the chariots to get bogged down because of the overflowing Kishon River. The entire army was slaughtered by the Israelites.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008763/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Judg. 4:13-16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008763/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 5:19-21</a>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">15.

That name reminds us of the dramatic battles that took place near Megiddo. Jehovah’s victory in those ancient wars assures us of his certain triumph in the battle of Armageddon.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008763/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Rev. 16:13-16</a>.</p>

<strong>Megiddo—Ancient Battleground With Prophetic Meaning</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">According to the Bible account, Judge Barak of Israel was commanded by God to station 10,000 armed men on Mount Tabor. An impressive number? Perhaps. But the 10,000 volunteers were woefully underequipped. “A shield could not be seen, nor a lance.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986126/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Judges 5:8</a>) Not so with the opponent, however. Led by General Sisera, the Canaanite army was equipped with the very latest in military technology: “Nine hundred war chariots with iron scythes.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986126/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Judges 4:3</a>) These gave the Canaanites the edge in speed and maneuverability and also an enormous psychological advantage.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Victory, though, was not to be the fruit of military prowess and equipment. Sisera’s vastly superior troops were lured into the then-dry torrent valley of Kishon. Jehovah gave Barak the signal to descend. Just picture 10,000 men streaming down the mountain into the valley plain! But then, unexpectedly, Jehovah caused a thunderstorm. Wind and rain now lashed into the face of the enemy. The Kishon River valley was turned into a raging torrent, immobilizing Sisera’s war chariots in a sea of mud. Thrown into confusion, Sisera’s troops fled in terror, only to be pursued and executed. “Not as much as one remained.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986126/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Judges, chapters 4 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986126/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 5</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">No wonder this stunning victory inspired the words: “Thus let all your enemies perish, O Jehovah, and let your lovers be as when the sun goes forth in its mightiness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986126/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Judges 5:31</a>) Note, however, that word “thus.” It suggested that the battle was prophetic, pointing forward to a greater war in which all enemies of God would perish.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">However, the hostile peoples surrounding Israel quickly forgot this disastrous encounter. Only 47 years later a combination of nations under the lead of Midian “gathered together as one and proceeded to . . . camp in the low plain of Jezreel,” the valley extending from Megiddo. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986126/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Judges 6:33</a>) These encamped enemies <span id="page22" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>were “as numerous as locusts.” This time, however, the army of Israel was only a small but courageous band of 300 men, standing “all around the camp” under the leadership of Gideon. At a signal, the 300 blew horns, loudly smashed water jars, waved torches, and let out a terrifying war cry: “Jehovah’s sword and Gideon’s!” The Midianites panicked! “Jehovah proceeded to set the sword of each one against the other,” and Gideon’s tiny band completed the rout!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986126/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Judges, chapter 7</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">We today dare not make the mistake of the Midianites nor shrug off the significance of Megiddo. Some 12 times the Bible speaks of this ancient battle site. Further, Bible prophecy indicates that what took place at Megiddo has serious implications for our day. Let us therefore take a look at what both the Bible and archaeology say about this historic place.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>Crossroads of the Ancient World</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Megiddo, along with the cities of Hazor and Gezer, once dominated a major military and trade route connecting Asia and Africa. Megiddo lay between the other two cities and hence was the one most strategically located. From all directions natural gateways, mountain passes, and roads converged into her valley plain. “Megiddo,” explains <em>The Geography of the Bible,</em> “stood at a crossroads, in fact at one of the great crossroads of the ancient world.”</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Megiddo dominated a large valley plain extending some 20 miles (32 km) along the northeastern side of the Carmel mountain range. During the rainy winter, water descending from the surrounding mountains caused the nearby Kishon River to swell. Thus the region is also called “the torrent valley of Kishon.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986126/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Judges 4:13</a>) Says the book <em>Geography of Israel:</em> “With the winter rains” the soil of the valley “is liable to turn into deep mud. . . . The [K]ishon’s gradient is very small, and the outlet . . . easily blocked; swamps thus spread here.” Sisera and his armies found out just how muddy this plain can get. Nevertheless, in the dry summer, this open plain was an ideal place for chariots to train for war. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986126/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Song of Solomon 6:11, 12</a>.) Military troops could also assemble conveniently there.</p>

<strong>Megiddo—Ancient Battleground With Prophetic Meaning</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">What, then, is “Har–Magedon”? It is obviously figurative. Drawing on Megiddo’s history as the site of decisive battles, Revelation uses it to picture the approaching <em>situation</em> when hatred for God’s people by “all the nations” will reach a climax. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986126/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 24:9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986126/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 14</a>) Because true Christians continue loyally to support God’s Kingdom, earth’s rulers will unite and, in effect, “assemble” to destroy them.

At the crucial moment, this heavenly King together with “the armies . . . in heaven” will intervene and attack “the kings of the earth and their armies.” This global battle will be decisive, just like those fought at Megiddo. All earthly foes will “perish,” even as the victory song of Deborah and Barak prophesied!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986126/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Revelation 19:11-21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986126/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Judges 5:31</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Will you be found among Jehovah’s lovers​—or among his enemies?

<strong>Gideon—Modest and Valiant Fighter for Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The rout of the Midianites was so complete and devastating that Gideon was able to judge Israel for forty years without needing to resort to war again. Out of appreciation for what Gideon had done, the men of Israel asked him to establish his family as a ruling dynasty: “Rule over us, you and your son and your grandson as well, for you have saved us out of the hand <span id="page252" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="252" data-before-text="252"></span>of Midian.” But, no, Gideon, modest warrior that he was, wanted none of the pomp and creature worship that went with man-made royalty: “I myself shall not rule over you, nor will my son rule over you. Jehovah is the one who will rule over you.” He was content to remain a judge, a servant of God and of the people as they needed him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966283/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Judg. 8:22, 23</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">However, Gideon did suggest that they contribute of the gold jewelry they had gained as the spoils of war, which they did and with which he made an ephod. Although he no doubt had this ephod made with all good intentions, in the end it proved to be a snare to all Israel, including Gideon and his household. Apparently the Israelites idolized it as they idolized the copper serpent that Moses had hoisted in the wilderness. So the record of Gideon is not without one serious flaw—again eloquent testimony of the candor of Bible writers.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966283/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Judg. 8:24-27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966283/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 18:4</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>LESSONS FOR US TODAY</strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">There is much profit to be gained from considering the Bible record of Judge Gideon. Even as Gideon was a man of faith, trusting in Jehovah God though faced with tremendous odds, so must Christians today have strong faith, for they also are greatly outnumbered by an unbelieving and hostile world. Even as Gideon was shown to be modest from beginning to the end, so Christians today must be ever modest, ‘not thinking more highly of themselves than it is necessary to think.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966283/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Rom. 12:3</a>) And just as Gideon showed himself cautious throughout, so Christians must be cautious. They want to be sure of the things they believe, even as did the ancient Beroeans; and when faced with those who would interfere with their worship, they heed Jesus’ words to be ‘cautious as serpents.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966283/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Matt. 10:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966283/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Acts 17:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966283/21/2" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> 1 Thess. 5:21</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">The record of Gideon and his 300 is also of prophetic significance to Christians, for from it we can draw parallels in our day. Thus just as Israel came to be in bondage because of laxness in their worship of Jehovah, so Jehovah’s people in modern times for a period came to be in bondage to Satan’s agents because of laxness as to pure worship. And as Gideon back there proved to be a breaker of idols, so Christians today expose the idolatry in Christendom, literal and symbolic, both statues of saints and such organizational idols as the United Nations.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Further, as Jehovah provided Gideon back there to deliver his people, he has provided the Greater Gideon, Jesus Christ, to deliver his people today. Then again, as back there tests revealed those who were deserving of sharing in the initial striking victory by weeding out those who were fearful or lacking in vigilance, so in modern times Jehovah has permitted tests that have caused the fearful and negligent to fall by the way. And, finally, as the combined forces of Israel were used by Jehovah to destroy the invading hosts of Midian and their cohorts, so Jesus Christ and all his heavenly forces, including those of spiritual Israel, will destroy all the enemies of Jehovah God and of his people, in line with the inspired prayer of the psalmist: “Do to them as to Midian . . . As for their nobles, make these like Oreb and like Zeeb, and like Zebah and like Zalmunnah . . . that people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966283/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ps. 83:9-18</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Truly the account of Gideon and his 300 is part of ‘all Scripture inspired of God,’ and it ‘is beneficial for teaching us so that as Christians we may be competent, completely equipped for every good work’; and, in particular, that we might be strong in faith and vigilant, yet modest and cautious!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966283/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:16, 17</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Barak—Judge and Deliverer of Israel</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">There is more to this inspired account; it is also of prophetic import. How can we be certain of this? Because the discomfiture and defeat of Sisera and his forces took place on the plains of Megiddo, the first of the battles to make that place famous and which battles have served as symbols of the battle of the great day of God the Almighty, Armageddon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966566/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Rev. 16:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966566/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 16</a>) This is further borne out by the prophetic prayer of the psalmist: “Do to them as to . . . Sisera, as to Jabin at the torrent valley of Kishon. They were annihilated <span id="page477" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="477" data-before-text="477"></span>at Endor; they became manure for the ground.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966566/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 83:9, 10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966566/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966566/20/2" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> Jer. 25:33</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Since the one successfully fighting the battle at Armageddon for Jehovah and his name will be Jesus Christ, together with his heavenly hosts, it follows that Barak pictures Jesus Christ. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966566/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Rev. 2:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966566/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 19:11-21</a>) King Jabin of Canaan, chief oppressor of Israel, would well picture Satan the Devil, the chief oppressor of God’s people, while his agents on earth that do his bidding would well be pictured by General Sisera. What about Jael? Whom does she picture?</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Not being of the nation of Israel, she would picture someone else than the spiritual Israelites. Logically she would picture the “great crowd” that the apostle John saw after he had seen the 144,000 of spiritual Israel, and which crowd came out of all nations, peoples and languages. These share in praising Jehovah God and show their loyalty to the greater Barak, Jesus Christ, and to spiritual Israel by treating Satan’s agents as dead.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966566/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Rev. 7:9-17</a>.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966566/1">b</a></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Truly, what was written aforetime does serve to strengthen our faith, encouraging us and throwing light on our pathway!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966566/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 119:105</a>.</p>

In that attack, opposers may greedily seize the property and possessions of Jehovah’s people, as enemies have done in the past. Satan’s main goal, however, has always been to break us up as a people so that our God-given name will be remembered no more. How does Jehovah react to such defiance of his sovereignty?

In those lands, the steadfastness and endurance of worshippers of the one true God have served as a witness to righthearted ones, and many have ‘searched for Jehovah’s name.’ In a number of lands where Jehovah’s Witnesses were once viciously persecuted, there are now tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands, of happy praisers of Jehovah.

<strong>Who Is God?</strong><br/><h1 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>Who Is God?</strong></h1><p id="p3" data-pid="3">Nearly as long as humans have existed, they have worshipped many gods and goddesses. Yet, the Bible refers to one God who “is greater than all the other gods.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021204/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 2:5</a>) Who is that? And what makes him greater than all the other gods that people worship? In this lesson, learn how this God introduces himself to you.</p><h3 class="du-color--gold-700 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>1.</strong> <strong>What is God’s name, and how can we be sure that he wants us to know it?</strong></h3><p id="p5" data-pid="5">In the Bible, God introduces himself to us. He says: <strong>“I am Jehovah. That is my name.”</strong> (Read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021204/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 42:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021204/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 8</a>.) “Jehovah” is the translation of a Hebrew name that evidently means “He Causes to Become.” Jehovah wants us to know his name.

He is “the Almighty,” which means he has the power to do whatever he chooses to do. He “created all things”​—the universe and all life on earth.

The <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</em> renders this verse: “May people know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.” A number of other Bible translations give similar renderings. However, many translations leave out the name Jehovah, replacing it with such titles as “Lord” or “Eternal.” What belongs in this verse? A title or the name Jehovah?</p><img src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/bh/2014/176" data-img-small-src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/bh/2014/177" alt="The Tetragrammaton—the way the divine name is written in Hebrew" width="113" height="63" class="east_right half" />

<strong>They Knew God’s Name</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A noteworthy feature of the Bay Psalm Book was the use of the divine name in some verses. Hence, anyone reading that publication as far back as some 350 years ago was in a position to know the name of our Creator. In that edition, for instance, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992686/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 83:17, 18</a> reads: “Confounded let them ever be, and terriblie troubled: yea, let them be put unto shame, and bee extinguished.

<strong>Who Is Your God?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">So, if the God of the Bible, the Creator, is your God, then you should, first of all, know what his name is. Do you? You say “God” is his name? No, that is merely a title, as is “boss.” Did you say, “Jesus <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>Christ”? No, that is the name of God’s Son. Then what is God’s name? He tells us in his Word: “I am Jehovah. That is my name.” “You, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High.” Yes, the true God has a name that distinguishes him from the many imitation or false gods.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961000/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa. 42:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961000/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ps. 83:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961000/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 1 Cor. 8:5, 6</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">If the God of the Bible is your God, you will also know what his basic characteristics or attributes are. What are they? They are four. First, justice: “A God of faithfulness, with whom there is no injustice; righteous and upright is he.” Second, power: “With God all things are possible.” Third, wisdom: “Jehovah himself in wisdom founded the earth. He solidly fixed the heavens in discernment. By his knowledge the . . . skies keep dripping down light rain.” And fourth, love. “God is love.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961000/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Deut. 32:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961000/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Matt. 19:26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961000/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Prov. 3:19, 20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961000/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 1 John 4:8</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Further, if your God is the God of the Bible, you should be familiar with his purposes. Then when others reproach him, because of ignorance or malice, you will be able to defend his good name just as you would that of any earthly friend. Does someone accuse your God Jehovah of being merely the tribal God of the Jews? They are wrong. The faithful men of old from Abel to Jacob were not Jews. Besides, all humankind are recipients of Jehovah’s blessings and yet will be. It is only that at one time Jehovah gave the Israelites, later known as Jews, certain privileges because of the faith of their forebears. Jesus Christ worshiped the God of Moses; his followers will do likewise.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961000/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rom. 3:29</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Or, if someone found fault with your God because He used the armies of Israel to destroy certain pagan peoples in times past, you, as a Christian, should be able to clear God’s name from this reproach also. Those pagan Canaanites deserved to die because of being steeped in the vilest immorality. Since Jehovah is earth’s rightful Sovereign and Judge, he is free to choose the means of executing criminals: the Flood for the antediluvians, fire for those of Sodom and Gomorrah, the literal sword for the Canaanites.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961000/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Deut. 9:4-6</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Then, again, should some, because misery and injustice are the lot of humankind, deny that Jehovah God exists, how will you answer? Many persons have no answer. But the Bible has. In the first place, let it be noted that mankind has only itself to blame. True, God could have at once wiped out the principals in the Edenic rebellion, but God was challenged as to his ability to have creatures upon this earth that would remain true to him under test. To answer that challenge God had to permit suffering, even as the book of Job shows. Once Jehovah God has fully refuted these charges and answered Satan’s challenge, he will destroy all evildoers and bring about conditions upon earth that will leave no doubt as to his existence, sovereignty and attributes.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">One more relevant point—your conduct. Does it belie your claim that the God of the Bible is your God? If he truly is your God, you will try to please him by your very way of life. Actions speak—often louder than words. You must ‘love Jehovah with your whole heart, soul, mind and strength.’ You must also “love your neighbor as yourself.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961000/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mark 12:30, 31</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">So, who is your God? You do have one; even those who deny belief in God have a god they serve. If your God is the God of the Bible, the Creator, then you know his name, his attributes and his purposes. Then you are able to vindicate him when he is reproached. Then too, you live so as to please him. Otherwise, your god, in effect, is “the god of this system of things,” the base, would-be rival of the one true God Jehovah.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"></p>

They should obey his commands, declare his truths, reflect his praises, produce Kingdom fruits. The Christian nation is not to sacrifice animals as Israel did, but “we will render the bulls of our lips.” This new nation does not offer fruits of the ground as Israel did, but “let us always offer to God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips which make public declaration to his name.” The verbal bulls, the fruits offered by Christian lips, should not be polluted or sickly, which is what they will be unless they are words of truth from the Bible properly used as healthful teaching. Nor should these verbal sacrifices ostensibly offered to God be actually diverted to the praise of false “gods,” such as to men or human schemes or religious organizations.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957561/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Hos. 14:2</a>, <em>RS,</em> margin; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957561/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Heb. 13:15</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>NAME NOW NEEDS VINDICATION</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Jehovah commands: “And you must not swear in my name to a lie, so that you do profane the name of your God. I am Jehovah.” If religious organizations teach lies in God’s name they are profaning it and putting it in need of vindication. Some say the earth will be destroyed by fire, but the Bible says: “The earth abideth for ever.” Some say you will live either in heaven or hell-fire, but of the earth the Bible says: “He created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited.” Some say sinners have immortal souls that will be tortured forever, but the Bible says: “The soul that sinneth, it shall die.” Some say two others are equal to God in a trinity, but the Bible says: “Jehovah is greater than all other gods.” Those who in God’s name teach doctrines contrary to the Bible are teaching lies in his name, are profaning his name.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957561/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Lev. 19:12</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957561/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Eccl. 1:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957561/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Isa. 45:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957561/13/2" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> Ezek. 18:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957561/13/3" data-bid="14-4" class="b"> Ex. 18:11</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Some religions have adopted pagan teachings to facilitate yoking pagans and Christians, but the Bible warns: “Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers.” Others more modernistically-minded adopt scientific, evolutionary philosophies to attract the intellectuals, but here too the Bible cautions: “Look out: perhaps there may be some man that will carry you off as his prey through the philosophy and empty deception according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary things of the world and not according to Christ.” Most religions of Christendom teach friendship and participation with the world, but the Bible rules that “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one” and that whoever “wants to be a friend of the world is constituting himself an enemy of God.” In these and many other ways false religions of Christendom swear to lies in Jehovah’s name.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957561/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Cor. 6:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957561/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Col. 2:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957561/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 1 John 5:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957561/14/3" data-bid="15-4" class="b"> Jas. 4:4</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Many peoples and religions in the nations claiming to be Christian are actually taking God’s name in a vain and worthless way. By their false teachings and unclean conduct they bring disgrace upon the name of God that they say they bear. Hence Jehovah’s name needs vindicating, and its vindication is more important than their salvation, for it will be cleared at the cost of their lives: “Let them be put to shame, and perish: that men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957561/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 83:18</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">This destruction in vindication of Jehovah’s name will come in God’s battle called Armageddon. When this is mentioned in these days scoffers ridicule and say what the Bible said they would say: “Where is this promised presence of his? Why, from the day our forefathers fell asleep in death, all things are continuing exactly as from creation’s beginning.” Jehovah may seem slow in acting to some, but “Jehovah is <span id="page456" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="456" data-before-text="456"></span>not slow respecting his promise, as some consider slowness, but he is patient with you because he does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.” Jehovah is interested in the salvation of men; he takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked, he would like for all to come to their senses and repent and be saved. He gives plenty of time for them to do so. But the promised destruction will come.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957561/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957561/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 9</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p>

<strong>The Voice of Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> There is still another possible rendering of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 29:1</a>, according to a second footnote in the <em>American Standard Version.</em> <span id="page751" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="751" data-before-text="751"></span>The Hebrew text could read, “Ascribe unto Jehovah, O ye sons of the gods.” This then would refer to the sons of the nations who have forgotten the first man’s true parentage, the Creator, Jehovah God. Men of all nations have arranged themselves under the imaginary protection of deified heroes. Of course, to help their imaginations, they have made great idols of silver and stone and gold and wood. In this way the peoples of the world have invented and made their own gods. These they have worshiped for centuries; but what has this worship gotten them? The many religions in the world have often been the cause of wars, strifes, hatreds between peoples and nations, class distinction, isolationism. Jesus said to false religionists “You are from your father the Devil.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">John 8:44</a>, <em>NW</em>) The sons of the gods they worship are still carrying on the false religion which began in early mythology, and their doctrines, ideas and philosophies of life have been carried right down to our day. The Sovereign Ruler Jehovah calls on all these sons of the many gods now to ascribe to Jehovah the glory that is due, to ascribe strength to him. Nimrod of centuries past placed himself above God. He wanted to be a mighty one ahead of Jehovah. Where are his strength and glory today? Let the followers of Nimrod and the followers of the many pagan gods, practices and beliefs all forsake their gods and their false religion if they want to live, and give glory to Jehovah, not to some man or image. But the religionists with their many gods will not recognize Jehovah; rather, “modernists” try to hide him.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 8. How have the <em>RS</em> translators rendered <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Psalm 29:2</a> vaguely, and upon whom does this verse call and to do what?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Today we have throughout the world many kinds of religions with their many different gods. Even Christendom wants to have many gods and lords, and she wants the sons of these many gods to be satisfied with the latest product of the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the United States of America, their new Revised Standard Version Bible. So they remove the name Jehovah and make it “the LORD”. But their new version or their revision of their old version makes the translators look vague when we read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 29:2</a> (<em>RS</em>): “Ascribe to <em>the LORD</em> the glory of his name.” Hence we ask the Committee, What is his name? Is it <em>the LORD?</em> No! At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 83:18</a>, according to the book entitled “Studies in The Psalms”, by J. B. Rotherham, a very accurate translation is: “That men may know that thou, whose name is Jehovah, thou alone art most high over all the earth.” While Christendom goes on its wayward course, the faithful followers of the Almighty will hearken to the voice of Jehovah, and they will make his message and his name known to the nations. If we allow as possible this third rendering of the text inviting the “sons of the gods” to praise Jehovah, it means that all creation should tremble before him, not only the creatures of the invisible heavens, but all humankind. The writer of the 96th Psalm expresses this thought in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps 96 verses 7 to 9</a>, where it is stated: “Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts. Oh worship Jehovah in holy array: tremble before him, all the earth.” (<em>AS</em>) Here the appeal is to all earthlings to worship Jehovah, and the expression is very similar to that at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 29:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 9.

If Jesus said he had “other sheep”, which he must also bring to associate with the “little flock” who are being called out as joint heirs with him in heavenly glory, then these he must bring and make one flock, and Christ Jesus will be their “one shepherd”. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">John 10:16</a>) Those whose hearts are right will find Jehovah and know him because of Jesus the Shepherd, and they will be guided to Jehovah’s organization, just as the psalmist pointed out in the 22d <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 22, verses 26 and 27</a>: “The meek shall eat and be satisfied; they shall praise Jehovah that seek after him: let your heart live for ever. All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto Jehovah; and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.” (<em>AS</em>) This is in full accord with the expression in Revelation where the thought is brought out that a great crowd shall come from all nations, kindreds and tongues. They will worship before Jehovah, because they know that glory is due to his name. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Rev. 7:9</a>, <em>NW</em>) Jesus their Shepherd acknowledged that there is one living and true God; not many gods, not many lords. And this unique God, the Sovereign Ruler of the universe, has been distinguished from all the false gods by having a name which is worthy of praise on the part of all creatures in heaven and on earth.</p>

<br/><strong>Picture caption:</strong> <p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> Swallow</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Inhabitants of Jerusalem were familiar with swallows, which customarily build their nests under the eaves of buildings. Some made their nests in Solomon’s temple.

Longing to be like the swallow that had a permanent home in Jehovah’s house, he exclaimed: “How lovely your grand tabernacle is, O Jehovah of armies! My whole being yearns, yes, I am faint with longing, for the courtyards of Jehovah . . . Even the bird finds a home there and the swallow a nest for herself, where she cares for her young near your grand altar, O Jehovah of armies, my King and my God!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016404/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 84:1-3</a>) Do we, along with our young ones, show a similar longing and appreciation for regularly being with the congregation of God’s people?​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016404/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 26:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016404/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 12</a>.</p>

He therefore sang: “Even the bird itself has found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she has put her young ones—your grand altar, O Jehovah of armies, my King and my God!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997202/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 84:3</a>) How happy the Levite would have been if he was like the birds <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>that had a more permanent dwelling place at the temple!</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">It would have been easy for the Levite to give in to bitterness because he could not serve at the temple more often. However, he was pleased to serve as he could, and he surely realized that wholehearted devotion to Jehovah is worth the effort. What helped this faithful Levite to remain content with his service privileges?</p>

How happy the psalmist would be to praise Jehovah by likewise dwelling permanently in Jehovah’s house!</p>

<strong>Where Do You Choose to Be?</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The writer of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979685/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 84</a>, a Levite who descended from Korah, set a fine example in wanting to be among God’s faithful servants. He said: “How lovely your grand tabernacle is, O Jehovah of armies! My soul has yearned and also pined away for the courtyards of Jehovah. My own heart and my very flesh cry out joyfully to the living God. Even the bird itself has found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she has put her young ones​—your grand altar, O Jehovah of armies, my King and my God!”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979685/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 84:1-3</a>.</p>

<strong>Superior Authorities</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">There being no reason for Christians to set themselves in opposition to an arrangement that God has permitted, they have good reason to be in subjection to the superior authorities. Governmental rulers, though they may be corrupt personally, would not normally punish others for doing good, that is, for adhering to the law of the land. But a person who engages in thievery, murder or other lawless acts could expect an adverse judgment from the ruling authority. One guilty of deliberate murder, for instance, might be executed for his crime. Since Jehovah God authorized capital punishment for murderers after the Flood (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014163/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Gen. 9:6</a>), the human authority, by executing the lawbreaker, would be acting as “God’s minister, an avenger to express wrath upon the one <span id="page1561" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1561" data-before-text="1561"></span>practicing what is bad.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014163/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rom. 13:2-4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014163/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Titus 3:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014163/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 1 Pet. 2:11-17</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Christian subjection to the superior authorities is not based merely on their ability to punish evildoers. With a Christian, it becomes a matter of conscience. He is submissive to human authorities because he recognizes that this is in harmony with God’s will. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014163/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Rom. 13:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014163/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 2:13-15</a>) Therefore, subjection to the superior authorities—to worldly political authorities—could never be absolute. It would be impossible for a Christian to preserve a good conscience and do the divine will by breaking God’s law, if that is what the political authority demanded. For this reason subjection to superior authorities must always be viewed in the light of the apostles’ statement to the Jewish Sanhedrin: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014163/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 5:29</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Since the governmental authorities render valuable services to ensure the safety, security and welfare of their subjects, they are entitled to taxes and tribute in compensation for their services. The governmental authorities can be termed “God’s public servants” in the sense that they provide beneficial services. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014163/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rom. 13:6, 7</a>) At times such services have directly assisted God’s servants, as when King Cyrus made it possible for the Jews to return to Judah and Jerusalem and rebuild the temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014163/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Chron. 36:22, 23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014163/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Ezra 1:1-4</a>) Often the benefits are those shared by all from the proper functioning of the authorities. These would include the maintenance of a legal system to which persons can appeal for justice, roads, protection from criminals, illegal mobs, and so forth.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014163/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Phil. 1:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014163/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Acts 21:30-32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014163/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 23:12-32</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Of course, a ruler who misuses his authority is accountable to God. Wrote the apostle Paul: “Do not avenge yourselves, beloved, but yield place to the wrath; for it is written: ‘Vengeance is mine; I will repay, says Jehovah.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014163/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Rom. 12:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014163/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Eccl. 5:8</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"></p>

How did he “look for” it or seek it as the “one thing” that he asked from God? By seeking and endeavoring on every suitable occasion to be there at the temple to join with his fellow Israelites in the worship of Jehovah, the pleasant God. So it pained him most keenly when unfaithful King Saul of Israel outlawed David and prevented his taking part in the regular yearly festivals and other occasions of worship and sacrifice at the temple.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961921/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Sam. 21:1-10</a>.</p><p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="qu">27.

<strong>Yes, You Can Find Happiness</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">The book of Psalms also mentions other things that make for happiness. One is the importance of relying on Jehovah’s strength rather than on oneself: “Happy are the men whose strength is in [Jehovah].”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006443/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 84:5</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Corinna can relate to this. She moved to a country where there was a great need in the ministry. “I encountered a new language, a new culture, and a new way of thinking. I felt as though I were on a different planet. I choked up at the thought of preaching in a strange environment. I asked Jehovah for help, and it was in his strength that I was able to preach all day in isolated territory. In time, doing so seemed to be the most natural thing in the world. I started many Bible studies, and I am still benefiting from this experience. I learned that in Jehovah’s strength, we can overcome even seemingly insurmountable obstacles.”</p>

<strong>Aids in Conducting Ourselves as Lesser Ones</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> So, do we appreciate the importance of Jehovah God’s kingdom? If we do then we will be ready to put its interests first in our lives. Doing so will also help us to conduct ourselves as lesser ones. Why can this be said? Because if we appreciate that the Kingdom work all of us are engaged in is the important thing and not we ourselves, then we will not feel unduly disturbed if we happen to have been overlooked as regards a privilege of service we might have desired. We want to take God’s work, not ourselves, seriously. After all, there are only so many parts on the various congregation meetings, only so many parts on a circuit assembly program, only so many parts on a district convention program. So some of us are bound to be left out. If that should be our lot, let us rejoice with the brothers that do have the privileges rather than envy them. Let us have the mental disposition of the psalmist who said: “For a day in your courtyards is better than a thousand elsewhere. I have chosen to stand at the threshold in the house of my God rather than to move around in the tents of wickedness.” Yes, it is far better to be a lesser one in Jehovah’s organization than to be a greater one in Satan’s wicked doomed organization.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981408/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 84:10</a>.</p>

<strong>Where Do You Choose to Be?</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In view of the psalmist’s great desire to be at the sanctuary, he says: “For a day in your courtyards is better than a thousand elsewhere. I have chosen to stand at the threshold in the house of my God rather than to move around in the tents of wickedness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979685/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 84:10</a>) What outstanding appreciation! To the psalmist, just one day in the courtyards of Jehovah’s sanctuary was more valuable, better, than a thousand days spent at some other place. He preferred standing in service at the threshold, yes, at the entrance of Jehovah’s house rather than to be in the tents of wicked men, no matter how luxurious their dwellings might be.</p>

<strong>Giving Encouragement to Others</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Even when there are shortcomings, the bond of family love is not going to be strengthened by magnifying them out of all proportion. If need be, give the matter attention, but particularly see and express appreciation for the good work that has been done. Commendation even for little things can give one the spirit and strength to push on and do more and better in the days to come. Likewise when accidents occur there is opportunity to give encouragement. A man who appreciates what it means “that they are no longer two, but one flesh,” is not going to stand back and <span id="page433" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="433" data-before-text="433"></span>chide his wife with remarks such as, “Why do you have to be so clumsy?” She probably already feels bad enough about it. Why make it worse? Why not make her feelings as important to you as your own? A kindly word and a little assistance will bring real encouragement. It is a little thing, but it shows love, and it is love that is the perfect bond of union.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963523/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 19:5, 6</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 9.

She has rewarded him with good, and not bad, all the days of her life. She is watching over the goings on of her household, and the bread of laziness she does not eat.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963523/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Prov. 31:11, 12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963523/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 27</a>) Such a wife is not a competitor, one who seeks to evade his headship, but she cooperates and works willingly under his direction. She considers, not only their immediate good, but their lasting welfare. She is a “woman that fears Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963523/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Eph. 5:22, 23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963523/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Prov. 31:30</a>) Being of such a disposition, she puts first the spiritual welfare of the family, and of material things she takes the viewpoint: “So, having sustenance and covering, we shall be content with these things.” Thus she helps to ward off the snares of materialism and to avert anxiety due to excessive financial obligations that might crowd out service to God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963523/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:6-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963523/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Matt. 13:22</a>) By keeping other interests in the background and by her own enthusiastic interest in spiritual matters she can encourage her husband to give these spiritual matters the attention they deserve.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu">10.

If they are not given thorough instruction in godly principles, the anxieties and frustrations that will beset them in life will cause constant irritation and grief.

What a frustration for anyone to spend all his effort building in a world that God is going to destroy because of its wickedness! How much better, how much more rewarding, how much more encouraging, to devote one’s life to the service of God, if possible, as a full-time pioneer minister! As the psalmist said to God, “a day in your courtyards is better than a thousand elsewhere. I have chosen to stand at the threshold in the house of my God rather than to move around in the tents of wickedness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963523/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 84:10</a>) It shows love of one’s children to encourage them to pursue such a life.

In what ways?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Yes, young folks too can learn to think in terms of giving. They should not adopt the view that everyone is supposed to wait on them. They need to learn to show appreciation for the hard work of their parents, to listen and obey when they are spoken to, and to be willing workers under the direction of their parents in helping with chores that need to be done; more than that, taking the initiative and offering to be of assistance when they see that there are jobs that need attention. By their conduct when away from home, too, they can be a blessing to themselves and others. The Scriptures wisely counsel: “Listen to your father who caused your birth, and do not despise your mother just because she has grown old. . . . The father of a righteous one will without fail be joyful; the one becoming father to a wise one will also rejoice in him.

It was nothing <span id="page747" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="747" data-before-text="747"></span>political or materialistic or fleshly. It was something spiritual. He desired to have direct, personal contact with Jehovah’s temple of worship. It was because he admired Jehovah as the living God. His personal acquaintance with Jehovah by reading the Holy Scriptures and by his experience with Jehovah’s dealings stirred him to a worshipful attitude. Especially at the temple David felt near to his God, for it was there that Jehovah’s priests and Levites offered up sacrifices and sang psalms of praise to Jehovah and conducted prayers to Him and read aloud portions of his written Word. At the temple David felt the brotherhood with all his fellow worshipers.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[68]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> So there he beheld the “pleasantness of Jehovah.” To him Jehovah was no ugly god like the grotesque gargoyles on Roman Catholic cathedrals or like the horrifying, fierce-looking idols seen at the entrances of pagan temples or inside them. How pleasant Jehovah is was described for us by the Son of David, namely, Jesus Christ the Son of God, when he said: “God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961921/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>) A God who would give his own beloved Son in sacrifice for us sinners must be pleasant, indeed.</p><p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="qu">25.

The various features of that temple had a meaning for David—its altar, its basin, its Holy with the lampstand, the table of sacred bread and its golden altar of incense, and its Most Holy with the golden ark of the covenant upon the lid of which were two cherubs stretching out their wings. The prophetic ceremonies that the priests carried out also carried some meaning to David. The more that he attended the meetings for worship at the temple, the more he deepened his appreciation of what he looked upon.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961921/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 84:1-4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961921/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 10</a>.</p><p id="p70" data-pid="70" class="qu">26.

He knew he could not do this, because he was no Levite of the household of Aaron. How, then, did David want to do it? How could he do it? How did he “look for” it or seek it as the “one thing” that he asked from God? By seeking and endeavoring on every suitable occasion to be there at the temple to join with his fellow Israelites in the worship of Jehovah, the pleasant God. So it pained him most keenly when unfaithful King Saul of Israel outlawed David and prevented his taking part in the regular yearly festivals and other occasions of worship and sacrifice at the temple.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961921/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Sam. 21:1-10</a>.</p><p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="qu">27.

After David made Jerusalem his royal capital, he had the ark of God’s covenant, that had been isolated from the Most Holy, placed in a suitable tent near his royal residence on Mount Zion. Later he felt that it was an unequal state of affairs for him to dwell in a sturdy stationary palace whereas the symbol of Jehovah’s presence, his ark of the covenant, did not. He determined to build such a palace or temple, but Jehovah God said No! The privilege of building such a glorious temple was to go to his son and successor, <span id="page748" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="748" data-before-text="748"></span>who proved to be Solomon. Yet in appreciation of such a temple King David contributed much money and collected and got ready many materials for his son Solomon to use in building the temple. Jehovah even inspired David to draw up the building plans for the authorized temple.</p>

<strong>Detestable Religious Things over Which to Sigh</strong><br/><p id="p37" data-pid="37" data-rel-pid="[91]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="32"><sup>32</sup></span> The conduct of those twenty-five Israelite men was specially outrageous toward Jehovah. There they were, in the inner court of the temple dedicated to him and in the space between the porch of the temple and the altar of sacrifice at the center of the inner court. But they were not worshiping Jehovah at that place, nor were they bowing to his altar of sacrifice that was to the east of them. Instead of facing west, toward the temple where the presence of Jehovah was symbolized by the Shekinah light that hovered over the sacred Ark of the Covenant in the innermost compartment, the Most Holy, those twenty-five men turned their backs toward the Divine Presence and faced east. Horrors! They were bowing down in worship to the <span id="page155" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="155" data-before-text="155"></span>sun in the sky! They were expressly violating the warning that Jehovah gave through the prophet Moses:</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" data-rel-pid="[91]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="33"><sup>33</sup></span> “You must take good care of your souls, . . . that you may not raise your eyes to the heavens and indeed see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the army of the heavens, and actually get seduced and bow down to them and serve them.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971008/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 4:15-19</a>.</p><p id="p92" data-pid="92" class="qu">34. Earlier, what had good King Josiah done regarding sun worship, but now how were those twenty-five men renouncing <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971008/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Psalm 84:11</a>?</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" data-rel-pid="[92]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="34"><sup>34</sup></span> In the year 642 B.C.E., or thirty years before this, good King Josiah had publicly read those words to the people who were assembled at the temple, and after that he promptly abolished and destroyed all worship of the sun-god out of the Kingdom of Judah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971008/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2 Kings 22:3 to 23:11</a>) But now, after Josiah’s death, the men of Judah acted like washed swine that returned to their wallowing in the mire and they reintroduced sun worship and practiced it right inside the temple of Jehovah, without interference on the part of the priests of the tribe of Levi. They renounced the words of the “sons of Korah [the Levite],” as recorded in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971008/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Psalm 84:11</a>: “Jehovah God is a sun and a shield; favor and glory are what he gives. Jehovah himself will not hold back anything good from those walking in faultlessness.” Those twenty-five renegade Israelites looked to a mere creation of Jehovah, the sun, as their source of “favor and glory,” as their source for “anything good.” That was enough to insult Jehovah.</p><p id="p93" data-pid="93" class="qu">35. Why was their holding out the shoot or twig to Jehovah’s nose offensive to him, and with what were they filling the land, thus obliging Jehovah to act in what way toward them?</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" data-rel-pid="[93]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="35"><sup>35</sup></span> Yet those men added further insult to this. “Here,” said Jehovah, “they are thrusting out the shoot [or, twig] to my nose.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971008/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ezekiel 8:17</a>) This shoot or twig was used in idolatrous worship and may have been carved to a certain shape to represent the human male organ. At least it must have been something very offensive or obscene to be held out to Jehovah’s nose, as if he would find pleasure in smelling it. Such idolatrous sun worship on the part of those twenty-five men was <span id="page156" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="156" data-before-text="156"></span>accompanied by their filling “the land with violence.” It was enough for Jehovah to find good reason to “act in rage.” This it was his purpose to do at the approaching destruction of Jerusalem and its temple. Then, when the sun-god failed those twenty-five apostate Israelites, they would fall back on Jehovah and call out to him with a loud voice to try to make him hear, but he would have no cause for paying attention to their selfish cries. As he looked upon their destruction by his executional forces his eye would feel no sorrow, for he himself would feel no compassion. He hates hypocrites!</p>

<strong>“The Sun Will Be Darkened”</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Do these prophecies refer to the literal sun’s being darkened, as was the case in the time of Moses and Jesus Christ? Yes, say many devout religionists. Thus a Seventh-day Adventist publication, <em>Bible Readings for the Home Circle,</em> states that such texts were fulfilled in the dark day of May 19, 1780. In support of its position it quotes, among other authorities, <em>Webster’s Dictionary,</em> Unabridged, edition 1833, which on page 1604 has the following to say regarding “The Dark Day”: “In some places persons could not see to read common print in the open air for several hours <span id="page550" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="550" data-before-text="550"></span>together. Birds sang their evening song, disappeared, and became silent; fowls went to roost, cattle sought the barnyard; and candles were lighted in the houses. The obscuration began about ten o’clock in the morning, and continued until the middle of the next night, but with differences of degrees and duration in different places. . . . The true causes of this remarkable phenomenon are not known.” Nor can this darkness, it is pointed out, be explained as an eclipse, as the moon had been full the night before and therefore was on the opposite side of the earth at the time the sun became obscured.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>SYMBOLIC USE OF SUN</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">But does it necessarily follow that when God’s Word states that “the sun will be darkened” the literal sun is referred to? Not at all. And especially not when we note the many ways in which the sun is used as a symbol. Thus Jehovah God is referred to as the sun, and that most fittingly so, as he is the primal source of all light, life and energy: “Jehovah God is a sun and a shield.” In keeping with this expression is his being termed “the Father of the celestial lights.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958682/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 84:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958682/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Jas. 1:17</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Jesus Christ is likewise most fittingly spoken of as a sun: “But unto you that fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in its wings.” As the sun is the light of the earth, so Jesus is the spiritual “light of the world.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958682/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Mal. 4:2</a>, <em>AS;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958682/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 8:12</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The Scriptures further tell that God has a host of heavenly spirit creatures or angels, the organization of which is spoken of as a woman. This womanlike organization is spoken of as being “arrayed with the sun.” Then again, God’s kingdom rule, we are assured, will be so bright that by comparison the sun and moon will feel embarrassed: “Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for Jehovah of hosts will reign in mount Zion.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958682/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rev. 12:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958682/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Isa. 24:23</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">And, finally, we also read of God’s servants while still on earth being described as luminaries or suns and as shining as the sun: “Be blameless and innocent, children of God without a blemish in among a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you are shining as illuminators in the world.” “At that time [of the harvest] the righteous ones will shine as brightly as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.” The facts show that God’s faithful servants today are indeed shining forth as the sun by publishing far and wide the good news of God’s kingdom.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958682/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Phil. 2:15, 16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958682/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Matt. 13:43</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The sun not only is used as a symbol of spiritual light, but, by reason of its great heat, is also used to picture persecution. Thus Jesus, in his illustration of the sower, told of seeds being sown on rocky soil, where they sprang up at once, “but when the sun rose they were scorched, and because of not having root they withered.” In explanation Jesus said: “This is the one hearing the word and at once accepting it with joy. Yet he has no root in himself but continues for a time, and after tribulation or persecution has arisen on account of the word he is at once stumbled.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958682/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 13:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958682/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 20, 21</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>HOW AND WHEN SUN DARKENED</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">In view of all the foregoing, is it necessary to hold that the prophecies regarding the darkening of the sun refer to the literal sun not giving its light? No, it is not; nor does it seem reasonable to hold that this darkening of the sun was limited to but a few hours in just a small section of the earth. Further, the contexts of some of these texts very definitely locate the darkening of the sun in our day rather than two centuries ago. For example, Jesus associates the darkening of the sun with his <span id="page551" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="551" data-before-text="551"></span>return, when the nations were angry, nation rising against nation and kingdom against kingdom, when there would be famine, plagues and earthquakes. The facts show that 1914 marked the beginning of the fulfillment of these prophecies. Thus also Joel’s prophecy shows that this darkening of the sun would precede the terrible day of Jehovah, as an indication of its nearness. It is not reasonable to conclude that this sign would come some 170 years or more before Jehovah’s terrible day.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958682/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 24:7-12</a>.</p>

Furthermore, as in the example of literal lightning which follows a set pathway to thunder to the earth, we likewise note a conduit-like course for the lightning judgments of Jehovah to come earthward to shake the nations. This gives rise to a timely study as to Jehovah’s channel of communication of his spiritual truths and vital judgments.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>THE WORD “CHANNEL”</strong></p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 4. What meaning does the word “channel” convey?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> In connection with literal water the word “channel” is used to refer to a waterway, a watercourse or an established stream of water. In a larger sense the word “channel” is used to describe a means of conduction, a course into which something may be directed, a route through which anything passes or progresses. In this latter, larger way the word “channel” is appropriately used with reference to Jehovah’s age-old method of communication with his servants.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>OPERATING IN HARMONY WITH THE LIVING CENTER</strong></p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 5. What is argued from the fact that there are fixed physical laws in nature?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Everything in the physical universe operates according to fixed rules of action, which men today know as physical laws, such as laws of motion, gravitation, genetics, etc. For laws to exist there always must be a prime lawmaker. In turn the very existence of a Lawmaker implies communication. No law of the governments today just happens to be on the statute book, but must be made by a parliament, a lawmaking body of rulers. From this circumstance alone powerful support is given to the Bible’s teaching that there was direct creation of all animate and inanimate things. Nothing was left to chance, but all things originally were brought into existence by a Master Intelligence, a Great First Cause, an Almighty Creator with whom communication can be established.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 6. What is the position of God’s throne in the universe, and how is this pictured even in nature?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Jehovah God’s throne is the absolute center of the boundless universe as to its creative existence, operations and interests. This throne is not at the astral center of the great galaxy of numberless galaxies of stars or island universes that now exist within or beyond the range of man’s visual powers. But it is at the creative center where God of necessity is the very foundation of all his works. All creation revolves around him as its source, which makes God the Living Center. The centripetal force of this vast system of animate and inanimate things is inward toward him. All is inseparably united to Him. We need only mention by way of illustration our planetary system wherein the individual planets revolve in established relationship around our sun as the center. Then the minutest illustration would be that of the structure of the atom where tiny electrons revolve in paths around their proton nucleus, or center. The nuclear design of operations around fixed centers is universal.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955364/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 93:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955364/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 36:9</a>.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> 7. How is God likened to a sun? Compare “time” and “space” with God.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> The Bible itself likens Jehovah God to a sun. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955364/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 84:11</a>) As a sun radiates energy ever outwardly, so from God there has radiated eternally in all directions forms of various energies, spiritual and physical. This everlasting brilliant effusion can be described as the glory of God. These energies ever traveling into the outer reaches in very brief moments of “time” have filled what is called “space.” For this reason it is understood that “time” and “space” are as eternal as God, for God himself has had no beginning. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955364/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 90:2</a>) If God decrees the holding back of physical energy at any one point in space, mass or matter immediately forms. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955364/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Rev. 4:11</a>) Professor Einstein <span id="page303" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="303" data-before-text="303"></span>ascertained this basic truth from the Book of Nature when he discovered the law that energy equals mass times the speed of light squared.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1955364/0">a</a> Therefore, everything that exists has been created from energy that originally emanated from the Great Source of the universe, Jehovah. The Bible certainly is true when it records, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955364/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Gen. 1:1</a>, <em>NW.</em></p>
