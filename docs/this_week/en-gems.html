<strong>Can You Wait upon Jehovah?</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">While we do not attribute all our diseases and ailments to direct intervention of the Devil, as in the case of Job, we, nevertheless, can be sure he does try at times to take advantage of Jehovah’s people in their weakened physical state to cause discouragement and even abandonment of hope. We need Jehovah’s help. The psalmist David prayed: “I earnestly hoped in Jehovah, and so he inclined his ear to me and heard my cry for help.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973566/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 40:1</a>) You too can thus pray as you wait upon Jehovah. Jehovah does not abandon his servants. He gives them the strength to endure if they keep trusting in him.</p>

<strong>Increase Your Praise of Jehovah!</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span id="page339" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="339" data-before-text="339"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> This matter of aiding one another is not limited to dealing with your brothers at the Kingdom Hall but also extends out to assisting others in the field service. “The generous soul will itself be made fat, and the one freely watering others will himself also be freely watered.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Prov. 11:25</a>) So whenever you plan to engage in the house-to-house or back-call or home Bible study activity, ask yourself: “Whom can I invite to go along with me?” Are you a pioneer who goes alone simply because “I just have to get my time in before the end of the month”? Stop and think. If you get in only two hours instead of three, due to helping three weak ones, think how much more praise this means to Jehovah. Four times two equals eight hours instead of your individual three. Maybe <em>you</em> will be praised more by men if you put in more hours working by yourself, but <em>Jehovah</em> is praised more when more praisers are in the field. Paul counsels: Keep “an eye, not in personal interest upon just your own matters, but also in personal interest upon those of the others.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Phil. 2:4</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="ss"><strong>PRAISING JEHOVAH WITH THE POWERS OF SPEECH</strong></p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">21.

For example: “He put in my mouth a new song, praise to our God.” “O Jehovah, may you open these lips of mine, that my own mouth may tell forth your praise.” “With lips of joyful cries my mouth offers praise.” “My mouth is filled with your praise.” “I shall laud Jehovah very much with my mouth, and in among many people I shall praise him.” “May my lips bubble forth praise.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Pss. 40:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 51:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/21/2" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> 63:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/21/3" data-bid="22-4" class="b"> 71:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/21/4" data-bid="22-5" class="b"> 109:30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/21/5" data-bid="22-6" class="b"> 119:171</a>.</p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">22.

Only when you engage in the field ministry? Only when you attend congregational meetings? <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Psalm 34:1</a> answers: “I will bless Jehovah at all times; constantly his praise will be in my mouth.” Paul also emphasized this matter of constancy in giving praise to Jehovah at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:15</a>, where he wrote: “Through him [Christ] let us always offer to God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips which make public declaration to his name.” It is therefore wholly incompatible with Christian conduct to use your mouth, lips and tongue to speak forth filthy or obscene talk. “Let a rotten saying not proceed out of your mouth, but whatever saying is good for building up as the need may be, that it may impart what is favorable to the hearers.” In this same letter to the Ephesians the apostle also classifies foolish talking along with fornication and shameful conduct, saying that no person who practices these things “has any inheritance in the kingdom of the Christ and of God.” Therefore, his apostolic order is, “Let fornication and uncleanness of every kind or greediness not even be mentioned among you, just as it befits holy people; neither shameful conduct nor foolish talking nor obscene jesting, things which are not becoming.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Eph. 4:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 5:3-5</a>) Asks the Bible writer James: “A fountain does not cause the sweet and the bitter to bubble out of the same opening, does it?” So at all times let your powers of speech bubble forth only the sweet praises of Jehovah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Jas. 3:11</a>.</p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">23.

For, says the apostle Peter, “maintain your conduct fine among the nations.” Why so? In order, Peter continues, “that . . . they may as a result of your fine works of which they are eyewitnesses <em>glorify God.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:12</a>) So when dealing with outsiders you must be patient and long-suffering. You must show kindness and neighbor love. You must exercise self-control. You must prove your uncompromising integrity to Jehovah when facing the everyday issues. And there are so many issues presented by this materialistic, sex-crazed system of things, including such vital matters as blood transfusions, regimented servitude and saluting of images of the State, all of which must be met with the same intelligent determination as displayed by first-century Christians who boldly declared: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Acts 5:29</a>.</p>

<strong>Yes, You Can Find Happiness</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>Trusting in Jehovah Leads to Happiness</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">We have no reason to doubt the Creator’s almightiness and his limitless wisdom. Knowing that he could have complete confidence in Jehovah and that he could take refuge in Him, David wrote: “Happy is the able-bodied man that has put Jehovah as his trust.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006443/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 40:4</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Maria said: “My experience in Spain and elsewhere has been that when we do things Jehovah’s way, even though our feelings and emotions may incline us to do otherwise, we get the best possible results. This makes for happiness because Jehovah’s way is always the best.”</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Andreas, a Christian elder who has served in several European lands, also knows from personal experience that we can put our trust in Jehovah. He said: “My older brother, who does not share my faith, strongly influenced me during my youth, encouraging me to pursue a financially rewarding career. He was extremely disappointed when I took up the ministry full-time and did not rely on the so-called security provided by secular pension plans. During my full-time service, I have never been in need, and I have experienced blessings of which others can only dream.”</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">In 1993, Felix was invited to help enlarge the facilities of the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Selters, Germany. Once the work was finished, he was invited to <span id="page14" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>become a permanent part of the Bethel family there. His reaction? “I accepted the invitation with certain reservations. But now I have been here for almost ten years, and I am convinced that Jehovah answered my prayers. He knows what is best for me. By placing complete confidence in him and letting him direct me, I give him an opportunity to show me what he wants me to do.”</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Susanne, mentioned earlier, wanted to serve as a full-time minister, a pioneer, but she had difficulty finding a part-time job. After waiting a year for something to turn up, she acted with trust in Jehovah. She related: “I turned in my application for regular pioneering. I had saved enough to pay my normal expenses for about a month. And what a dramatic month it turned out to be! My ministry was a source of great joy, but one job interview after another failed. As Jehovah had promised, however, he did not desert me. On the <em>last</em> day of the month, I was able to sign a job contract. Now I knew that I really could trust in Jehovah! This first experience in full-time service has contributed to a rewarding and happy life.”</p>

Do we want to be happy? We can be. How? There are twenty-four happinesses or beatitudes in the Psalms that tell us the secret of how to be happy with the happiness that will never end. It is instructive for us to hear some of these beatitudes! The very book of Psalms opens with a beatitude, “Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked ones, and in the way of sinners has not stood and in the seat of ridiculers has not sat. But his delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1, 2</a>) The beatitude in the Second Psalm is one that not only world rulers but all of us under the shadow of Armageddon ought to heed: “Serve Jehovah with fear and be joyful with trembling. Kiss the son, that He may not become incensed and you may not perish [from] the way, for his anger flares up easily. Happy are all those taking refuge in him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Ps. 2:11, 12</a>.</p><p id="p98" data-pid="98" class="qu">38.

Jehovah himself will guard him and preserve him alive. He will be pronounced happy in the earth, and you cannot possibly give him over to the soulful desire of his enemies.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Ps. 41:1, 2</a>, <em>margin</em>) Correction from Jehovah is meant to result in our happiness: “Happy is the able-bodied man whom you correct, O Jah, and whom you teach out of your own law, to give him quietness from days of calamity, until for the wicked one a pit is excavated.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/60/0" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Ps. 94:12, 13</a>) Obedience to God’s command results in unusual happiness: “Happy is the man in fear of Jehovah, in whose commandments he has taken very much delight.” “Happy are the ones faultless in [their] way, the ones walking in the law of Jehovah.

<strong>Inspiration</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">In a number of cases the writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures evidently made use of the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> translation when quoting from the Hebrew Scriptures. At times the rendering of the <em>Septuagint,</em> as quoted by them, differs somewhat from the reading of the Hebrew Scriptures as now known (most translations today being based on the Hebrew Masoretic text dating back to about the tenth century C.E.). As an example, Paul’s quotation of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002178/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Psalm 40:6</a> contains the expression “but you prepared a body for me,” an expression found in the <em>Septuagint.</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002178/65/0" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Heb 10:5, 6</a>) The available Hebrew manuscripts of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002178/66/0" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Psalm 40:6</a> have, in place of that expression, the words “these ears of mine you opened up.” Whether the <em>original</em> Hebrew text contained the phrase found in the <em>Septuagint</em> cannot be stated with certainty. Whatever the case, God’s spirit guided Paul in his quotation, and therefore these words have divine authorization. This does not mean that the entire <em>Septuagint</em> translation is to be viewed as inspired; but those portions quoted by the inspired Christian writers did become an integral part of God’s Word.</p>

Instead, he realized that God had prepared a perfect human body for him, Jesus, to offer as a sacrifice. This would remove any further need of animal sacrifices. Showing his heartfelt desire to submit to God’s will, Jesus continued praying: “Look!

Jehovah did not “delight” in those offerings, in that they were only typical and unable to atone completely for human sin. Hence, Jehovah prepared a perfect human body for Jesus to sacrifice. God transferred the life of his heavenly Son to the womb of a Jewish virgin. Jesus was thus born uncontaminated by the sin of Adam. He was a perfect human Son of God, whose life could atone for the sin of mankind.

Interestingly, in the <em>Septuagint</em> these words are rendered: “You prepared a body for me.” Whatever the source of this translation, it carries the same basic idea as the Hebrew.

<strong>Producing the Chief Agent of Divine Rulership</strong><br/><p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> By presenting himself for baptism, Jesus really fulfilled the words of “the Prophets,” just as he said. The apostle Paul indicates which of the prophecies Jesus fulfilled, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972842/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:5-10</a>, where we read concerning Jesus at the time of his coming for baptism: “Hence when he comes into the world he says: ‘Sacrifice and offering you did not want, but you prepared a body for me. You did not approve of whole burnt offerings and sin offering.’ Then I said, ‘Look! I am come (in the roll of the book it is written about me) to do your will, O God.’ . . . By the said ‘will’ we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all time.” Jesus was thus fulfilling <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972842/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Psalm 40:6-8</a>.

It is evident that Jesus’ being baptized was symbolic. His baptism was not “in symbol of repentance for forgiveness of sins.” It was in symbol of Jesus’ coming or presenting himself to do God’s will, which divine “will” included the offering of Jesus’ body in sacrifice once for all time. As a natural Jew he was already under the Mosaic law and was a member of the only nation on earth then dedicated to God, to do “all that Jehovah has spoken.” Also, as the firstborn son of Mary, whose firstborn son her husband Joseph adopted as his own firstborn son, Jesus was sanctified to God and belonged to him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972842/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Ex. 13:1, 2</a>) For this reason Jesus had to be redeemed by Joseph and Mary in order to allow him to engage in secular work.

Having this in mind, Jehovah in the Psalms foretold Jesus’ resurrection from the dead. The dead Jesus was buried in a nearby tomb in a rock and thus his soul, which he had poured out in death, went to Sheol or mankind’s common grave. But Jesus died with full hope of a resurrection, his hope being voiced in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 16:8-11</a>: “I have placed Jehovah in front of me constantly.

You will not allow your man of loving-kindness to see the pit. You will cause me to know the path of life. Rejoicing to the full is with your face; there is pleasantness at your right hand forever.” That this and other prophecies of the Psalms might be carried out, Jehovah God brushed aside the Devil’s preventive efforts and raised Jesus from the dead, delivering him from Sheol on the third day. God rewarded him with a spirit body in place of the sacrificed human body, that he might know again the path of life and know pleasantness at God’s right hand forever.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Acts 2:22-31</a>.</p>

<strong>The Reassuring History of Dedication</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> During the history of God’s people Israel there were many times when individuals dedicated things or persons. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955447/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">the 20th chapter of Deuteronomy</a> we have the account of the procedure when a man called to war had a house that he had not yet initiated or inaugurated. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955447/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Samuel 8:11</a> David is said to have “dedicated” vessels. The word “dedicated” here appearing has the meaning of making to be a sacred thing. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955447/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Kings 7:51</a> Solomon brings into the temple the items that David had previously dedicated to Jehovah’s use. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955447/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Kings 8:63</a> the king and all the people are revealed inaugurating the house of Jehovah, initiating it into its proper use in Jehovah’s worship. The good woman Hannah vowed to dedicate her babe to Jehovah before it was conceived and her child Samuel served faithfully in the worship of Jehovah God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955447/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Sam. 1:11</a>) Samuel took personal action in respect to his dedicated service, as shown at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955447/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Samuel 3:10</a>: “Then <span id="page375" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="375" data-before-text="375"></span>Samuel said, Speak; for thy servant heareth.” (<em>AS</em>) His continued obedience is shown throughout the account of his ministry, including <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955447/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Samuel 3:19, 20</a> (<em>AS</em>), which states: “And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground. And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Jehovah.” The prophet Isaiah took a volunteer step in God’s service: “And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Here am I; send me. And he said, Go, and tell this people.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955447/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Isa. 6:8, 9</a>, <em>AS</em>) The testimony of the account of true worship throughout the ages is uniform in showing that dedication was a serious personal step in the right direction taken by all of those who worshiped Jehovah God and received his approval.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>THE DEDICATION OF THE SON OF GOD</strong></p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu"> 6.

Jesus was devoted to his God. He kept the law of the Jews. Under this law Jesus became of age at thirty years and faced the question as to what he was going to do with his life. Would he do God’s will? Was it God’s will that he keep on being a carpenter and simply conform to the Mosaic law? No, the worship of Jehovah was to be advanced and great steps forward were to be taken respecting the carrying out of his purposes including the establishment of a new theocratic organization, the Christian congregation, the gathering of its members, and eventually thereafter the establishment of the antitypical theocratic government, the kingdom of heaven, and the new world of righteousness. Jesus was acquainted with his Father and with his Father’s word in the Hebrew Scriptures. He knew Jehovah’s worthiness and was not content with being a carpenter nor would he selfishly turn aside from a pursuit of his Father’s will. He made a decision. He made up his mind. He charted a course of action for the rest of his life. He fulfilled the prophecy of the 40th Psalm, which states, in part: “Sacrifice and offering thou hast no delight in; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt-offering and sin-offering hast thou not required. Then said I, Lo, I am come; in the roll of the book it is written of me: I delight to do thy will, O my God; yea, thy law is within my heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955447/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 40:6-8</a>, <em>AS</em>) In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955447/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">the tenth chapter of Hebrews</a> the apostle Paul quotes from this prophecy, stating that it applied to Christ Jesus at his dedication. So we see this devoted Son of God made a personal, solemn dedication of himself to his God, to do his will and follow the law of God held in the heart of this dedicated servant. From that course of action into which he was there initiated he never swerved. That decision was important to Jesus. A similar decision is important to you.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 7. (a) What leads up to dedication? (b) Are formalities appropriate? Why?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> What led up to Jesus’ dedication? Knowledge that he had concerning God, love for his heavenly Father and earnest desire to forward the cause of pure worship to the advancement of Jehovah’s purposes to the vindication of his name. What leads a man to dedicate himself to Jehovah today? A knowledge of the truth, an understanding of Jehovah’s purposes, the possibilities of life set before men through Christ Jesus, appreciation of God’s provisions through his Son, love developed in the heart of the individual and a decision to follow, not the practices and standards of the ungodly, Devil-ruled old world, but the will of God in vindication of his name. It is a dedication to the Supreme One. Why did not Jesus simply go about his work, <span id="page376" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="376" data-before-text="376"></span>putting his hand to it and doing what he could in the furtherance of his ministry? Why should he dedicate himself? For the reason that the doing of God’s will, carrying on his worship, is no casual affair. It is not something that is all right if you do it and all right if you do not. Dedication to Jehovah calls for special solemnities, the making of a contract, a formal agreement which, when evidenced, gives notice to all concerned and all observing as to what to expect from the individual henceforth. It calls for punctiliousness, orderliness.</p>

<strong>Dedication—To Whom?

Even Jesus said: “I was not sent forth to any but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982128/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matthew 15:24</a>) The message to this dedicated people of God was a special one, not applicable to non-Israelite nations. John the Baptizer called upon those “lost sheep of the house of Israel” to repent of their sins against the Law covenant. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982128/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 3:1-6</a>) “John baptized with the baptism in symbol of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982128/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Acts 19:4</a>) However, when Jesus presented himself to John for water baptism, this obviously was not in symbol of repentance, for Jesus was sinless and no violator of the Law covenant under which he had been born. John, knowing this, hesitated to baptize Jesus, but complied with his request on being told: “Let it be, this time, for in that way it is suitable for us to carry out all that is righteous.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982128/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matthew 3:13-17</a>) What did he mean?</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">13.

So when getting baptized, Jesus was not dedicating himself to God, for he was already a member of a dedicated nation and, being sinless, needed no conversion. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982128/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Hebrews 7:26</a>) Rather, his baptism was a symbol of the <em>presenting of himself</em> to his heavenly Father to do His further will. And in this respect Jesus set a pattern for the baptism of his disciples.</p>

His baptism was not “in symbol of repentance for forgiveness of sins.” It was in symbol of Jesus’ coming or presenting himself to do God’s will, which divine “will” included the offering of Jesus’ body in sacrifice once for all time. As a natural Jew he was already under the Mosaic law and was a member of the only nation on earth then dedicated to God, to do “all that Jehovah has spoken.” Also, as the firstborn son of Mary, whose firstborn son her husband Joseph adopted as his own firstborn son, Jesus was sanctified to God and belonged to him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972842/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Ex. 13:1, 2</a>) For this reason Jesus had to be redeemed by Joseph and Mary in order to allow him to engage in secular work.

Hence the <em>New English Bible</em> (of 1961) puts Jesus’ words this way: “For as the Father has life-giving power in himself, so has the Son, by the Father’s gift.” <span id="page718" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="718" data-before-text="718"></span>The Roman Catholic translation by Monsignor Ronald A. Knox conveys the same idea, reading: “As the Father has within him the gift of life, so he has granted to the Son that he too should have within him the gift of life.” <em>The New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures,</em> of 1950, presents the same thought: “For just as the Father has in himself the gift of life, so he has granted to the Son to have also in himself the gift of life.”</p><p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="qu"> 3.

To provide this human sacrifice for offsetting mankind’s sin and relieving them of their condemnation to death Jehovah God the heavenly Father sent his Son, transferring his life from heaven to earth. Miraculously he had his Son born as the babe Jesus in Bethlehem of Judea. Jesus grew up to be a perfect man at the age of thirty, the equivalent of the perfect man Adam in Eden. True, he now had perfect human life, free from condemnation, but he had to make this human life of his available for mankind by sacrificing it in the service of his heavenly Father. So at the age of thirty years Jesus presented himself for this sacrificial service, to serve as a priest of God. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964883/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:5-10</a> the inspired writer applies the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964883/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 40:6-8</a> to Jesus and says:</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[64]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> “Hence when he comes into the world he says: ‘“Sacrifice and offering you did not want, but you prepared a body for me. You did not approve of whole burnt offerings and sin offering.” Then I said, “Look! I am come (in the roll of the book it is written about me) to do your will, O God.’” After first saying: ‘You did not want nor did you approve of sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sin offering’—sacrifices that are offered according to the Law—then he actually says: ‘Look! I am come to do your will.’ He does away with what is first that he may establish what is second. By the said ‘will’ we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all time.”</p><p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu"> 6.

There at that baptism the Father granted to the Son to have in himself life-giving power to a limited extent. It was because of this fact that the Son was able to cure the man who lay sick for thirty-eight years and also to raise Jews from the dead, even bringing his dear friend Lazarus back to life after four days of entombment. But Jesus did not yet have power to impart everlasting life to members of the condemned human family. Why not? Because he had not yet sacrificed his perfect human body in actual death.</p><p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu"> 7. (a) What power did God exercise on the third day after Jesus’ death, and how?

When Jesus ascended to heaven forty days after his resurrection from the dead, he did not take the sacrificed human body to heaven with him—an impossibility!—but took with him the value of his sacrificed perfect human life, in order to present this to the heavenly Father in behalf of mankind. God the Father accepted this sacrificial presentation and he made Jesus Christ his High Priest in behalf of man.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964883/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Heb. 9:24-26</a>.</p>

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page501" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="501" data-before-text="501"></span><strong>The Early Christian Codex</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE printed book is so much a part of our modern civilization that we take it for granted, and often forget that there was a time only two thousand years ago when books like this were practically unknown. Instead, scrolls were used for literary works, continuous rolls twenty or thirty feet long, and nine or ten inches high. Skins or papyrus sheets were fastened together to form this “roll of the book” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962605/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 40:7</a>), and the text was written in columns, which formed the pages. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962605/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jer. 36:23</a>) Even our word “volume” literally means something rolled up or revolved, as upon rollers. So we can picture Jesus taking his stand in the synagogue of Nazareth and, on being handed the scroll of the prophet Isaiah by the hazan or attendant, skillfully rolling the scroll off with one hand and on with the other until the required place was reached.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962605/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 4:16, 17</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Then occurred a change. From small beginnings the codex rose until it almost eclipsed the roll. But what is a codex? The stem of a tree was called a “caudex,” and from this the name was applied to tablets of wood with raised rims, often covered with a coating of wax and written upon with a stylus, like the schoolboy’s slate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962605/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 8:1</a>) By the fifth century B.C.E. tablets of several leaves were being used, having strings passed through pierced holes to hold them together. Because these tablets looked like a tree trunk when bound together they were called a codex.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Imagine carrying around such bulky, cumbersome wooden tablets! No wonder the search was on for a lighter, more pliable material. The Romans developed the parchment notebook, an intermediate step between the tablet and the later book-form codex. As the style and material of the original tablet changed, it became a problem to know what to call the new format. In Latin usage the word <em>membranae</em> came to distinguish especially the parchment notebook,<sup>1</sup> and this word was used by Paul when requesting “the scrolls, especially the parchments [<em>membranas</em>].” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962605/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Tim. 4:13</a>) That Paul used a Latin word and even in a Latin sense would be only because no Greek equivalent existed to describe what he was calling for. Later the word “codex” was transliterated into the Greek language to refer to the book.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>CHRISTIANS DEVELOP THE CODEX</strong></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Where does the evidence gathered to date place the development of the codex? Writing in 1898, F. G. Kenyon, already assistant keeper of manuscripts in the British Museum, stated that “the rise of the codex was accompanied by the rise of vellum,” notably in the fourth century A.D., and that the papyrus codex was only an experiment that failed.<sup>2</sup> Of course, until then very few papyrus manuscripts of the <span id="page502" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="502" data-before-text="502"></span>Bible had been discovered and the first three centuries A.D. were practically blank pages in the textual history of the Bible. Papyrus requires a very dry climate in order to survive the ravages of time and weather, and it is to where this ideal condition is found, such as around the Dead Sea and in Egypt, that the papyrus hunter must turn. How different is the picture today, then, thanks to the kind sands of Egypt! So much evidence has been unearthed in sixty years, especially from the town rubbish dumps of Oxyrhynchus and the ancient Fayum, that the gap of three centuries is virtually closed and the role played by the papyrus codex is better understood.</p>

His will did not die, for when he was lifted out of the Jordan he still had his power of will. He said after that: “My food is for me to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work.” “I seek not my own will but the will of him that sent me.” “I have come down from heaven to do, not my will, but the will of him that sent me. This is the will of him that sent me, that I should lose nothing out of all that he has given me but that I should resurrect it at the last day. For this is the will of my Father, that everyone that beholds the Son and exercises faith in him should have everlasting life, and I should resurrect him at the last day.” And in prayer to God just before he was betrayed by unfaithful Judas, Jesus said: “My Father, if it is not possible for this to pass away except I drink it, let your will take place.” “Nevertheless, let, not my will, but yours take place.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959404/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">John 4:34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959404/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 5:30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959404/19/2" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 6:38-40;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959404/19/3" data-bid="20-4" class="b"> Matt. 26:42;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959404/19/4" data-bid="20-5" class="b"> Luke 12:42</a>; see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959404/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:37</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">21.

Let him deliver him, since he has taken delight in him!” We can see the Roman soldiers who stripped Jesus of his clothing before nailing him up throwing dice for the ownership of his inner garment: “They apportion my clothing among themselves, and upon my garment they cast lots.” We can hear Jesus just before his death taking up the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 22:1</a>: “My God, my God, why have you left me?

Having this in mind, Jehovah in the Psalms foretold Jesus’ resurrection from the dead. The dead Jesus was buried in a nearby tomb in a rock and thus his soul, which he had poured out in death, went to Sheol or mankind’s common grave. But Jesus died with full hope of a resurrection, his hope being voiced in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 16:8-11</a>: “I have placed Jehovah in front of me constantly.

You will not allow your man of loving-kindness to see the pit. You will cause me to know the path of life. Rejoicing to the full is with your face; there is pleasantness at your right hand forever.” That this and other prophecies of the Psalms might be carried out, Jehovah God brushed aside the Devil’s preventive efforts and raised Jesus from the dead, delivering him from Sheol on the third day. God rewarded him with a spirit body in place of the sacrificed human body, that he might know again the path of life and know pleasantness at God’s right hand forever.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Acts 2:22-31</a>.</p>

<strong>The Reassuring History of Dedication</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> During the history of God’s people Israel there were many times when individuals dedicated things or persons. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955447/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">the 20th chapter of Deuteronomy</a> we have the account of the procedure when a man called to war had a house that he had not yet initiated or inaugurated. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955447/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Samuel 8:11</a> David is said to have “dedicated” vessels. The word “dedicated” here appearing has the meaning of making to be a sacred thing. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955447/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Kings 7:51</a> Solomon brings into the temple the items that David had previously dedicated to Jehovah’s use. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955447/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Kings 8:63</a> the king and all the people are revealed inaugurating the house of Jehovah, initiating it into its proper use in Jehovah’s worship. The good woman Hannah vowed to dedicate her babe to Jehovah before it was conceived and her child Samuel served faithfully in the worship of Jehovah God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955447/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Sam. 1:11</a>) Samuel took personal action in respect to his dedicated service, as shown at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955447/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Samuel 3:10</a>: “Then <span id="page375" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="375" data-before-text="375"></span>Samuel said, Speak; for thy servant heareth.” (<em>AS</em>) His continued obedience is shown throughout the account of his ministry, including <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955447/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Samuel 3:19, 20</a> (<em>AS</em>), which states: “And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground. And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Jehovah.” The prophet Isaiah took a volunteer step in God’s service: “And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Here am I; send me. And he said, Go, and tell this people.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955447/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Isa. 6:8, 9</a>, <em>AS</em>) The testimony of the account of true worship throughout the ages is uniform in showing that dedication was a serious personal step in the right direction taken by all of those who worshiped Jehovah God and received his approval.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>THE DEDICATION OF THE SON OF GOD</strong></p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu"> 6. In the case of Jesus, why was his personal dedication in order, and why important?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Of all the examples of dedication to Jehovah God, the outstanding one is that of Christ Jesus. Jesus was devoted to his God. He kept the law of the Jews. Under this law Jesus became of age at thirty years and faced the question as to what he was going to do with his life. Would he do God’s will? Was it God’s will that he keep on being a carpenter and simply conform to the Mosaic law? No, the worship of Jehovah was to be advanced and great steps forward were to be taken respecting the carrying out of his purposes including the establishment of a new theocratic organization, the Christian congregation, the gathering of its members, and eventually thereafter the establishment of the antitypical theocratic government, the kingdom of heaven, and the new world of righteousness. Jesus was acquainted with his Father and with his Father’s word in the Hebrew Scriptures. He knew Jehovah’s worthiness and was not content with being a carpenter nor would he selfishly turn aside from a pursuit of his Father’s will. He made a decision. He made up his mind. He charted a course of action for the rest of his life. He fulfilled the prophecy of the 40th Psalm, which states, in part: “Sacrifice and offering thou hast no delight in; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt-offering and sin-offering hast thou not required. Then said I, Lo, I am come; in the roll of the book it is written of me: I delight to do thy will, O my God; yea, thy law is within my heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955447/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 40:6-8</a>, <em>AS</em>) In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955447/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">the tenth chapter of Hebrews</a> the apostle Paul quotes from this prophecy, stating that it applied to Christ Jesus at his dedication. So we see this devoted Son of God made a personal, solemn dedication of himself to his God, to do his will and follow the law of God held in the heart of this dedicated servant. From that course of action into which he was there initiated he never swerved. That decision was important to Jesus. A similar decision is important to you.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 7. (a) What leads up to dedication? (b) Are formalities appropriate? Why?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> What led up to Jesus’ dedication? Knowledge that he had concerning God, love for his heavenly Father and earnest desire to forward the cause of pure worship to the advancement of Jehovah’s purposes to the vindication of his name. What leads a man to dedicate himself to Jehovah today? A knowledge of the truth, an understanding of Jehovah’s purposes, the possibilities of life set before men through Christ Jesus, appreciation of God’s provisions through his Son, love developed in the heart of the individual and a decision to follow, not the practices and standards of the ungodly, Devil-ruled old world, but the will of God in vindication of his name. It is a dedication to the Supreme One. Why did not Jesus simply go about his work, <span id="page376" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="376" data-before-text="376"></span>putting his hand to it and doing what he could in the furtherance of his ministry? Why should he dedicate himself? For the reason that the doing of God’s will, carrying on his worship, is no casual affair. It is not something that is all right if you do it and all right if you do not. Dedication to Jehovah calls for special solemnities, the making of a contract, a formal agreement which, when evidenced, gives notice to all concerned and all observing as to what to expect from the individual henceforth. It calls for punctiliousness, orderliness.</p>

<strong>Are You Doing God’s Will?</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>Maintaining the Joy of Doing God’s Will</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">King David of ancient Israel was one who sought to do God’s will all his life. In spite of the many hardships and pressures brought against him, he was inspired to say: “To do your will, O my God, I have delighted, and your law is within my inward parts.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994166/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 40:8</a>) Doing Jehovah’s will was in David’s very soul, in his very being. That was the secret of his unfading joy in serving Jehovah. Doing God’s will was not a hardship to David. Rather, it was a delight, something that came from his heart. All through his life, he struggled to do his best to serve his God, Jehovah, even though he did sometimes sin and fall short.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">On occasion, our joy may wane. We may become fatigued or downhearted. Perhaps our past haunts us, our conscience troubling us over some wrong act committed long in the past. Often, we can conquer these feelings by a more thorough study of God’s Word. We can aim to inscribe God’s law on our “inward parts,” as David did.

Can you too serve full-time in the preaching work so that your joy may also abound?</p>

The Bible records some of his significant words, as later quoted by the apostle Paul: “‘Sacrifice and offering you did not want, but you prepared a body for me. You did not approve of whole burnt offerings and sin offering.’ Then I said, ‘Look! I am come (in the roll of the book it is written about me) to do your will, O God.’”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1990763/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:5-7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1990763/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Luke 3:21</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Thus, Jesus applied to himself the prophecy at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1990763/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Psalm 40:6-8</a>, which foretold Jehovah’s purpose to bring an end to animal sacrifices offered by Aaronic priests at Jerusalem’s temple. Jehovah did not “delight” in those offerings, in that they were only typical and unable to atone completely for human sin. Hence, Jehovah prepared a perfect human body for Jesus to sacrifice. God transferred the life of his heavenly Son to the womb of a Jewish virgin. Jesus was thus born uncontaminated by the sin of Adam. He was a perfect human Son of God, whose life could atone for the sin of mankind.

<strong>How Baptism Can Save Us</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Whether young or old, undoubtedly a baptismal candidate wants to remain faithful to Jehovah. So why do some baptized Christians experience a spiritual relapse? Though various factors may be involved, there seems to be one fundamental cause​—a failure to understand all that is meant by dedication. It is not a matter of dedicating ourselves to a <em>work.</em> That would keep us busy but would not make us spiritual persons. We need to remember that we are dedicated not to a work but to a <em>Person</em>​—Jehovah God. This helps us to avoid the mistake of viewing our dedication as a perfunctory step we had to take before getting on with the work. Making a dedication should be viewed as entering into a vital <em>relationship</em> that must always be guarded and maintained. In this respect, we have the example of Jesus Christ. Expressing his heartfelt attitude when presenting himself to Jehovah are the prophetic words: “I have come . . . To do your will, O my God, I have delighted, and your law is within my inward parts.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989044/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 40:6-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989044/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Hebrews 10:5-10</a>.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">18.

He told a Jewish scribe that Jehovah our God is one and there is no other, thus stressing Jehovah’s supremacy. Then Jesus showed that the essence of God’s law consists of loving Jehovah with our whole heart, understanding, and strength, while loving our neighbor as ourselves. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989044/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Mark 12:28-34</a>) That is the basic reason why Jesus could say, ‘I delight to do God’s will.’ He was able to stick to his course faithfully despite the greatest tests and sufferings, not just because he saw this as a good work but because he had a close relationship with Jehovah God. If we similarly acknowledge Jehovah’s supremacy and love him with unbreakable attachment, we will live up to our dedication and baptism.</p>

<strong>Dedication—To Whom? Why?</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> It was to this dedicated nation that the forerunner of Jesus Christ, John the Baptizer, was sent, to call the nation to repentance. Even Jesus said: “I was not sent forth to any but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982128/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matthew 15:24</a>) The message to this dedicated people of God was a special one, not applicable to non-Israelite nations. John the Baptizer called upon those “lost sheep of the house of Israel” to repent of their sins against the Law covenant. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982128/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 3:1-6</a>) “John baptized with the baptism in symbol of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982128/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Acts 19:4</a>) However, when Jesus presented himself to John for water baptism, this obviously was not in symbol of repentance, for Jesus was sinless and no violator of the Law covenant under which he had been born. John, knowing this, hesitated to baptize Jesus, but complied with his request on being told: “Let it be, this time, for in that way it is suitable for us to carry out all that is righteous.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982128/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matthew 3:13-17</a>) What did he mean?</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">13.

So when getting baptized, Jesus was not dedicating himself to God, for he was already a member of a dedicated nation and, being sinless, needed no conversion. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982128/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Hebrews 7:26</a>) Rather, his baptism was a symbol of the <em>presenting of himself</em> to his heavenly Father to do His further will. And in this respect Jesus set a pattern for the baptism of his disciples.</p>

<strong>Baptism—Only a Beginning</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> From all of this we can surely conclude that Jesus, especially when approaching the age of thirty, had a keen perception of what was ahead of him. He knew that his baptism was only a beginning. A beginning of just his ministry and future reward on proving faithful? No. There was something that went along with those things, but now going much deeper. That deeper and more important and precious thing was his relationship with his heavenly Father, now taking on an added meaning, a spiritual one. This is indicated at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976607/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 40:6-10</a>, which Jesus doubtless came to realize was speaking prophetically of himself, telling of the sacrifice of his perfect human body in preference to all the animal sacrifices offered under the Law given through Moses. That this is the correct understanding is confirmed by Paul’s quotation of this passage at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976607/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:5-9</a>. However, despite the suffering and death involved in this sacrifice, what was Jesus’ attitude, also the basis for that attitude? Notice the answer as given at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976607/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 40:8</a>: “To do your will, O my God, I have delighted, and your law is within my inward parts.”</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu"> 7.

Thereafter he would maintain and strengthen that relationship by always seeking to please and honor his Father, come what may, “for better or for <span id="page506" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="506" data-before-text="506"></span>worse,” as is often said when a couple is taking the marriage vows.

But in your case, the step of baptism is an outward and public symbol of your dedication to do God’s will, and because of your having been a slave of sin, it is also “the request made to God for a good conscience.” Though still imperfect, you “now present your members as slaves to righteousness with holiness in view.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974727/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:21–4:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974727/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Rom. 6:19</a>.</p>

He obtained this by thoroughly absorbing his Father’s Word, as foretold concerning him: “Your law is within my inward parts.” It was this that enabled him to say at the beginning of his ministry and trialsome course: “To do <span id="page178" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="178" data-before-text="178"></span>your will, O my God, I have delighted.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972203/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 40:8</a>.</p>

<strong>Producing the Chief Agent of Divine Rulership</strong><br/><p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> By presenting himself for baptism, Jesus really fulfilled the words of “the Prophets,” just as he said. The apostle Paul indicates which of the prophecies Jesus fulfilled, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972842/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:5-10</a>, where we read concerning Jesus at the time of his coming for baptism: “Hence when he comes into the world he says: ‘Sacrifice and offering you did not want, but you prepared a body for me. You did not approve of whole burnt offerings and sin offering.’ Then I said, ‘Look! I am come (in the roll of the book it is written about me) to do your will, O God.’ . . . By the said ‘will’ we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all time.” Jesus was thus fulfilling <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972842/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Psalm 40:6-8</a>. The “will” of God called for Jesus to sacrifice himself, his “body.”</p><p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="qu">25. (a) Of what, then, was Jesus’ water baptism a symbol?

It is evident that Jesus’ being baptized was symbolic. His baptism was not “in symbol of repentance for forgiveness of sins.” It was in symbol of Jesus’ coming or presenting himself to do God’s will, which divine “will” included the offering of Jesus’ body in sacrifice once for all time. As a natural Jew he was already under the Mosaic law and was a member of the only nation on earth then dedicated to God, to do “all that Jehovah has spoken.” Also, as the firstborn son of Mary, whose firstborn son her husband Joseph adopted as his own firstborn son, Jesus was sanctified to God and belonged to him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972842/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Ex. 13:1, 2</a>) For this reason Jesus had to be redeemed by Joseph and Mary in order to allow him to engage in secular work.

When Jesus presented himself to God at the time of his baptism in the Jordan River at the hands of John the Baptist, the prophetic words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970806/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 40:7, 8</a> went into fulfillment, the words thereof being the expression of Jesus’ heart: “That being so, I said: ‘Here I have come, in the roll of the book it being written about me. To do your will [pleasure, <em>margin; Young;</em> good-pleasure, <em>Rotherham</em>]<em>,</em> O my God, I have delighted, and your law is within my inward parts.’”​—<em>New World Translation,</em> 1957 edition.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">12.

You did not approve of whole burnt offerings and sin offering.” Then I said, “Look! I am come (in the roll of the book it is written about me) to do your will, O God.”’ After first saying: ‘You did not want nor did you approve of sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sin offering’​—sacrifices that are offered according to the Law—​then he actually says: ‘Look! I am come to do your will.’” That will of God was a good “will”; it was his good pleasure, or what pleased him. So, by coming at the time of baptism to do that divine will, Jesus came to do God’s good pleasure and God was well pleased in him. Likewise, when we undertake to do God’s will or good pleasure, we gain His goodwill, His favor.</p>

<strong>“Fully Accomplish Your Ministry”</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> In all of our ministry unity is essential. It is true that in the world a united front is often presented, either by a political party or in time of war. In the religious <span id="page407" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="407" data-before-text="407"></span>world, too, efforts are made in this direction, though in comparison they seem slow and cumbersome. Generally, however, is it not true that the motive prompting the united front is often that of fear, fear of a common enemy? As soon as the danger is overcome, then all too often the old factions break out again. Unity prompted by such a motive is liable to crack and break. It is not love that binds them together; but it is love, a Godlike love, that alone will bring about and lastingly preserve real, genuine unity. Let us see how this operates among all who are gathered under Christ’s administration.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">15. What initial steps are required to come into unity with God?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> Unity in any group of people must start with the individual. In this case we are concerned with Christians, or those who have become Christians. In order to become such, the first vital step is to come into unity with God. Often this is viewed as an emotional experience, a sudden conversion. But true unity requires a more solid foundation. To come into unity with God the individual must get to know the mind of God on all matters that properly concern him. That is one of the main reasons why God has given us his Word, the Bible. It expresses the mind and will of the Supreme One. As we study and get the understanding of it, our minds are influenced by the right thoughts and, in turn, we are moved to do the right works, those “which God prepared in advance for us to walk in them.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964484/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Eph. 2:10</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">16. How is the heart involved, leading to what blessed fruitage?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> But the heart as well as the mind is involved. As we learn and grow in knowledge, so our appreciation of God, the Source of all knowledge and wisdom, should also grow. Our hearts are drawn out to him in gratitude and worship, leading us to take the step of dedication and baptism, resulting in a personal and unified relationship with Jehovah. In order to maintain that relationship and meeting of the minds, we need to continue our study of his Word. This is a constant necessity. As beautifully expressed in the Psalms: “Happy is the man . . . [whose] delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.” With what result? “He will certainly become like a tree planted by streams of water that gives its own fruit in its season and the foliage of which does not wither, and everything he does will succeed.” What richer blessing could you desire?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964484/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">17.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964484/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Isa. 53:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964484/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964484/23/2" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> 12</a>) It was because his Father’s Word and law were within his inward parts. From his perfect knowledge and memory of God’s Word he knew his Father’s mind on all these things, and this guided and sustained him throughout. He knew his death was “precious in the eyes of Jehovah,” so he could say, as foretold: “To you [Jehovah] I shall offer the sacrifice of thanksgiving . . . My vows I shall pay to Jehovah.” Jesus is the perfect example of one who is at unity with Jehovah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964484/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ps. 116:15-18</a>; see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964484/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">John 5:19,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964484/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 30</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">18.

This is interesting. It comes in the detailed counsel given by Paul to both wives and husbands. We mention wives first, as both Paul and Peter do so when giving detailed counsel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964484/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Eph. 5:22-33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964484/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 3:1-7</a>) In each case they stress the need for wives to be in subjection to their husbands, even as without question the “congregation is in subjection to the Christ” in everything. This is manifested by the “incorruptible apparel of the quiet and mild spirit.” This is essential to family unity. After all, in the case of the first human couple, was it not the wife who first went wrong and aimed the initial blow at family unity by her show of independence?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964484/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Eph. 5:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964484/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 3:4</a>.</p>

<strong>Out of the Tombs to a “Resurrection of Life”</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[62]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> Jesus Christ referred to his part in connection with God’s act of bringing the believers from death across to life, when Jesus next said: “For just as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted also to the Son to have life in himself.” In view of how Jesus argued in his discourse here, he did not refer to what some persons call “inherent life” in either his heavenly Father or himself, or ‘self-existence’ according to <em>An American Translation.</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964883/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 5:26</a>) According to his argument Jesus referred to the power to impart life. Hence the <em>New English Bible</em> (of 1961) puts Jesus’ words this way: “For as the Father has life-giving power in himself, so has the Son, by the Father’s gift.” <span id="page718" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="718" data-before-text="718"></span>The Roman Catholic translation by Monsignor Ronald A. Knox conveys the same idea, reading: “As the Father has within him the gift of life, so he has granted to the Son that he too should have within him the gift of life.” <em>The New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures,</em> of 1950, presents the same thought: “For just as the Father has in himself the gift of life, so he has granted to the Son to have also in himself the gift of life.”</p><p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="qu"> 3.

As Jehovah God is the “source of life,” he could grant to his Son to have lifegiving power in himself. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964883/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 36:9</a>) Why he did so was because the human family was dying as a result of the sin committed by its first human father, Adam.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964883/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12</a>.</p><p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu"> 4, 5.

To provide this human sacrifice for offsetting mankind’s sin and relieving them of their condemnation to death Jehovah God the heavenly Father sent his Son, transferring his life from heaven to earth. Miraculously he had his Son born as the babe Jesus in Bethlehem of Judea. Jesus grew up to be a perfect man at the age of thirty, the equivalent of the perfect man Adam in Eden. True, he now had perfect human life, free from condemnation, but he had to make this human life of his available for mankind by sacrificing it in the service of his heavenly Father. So at the age of thirty years Jesus presented himself for this sacrificial service, to serve as a priest of God. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964883/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:5-10</a> the inspired writer applies the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964883/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 40:6-8</a> to Jesus and says:</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[64]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> “Hence when he comes into the world he says: ‘“Sacrifice and offering you did not want, but you prepared a body for me.

I am come to do your will.’ He does away with what is first that he may establish what is second.

There at that baptism the Father granted to the Son to have in himself life-giving power to a limited extent. It was because of this fact that the Son was able to cure the man who lay sick for thirty-eight years and also to raise Jews from the dead, even bringing his dear friend Lazarus back to life after four days of entombment. But Jesus did not yet have power to impart everlasting life to members of the condemned human family. Why not?

Jesus willingly did his Father’s bidding. His service was not done under compulsion or with reservation, but he was wholehearted, generous, and abundant in his giving. To be willing means “to be desirous, ready, prompt to do, give, grant, etc.; not slow, lazy, or reluctant.”</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu"> 6.

He was such a disturbing personality that the authorities had to liquidate Him. Real Christianity is always an explosive force.

It confessed: “We must be ashamed of ourselves because of whom? Because of Jehovah’s witnesses.” After describing how all of Jehovah’s witnesses are workers, it raised the question, ‘Is one who does not work actually a member of the congregation?’ It acknowledged that, “according to what the Bible says, he isn’t . . . Therefore we must shame ourselves before this sect. But this shame is only secondary. We must shame ourselves before God, that we have congregations everywhere calling themselves by his name, in which, however, only a few work.

Should Christians be content with a minimum of service to God and, even temporarily, concentrate on expanding material aims and ambitions? While this may seem desirable for some, it is totally undesirable for dedicated Christians. Why? It is dangerous. The Bible counsels: “Consequently I entreat you by the compassions of God, brothers, to present your bodies a sacrifice living, holy, acceptable to God, a sacred service with your power of reason.

The greatest example of all is that of Jesus Christ, who really had a consuming zeal for Jehovah’s house and worked for it. He did not hold back, saying to his Father: “The work you gave me is too much and requires many hours and much effort.” No, but he went right ahead, with the words: “To do your will, O my God, I have delighted.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962404/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 40:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962404/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Heb. 10:7-9</a>) Notice the last words, “I have delighted.” He did his Father’s will in the building up of the “living stones” of God’s spiritual temple out of love, and he rejoiced in this work. God had given him twelve apostles as secondary foundation stones of the building; he taught them and lovingly trained them to be preachers and teachers by being every day with them. He loved them so much that he laid down his own life for them and for all his “sheep.” He discharged his responsibility to the end.

He goes on, saying: “Besides those things of an external kind [that is, his daily dangers and adversities], there is what rushes in on me from day to day, the anxiety for all the congregations. Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is stumbled, and I am not incensed?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962404/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">2 Cor. 11:23-29</a>) Think of that!

In fulfillment of these promises Jehovah God “brought out his people with exultation” to the land promised.—105:9, 10, 42-44.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Bringing his people Israel into their Promised Land involved many mighty acts, and these the book of Psalms also features. It tells that Jehovah sent ten plagues upon Egypt, that he split the Red Sea so that they could pass over and that he miraculously sustained them in the wilderness, providing bread, meat and water. Noted also are the striking victories God gained for his people in the days of Barak and Gideon.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalms 78,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 83,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 105,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 106,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/4" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> 135</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Then too, the Psalms record that it was necessary for Jehovah God repeatedly to chastise his people, even to the point of bringing them into Babylonian captivity: “By the rivers of Babylon—there we sat down. We also wept when we remembered Zion.” (137:1-9) And they record also Israel’s return from captivity: “When Jehovah gathered back the captive ones of Zion, we became like those who were dreaming. . . . At that time they proceeded to say among the nations: ‘Jehovah has done a great thing in what he has done with them.’” (126:1, 2) Yes, by recording how Jehovah God dealt with his people in times past and why, the book of Psalms throws much light on life’s roadway, for thereby it acquaints us with God’s attributes and principles.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>THE LIGHT OF PROPHECY</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The book of Psalms also serves as a light on life’s roadway by reason of the prophecies it contains, many of which have already been fulfilled, giving confidence that the rest will also have fulfillment. Among the many prophecies of the Psalms regarding Jesus Christ that the Christian Greek Scriptures show had fulfillment were that he would come in dedication to do God’s will (40:8; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 10:7-9</a>); that zeal for God’s house would eat him up, as it were (69:9; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 2:17</a>); that he would be betrayed by an intimate (41:9; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 13:18</a>); that lots would be cast for his garments (22:18; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 19:24</a>); that not a bone of him would be broken (34:20; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 19:36</a>) and that God would not leave his soul in Sheol or Hades.—16:10; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 2:29-31</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Further, the book of Psalms foretold Jesus’ exaltation to the right hand of his Father, there to await God’s due time for him to go into action against God’s enemies and for God to subject all things under Christ’s feet.—110:1, 2; 8:6; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Heb. 1:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 2:8</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The fulfillment of such prophecies instills faith that the prophecies in the Psalms regarding the blessings of the Messianic reign of the King’s Son, Jesus Christ, will also have fulfillment: “Let him judge the afflicted ones of the people, let him save the sons of the poor one, and let him crush the defrauder. He will descend like the rain upon the mown grass, like copious showers that wet the earth. In his days the righteous one will sprout, and the abundance of peace until the moon is no more. There will come to be plenty of grain on the earth; on the top of the mountains there will be an overflow.”—72:4, 6, 7, 16.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>BIBLE TEACHINGS</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The book of Psalms also throws light on life’s roadway by the various Bible teachings it touches on. Fittingly it stresses the role of Jehovah God as the Universal <span id="page551" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="551" data-before-text="551"></span>Sovereign. Though ‘the rulers of earth mass together as one against Jehovah and his anointed one, Jehovah himself will laugh at them in derision, speak to them in his anger and disturb them in hot displeasure.’ (2:1, 2, 4, 5) He will put them in their place, answering the psalmists’ prayers: “Do arise, O Jehovah! Let not mortal man prove superior in strength. Let the nations be judged before your face. Do put fear into them, O Jehovah, that the nations may know that they are but mortal men.” “Fill their faces with dishonor, that people may search for your name, O Jehovah. That people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.”—9:19, 20; 83:16, 18.</p>

<strong>Should Your Baby Be Baptized?</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">From these various historical facts we must draw the following conclusion: That baptizing infants was not the practice of the early Christians. What, then, led to the practice? It is largely the view that baptism <span id="page38" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="38" data-before-text="38"></span>is a sacrament, resulting in the washing away of sins.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Does not the Bible speak of baptism for the forgiveness of sins? Yes, both in regard to the baptism performed by John the Baptist and that performed in the name of Jesus Christ. First, let us examine John’s baptism. John baptized “those repenting for forgiveness of sins. . . . they were baptized by him in the Jordan river, openly confessing their sins.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961041/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mark 1:4, 5</a>) This does not mean that baptism itself washed away sins. As <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961041/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 19:4</a> shows, according to various modern translations: “John baptized with the baptism of those repenting.” “John’s baptism was a baptism in token of repentance.” (<em>AT</em>) “John baptized with a baptism that was an expression of repentance.” (<em>Williams</em>) John’s baptism, then, was a token or symbol of a natural Jew’s having repented for sins against the law covenant. Hence John’s baptism prepared these repentant persons for the Messiah. John’s baptism, moreover, was not sprinkling but immersion in water: “John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was a great quantity of water there.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961041/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 3:23</a>) To repent from sins one had to be old enough to understand repentance. That is why John did not baptize babies.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Did things change with the institution of Christian baptism, so that now babies should be baptized? To answer that question we must ask: How was Jesus baptized? Why was Jesus baptized?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>SYMBOL OF DEDICATION</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The Son of God went to John the Baptist and, to John’s surprise, asked to be baptized. John did not understand why Jesus should be baptized and said: “I am the one needing to be baptized by you, and are you coming to me?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961041/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 3:14</a>) Jesus stood firm in his request and John obeyed, dipping Jesus under the water as he had been dipping others. Jesus was not merely sprinkled but was down in the water: “Jesus immediately came up from the water.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961041/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 3:16</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Why did Jesus get baptized? It could not have been for the removal of sins or for a sign that he had repented of sins, because he was “guileless, undefiled, separated from the sinners.” And “he committed no sin, nor was deceit found in his mouth.” A perfect man—yet Jesus was baptized!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961041/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Heb. 7:26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961041/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 2:22</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The sinless man Jesus got baptized because of his desire to do his Father’s will. Explaining this, the apostle Paul applies <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961041/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 40:6-8</a> to Jesus Christ: “Look! I am come (in the roll of the book it is written about me) to do your will, O God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961041/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Heb. 10:4-7</a>) Jesus was baptized because he wanted to symbolize his dedication to do Jehovah’s will; and he proved that he had made this dedication by turning his back on carpenter work and beginning the ministry. Jesus made this dedication as a full-grown man: “Jesus also was baptized. . . . Furthermore, Jesus himself, when he commenced his work, was about thirty years old.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961041/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 3:21,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961041/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 23</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Christian baptism today should be performed in imitation of the example that Jesus Christ set. Thus the significance of Jesus’ baptism adheres to the baptism of his followers today. The baptism of a Christian serves as a symbol that one has dedicated his life to God and has vowed, like Jesus: ‘I am come to do your will, O God.’</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Those who believe that water baptism washes away sins often quote <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961041/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 2:38</a> as support. This verse contains the apostle Peter’s words: “Repent, and let each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of your sins.” Here Peter, at Pentecost, was talking to those who had sinned against Jesus. How could they gain forgiveness? They needed to repent <span id="page39" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="39" data-before-text="39"></span>and to accept Jesus and his cleansing blood and show this by getting baptized in Jesus’ name. Not that the baptismal water would itself wash away their sins; if that were the case they would have had to get rebaptized after every new sin. But as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961041/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 22:16</a> explains: “Now why are you delaying? Rise, get baptized and wash your sins away by your calling upon his name.” How are sins washed away? Not by the water itself but by “calling upon his name.”</p>

<strong>Watch Your Associations in the Time of the End</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> As long as you are in the time of the end of this old system of things and have to live in a corrupt world, you cannot be too careful about your associations. It is difficult enough to stay on the narrow way to life without endangering your footing with bad associations. When you came into the New World society and began walking with God on the narrow way to life, you had to make many changes that were for your own good. The apostle Paul spoke about this when he said: “Quit being fashioned after this system of things, but be transformed by making your mind over, that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and complete will of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961483/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Rom. 12:2</a>) Now that you have transformed your mind from worldly thinking to Scriptural thinking, do not turn back to the old world for companions or for a marriage partner. Did not Jesus speak of worldly people as being spiritually dead when he said: “Let the dead bury their dead”? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961483/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Matt. 8:22</a>) All who have begun walking the narrow way to life are spiritually alive in God’s eyes; whereas those walking the broad way to death are spiritually <span id="page404" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="404" data-before-text="404"></span>dead while they live. Why, then, should the living seek close association with the dead?</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> Remember at all times that you are like clay and that the persons you have as companions leave their mark on your thinking. Prolonged association with their thinking, their speech and actions can influence you to be like them. If they are bad companions you will be influenced to join them in their wrong conduct and warped thinking. Do not blind yourself to the danger of bad associations. Heed the good admonition in God’s Word and profit from what happened to the nation of Israel and to Solomon for not watching their associations.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">22. Where are right associations found?</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> Seek right associations by staying close to the New World society. Have companionship with your spiritual brothers rather than with unbelievers. The weekly congregational meetings and activity with spiritual brothers in the field ministry provide opportunities for this, as well as circuit and district assemblies. Here is where you should seek friends and prospective marriage partners. Here is where you will find right associations that are a good influence for you, that help you safeguard your thinking ability and that aid you in walking with God on the narrow way to life.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">23-25. (a) In what way should a Christian choose a suitable companion? (b) What can prevent you from being among the survivors of Armageddon?</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> Do not permit the physical attractiveness of worldly persons to move you to want to be companions with them. Physical beauty is only on the surface. What counts is what is in the heart. The people of Noah’s day undoubtedly exceeded by far this present generation for physical beauty, but their hearts were bad. They were so ugly spiritually that they were not worthy of continued existence. So when you look for a mate or a friend, look beyond the surface. Look for spiritual beauty.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> Use the Bible as your basis for determining whether a person is a suitable companion or not. See if his thinking and actions are in harmony or out of harmony with it. Does he have respect for Scriptural standards of righteousness? Does he make a sincere effort to apply Scriptural principles in his daily living? Does he put God’s interests first in his life? Does he have the attitude David manifested: “To do your will, O my God, I have delighted, and your law is within my inward parts”? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961483/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ps. 40:8</a>) Is he dedicated to serve God? These and other questions you can ask yourself. When you see that his actions and mental attitude are Scripturally good, you can be sure that the person’s association will be good.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"><sup>25</sup></span> It is not the person whose mind is on the things of the world that can help you to be among those who will survive the end of this old world. He will hinder, not help you walk the narrow way that leads to life in God’s new world. If you maintain close association with such persons this side of God’s war of Armageddon, you run the greater likelihood of not reaching the other side of it. As the seven persons who survived the flood with Noah watched their associations in the time of the end of that world, so you must watch your associations in the time of the end of this world.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">26. What is the prospect for the future, and what course should be taken now to realize that future?</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"><sup>26</sup></span> You have the prospect of eternal life ahead of you in surroundings that will be free from the wickedness and corruption that dominate the present world. If you rejoice at that prospect and anxiously look forward to the righteous conditions that are Scripturally promised for that time, why try to find pleasure or companionship in the company of persons who contribute to making the present world the unrighteous place it is? Why seek as friends persons <span id="page405" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="405" data-before-text="405"></span>who will have no place in God’s new world? Do not endanger your future with such bad associations. Fill your mind with what is good and upbuilding to your faith by being selective in the people you choose to have as close companions, in what you read, in the visual entertainment you watch and in the conversation you listen to. Preserve good relations with Jehovah God and safeguard your Christian integrity by seeking right associations in this time of the end.</p>

Hence when he comes into the world he says: ‘“You did not desire sacrifice and offering, but you prepared a body for me. You did not approve of whole burnt-offerings and sin offering.” Then I said, “Look! I am come (in the roll of the book it is written about me) to do your will, O God.”’ After first saying, ‘You did not desire nor did you approve of sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt-offerings and sin offering’—sacrifices which are offered according to the Law—then he actually says, ‘Look! I am come to do your will.’ . . .

At his water baptism, at his being buried by John under the waters, Jesus symbolically died to his past situation in earthly life. His will did not die, for when he was lifted out of the Jordan he still had his power of will. He said after that: “My food is for me to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work.” “I seek not my own will but the will of him that sent me.” “I have come down from heaven to do, not my will, but the will of him that sent me. This is the will of him that sent me, that I should lose nothing out of all that he has given me but that I should resurrect it at the last day. For this is the will of my Father, that everyone that beholds the Son and exercises faith in him should have everlasting life, and I should resurrect him at the last day.” And in prayer to God just before he was betrayed by unfaithful Judas, Jesus said: “My Father, if it is not possible for this to pass away except I drink it, let your will take place.” “Nevertheless, let, not my will, but yours take place.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959404/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">John 4:34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959404/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 5:30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959404/19/2" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 6:38-40;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959404/19/3" data-bid="20-4" class="b"> Matt. 26:42;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959404/19/4" data-bid="20-5" class="b"> Luke 12:42</a>; see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959404/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:37</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">21.

Having this in mind, Jehovah in the Psalms foretold Jesus’ resurrection from the dead. The dead Jesus was buried in a nearby tomb in a rock and thus his soul, which he had poured out in death, went to Sheol or mankind’s common grave. But Jesus died with full hope of a resurrection, his hope being voiced in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 16:8-11</a>: “I have placed Jehovah in front of me constantly.

You will not allow your man of loving-kindness to see the pit. You will cause me to know the path of life. Rejoicing to the full is with your face; there is pleasantness at your right hand forever.” That this and other prophecies of the Psalms might be carried out, Jehovah God brushed aside the Devil’s preventive efforts and raised Jesus from the dead, delivering him from Sheol on the third day. God rewarded him with a spirit body in place of the sacrificed human body, that he might know again the path of life and know pleasantness at God’s right hand forever.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Acts 2:22-31</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>THE CONGREGATION AND THE KINGDOM COVENANT</strong></p><p id="p80" data-pid="80" class="qu">20.

His work was to make known the name and the sovereignty of the one true God; it was to be the foremost witness of Jehovah, it was to gather about him a congregation of disciples, spiritual brothers, who should carry forward and finish on earth the work of Kingdom witnessing that he had begun. That was part of Jehovah’s will for Jesus, as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Psalm 40:8-10</a> foretold: “To do your will, O my God, I have delighted, and your law is within my inward parts.

Your righteousness I have not covered over within my heart. Your faithfulness and your salvation I have declared. I have not hidden your loving-kindness and your trueness in the big congregation.” True to this prophecy that was written about him in the roll of God’s Bible Jesus proceeded to gather twelve apostles and other disciples round about him. To this “little flock” he was Jehovah’s Right Shepherd. But he himself was the “Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world,” and so, like the psalmist David, he could say to God his Father: “Jehovah is my Shepherd. I shall lack nothing. In grassy pastures he makes me lie down; by well-watered resting places he conducts me.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ps. 23:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p81" data-pid="81" class="qu">21.

Jesus was devoted to his God. He kept the law of the Jews. Under this law Jesus became of age at thirty years and faced the question as to what he was going to do with his life. Would he do God’s will? Was it God’s will that he keep on being a carpenter and simply conform to the Mosaic law? No, the worship of Jehovah was to be advanced and great steps forward were to be taken respecting the carrying out of his purposes including the establishment of a new theocratic organization, the Christian congregation, the gathering of its members, and eventually thereafter the establishment of the antitypical theocratic government, the kingdom of heaven, and the new world of righteousness. Jesus was acquainted with his Father and with his Father’s word in the Hebrew Scriptures. He knew Jehovah’s worthiness and was not content with being a carpenter nor would he selfishly turn aside from a pursuit of his Father’s will. He made a decision. He made up his mind. He charted a course of action for the rest of his life. He fulfilled the prophecy of the 40th Psalm, which states, in part: “Sacrifice and offering thou hast no delight in; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt-offering and sin-offering hast thou not required. Then said I, Lo, I am come; in the roll of the book it is written of me: I delight to do thy will, O my God; yea, thy law is within my heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955447/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 40:6-8</a>, <em>AS</em>) In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955447/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">the tenth chapter of Hebrews</a> the apostle Paul quotes from this prophecy, stating that it applied to Christ Jesus at his dedication. So we see this devoted Son of God made a personal, solemn dedication of himself to his God, to do his will and follow the law of God held in the heart of this dedicated servant. From that course of action into which he was there initiated he never swerved. That decision was important to Jesus. A similar decision is important to you.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 7. (a) What leads up to dedication? (b) Are formalities appropriate? Why?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> What led up to Jesus’ dedication? Knowledge that he had concerning God, love for his heavenly Father and earnest desire to forward the cause of pure worship to the advancement of Jehovah’s purposes to the vindication of his name. What leads a man to dedicate himself to Jehovah today? A knowledge of the truth, an understanding of Jehovah’s purposes, the possibilities of life set before men through Christ Jesus, appreciation of God’s provisions through his Son, love developed in the heart of the individual and a decision to follow, not the practices and standards of the ungodly, Devil-ruled old world, but the will of God in vindication of his name. It is a dedication to the Supreme One. Why did not Jesus simply go about his work, <span id="page376" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="376" data-before-text="376"></span>putting his hand to it and doing what he could in the furtherance of his ministry? Why should he dedicate himself? For the reason that the doing of God’s will, carrying on his worship, is no casual affair. It is not something that is all right if you do it and all right if you do not. Dedication to Jehovah calls for special solemnities, the making of a contract, a formal agreement which, when evidenced, gives notice to all concerned and all observing as to what to expect from the individual henceforth. It calls for punctiliousness, orderliness.</p>

It means doing God’s will not only willingly, but eagerly, enthusiastically. Doing God’s will in a perfunctory, negative or grumbling manner will never win us his approval and his reward of everlasting life in the new world; for only if we delight in doing that will shall we be able to do it in the best possible manner, to the fullest extent, and be able to persevere in doing it in spite of all the temptations the Devil and his agents may bring.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">There was a time when all God’s intelligent creatures delighted to do his will. Then a covering cherub let selfish ambition rob him of that delight and he succeeded in inducing our first parents to lose their delight in doing God’s will. Many have followed their example, such as Lot’s wife, the murmuring multitude of Israelites in the wilderness and King Saul.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In striking contrast with all such is the example given to us by Christ Jesus. In his prehuman existence, from his very creation, he brought daily delight to his Father because of always rejoicing before him as he served as a “master workman” and <em>Logos</em> or “Word”. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953122/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Prov. 8:22-30</a>, <em>AS;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953122/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 1:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953122/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Rev. 3:14</a>, <em>NW</em>) And when God’s will for the Logos indicated leaving his glorious spirit existence and coming to earth to live as a human among imperfect, unfavorable and even antagonistic surroundings, the Logos did not lose his delight in doing God’s will. When, as the man Jesus, he came to Jordan to dedicate himself to the doing of God’s will the disposition of his heart still was the same: “Lo, I am come; in the roll of the book it is written of me: I delight to do thy will, O my God; yea, thy law is within my heart.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953122/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 40:7, 8</a>, <em>AS;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953122/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Heb. 10:7-9</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jesus eagerly and zealously pushed forward in doing his Father’s will. It was his very food for him. “My food is for me to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953122/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 4:34</a>, <em>NW</em>) Ever alert, he preached early and late; he had a consuming zeal for his Father’s cause.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953122/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Mark 6:30-34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953122/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Luke 21:38;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953122/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> John 2:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953122/5/3" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> 3:2</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">What gave Jesus that delight in doing God’s will? It was ‘having God’s law within his heart’. That law consists primarily of the two great commandments: “You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind and with your whole strength,” and, “you must love your neighbor as yourself.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953122/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mark 12:30, 31</a>, <em>NW</em>) Having those commandments in his heart meant not only that he was familiar with them but that he was concerned about obeying them.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Having that love for his heavenly Father Jesus considered it a real joy to be able to vindicate his Father’s name by keeping integrity under test, and that is why he gladly gave up all he had to become the head of the kingdom that will completely vindicate Jehovah’s name by destroying all his enemies. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953122/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job, chapters 1 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953122/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953122/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Prov. 27:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953122/7/3" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> Matt. 13:45, 46;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953122/7/4" data-bid="8-5" class="b"> Phil. 2:5-11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953122/7/5" data-bid="8-6" class="b"> Heb. 12:2</a>, <em>NW</em>) So, even though God’s will meant physical and mental suffering and <span id="page102" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="102" data-before-text="102"></span>a criminal’s death, Jesus continued to do it with delight.

<strong>A Mature View of Dedication</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[27]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Perhaps, dear reader, you have never had such an experience, but you may have had the joy of helping some others to see the truth and you have seen them come along in the way described, and then, just when you thought they were safe within the fold, having taken their stand and been immersed, they commenced to waver and stumble somewhat as suggested. What has gone wrong? You recall how good their progress seemed to be while you were having a home Bible study with them. Yet now, though you are anxious to help them in any way possible, seeking divine guidance in the matter, they will not let you and perhaps even refuse to see you. You regretfully conclude nothing more can be done and that you had better turn your attention elsewhere to try to find and help fresh interest, comforting yourself with the reflection that these things were foretold in that illustration given by Jesus about the seed sown where there was no depth of soil, or where it was speedily choked by thorns. However, it was clearly pointed out in the <em>Watchtower</em> study on that parable (December 1, 1950) that these conditions causing nonfruitage are not necessarily automatic, something that cannot be altered; but, whether it is a question of helping ourselves, or someone else, we have a big responsibility. So let us look <span id="page507" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="507" data-before-text="507"></span>again at the question, What has gone wrong?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>CAUSE OF RELAPSE</strong></p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="qu">10. Is our dedication to be viewed as primarily to a work, or to a person, and what difference does this make?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[28]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> You may say that immaturity is the cause. Yes, but in what particular respect? And we suggest it may very well be a lack of understanding as to all that is meant by the step of dedication. The point we wish to make is that it is not simply a matter of dedicating ourselves to a <em>work,</em> giving it first place in our lives; but it primarily means dedicating ourselves to a <em>person,</em> The Person, Jehovah. And what difference does that make? All the difference in the world. It helps us to avoid the mistake of viewing our dedication as an elementary step taken and done with, and then getting on with the work. Rather, it should be viewed as entering into a vital <em>relationship</em> which must at all times be maintained and jealously guarded.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="qu">11. (a) Where do we find information as to Jesus’ dedication? (b) How did he reveal a mature understanding of God’s law in relation to his dedication?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> For Scriptural guidance respecting this, we could not do better than consider our Leader and Exemplar, Christ Jesus. For our profit, as well as his, Jehovah very kindly revealed in his Word precisely the reasoning of Jesus’ mind and attitude of heart which led him to be immersed at the hands of John. This was recorded in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952607/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 40</a>, written centuries before Jesus came to earth, and we can be positive as to its application because, speaking at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952607/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:5-10</a> about Jesus’ offering himself, the apostle quotes from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952607/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 40:6-8</a>. Reading these verses we learn that Jesus realized that, in place of the animal sacrifices and offerings made under the old Law covenant, it was now his privilege to offer himself as the “one sacrifice for sins perpetually”. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952607/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Heb. 10:12</a>, <em>NW</em>) And so, expressing his heart attitude in dedicating himself, he said: “Lo, I come . . . I delight to do thy will, O my God.” But, you say, does not that last expression amply prove it <em>is</em> dedication to a work, <em>to do</em> God’s will? Wait a minute! Maturity means understanding not merely some truth on any one subject, but the <em>whole</em> truth, getting the <em>complete</em> picture in mind, each part in its proper place and proportion in relation to the whole. Let us, then, give due weight to the succeeding and closing expression of Jesus’ dedication: <em>“Thy law</em> is in my very heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952607/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 40:7, 8</a>, <em>AT</em>) How so? In what form? The Ten Commandments? Jesus pointed to a much more mature view of the essence of God’s law in his summary to the Jewish scribe, saying that Jehovah our God is one and there is no other (stressing his supremacy as the paramount issue), then we must be loving him with our whole heart, understanding and strength, and also loving our neighbor as ourselves. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952607/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Mark 12:28-34</a>, <em>NW</em>) Ah, there we have the root of the matter! That was the underlying reason why Jesus could say, “I <em>delight</em> to do thy will,” and persevered and stuck to that course through the severest of sufferings and tests; not just because he saw it was a good work on which so much depended, but because of his relationship with his heavenly Father, acknowledging his supremacy and loving him with unbreakable attachment and devotion.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu">12. How does the marriage relationship show the need to put first things first?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> To illustrate the relative importance between relationship and work, consider the marriage relationship. When a woman marries she knows that in the care of the home and rearing the children there is important work ahead of her and plenty of it, for “a woman’s work is never done”. But if she is a true and wise woman she appreciates that far more important still is the need to faithfully and constantly play her part in maintaining that precious marital <span id="page508" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="508" data-before-text="508"></span>relationship of mutual love and affection and devotion, jealously guarding against anything that might cause them to begin to lose confidence or respect and to start drifting apart. In these days when selfishness has gone to seed, it seems that marriage is often viewed as a step taken and done with, rather than a relationship entered into to be maintained and guarded. This, maybe, is the reason why so many drift so quickly onto the rocks.</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976607/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">John 4:34</a>) These words of the psalmist show first a great love for Jehovah and his fine qualities and also a keen desire to see Jehovah’s good name fully vindicated. They also show a true neighbor love, a sincere desire that others should know about these things, especially those with a hearing ear who would respond and help to build up the “big congregation.” In taking up these words, Jesus set a fine example for us.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976607/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matt. 9:36-38;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976607/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> John 17:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976607/17/2" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 18-21</a>.</p>

All others must do the same, if they would now worship at the temple, even if they have no hope of themselves becoming “living stones” in it.

<strong>International Praise to the One God</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[79]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> But a dead Jesus would not serve to vindicate himself as a Son of God faithful to the death nor to vindicate Jehovah God as universal Sovereign Lord with all power and dominion. Having this in mind, Jehovah in the Psalms foretold Jesus’ resurrection from the dead. The dead Jesus was buried in a nearby tomb in a rock and thus his soul, which he had poured out in death, went to Sheol or mankind’s common grave. But Jesus died with full hope of a resurrection, his hope being voiced in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 16:8-11</a>: “I have placed Jehovah in front of me constantly. Because [he] is at my right hand I shall not be made to totter. Therefore my heart does rejoice and my glory is inclined to be joyful. Also, <span id="page631" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="631" data-before-text="631"></span>my own flesh will reside in security. For you will not leave my soul in Sheol. You will not allow your man of loving-kindness to see the pit. You will cause me to know the path of life. Rejoicing to the full is with your face; there is pleasantness at your right hand forever.” That this and other prophecies of the Psalms might be carried out, Jehovah God brushed aside the Devil’s preventive efforts and raised Jesus from the dead, delivering him from Sheol on the third day. God rewarded him with a spirit body in place of the sacrificed human body, that he might know again the path of life and know pleasantness at God’s right hand forever.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Acts 2:22-31</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>THE CONGREGATION AND THE KINGDOM COVENANT</strong></p><p id="p80" data-pid="80" class="qu">20.

His work was to make known the name and the sovereignty of the one true God; it was to be the foremost witness of Jehovah, it was to gather about him a congregation of disciples, spiritual brothers, who should carry forward and finish on earth the work of Kingdom witnessing that he had begun. That was part of Jehovah’s will for Jesus, as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Psalm 40:8-10</a> foretold: “To do your will, O my God, I have delighted, and your law is within my inward parts.

Your righteousness I have not covered over within my heart. Your faithfulness and your salvation I have declared. I have not hidden your loving-kindness and your trueness in the big congregation.” True to this prophecy that was written about him in the roll of God’s Bible Jesus proceeded to gather twelve apostles and other disciples round about him. To this “little flock” he was Jehovah’s Right Shepherd. But he himself was the “Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world,” and so, like the psalmist David, he could say to God his Father: “Jehovah is my Shepherd. I shall lack nothing.

Look! My lips I do not restrain. O Jehovah, you yourself know that well . . . Your faithfulness and your salvation I have declared. I have not hidden your loving-kindness and your trueness in the big congregation.” This was certainly true of Jesus, who was determined to finish what he began at his baptism. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976607/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">John 4:34</a>) These words of the psalmist show first a great love for Jehovah and his fine qualities and also a keen desire to see Jehovah’s good name fully vindicated. They also show a true neighbor love, a sincere desire that others should know about these things, especially those with a hearing ear who would respond and help to build up the “big congregation.” In taking up these words, Jesus set a fine example for us.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976607/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matt. 9:36-38;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976607/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> John 17:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976607/17/2" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 18-21</a>.</p>

David said that he “told the good news of righteousness in the big congregation.” Jehovah himself knew that David did not restrain his lips from telling the good news of God’s righteousness. So David could say to Jehovah God himself: “Your righteousness I have not covered over within my heart. Your faithfulness and your salvation I have declared. I have not hidden your loving-kindness and your trueness in the big congregation.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961921/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ps. 40:9, 10</a>) Jesus Christ, as the Son of David, was no less a minister of Jehovah’s Word than his royal ancestor was. He told the good news of Jehovah’s righteousness and salvation throughout the “big congregation” of the whole nation in all the territory of Israel. He never missed going to meetings at Jehovah’s temple, even when his life was in danger. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961921/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Luke 8:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961921/32/1" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> Acts 10:38, 39;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961921/32/2" data-bid="33-3" class="b"> John 7:1-10</a>) Like Jesus, all his dedicated followers must do the same thing.

He will arrange to attend all the meetings of the congregation that have been scheduled and to which he is cordially invited. He will seek to bring others to the congregational meetings. Hence he will go forth from door to door and from house to house, ministering the Word of God to people in their homes as Jesus and his twelve apostles did. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961921/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Matt. 10:5-13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961921/33/1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> Acts 20:20</a>) Thus he will be acting in fulfillment of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961921/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Isaiah 2:3</a>: “Many peoples will certainly go and say: ‘Come, you people, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will instruct us about his ways, and we will walk in his paths.’” It is needful to do this now in view of Armageddon.</p><p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="qu">38.

In these days of divine wrath against the wicked nations he will experience God’s good will and he will become numbered among God’s “men of good will.” Consequently he will enjoy peace with God and his Son Jesus Christ. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961921/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Luke 2:13, 14</a>) With more and more appreciation of the meanings of things in God’s temple organization he will look upon God’s spiritual temple by faith and will strive to be with His congregation on all occasions possible. This will fill him with more courage to keep on being God’s minister even in the face of Armageddon.</p>

David, therefore, could ask to be <em>constantly</em> safeguarded by Jehovah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005403/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 40:11</a>) Counted among the faithful men and women to whom “a better resurrection” is promised, David is presently secure in Jehovah’s memory as one who will receive that reward.

Jehovah’s trueness and his love for righteousness require that he clearly set out what his standards are. Those who live by these standards are to a great degree safeguarded from the distresses, fears, and problems experienced by those who ignore them. For example, we can protect ourselves and our loved ones from many heartbreaking problems if we avoid drug and alcohol abuse, sexual promiscuity, and a violent life-style. And even those who wander from Jehovah’s way of trueness​—as did David at times—​have the assurance that God is still “a place of concealment” for repentant wrongdoers. Such can joyfully cry out: “You will safeguard me from distress itself.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005403/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Psalm 32:7</a>) What an expression of God’s loving-kindness!</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Another example of divine loving-kindness is that God warns his servants to remain separate from the wicked world, which he will soon destroy. We read: “Do not be loving either the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him; because everything in the world​—the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one’s means of life—​does not originate with the Father, but originates with the world.” By giving heed to this warning and acting accordingly, we can literally safeguard our life <span id="page12" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>for all eternity, for the text continues: “Furthermore, the world is passing away and so is its desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005403/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 John 2:15-17</a>.</p>

<strong>Show Consideration for Single Parents</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><em>It contributes to your own happiness.</em> Have you ever helped someone carry a load that was too heavy for one person? If so, you likely felt a sense of satisfaction in knowing that you had assisted someone in a practical way. Similarly, single parents carry a load that can at times be too taxing for one person. When you respond to their needs by lending a helping hand, you will experience the truthfulness of what is stated at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010889/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 41:1</a>: “Happy is anyone acting with consideration toward the lowly one.”</p>

Helping others brings me joy.”</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Dimitar, who is in his mid-20’s, said: “My mother raised me by herself. When I was a youngster, I was happy to have a Congregation Book Study overseer who took me along every week to train me in the ministry. I am still grateful for his persistence. I know it was not always easy to motivate me.” Out of gratitude for the help he once received, Dimitar now aids others: “I try to take a young person and also an older one along with me in the field ministry at least once a month.”</p>

<strong>God Delivers the Considerate One</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The psalm begins: <em>“Happy is anyone acting with consideration toward the lowly one.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979408/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 41:1a</a>) The Hebrew word for “lowly one” literally means “thin,” “lean,” “slender.” It indicates one who is weak due to poverty, disease or depressing circumstances, and who is in need of help. The individual “acting with consideration” discerns the need of such a lowly one. Rather than disinterestedly passing by, he cares for and attends to the needy one, displaying tender fellow feeling. Such a considerate one is truly “happy,” both from enjoying the special state of well-being that comes to one who is generous and from having the favor of Almighty God, whose generosity he imitates.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979408/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 20:35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979408/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Jas. 1:17</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The psalmist goes on to say of the considerate one: <em>“In the day of calamity Jehovah will provide escape for him.</em> <em>Jehovah himself will guard him and preserve him alive.

<strong>Consideration for the Lowly Ones</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">There was Zacchaeus. He was a small man who climbed a tree to get a glimpse of Jesus. In the community he was considered a terrible sinner. Jesus come to his home? Unthinkable! He was unworthy of so great an honor. But what did Jesus do? He invited himself to Zacchaeus’ house. The account says: “With rejoicing [Zacchaeus] received him as guest.” So moved was Zacchaeus with Jesus’ visit that he <span id="page455" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="455" data-before-text="455"></span>stood up and said: “‘Look! The half of my belongings, Lord, I am giving to the poor, and whatever I extorted from anyone by false accusation I am restoring fourfold.’ At this Jesus said to him: ‘This day salvation has come to this house . . . For the Son of man came to seek and to save what was lost.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965561/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Luke 19:1-10</a>) How thrilled Zacchaeus was because Jesus took the initiative! Oftentimes, it remains for the strong to make the first step. Lowly ones feel themselves too unworthy to invite prominent personages into their homes, but they would feel eternally grateful if these would invite themselves. Such visits are unforgettable blessings and an encouragement to the lowly ones.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>SOME DESERVE SPECIAL ATTENTION</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Some lowly ones have a tendency to withdraw. They become introverted. Often these lead capsuled lives. They need help. A lowly widow of Zarephath was visited by the prophet Elijah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965561/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Ki. 17:8-24</a>) His visit proved a blessing to her. Widows and widowers often slip into lonely lives. A visit would help to change this.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">In old age the mind often takes off and the imagination goes wild. Older people feel themselves left behind. Youth can show them consideration by including them in some of their affairs. Nothing is quite so stimulating as an unexpected knock, a youthful visitor. By showing older persons a little thoughtfulness, you can help them to feel like new assets rather than old liabilities.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965561/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 15:4-6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965561/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Ex. 20:12</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Set yourself a simple but organized program for improving your relationship with the physically handicapped, with persons who have little of this world’s goods or who may have personality problems. What can you do? Make scheduled dates and appointments with such persons to visit them. When having a special dinner, the tendency is to entertain prominent guests. Why not invite lowly ones over too who may enjoy such association? Those in high stations of life are constantly feasted and showered with gifts. Here is what Jesus said: “When you spread a dinner or evening meal, do not call your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors. . . . But when you spread a feast, invite poor people, crippled, lame, blind; and you will be happy, because they have nothing with which to repay you. For you will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous ones.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965561/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Luke 14:12-14</a>) Give this thoughtful consideration the next time you prepare a feast.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">These lowly ones are generally aware of their weaknesses. No doubt they have been reminded of them dozens of times. So their need is encouragement, consideration, love. They know they need to be better mixers, freer in conversation, but with some this takes time. What you can do is love them and let them love you and your family. You can help them to be doers of things through encouragement, inviting them to work with you at Christian assemblies or in the ministry. You can help them to keep in touch with other people by visiting them, by bringing someone along with you.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">None of this effort is wasted. The Bible says: “Happy is anyone acting with consideration toward the lowly one; in the day of calamity Jehovah will provide escape for him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965561/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 41:1</a>) Happiness is sure to come, and this is no small reward. These lowly ones are sure to remember you in their prayers, which in itself is an unspeakable blessing. But in addition to all of this, Jehovah promises protection to those who show consideration to his lowly ones. What other effort could be more worth while?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"></p>

The very book of Psalms opens with a beatitude, “Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked ones, and in the way of sinners has not stood and in the seat of ridiculers has not sat.

Kiss the son, that He may not become incensed and you may not perish [from] the way, for his anger flares up easily.

<strong>Dispelling the Spirit of Complaint</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Jehovah’s witnesses are not discouraged at this time because of the happenings in the world. We are in the midst of a wicked organization, ‘the Devil’s world,’ as the Bible calls it. It is filled with grief and sorrow and is in a miserable state; but there is no reason why Jehovah’s witnesses should be unhappy even though living in it. Though we are in it, we do not have to be a part of it. When we look at Jehovah’s organization, we marvel at its prosperity and its growth despite all the pressure that has been brought against it by those who oppose the good news. Jehovah’s witnesses have seen their work stopped or hindered in many countries, but that does not discourage them. Are we now to complain to God and tell him he does not know how to run his business? Are we to look at Russia and say, “God, why have you failed to get missionaries of Jehovah’s witnesses into that land to preach?” We cannot dictate to God because of certain unhappy experiences that occur to Jehovah’s witnesses behind the Iron Curtain. Those of Jehovah’s witnesses who are there have the same Word of God, and they are continuing to faithfully preach the good news. Jehovah’s witnesses in other countries where there is greater freedom should go about and preach the message of God’s kingdom even more extensively and be grateful that they have the opportunity. Do not neglect your freedom to speak in <span id="page54" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="54" data-before-text="54"></span>your territory. Sometimes our brothers in democratic lands where there is freedom of speech do not show as much zeal in going from house to house as the publishers do who live in countries where there is continuous opposition.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 7. What questions should we ask and answer about serving under conditions like those in such lands?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Stop and think for a moment. What would you do if your government told you that you could not worship Jehovah God any longer and that you could not put your God ahead of the state? What would you do under those circumstances? Where would you find happiness? Would it be by changing your mind over to worship according to the decree of the state? Or would your happiness come only in worshiping Jehovah God as he directs through his Word? Would you quit preaching to others if you encountered opposition? Or would you stand firm to preach the gospel as you had the opportunity? Would you complain as some do and say: “God, why did you bring this on me?” Maybe you would think: “Why could I not have been born in some other country where there is not as much trouble? Why does not the Watch Tower Society move me from this country to another and have me preach there?” A true Christian servant of the Most High could not give up his preaching of the good news of God’s kingdom. Oh, there are many things we could complain about; but if we have the right heart condition, we will be grateful to God for the opportunity to serve wherever he sends us or wherever we may be, because we know that this gospel of the Kingdom must be preached everywhere. People are people no matter where we find them, and there are good and bad among them. If there are “sheep” there, we want to find them.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 8. Why do Jehovah’s witnesses preach no matter where they are and under unfavorable conditions?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Remember that God is directing his organization, and he is going to have this gospel of the Kingdom preached in all the world for a witness. So no matter where we go, no matter what we have to do, we must stand firm to continue in that preaching work. It is a work that must be done. We do not want to become complainers, for then we are apt to stop preaching the truth; and once we stop giving out the truth to others we shall lose our happiness. Many faithful witnesses today are happy even in prisons and concentration camps, and even in such places they keep busy by preaching the gospel to other inmates. Jehovah’s witnesses are happy in countries where the message of the Kingdom has been banned. They keep on talking about the truth though they have hard times with opposition and persecution. They remember that Peter said: “Indeed, who is the man that will harm you if you become zealous for what is good? But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are happy. However, do not become afraid of what they are afraid of, neither become agitated. But sanctify the Christ as Lord in your hearts, always ready to make a defense before everyone that demands of you a reason for the hope in you, but doing so together with a mild temper and deep respect.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953044/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:13-15</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 9. How is the one who is attentive to the poor happy today?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Jehovah is very well pleased with those who are interested in the poor of this world, because it is this class of people who listen to the message of the Kingdom. The psalmist said: “How happy is he that is attentive to the poor, in the day of calamity will Yahweh deliver him: Yahweh will preserve him and keep him alive and he shall be pronounced happy in the land, do not then give him up at the desire of his enemies!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953044/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 41:1, 2</a>, <em>Ro</em>) We certainly cannot quit preaching this gospel <span id="page55" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="55" data-before-text="55"></span>of the Kingdom just because it is the desire of our enemies. Rather, Jehovah’s witnesses will be pronounced happy if they keep these truths concerning Jehovah’s kingdom before the poor of the world, those who are sighing and crying because of the abominations of this old system. When we think of our brothers and sisters and of all the servants of God in other lands and how the enemy has kept them under assault, we should be very thankful to God for the freedom we have and should show our gratitude by preaching the gospel to a greater extent while we still have the opportunity. All should show their maturity by setting the right example in house-to-house witnessing, by conducting home Bible studies and by aiding the immature ones to be more consistent in their field service.</p>

King David wrote: “Happy is anyone who shows consideration to the lowly one; Jehovah will rescue him in the day of calamity. Jehovah will guard him and keep him alive.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2015925/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 41:1, 2</a>) We know that an individual living in David’s day who showed consideration to a lowly one did not keep living without end. Hence, David could not have meant that such a considerate individual would be kept alive miraculously, thus gaining everlasting life. We can take those inspired words to mean that God would help the loyal considerate one. How? David explained: “Jehovah will sustain him on his sickbed; during his sickness you will completely change his bed.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2015925/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 41:3</a>) Yes, an individual who showed consideration to a lowly one could be certain that God was aware of him and his faithful course. And the recuperative power of his God-given body might help him to get better, to recover from his sickness.</p>

Do we want to be happy? We can be. How? There are twenty-four happinesses or beatitudes in the Psalms that tell us the secret of how to be happy with the happiness that will never end. It is instructive for us to hear some of these beatitudes! The very book of Psalms opens with a beatitude, “Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked ones, and in the way of sinners has not stood and in the seat of ridiculers has not sat. But his delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1, 2</a>) The beatitude in the Second Psalm is one that not only world rulers but all of us under the shadow of Armageddon ought to heed: “Serve Jehovah with fear and be joyful with trembling. Kiss the son, that He may not become incensed and you may not perish [from] the way, for his anger flares up easily. Happy are all those taking refuge in him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Ps. 2:11, 12</a>.</p><p id="p98" data-pid="98" class="qu">38.

What would you do if your government told you that you could not worship Jehovah God any longer and that you could not put your God ahead of the state? What would you do under those circumstances? Where would you find happiness? Would it be by changing your mind over to worship according to the decree of the state? Or would your happiness come only in worshiping Jehovah God as he directs through his Word? Would you quit preaching to others if you encountered opposition? Or would you stand firm to preach the gospel as you had the opportunity? Would you complain as some do and say: “God, why did you bring this on me?” Maybe you would think: “Why could I not have been born in some other country where there is not as much trouble? Why does not the Watch Tower Society move me from this country to another and have me preach there?” A true Christian servant of the Most High could not give up his preaching of the good news of God’s kingdom. Oh, there are many things we could complain about; but if we have the right heart condition, we will be grateful to God for the opportunity to serve wherever he sends us or wherever we may be, because we know that this gospel of the Kingdom must be preached everywhere. People are people no matter where we find them, and there are good and bad among them. If there are “sheep” there, we want to find them.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 8.

So no matter where we go, no matter what we have to do, we must stand firm to continue in that preaching work. It is a work that must be done. We do not want to become complainers, for then we are apt to stop preaching the truth; and once we stop giving out the truth to others we shall lose our happiness. Many faithful witnesses today are happy even in prisons and concentration camps, and even in such places they keep busy by preaching the gospel to other inmates. Jehovah’s witnesses are happy in countries where the message of the Kingdom has been banned. They keep on talking about the truth though they have hard times with opposition and persecution. They remember that Peter said: “Indeed, who is the man that will harm you if you become zealous for what is good? But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are happy. However, do not become afraid of what they are afraid of, neither become agitated. But sanctify the Christ as Lord in your hearts, always ready to make a defense before everyone that demands of you a reason for the hope in you, but doing so together with a mild temper and deep respect.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953044/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:13-15</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 9.

The psalmist said: “How happy is he that is attentive to the poor, in the day of calamity will Yahweh deliver him: Yahweh will preserve him and keep him alive and he shall be pronounced happy in the land, do not then give him up at the desire of his enemies!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953044/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 41:1, 2</a>, <em>Ro</em>) We certainly cannot quit preaching this gospel <span id="page55" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="55" data-before-text="55"></span>of the Kingdom just because it is the desire of our enemies. Rather, Jehovah’s witnesses will be pronounced happy if they keep these truths concerning Jehovah’s kingdom before the poor of the world, those who are sighing and crying because of the abominations of this old system. When we think of our brothers and sisters and of all the servants of God in other lands and how the enemy has kept them under assault, we should be very thankful to God for the freedom we have and should show our gratitude by preaching the gospel to a greater extent while we still have the opportunity. All should show their maturity by setting the right example in house-to-house witnessing, by conducting home Bible studies and by aiding the immature ones to be more consistent in their field service.</p>

<strong>Diseases and Treatment</strong><br/><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">Nevertheless, when one of God’s servants is physically ill, it is proper for him to pray to Jehovah for the fortitude needed to bear his malady and for spiritual strength to maintain integrity during this period of weakness in the flesh. “Jehovah himself will sustain [such a person] upon a divan of illness.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001191/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Ps 41:1-3</a>; see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001191/65/0" data-bid="66-1" class="b">1Ki 8:37-40</a>.</p>

<strong>Healing</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Among the blessings Jehovah bestowed on all mankind is the regenerative power of their physical organisms, the ability of the body to heal itself when wounded or diseased. A physician may recommend certain measures to speed recovery, but in reality it is the God-given recuperative powers within the body that accomplish the healing. Hence, the psalmist David acknowledged that though he was born imperfect, his Creator was able to sustain him during illness and heal all his maladies. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001946/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps 51:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001946/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 41:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001946/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 103:2-4</a>) Jehovah restored the bodily health of afflicted Job (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001946/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 42:10</a>) and God also provided physical healing for his people Israel.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001946/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ex 15:26</a>.</p>

<strong>Jehovah Will Sustain You</strong><br/><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong><strong> <a href="/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2015925/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Psalm 41:3</a> provides what encouraging assurance?</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Still, if we are ill, we can look to God for comfort, wisdom, and support, as did true worshippers in the past. King David wrote: “Happy is anyone who shows consideration to the lowly one; Jehovah will rescue him in the day of calamity. Jehovah will guard him and keep him alive.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2015925/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 41:1, 2</a>) We know that an individual living in David’s day who showed consideration to a lowly one did not keep living without end. Hence, David could not have meant that such a considerate individual would be kept alive miraculously, thus gaining everlasting life. We can take those inspired words to mean that God would help the loyal considerate one. How? David explained: “Jehovah will sustain him on his sickbed; during his sickness you will completely change his bed.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2015925/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 41:3</a>) Yes, an individual who showed consideration to a lowly one could be certain that God was aware of him and his faithful course. And the recuperative power of his God-given body might help him to get better, to recover from his sickness.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>8.</strong><strong> According to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2015925/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Psalm 41:4</a>, what did David seek from Jehovah?</strong></p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> David spoke from experience: “I said: ‘O Jehovah, show me favor. Heal me, for I have sinned against you.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2015925/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 41:4</a>) He may have written that regarding the time when Absalom tried to usurp the throne while David was ill and unable to handle the situation. Despite having received God’s forgiveness, David did not forget his own sin with Bath-sheba and its consequences. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2015925/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Sam. 12:7-14</a>) Still, the king was sure that God would sustain him <span id="page25" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>on his sickbed. But was David asking for a miraculous healing and an extension of life?</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>9.</strong><strong> (a) How did David’s case differ from that of King Hezekiah? (b) What could David expect from Jehovah?</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Years later, God chose to heal King Hezekiah, who “became sick and was at the point of death.” In that unusual case, God intervened. Hezekiah recovered and lived on for 15 years. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2015925/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Ki. 20:1-6</a>) David, on the other hand, did not pray for God to heal him miraculously. The context suggests that David asked Jehovah to help him in the same way that He would help an individual who showed consideration to a lowly one. That included being sustained “on his sickbed.” Because David’s sin had been forgiven, he could ask that God would comfort and support him and that the physical resources of his body might enable him to recover. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2015925/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 103:3</a>) We can do likewise.</p>

<strong>Jehovah—“Provider of Escape” in Bible Times</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> David’s trust in “the Provider of escape” did not waver. Concerning an upright worshipper who is ill, David said: “In the day of calamity Jehovah will provide escape for him. Jehovah himself will sustain him upon a divan of illness; all his bed you will certainly change during his sickness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008682/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ps. 41:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008682/31/1" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 3</a>) Here again, notice David’s confidence, as expressed in the words “Jehovah himself will.” David was sure that Jehovah would provide escape for him. How?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> David did not expect Jehovah to perform a miracle and remove the sickness. Rather, David felt certain that Jehovah would “sustain him”​—that is, give him support and strength while he was lying on his sickbed. David definitely needed such help. In addition to the sickness that weakened him, he was surrounded by enemies who were saying evil things about him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008682/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Verses 5, 6</a>) Jehovah may well have strengthened David by bringing to his mind comforting thoughts. Notably, David said: “Because of my integrity you have upheld me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008682/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Verse 12</a>) David may also have found strength in reflecting on the fact that despite his weakened condition and the bad things that his enemies were saying, Jehovah regarded him as a man of integrity. David did finally recover from his sickness. Is it not reassuring to know that Jehovah can sustain those who are sick?​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008682/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">2 Cor. 1:3</a>.</p>

He explains: “I have <span id="page11" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>had moments of pain and frustration when I have felt that death would be my only means of escape. Whenever I feel overwhelmed, I pray that Jehovah give me three things: a calm heart, patience, and endurance. I feel that Jehovah has answered those prayers. A calm heart lets me reflect on comforting thoughts, such as what it will be like in the new world when I will be able to walk, enjoy a tasty meal, and talk with my family again. Patience helps me to put up with the inconveniences and challenges of paralysis. Endurance enables me to keep faithful and not lose my spiritual balance. I can truly identify with the psalmist David, for I feel that Jehovah has sustained me upon my divan of illness.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008683/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Isa. 35:5, 6</a>.</p>

<strong>Trust in Jehovah Completely in Times of Distress</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Is it realistic to trust in Jehovah in the face of serious illness? Absolutely! Jehovah feels for sick ones among his people. More than that, he is willing to help. Consider, for example, King David. He himself may have been seriously ill when he wrote of God’s dealings with an upright sick one. He said: “Jehovah himself will sustain him upon a divan of illness; all his bed you will certainly change during his sickness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003643/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 41:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003643/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003643/17/2" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 7, 8</a>) David’s trust in God remained strong, and finally the king recovered from his illness.

He trusts in God to guard him during infirmity, and others ‘pronounce him happy in the earth’ by spreading the news of Jehovah’s merciful dealings with him. God sustained David “upon a divan of illness,” perhaps during the stressful time when David’s son Absalom sought to seize Israel’s throne.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991723/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Samuel 15:1-6</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Since David had shown consideration to the lowly, he felt that God would sustain him while he was helpless in a sickbed.

It would be as though Jehovah were transforming his bed from one of illness into one of recuperation. Similarly, if we are suffering illness as God’s servants, Jehovah’s everlasting arms will support us.</p>

The psalmist says: “Jehovah himself will sustain him upon a divan of illness; all his bed you will certainly change during his sickness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979285/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ps. 41:3</a>) God does not promise that his servant will in all cases recover full health. But he assures the Christian that he will stand by him and make his sickness bearable. The language of the psalm reminds one of a nurse who constantly attends a patient so that no part of the body is uneasy, or of a parent lovingly taking care of a sick child, making him comfortable, washing him, changing and smoothing his bed, so that he feels refreshed and cheered up. If it is best for the individual, God can raise him up out of his sickbed and turn it into a bed of health. But even if he does not recover, God causes all things to work for his good. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979285/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Rom. 8:28</a>) Spiritually he is made stronger, and endures the sickness, regarding it as a form of discipline or training that is shaping him to be a stronger, more considerate, more sympathetic Christian. He remembers that Christ suffered. Jesus’ experience worked for his benefit, and ours. God did not forsake Jesus, and his reward for patient endurance was great.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979285/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Heb. 4:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979285/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 5:8, 9</a>.</p>

Despite pain, he is able to maintain a comparatively cheerful outlook, being strengthened by God’s spirit to endure.</p>

<strong>What Do You Say to God?</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The Bible gives specific examples of praying to God regarding one’s troubles. For example, the person who is physically ill can pray to God, asking that “Jehovah himself will sustain him upon a divan of illness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101974401/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 41:3</a>) King Hezekiah of Judah did.

We can pray for consolation from Jehovah, and for patience until the body’s marvelous healing forces can restore health.</p>

<strong>“Carry On Prayer on Every Occasion in Spirit”</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> One of Jehovah’s witnesses who is a civil engineer has enjoyed a steady secular job with a construction firm in the western part of the United States. This man is also a presiding minister of a congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses and realizes that his secular job is only secondary to his primary vocation of the Christian ministry. As in Paul’s case, it is merely the ‘tentmakers’ trade.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964684/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Acts 18:1-4</a>) The salary of this overseer’s secular job is good and adequate. He puts in forty hours a week at the place of business and thereafter has a free mind for his ministerial activities. Last year the owners of the business made him a tempting offer to become the factory supervisor. They offered an increased salary and other so-called benefits. But there were also increased responsibilities that might bring many sleepless nights and extra activities beyond the present forty hours a week. This tempting offer was taken to Jehovah in prayer. The result was that he was strengthened to turn down the <span id="page562" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="562" data-before-text="562"></span>offer.

Yes, David, once ill, wrote of Jehovah’s dealing with sick ones: “Jehovah himself will sustain him upon a divan of illness; all his bed you will certainly change during his sickness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964684/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ps. 41:3</a>) Jehovah’s people do not pray for faith healing. Rather, they pray that wise steps may be taken to cope with their particular health problem. In addition, prayer brings one consolation from Jehovah that enables him to exercise patience and long-suffering to put up with the illness until the healing forces of the physical body are able to bring about restoration to health.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> A lady minister of Jehovah some time back faced a serious problem of having an operation for a malignant growth. None of the local doctors would agree to perform the operation without a blood transfusion. In harmony with her prayer for guidance, a diligent search was made in other parts of the country for a surgeon who would perform the operation without blood. Such a surgeon was found. He operated successfully without a blood transfusion. The sister has been restored to health for further ministerial service. It was through prayer that the sister’s faith was strengthened not to take a blood transfusion at any cost.

Prayer is vitally necessary to overcome this dangerous condition into which one has slipped. James gives advice on this matter: “Is there anyone sick among you? Let him call the older men of the congregation to him, and let them pray over him, greasing him with oil in the name of Jehovah. And the prayer of faith will make the indisposed one well, and Jehovah will raise him up.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964684/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Jas. 5:14, 15</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Some years back one of the anointed ministers of Jehovah had become spiritually ill. Two of the older brothers were asked to visit him. They found that the anointed brother had lost confidence and that he had not prayed to Jehovah for three months. No wonder he was spiritually ill! As soothing oil, the Bible as the Word of God was used by these visiting ministers to restore perception as to Jehovah’s purposes in the mind and heart of this ailing one. They prayed with the sick brother in his own home to bring about this restoration to spiritual better health. That visit brought results. In this connection James goes on to record: “A righteous man’s supplication, when it is at work, has much force.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964684/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Jas. 5:16</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong>PRAYERS DURING PERSECUTION</strong></p><p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="qu">17, 18.

Others undergo severe suffering of evil in their own homes or in their own surrounding community because of their stand as one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Prayer is a must to endure such persecutions.

Despite having received God’s forgiveness, David did not forget his own sin with Bath-sheba and its consequences. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2015925/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Sam. 12:7-14</a>) Still, the king was sure that God would sustain him <span id="page25" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>on his sickbed.

The context suggests that David asked Jehovah to help him in the same way that He would help an individual who showed consideration to a lowly one. That included being sustained “on his sickbed.” Because David’s sin had been forgiven, he could ask that God would comfort and support him and that the physical resources of his body might enable him to recover.

<strong>Foreknowledge, Foreordination</strong><br/>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sn"><strong><em>Did God predestine Judas to betray Jesus in order to fulfill prophecy?</em></strong></p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb">The traitorous course of Judas Iscariot fulfilled divine prophecy and demonstrated Jehovah’s foreknowledge as well as that of his Son. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/101/0" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Ps 41:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/101/1" data-bid="102-2" class="b"> 55:12, 13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/101/2" data-bid="102-3" class="b"> 109:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/101/3" data-bid="102-4" class="b"> Ac 1:16-20</a>) Yet it cannot be said that God foreordained or predestinated Judas himself to such a course. The prophecies foretold that some intimate acquaintance of Jesus would be his betrayer, but they did not specify which of those sharing such acquaintance it would be. Again, Bible principles rule against God’s having foreordained Judas’ actions. The divine standard stated by the apostle is: “Never lay your hands hastily upon any man; neither be a sharer in the sins of others; preserve yourself chaste.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/102/0" data-bid="103-1" class="b">1Ti 5:22</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/103/0" data-bid="104-1" class="b">3:6</a>.) Evidencing his <span id="page858" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="858" data-before-text="858"></span>concern that the selection of his 12 apostles be wisely and properly made, Jesus spent the night in prayer to his Father before making known his decision. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/104/0" data-bid="105-1" class="b">Lu 6:12-16</a>) If Judas were already divinely foreordained to be a traitor, this would result in inconsistency in God’s direction and guidance and, according to the rule, would make him a sharer in the sins that one committed.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="sb">Thus, it seems evident that at the time of his being selected as an apostle, Judas’ heart presented no definite evidence of a treasonous attitude. He allowed a ‘poisonous root to spring up’ and defile him, resulting in his deviation and in his accepting, not God’s direction, but the Devil’s leading in a course of thievery and treachery.

<strong>Hanging</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In two cases of suicide recorded in the Bible, strangulation by hanging was employed. Ahithophel, David’s traitorous counselor, strangled himself (“hanged himself,” <em>LXX</em>).

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001860/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Mt 27:5</a>) Apparently the rope, or perhaps a branch of the tree on which Judas hanged himself, broke, “and pitching head foremost he noisily burst in his midst and all his intestines were poured out.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001860/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ac 1:18</a>.</p>

<strong>Heel</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">King David spoke figuratively of his traitorous companion Ahithophel, saying: “[He] has magnified his heel against me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001959/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps 41:9</a>) This had a prophetic fulfillment in Judas Iscariot, to whom Jesus applied the text, saying: “He that used to feed on my bread has lifted up his heel against me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001959/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Joh 13:18</a>) Thus the expression indicates a treacherous action, one threatening harm to the person against whom the heel is “magnified” or “lifted up.”</p>

<strong>Hospitality</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"><strong>The Guest.</strong> In ancient times the guest, while treated with the utmost courtesy and honor, was expected to observe certain amenities and requirements. For example, it was considered among the vilest of acts to partake of another man’s food and then betray him or bring harm to him.

<strong>Foreknowledge, Foreordination</strong><br/><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="sb">Paul’s quotations concerning Jehovah’s ‘love for Jacob [Israel] and his hatred for Esau [Edom]’ comes from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/76/0" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Malachi 1:2, 3</a>, written long after Jacob and Esau’s time. So the Bible does not necessarily say that Jehovah held such opinion of the twins before their birth. It is a scientifically established fact that much of a child’s general disposition and temperament are determined at the time of conception, due to the genetic factors contributed by each parent. That God can see such factors is self-evident; David speaks of Jehovah as seeing “even the embryo of me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/77/0" data-bid="78-1" class="b">Ps. 139:14-16</a>; see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/78/0" data-bid="79-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 11:5</a>.) To what extent such divine insight affected Jehovah’s foreordination concerning the two boys cannot be said, but, at any rate, his choice of Jacob over Esau did not of itself doom Esau or his descendants, the Edomites, to destruction.

Nor is there any indication that God coerced the individuals to act against their own will. In the cases of Pharaoh, Judas Iscariot, and God’s own Son, there is no evidence that Jehovah’s foreknowledge was exercised prior to the person’s coming into existence. Within these individual cases certain principles are illustrated, bearing on God’s foreknowledge and foreordination.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="sb">One such principle is God’s testing of individuals by causing or allowing certain circumstances or events, or by causing such individuals to hear his inspired messages, the result being that they are obliged to exercise their free choice to make a decision and thus reveal a definite heart attitude, read by Jehovah.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/92/0" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Rom. 9:14-18</a>) Likewise, according to many translations, God advised Moses that he would “harden [Pharaoh’s] heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/93/0" data-bid="94-1" class="b">Ex. 4:21</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/94/0" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Exodus 9:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/94/1" data-bid="95-2" class="b"> 10:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/94/2" data-bid="95-3" class="b"> 27</a>.) However, some translations render the Hebrew account to read that Jehovah “let [Pharaoh’s] heart wax bold” (<em>Ro</em>); “let [Pharaoh’s] heart became obstinate.” (<em>NW</em>) In support of such rendering<em>,</em> the Appendix to Rotherham’s translation shows that in Hebrew the <em>occasion</em> or <em>permission</em> of an event is often presented as if it were the <em>cause</em> of the event, and that “even <em>positive commands</em> are occasionally to be accepted as meaning no more than <em>permission.”</em> Thus at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/95/0" data-bid="96-1" class="b">Exodus 1:17</a> the original Hebrew text literally says that the midwives “caused the male children to live,” whereas in reality they <em>permitted</em> them to live by refraining from putting them to death. After quoting Hebrew scholars M. M. Kalisch, H. F. W. Gesenius, and B. Davies in support, Rotherham states that the Hebrew sense of the texts involving Pharaoh is that “God permitted Pharaoh to harden his own heart—spared him—gave him the opportunity, the occasion, of working out the wickedness that was in him. That is all.”—<em>The Emphasised Bible,</em> by J. B. Rotherham, Appendix, p. 919; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/96/0" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Isaiah 10:5-7</a>.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="sb">Corroborating this understanding is the fact that the record definitely shows that Pharaoh himself “hardened his heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/97/0" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Ex. 8:15,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/97/1" data-bid="98-2" class="b"> 32</a>, <em>AV</em>; “made his heart unresponsive,” <em>NW</em>) He thus exercised his own will and followed his own stubborn inclination, the results of which inclination Jehovah accurately foresaw and predicted. The repeated opportunities given him by Jehovah obliged Pharaoh to make decisions and in doing so he became hardened in his attitude. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/98/0" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 8:11, 12</a>.)

The prophecies foretold that some intimate acquaintance of Jesus would be his betrayer, but did not specify which of those sharing such acquaintance it would be. Again, Bible principles rule against God’s having foreordained Judas’ actions. The divine standard stated by the apostle is: “Never lay your hands hastily upon any man; neither be a sharer in the sins of others; preserve yourself chaste.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/102/0" data-bid="103-1" class="b">1 Tim. 5:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/102/1" data-bid="103-2" class="b"> compare 3:6</a>.) Evidencing his concern that the selection of his twelve apostles be wisely and properly made, Jesus spent the night in prayer to his Father before making known his decision.

He allowed a ‘poisonous root to spring up’ and defile him, resulting in his deviation and in his accepting, not God’s direction, but the Devil’s leading in a course of thievery and treachery.

What must be the underlying foundation for every reliable friendship, and what examples show this?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> But, now, what made such an outstanding friendship possible? Mutual love for and devotion and loyalty to Jehovah God! Hence it has been said: “No friendship on pagan soil can rival the qualities displayed by Jonathan and David: ‘the best that Greece and Rome have to show of friendships looks pale beside this.’”<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1962122/0">a</a> The unselfishness and loyalty shown by Jonathan arose out of his putting Jehovah God and His will first. Being Saul’s son, Jonathan was in line for the kingship. Yet when Jehovah removed his favor from King Saul and placed it upon David, bypassing Jonathan, the natural heir to the throne, Jonathan did not hate David, viewing him as a rival to be eliminated, as did Saul. But, recognizing that Jehovah’s favor was on David, Jonathan theocratically submitted to the divine arrangement. Only by both David’s and Jonathan’s putting loyalty to Jehovah God first was their marvelous friendship possible. It is true, then: Without that primary love for and loyalty to Jehovah God, the foundation for any human friendship lies on sandy ground.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> David also had experience with false friends. Ahithophel, David’s astute counselor, was among those “companions disposed to break one another to pieces.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Sam. 15:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Ps. 41:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 55:12-14</a>) Those friends of David who turned disloyal lost their love and exclusive devotion to Jehovah, the real King of Israel. On the other hand, because of having these very qualities, Ruth, the Moabitess, displayed loyal friendship for Naomi. “As for Ruth, she stuck with her.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ruth 1:14</a>) Unswerving devotion to Jehovah God must be the underlying foundation for every lasting and reliable friendship.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>SELECTING THE RIGHT FRIENDS FOR OURSELVES</strong></p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 7.

Only lovers of Jehovah can do this. Let us learn a lesson from the mistake made by King Jehoshaphat of Judah. This king, upon whom Jehovah had bestowed his friendship, made the mistake of associating with one who was no friend of God, King Ahab of Israel. This wicked king asked Jehoshaphat to join him in an expedition for the recovery of Ramoth-gilead. Jehoshaphat agreed. Though the prophets of Baal predicted success for the expedition, Micaiah, the only prophet of Jehovah obtainable, <span id="page106" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="106" data-before-text="106"></span>foretold the death of Ahab. Going into battle, Ahab disguised himself; but he had proposed that the king of Judah should put on his royal robes, thus becoming a mark for every missile. In the thick of the battle royally attired Jehoshaphat found every warrior of Syria turned against him, thinking him to be the king of Israel. “Jehoshaphat began to cry for aid, and Jehovah himself helped him, and God at once allured them away from him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Chron. 18:31</a>) True to the words of Jehovah’s prophet, Ahab met his doom, a certain man bending his bow in his innocence and shooting an arrow into the king of Israel, so that he died. When the king of Judah returned to Jerusalem, Jehu the son of Hanani the visionary said to King Jehoshaphat: “Is it to the wicked that help is to be given, and is it for those hating Jehovah that you should have love? And for this there is indignation against you from the person of Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Chron. 19:2</a>.</p>

<strong>Light on Life’s Roadway from the Psalms</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">To begin with, the Psalms eloquently and repeatedly call attention to the fact that Jehovah God created all things: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man?” (8:3, 4) “Before the mountains themselves were born, or you proceeded to bring forth as with labor pains the earth and the productive land, even from time indefinite to time indefinite you are God.” (90:2) “Know that Jehovah is God. It is he that has made us, and not we ourselves.” (100:3) <span id="page550" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="550" data-before-text="550"></span>“I shall laud you because in a fear-inspiring way I am wonderfully made.”—139:14.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Among the earliest instances of God’s dealings with his creatures that the book of Psalms records is that of Jehovah concluding a covenant with Abraham and his making sworn statements to Isaac and Jacob. In fulfillment of these promises Jehovah God “brought out his people with exultation” to the land promised.—105:9, 10, 42-44.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Bringing his people Israel into their Promised Land involved many mighty acts, and these the book of Psalms also features. It tells that Jehovah sent ten plagues upon Egypt, that he split the Red Sea so that they could pass over and that he miraculously sustained them in the wilderness, providing bread, meat and water. Noted also are the striking victories God gained for his people in the days of Barak and Gideon.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalms 78,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 83,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 105,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 106,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/4" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> 135</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Then too, the Psalms record that it was necessary for Jehovah God repeatedly to chastise his people, even to the point of bringing them into Babylonian captivity: “By the rivers of Babylon—there we sat down. We also wept when we remembered Zion.” (137:1-9) And they record also Israel’s return from captivity: “When Jehovah gathered back the captive ones of Zion, we became like those who were dreaming. . . . At that time they proceeded to say among the nations: ‘Jehovah has done a great thing in what he has done with them.’” (126:1, 2) Yes, by recording how Jehovah God dealt with his people in times past and why, the book of Psalms throws much light on life’s roadway, for thereby it acquaints us with God’s attributes and principles.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>THE LIGHT OF PROPHECY</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The book of Psalms also serves as a light on life’s roadway by reason of the prophecies it contains, many of which have already been fulfilled, giving confidence that the rest will also have fulfillment. Among the many prophecies of the Psalms regarding Jesus Christ that the Christian Greek Scriptures show had fulfillment were that he would come in dedication to do God’s will (40:8; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 10:7-9</a>); that zeal for God’s house would eat him up, as it were (69:9; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 2:17</a>); that he would be betrayed by an intimate (41:9; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 13:18</a>); that lots would be cast for his garments (22:18; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 19:24</a>); that not a bone of him would be broken (34:20; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 19:36</a>) and that God would not leave his soul in Sheol or Hades.—16:10; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 2:29-31</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Further, the book of Psalms foretold Jesus’ exaltation to the right hand of his Father, there to await God’s due time for him to go into action against God’s enemies and for God to subject all things under Christ’s feet.—110:1, 2; 8:6; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Heb. 1:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 2:8</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The fulfillment of such prophecies instills faith that the prophecies in the Psalms regarding the blessings of the Messianic reign of the King’s Son, Jesus Christ, will also have fulfillment: “Let him judge the afflicted ones of the people, let him save the sons of the poor one, and let him crush the defrauder. He will descend like the rain upon the mown grass, like copious showers that wet the earth. In his days the righteous one will sprout, and the abundance of peace until the moon is no more. There will come to be plenty of grain on the earth; on the top of the mountains there will be an overflow.”—72:4, 6, 7, 16.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>BIBLE TEACHINGS</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The book of Psalms also throws light on life’s roadway by the various Bible teachings it touches on. Fittingly it stresses the role of Jehovah God as the Universal <span id="page551" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="551" data-before-text="551"></span>Sovereign. Though ‘the rulers of earth mass together as one against Jehovah and his anointed one, Jehovah himself will laugh at them in derision, speak to them in his anger and disturb them in hot displeasure.’ (2:1, 2, 4, 5) He will put them in their place, answering the psalmists’ prayers: “Do arise, O Jehovah! Let not mortal man prove superior in strength. Let the nations be judged before your face. Do put fear into them, O Jehovah, that the nations may know that they are but mortal men.” “Fill their faces with dishonor, that people may search for your name, O Jehovah. That people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.”—9:19, 20; 83:16, 18.</p>

The desire to ‘pay back’ his enemies was not in the spirit of personal vengeance.

<strong>Why Keep Your Integrity?</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> Because integrity is at the core of Jehovah’s judgment of us, it is essential to our hope for the future.

Like true Christians today, David hoped to live forever, continuing to draw ever closer to Jehovah God while serving him. David saw the role that his maintaining integrity would play if he was to see the fulfillment of that hope. Similarly, Jehovah upholds us, teaches us, guides us, and blesses us as we keep our integrity.</p>

Rather, David felt certain that Jehovah would “sustain him”​—that is, give him support and strength while he was lying on his sickbed. David definitely needed such help. In addition to the sickness that weakened him, he was surrounded by enemies who were saying evil things about him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008682/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Verses 5, 6</a>) Jehovah may well have strengthened David by bringing to his mind comforting thoughts.

<strong>Amen</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In the Hebrew Scriptures the word is used as a solemn expression to obligate oneself legally to an oath or covenant and its consequences (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Nu 5:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> De 27:15-26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Ne 5:13</a>), also as a solemn expression to subscribe to an expressed prayer (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Ch 16:36</a>), to an expression of praise (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ne 8:6</a>), or to an expressed purpose (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1Ki 1:36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Jer 11:5</a>). Each of the first four books, or collections, of the Psalms concludes with this expression, perhaps indicating that it was customary for the congregation of Israel to join in at the end of the song or psalm with an “Amen.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps 41:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 72:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 89:52;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/4/3" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 106:48</a>.</p>

Do you think time could really go on forever? Well, there is no question that time stretches forever into the past. So why not forever into the future? Indeed, the <em>New World Translation</em> of the Bible refers to God as being praised “from time indefinite even to time indefinite.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996243/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 41:13</a>) What does this expression mean?

Is there any limit to it? Up until 400 years ago, our earth was thought to be the center of the universe. Then Galileo developed the telescope, providing for a greatly enlarged view of the heavens. Now Galileo could see many more stars and was able to show that the earth and other planets revolve around the sun. The Milky Way no longer looked milky. It proved to be a galaxy of stars, about a hundred billion in number. We could never count that many actual stars, even in a lifetime. Later, astronomers went on to locate billions of galaxies. These stretch out endlessly into space, as far as the most powerful telescopes can probe. It seems that there are no limits to space. The same is true with eternity—it has no limits.</p>

<strong>Ambassador</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Unlike modern-day ambassadors, ancient envoys or messengers, since they did not reside in foreign <span id="page64" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="64" data-before-text="64"></span>capitals, were dispatched only on special occasions for specific purposes. Often they were persons of rank (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:17, 18</a>) and their office was highly respected. Consequently, they were accorded inviolability of person when they visited other rulers.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The treatment accorded a ruler’s messengers or envoys was considered as done toward the ruler and his government. Thus, when Rahab showed favor to the messengers sent as spies to Jericho by Joshua, she really was acting as she did because she recognized that Jehovah was the God and King of Israel. Jehovah, through Joshua showed her favor accordingly. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Josh. 6:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Heb. 11:31</a>) A flagrant violation of the unwritten international custom of respect toward envoys was the action of Hanun the king of Ammon, to whom King David sent some servants in a gesture of friendship. The king of Ammon listened to his princes, who falsely called the messengers spies, and publicly humiliated them, demonstrating his disrespect for David and his government. This disgraceful action led to war.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Sam. 10:2–11:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 12:26-31</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Opposite to the modern-day practice of recalling an ambassador when diplomatic relations are broken with a government, the people of ancient times sent messengers or envoys as spokesmen to one another during times of strain in an effort to reestablish peaceful relations. Isaiah speaks of such “messengers of peace.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isa. 33:7</a>) Hezekiah sent a peace appeal to Sennacherib the king of Assyria. Although Sennacherib was threatening the fortified cities of Judah, the messengers were given freedom of passage by the Assyrians because they were acting as Hezekiah’s envoys. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:13-15</a>) Another example of this can be seen in the record about Jephthah, a judge in Israel. He dispatched messengers with a letter of remonstration against wrong action on the part of the king of the Ammonites and to clear up a dispute over territorial rights. If possible, Jephthah, through his envoys, would have settled the matter without war. These messengers were permitted to pass back and forth between the armies without hindrance.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Judg. 11:12-28</a>; see MESSENGER.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"></p>
