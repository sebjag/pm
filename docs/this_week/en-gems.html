<strong>Do You Appreciate Being With God’s Servants?</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">When confinement on account of persecution prevents a person from being with his fellow believers, this can be very depressing. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979443/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Verse 3 of Psalm 42</a>:3 indicates that the Levite’s exile did affect him emotionally. We read: “To me my tears have become food day and night, while they say to me all day long: ‘Where is your God?’” Because of the unfavorable situation in which he found himself, the psalmist was so sorrowful that he lost his appetite. Thus his tears proved to be as food to him. Day and night, tears would stream down his cheeks and over his mouth. Taunters would say: “Where is your God?” In other words, they asked: ‘Why does not the God in whom you trust help you?’ This ridicule added to the psalmist’s affliction.</p>

For some reason, a certain Levite was in exile. So much did he miss worship at God’s sanctuary that he felt like a thirsty hind, or female deer, that longs for water in a dry and barren region. He “thirsted,” or yearned, for Jehovah and for the privilege of worshiping God at His sanctuary. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995044/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Psalm 42:1, 2</a>) This exile’s experience should move us to show gratitude for the association we enjoy with Jehovah’s people.

<strong>A Pillar on the Sea</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Waterspouts are sometimes called tornadoes over water, but they are usually weaker than tornadoes in their intensity. They generally last about ten minutes, although some have continued for an hour. Because they develop at sea, their detection usually depends on chance observations. This makes it difficult for meteorologists to understand them fully. According to reports, they may make a loud noise, similar to that of a freight train.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When describing his emotional turmoil, a Bible psalmist of ancient times wrote: ‘Watery deep to watery deep is calling at the sound of your waterspouts.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009328/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 42:7</a>) Although we cannot say that this type of waterspout is what the Bible psalmist was referring to, his feelings might well have been depicted by this phenomenon. He said that his soul was “in despair” and was “boisterous” within him. Yet, he drew comfort from his God. “Wait for God,” he declared to his own soul, “for I shall yet laud him as the grand salvation of my person and as my God.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009328/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 42:11</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Just like the psalmist, we may experience afflictions that can be compared with a tornadolike whirlwind over the sea. But if we wait for God, he will prove to be the grand salvation for us.</p>

<strong>Do You Appreciate Being With God’s Servants?</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">If you find yourself discouraged because of unfavorable circumstances, do what the psalmist did. Call to mind that Jehovah will not forsake his servants. He will come to your aid. Still, you may sense keenly the undesirable effects of your trials. This does not mean that you have lost faith. Though the psalmist was confident that Jehovah would come to his rescue, he still experienced grief. Why, the very surroundings in the area of his exile, though beautiful in themselves, reminded him of his sad plight! We read: “Watery deep to watery deep is calling at the sound of your (water)spouts. All your breakers and your waves​—over me they have passed.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979443/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 42:7</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">These words may be descriptive of what happens when the snows of Mount Hermon melt. Tremendous waterfalls are created and these pour into the Jordan, causing it to swell. One wave seems to speak to another wave. This impressive display of power reminded the psalmist of his being overwhelmed by affliction as if being engulfed by a flood.</p>

<strong>Consolation for the Depressed</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Depression is a miserable feeling, but not uncommon. For example, a mature overseer nearing the end of a period of intense study is suddenly gripped by depressing thoughts. A middle-aged woman who works hard to meet her obligations is sad-faced and dejected. A zealous servant in a congregation, although having many living letters of recommendation, feels miserably depressed. A young mother with several <span id="page182" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="182" data-before-text="182"></span>Bible studies to her credit is painfully downcast and complains that God does not seem to be as close as she had hoped he would be. A young full-time minister raised “in the discipline and authoritative advice of Jehovah” is suddenly crushed by depressing doubts. An elderly Christian with long years of full-time ministry behind him fears that somehow he has lost the race for the heavenly crown of life.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>COMMON EXPERIENCE</strong></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">These true experiences are not news to students of the Bible. In 50 (A.D.) the apostle Paul exhorted the Christians in Thessalonica to “speak consolingly to the depressed souls.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:14</a>) After denying Christ the third time, Peter “went outside and wept bitterly,” undoubtedly very depressed by personal failure. On the road to Emmaus, Cleopas and another disciple “stood still with sad faces” and poured out their disappointment at the death of Jesus, who they had hoped was destined to deliver Israel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 22:62;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 24:13-21</a>) Paul, in his second letter to the Christians at Corinth, wrote: “We are pressed in every way, but not cramped beyond movement; we are perplexed, but not absolutely with no way out; we are persecuted, but not left in the lurch; we are thrown down, but not destroyed.” “In fact, when we arrived in Macedonia, our flesh got no relief, but we continued to be afflicted in every manner—there were fights without, <em>fears within.</em> Nevertheless God, who comforts those laid low, comforted us by the presence of Titus.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:8, 9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 7:5, 6</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Faithful servants of Jehovah also suffered depressed feelings long before the Christian Era. Integrity-keeping Job had so many burdens that he spoke as if God were no longer with him: “As in the days when God was guarding me; . . . when intimacy with God was at my tent; when the Almighty was yet with me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 29:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 4, 5</a>) The Israelites worked so hard in Egyptian slavery that even when Jehovah sent a message of hope through Moses the discouraged people did not believe. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex. 6:6-9</a>) Elkanah’s beloved wife Hannah was so disappointed over barrenness and vexed by a rival wife that “she would weep and not eat.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Sam. 1:5-7</a>) The harassed psalmist, feeling sad and abandoned, wrote: “I will say to God my crag: ‘Why have you forgotten me? Why do I walk sad because of the oppression of the enemy?’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 42:9</a>) These depressed feelings that leave one cheerless and unable to smile with ease are obviously a common experience that has befallen God’s servants from ancient times to our day. And the causes are still basically the same.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>THE CAUSES</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Depression is a temporary loss of optimism, courage and hope often termed “low spirits.” As we have seen, it can be induced by personal trials, a sense of personal failure, bitter disappointment, lack of clear understanding of God’s purpose and oppression. Often, however, the cause cannot be easily pinpointed, since a combination of circumstances is involved. A girl away from home may be out of work, alone and homesick. Physical and mental fatigue also team up to cause depression. Sometimes it may simply be poor health or worry. Periodic adjustments in one’s body chemistry may be accompanied by low spirits. Women frequently undergo depression during the menopause. Elderly people may be dejected because of failing physical strength or suspicion that they are unwanted. If one is fatigued by steady hard work or his mind is wearied by intense study and improper rest, he may begin to view life pessimistically, negatively. These are some common causes of the miserable state of depression. Occasionally depression <span id="page183" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="183" data-before-text="183"></span>may lean more toward spiritual sickness, with weakened faith and a corresponding inability to get comfort from the Scriptures. The spiritually sick one imagines that for some reason God has turned His back on him, and God-given promises of hope and sympathy are doubted. Whatever the particular cause, depressed feelings are never pleasant.</p>

<strong>Light Bearers—For What Purpose?</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> If by our own devices we were to try to <span id="page12" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>‘make the lights come back on,’ to brighten the future for mankind, we would seriously be missing the point of God’s inspired Word. Regardless of what the world in general does, however, genuine Christians look to Jehovah as the true Source of light. Their prayer is like that recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993042/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Psalm 43:3</a>, which says: “Send out your light and your truth. May these themselves lead me. May they bring me to your holy mountain and to your grand tabernacle.”</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">14, 15. (a) In what ways is Jehovah now sending out his light and truth? (b) How can we show that God’s light and truth really lead us?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Jehovah continues to answer that prayer of his loyal servants. He sends out light by declaring his purpose, by enabling his servants to understand it, and then by bringing to fulfillment what he has declared. When we pray to God, it is not a mere formality, done simply to give an appearance of holiness. Our earnest desire is that the light that comes from Jehovah will lead us, as the psalm says. We accept the responsibility that goes with receiving the light that God provides. Like the apostle Paul, we discern that the fulfillment of Jehovah’s Word carries with it an implied command to all who exercise faith in it. We feel like debtors to other people until we have given them the good news that God entrusted to us for that purpose.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993042/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Romans 1:14, 15</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> The light and truth that Jehovah has sent forth in our day make manifest that Jesus Christ is actively ruling from his heavenly throne.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993042/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993042/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 14</a>) That work is being done now, and intensely so, around the globe. If we are making that work the most important thing in our life, then God’s light and truth are leading us, as the psalmist said.</p>

As the “harvest” or “conclusion of a system of things” drew near, Jehovah acted to identify the wheatlike ones.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973483/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 9:1, 2</a>) A brief review of their history shows that they too are organized to praise God.</p>

Darkness is their “light,” for they are accustomed to carry out their evil deeds under its cover and this figurative “light” is taken from them by the literal light of dawn.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Job 38:12-15</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Job 24:15-17</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">As the light of the sun is clearly observable, thus Jehovah’s adverse judgments are obvious.

<strong>Jackal</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In Scripture the jackal figures repeatedly in an illustrative setting.

<strong>Jabin</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">2. A later Canaanite king ruling from the restored Hazor; possibly a descendant of No. 1 above. Jabin’s being called “the king of Canaan” might denote supremacy over the other Canaanite kings, granting him exceptional power and authority; it does appear that there were others at least allied with him. On the other hand, the expression might merely distinguish him from kings of other lands. Jabin’s army, including nine hundred chariots with iron <span id="page860" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="860" data-before-text="860"></span>scythes, was under the command of Sisera, who takes greater prominence in the account than Jabin himself.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012222/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Judg. 4:2, 3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012222/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 5:19, 20</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">By Jehovah’s permission, Jabin harshly oppressed apostate Israel twenty years.

<strong>Above All Else, Guard Your Heart!</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In the greater number of cases in the Bible where the term “heart” occurs, it is used in this figurative way, as a symbol of the mind, the disposition, the love and actuating motive of the individual. At the time of the writing of the Hebrew Scriptures the word for heart (<em>lebh</em>) “denoted the seat of all affective and reasoning activity of the mind: the emotions of love <span id="page182" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="182" data-before-text="182"></span>and hate, desire, joy, sorrow, courage, loyalty, fear, pride, were thought to reside in the heart, so also did the faculties of memory, imagination and reasoning”. (Albright’s <em>Archaeology and the Religion of Israel,</em> pages 24, 25) And not without good reason, for do not all such mental and emotional activities directly affect the literal heart? Indeed they do!</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">It is in this sense, as the seat of our affections, the operations of our mind, that the term “heart” is used at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952203/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 4:23</a> (<em>Ro</em>): “Above all that must be guarded keep thou thy heart, for out of it are the issues of life.” Yes, just as the health, strength and life of the human body depend upon the organ of the heart, so the spiritual health, strength and life of the Christian depend upon the condition of his symbolic or figurative heart.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">We are living in the last days of this wicked old system of things, in the critical times hard to deal with, when iniquity is abounding and little faith is found, when the adversary, Satan the Devil, is putting forth an all-out effort to debauch the human race and to destroy all those who are determined to maintain integrity toward Jehovah God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952203/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 24:9-13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952203/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Luke 18:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952203/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 2 Tim. 3:1-5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952203/4/3" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> Rev. 12:12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952203/4/4" data-bid="5-5" class="b"> 17</a>) Now, more than ever before, we must give earnest heed to this admonition to guard our hearts.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Foreseeing this very situation and need, Jesus gave us fitting admonition: “But pay attention to yourselves that your hearts never become weighed down with overeating and heavy drinking and anxieties of life [which, in fact, are bad for the literal heart], and suddenly that day be instantly upon you as a snare. For it will come in upon all those dwelling upon the face of all the earth. Keep awake, then, all the time making supplication that you may succeed in escaping all these things that are destined to occur, and to hold your position before the Son of man.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952203/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 21:34-36</a>, <em>NW</em>) And make no mistake about it, as the days go by faith-testing trials and heart-searching temptations will increase.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Our hearts stand for what we really are on the inside, and which is determined by what we like to think about, or where our love and affections are centered. If we allow our hearts to dwell on the corrupt pleasures of this old world, merely avoiding giving expression to them because of fear of exposure and unfavorable criticism and punishment, we may for a time conceal our real desires or hidden purposes from men; but not from God. His Word says: “Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952203/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 44:21</a>) “I, Jehovah, search the mind [<em>lebh</em>], I try the heart, even to give every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his doings.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952203/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jer. 17:10</a>, <em>AS</em>) There is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, and if our hearts are weak or unclean, sooner or later that fact will be made manifest. We may pass for integrity-keeping Christian ministers for a time, but when the test comes we shall fall.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>HOW TO GUARD THE HEART</strong></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">How can we guard our hearts with all diligence so as to assure for ourselves divine approval and everlasting life in the new world? By carefully watching the things on which we like to dwell, the things upon which we fix our affections, our longings, the things which we like to think out. For instance, a young maiden who has her heart set on marriage will fill her mind with romantic ideas about an ideal “prince charming”; she will visualize just how he looks, how she met him, how he made love to her, and the thrill of the wedding. All this she will think out and with this she will fill her mind, her heart, because that is where her affections lie.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">If we, as Christian ministers, witnesses for Jehovah, have our hearts set upon the <span id="page183" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="183" data-before-text="183"></span>vindication of Jehovah’s name, the blessings of the new world, and the present expansion of the true worship, then we will be filling our minds with the pure, beautiful and life-giving truths of God’s Word and with plans regarding making those truths known to others. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952203/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Phil. 4:8</a>) We will be studying and giving attention to these things, storing them up in our minds and letting them be our meditation and guide. So, rather than turning and looking yearningly at the selfish things of Satan’s system of things, let us obey God by looking straight ahead to the new world, keeping our eyes fixed on God’s kingdom. By not looking to the right or to the left, but by going straight forward with a firm determination, we shall keep our feet from evil and in the way that leads to everlasting life.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952203/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Prov. 4:20-27</a>.</p>

And in the knowledge of your ways we have found no delight.”’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965083/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 21:7-14</a>.</p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">14.

The womb will forget him, the maggot will sweetly suck him, he will be remembered no more.

No; even though their carcasses may have been buried along with human corpses or though images of animals may have been put in the sepulchers of believers in the immortality of animal souls as well as of human souls. However, just as helpless sheep are slaughtered in great numbers, so persons of all stations, high and low, rich and poor, have been slaughtered or killed in great numbers and thus been brought down to the common grave of humans who are dead in the dust of the ground.

This is the way of those who have stupidity, and of those coming after them who take pleasure in their very mouthings. Like sheep they have been appointed to Sheol itself; death itself will shepherd them [as if they were slaughtered sheep, the flock of Death]; and the upright ones will have them in subjection in the morning [of the day of deliverance of the upright ones], and their forms are due to wear away; Sheol rather than a lofty abode is for each one. However, God himself will redeem my soul from the hand of Sheol, for he will receive me.”</p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">17.
