<strong>Ephraim</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">As the dominant tribe of the northern kingdom, Ephraim came to stand for the entire ten-tribe kingdom.

Hosea condemned Ephraim for mingling with the nations, learning their works, and serving their idols.

Although having been sapped of strength by strangers, Ephraim, rather than returning to Jehovah, appealed to Egypt for help and made a covenant with Assyria. Thus Ephraim was like a simpleminded dove that would not escape being trapped in a net.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ho 7:9-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/31/1" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 8:9</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">2Ki 17:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001401/32/1" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> Ho 12:1</a>.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1200020014/166/0">ad 526</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Ephraim</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">First Chronicles 7:20-27</a> provides a genealogical listing of Ephraim’s sons and later descendants, concluding with Joshua, who led the Israelites into <span id="page526" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="526" data-before-text="526"></span>the Promised Land. The historical information found in this passage has been variously interpreted. Many commentators consider Ezer and Elead to be the sons of Ephraim that were slain by the men of Gath, thus placing the event probably sometime between the death of Joseph and the beginning of the Egyptian oppression. This would mean either that Ezer and Elead went into Canaan to take the livestock of the men of Gath or that the latter were the aggressors. It may be that Ezer and Elead were slain in an attempt to prevent the theft of their livestock. Not long after the death of his sons, Ephraim fathered Beriah.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">2. The name Ephraim is also applied to the tribe that descended from him. About a year after the exodus from Egypt, Ephraim’s 40,500 fighting men from twenty years old upward outnumbered Manasseh’s able-bodied men by 8,300. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Num. 1:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 32-35</a>) However, at the end of the forty years’ wandering in the wilderness, the registered males of Ephraim numbered only 32,500, or 20,200 less than those of Manasseh. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Num. 26:34,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 37</a>) Nevertheless, Ephraim was destined to become the greater. Moses, when blessing the Israelites, prophetically spoke of the “tens of thousands of Ephraim,” but of the “thousands of Manasseh.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Deut. 33:17</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In the wilderness, the Ephraimites, with Elishama serving as chieftain, were assigned to camp on the W side of the tabernacle, along with the tribes of Manasseh and Benjamin. This three-tribe division was third in the order of march.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Num. 2:18-24</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>TRIBAL TERRITORY</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The territory assigned to the tribe of Ephraim occupied a central portion of Palestine, W of the Jordan. The tribe also had enclave cities in Manasseh’s territory. On the N, Ephraim was bounded by Manasseh, and on the S, by Benjamin and Dan. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Josh. 16:1-9</a>) This region, although mountainous and hilly, is blessed with rich and fertile soil and, in ancient times, was heavily wooded. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Josh. 17:15,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 17, 18</a>) The chieftain Kemuel served as the divinely appointed representative of Ephraim in dividing the Promised Land into inheritance portions.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Num. 34:18,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 24</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Besides Shechem, a city of refuge, a number of other Levite cities were located in the territory of Ephraim. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Josh. 21:20-22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 6:66-69</a>) From one of these Levite cities, Gezer, the Ephraimites did not drive out the Canaanites, but subjected them to slavish forced labor. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Josh. 16:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Judg. 1:29</a>) At Shiloh, likewise in Ephraim, the tabernacle was set up.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Josh. 18:1</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>EPHRAIM FROM JOSHUA TO DAVID</strong></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The territory of Ephraim was the scene for numerous notable events. At Shechem, Moses’ successor, the Ephraimite Joshua, congregated the tribes of Israel and appealed to them to serve Jehovah faithfully. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Josh. 24:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 14, 15</a>) Also, here at Shechem, Joseph’s bones were finally buried, and both Joshua and Aaron’s son Eleazar were buried in the mountainous region of Ephraim. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Josh. 24:29-33</a>) Later, Benjamite Judge Ehud assembled the Israelites in the mountainous region of Ephraim to fight against the Moabites. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Judg. 3:26-30</a>) After Ehud’s death the prophetess Deborah, from her residence in the mountainous region of Ephraim, sent for Barak as the one designated by Jehovah to deliver Israel from the oppression of King Jabin. In the victory song of Barak and Deborah, Ephraim is the first tribe to be mentioned. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Judg. 4:1-7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 5:14</a>) At a later time, Tola of the tribe of Issachar judged Israel for twenty-three years while dwelling at Shamir in the mountainous region of Ephraim. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Judg. 10:1, 2</a>) The last of the judges, the prophet Samuel of the tribe of Levi, was born at Ramah in the mountainous region of Ephraim, and it was there that he, as an adult, established his home.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Sam. 1:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 19, 20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/21/2" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> 7:15-17</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Pride and an extreme desire for prominence caused severe difficulty to the Ephraimites in their relationship to the other tribes. As early as the time of the judges this trait manifested itself. For example, the Ephraimites tried to pick a quarrel with Gideon for not having called them earlier in the fight against Midian. However, Gideon’s tactfulness on that occasion averted a clash. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Judg. 8:1-3</a>) Later, although having previously turned down an opportunity to assist Jephthah, the Ephraimites felt slighted when he did not call them to fight against the Ammonites. They warred with Jephthah and experienced a humiliating defeat; thousands were killed at the fords of the Jordan, where they were identified as Ephraimites due to their mispronouncing the password “Shibboleth” as “Sibboleth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Judg. 12:1-6</a>; see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 25:10</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">After the period of the judges and the death of King Saul, among those who came to Hebron to turn the kingship over to David there were 20,800 men of Ephraim.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">1 Chron. 12:23,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 30</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>DOMINANT TRIBE OF NORTHERN KINGDOM</strong></p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">From the time the kingdom was divided during the reign of Rehoboam, Ephraim, as the most prominent and influential tribe of the northern kingdom, made a bad name for itself. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011358/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Hos. 13:1</a>) The first king, the Ephraimite Jeroboam, established calf worship at Dan and Bethel.

<strong>Strangest City Built by Man</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">At the left of the gorge, where it opened into the valley, Burckhardt found a Roman <span id="page492" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="492" data-before-text="492"></span>amphitheater cut in the rock. It had thirty-five tiers and seats for about 4,000 persons. Sitting down at the theater, the traveler could see that the valley was about a mile in length and less than half a mile broad.

He had discovered lost Petra!</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">The stream that followed the cleft by which Burckhardt entered bisected the plain from east to west and disappeared into a ravine.

<strong>Gate, Gateway</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The Gate of the Old City was located on the NW side of the city between the Fish Gate and the Gate of Ephraim. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Neh. 3:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/51/1" data-bid="52-2" class="b"> 12:39</a>) In Hebrew, the gate is called simply “Gate of the Old,” the word “city” being supplied by some translators. It is suggested that the name was derived from its having been the main N entrance to the old city. It may have been at the junction of the Broad Wall (that formed a N boundary of the old city) and the S end of the W wall of the second quarter. Some think that this gate is identical with the “First Gate” mentioned by Zechariah. He seemingly refers to the E-W limits of the city in saying “from [1] the gate of Benjamin <span id="page626" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="626" data-before-text="626"></span>all the way to the place of [2] the First Gate, all the way to [3] the Corner Gate,” and to the N-S limits in saying “from the Tower of Hananel all the way to the press vats of the king.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Zech. 14:10</a>) If so, this places the First Gate E of the Corner Gate, possibly naming, from E to W, (1) the gate in or near the E corner, (2) the gate at the angle where the walls of the second quarter and the old city meet, and (3) the gate in the NW corner of the old city wall. Hence this would allow for the above-suggested identity of the First Gate with the Gate of the Old City. Others would connect the Gate of the Old City with the “Middle Gate” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Jeremiah 39:3</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong><em>Gate of Ephraim</em></strong></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">The Gate of Ephraim was located in the Broad Wall 400 cubits (c. 583 feet [c. 178 meters]) E of the Corner Gate.

The Corner Gate does not appear in Nehemiah’s accounts; again the reason may be that it did not need extensive repairs. The account does speak of repairing the Tower of the Bake Ovens, which seems to have been a part of, or near, the Corner Gate.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Neh. 3:11</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="ss"><strong><em>Valley Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">At the SW corner of the city wall, the Valley Gate led to the Valley of Hinnom, and corresponds to the modern Jaffa Gate. Josephus’ “Gate of the Essenes” may have been located here or nearby. Uzziah, in his city-fortification program, built a tower by this gate.

Also, there may have been a potter’s industry near this gate, for there was clay nearby in the Valley of Hinnom as well as a water supply at the mouth of the Tyropean valley and at the spring En-rogel. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/70/0" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Jeremiah 18:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/70/1" data-bid="71-2" class="b"> 19:1, 2</a>.)

Probably it was at the S tip of the E hill of the city (that is, at the southern end of the “City of David”). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/72/0" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Neh. 2:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/72/1" data-bid="73-2" class="b"> 3:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/72/2" data-bid="73-3" class="b"> 12:37</a>) The Fountain Gate would afford convenient exit and access to En-rogel for those living in the City of David, while the Gate of the Ash-heaps, not far to the SW, would also lead out toward En-rogel and would likely be a better exit for the residents of the Tyropean valley and the SW hill of the city.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="ss"><strong><em>Water Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">The name of this gate may have been derived from its proximity, or at least its access, to the Spring of Gihon about midway up the E side of the city. This gate was near Ophel, not far from the Temple area.

They reach this conclusion from the account of Athaliah’s execution, which reports that, on being led out of the Temple by the soldiers, “she came to the entry of the horse gate of the king’s house.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/77/0" data-bid="78-1" class="b">2 Chron. 23:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/77/1" data-bid="78-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 11:16</a>) However, this was likely an entry just to the precincts of the royal palace and not the Horse Gate through which the horses passed in and out of the city itself. Nehemiah definitely includes the Horse Gate in his reconstruction description, indicating that it was a gate in the city wall. It was probably located near the SE corner of the Temple-palace area.

He reigned for over 50 years, from the late ninth to the early eighth century B.C.E. From a young age, Uzziah “kept doing what was right in Jehovah’s eyes.” What influenced him to take an upright course? The historical record states: “[Uzziah] continually tended to search for God in the days of Zechariah, the instructor in the fear of the true God; and, in the days of his searching for Jehovah, the true God made him prosperous.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007923/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 26:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007923/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 4, 5</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Not much is known about Zechariah, the adviser to the king, apart from this account in the Bible. Yet, as “the instructor in the fear of the true God,” Zechariah exercised a fine influence on the young ruler to do what was right. <em>The Expositor’s Bible</em> observes that Zechariah was obviously “a man versed in sacred learning, rich in spiritual experience, and able to communicate his knowledge.” One Bible scholar concluded about Zechariah: “He was well versed in prophecy and . . . was an intelligent, devout, good man; and, it seems, had great influence with Uzziah.”</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Uzziah’s faithful course brought him many blessings, and he “displayed strength to an extraordinary degree” because “the true God continued to help him.” Yes, success in his secular efforts followed his spiritual success “in the days of Zechariah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007923/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 26:6-8</a>) After Uzziah became successful, he left the teachings of Zechariah, his mentor. Uzziah’s “heart became haughty even to the point of causing ruin, so that he acted unfaithfully against Jehovah.” As a result of a particularly irreverent act, he was struck with a loathsome skin disease, which incapacitated him, so that he could no longer serve as king in the fullest sense.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007923/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 26:16-21</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Do you have someone who might be called an instructor, a mentor, who influences you “to search for God”? This can be so whether you are young or past the days of your youth, whether you are male or female. Treasure such a mentor, for his or her admonition can help you to keep doing what is right in Jehovah’s eyes. Listen to this mature Christian, and seriously consider the advice he gives. May you never turn aside from the wise words of such an “instructor in the fear of the true God.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007923/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 1:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007923/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 12:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007923/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 19:20</a>.</p>

Notes commentator C. F. Keil: “Alexander the Great and his successors set many of the Jewish prisoners of war in their lands at liberty (compare the promise of King Demetrius to Jonathan, ‘I will send away in freedom such of the Judaeans as have been made prisoners, and reduced to slavery in our land,’ Josephus, <em>Ant.</em> xiii. 2, 3), and portions of the Philistian and Phoenician lands were for a time under Jewish sway.” (<em>Commentary on the Old Testament,</em> 1973, Vol. X, Joel, p. 224) (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003469/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Ob 19, 20</a>.) Noteworthy, too, is the fact that Alexander the Great took the Philistine city of Gaza. Many of the inhabitants were slain, and the survivors were sold into slavery.

<strong>Gate, Gateway</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The Gate of the Old City was located on the NW side of the city between the Fish Gate and the Gate of Ephraim.

It is suggested that the name was derived from its having been the main N entrance to the old city. It may have been at the junction of the Broad Wall (that formed a N boundary of the old city) and the S end of the W wall of the second quarter. Some think that this gate is identical with the “First Gate” mentioned by Zechariah. He seemingly refers to the E-W limits of the city in saying “from [1] the gate of Benjamin <span id="page626" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="626" data-before-text="626"></span>all the way to the place of [2] the First Gate, all the way to [3] the Corner Gate,” and to the N-S limits in saying “from the Tower of Hananel all the way to the press vats of the king.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Zech. 14:10</a>) If so, this places the First Gate E of the Corner Gate, possibly naming, from E to W, (1) the gate in or near the E corner, (2) the gate at the angle where the walls of the second quarter and the old city meet, and (3) the gate in the NW corner of the old city wall. Hence this would allow for the above-suggested identity of the First Gate with the Gate of the Old City. Others would connect the Gate of the Old City with the “Middle Gate” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Jeremiah 39:3</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong><em>Gate of Ephraim</em></strong></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">The Gate of Ephraim was located in the Broad Wall 400 cubits (c. 583 feet [c. 178 meters]) E of the Corner Gate.

It, too, has been identified by some researchers with the Middle Gate (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Jer. 39:3</a>), by others with the First Gate.

There was a public square near the Gate of Ephraim, in which the people made booths to celebrate the Festival of Booths in Nehemiah’s time. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Neh. 8:16</a>) This gate is not named in Nehemiah’s reconstruction text, evidently because it did not need extensive repairs.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="ss"><strong><em>Corner Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">This gate was evidently located in the NW angle of the city wall, 400 cubits (c. 583 feet [c. 178 meters]) along the Broad Wall W of the Gate of Ephraim. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/58/0" data-bid="59-1" class="b">2 Ki. 14:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/58/1" data-bid="59-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 25:23</a>) It was on the E side of the Valley of Hinnom, apparently in the W wall of the old city at the point where it joined the Broad Wall. Uzziah built a tower by this gate; whether or not it was the Tower of the Bake Ovens is not stated. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:9</a>) Both Jeremiah and Zechariah appear to refer to the Corner Gate as being on the western edge of the city.

The Corner Gate does not appear in Nehemiah’s accounts; again the reason may be that it did not need extensive repairs. The account does speak of repairing the Tower of the Bake Ovens, which seems to have been a part of, or near, the Corner Gate.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Neh. 3:11</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="ss"><strong><em>Valley Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">At the SW corner of the city wall, the Valley Gate led to the Valley of Hinnom, and corresponds to the modern Jaffa Gate. Josephus’ “Gate of the Essenes” may have been located here or nearby. Uzziah, in his city-fortification program, built a tower by this gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/62/0" data-bid="63-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:9</a>) It was from the Valley Gate that Nehemiah went out for his inspection of the damaged wall, riding eastward through the Valley of Hinnom and then up the Kidron valley, finally reentering the city by the same gate.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/66/0" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Neh. 3:13, 14</a>) It was at the SE corner of the city wall, and led to the Valley of Hinnom near the point where it joined the Tyropean valley. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/67/0" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Jer. 19:2</a>) It was from this gate that Topheth in the Valley of Hinnom was reached by those idolatrously burning their children in the fire to Baal. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/68/0" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Jer. 19:5, 6</a>) It was also the gate through which Jeremiah led some of the older men and priests of Israel and proclaimed calamity to Jerusalem, breaking an earthenware flask to illustrate God’s breaking of the people for their serving of other gods.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/69/0" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Jer. 19:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/69/1" data-bid="70-2" class="b"> 10, 11</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">The name “Gate of the Potsherds” may have been given because fragments of pottery were thrown near there as refuse, or because fragments of pottery were ground there, the dust from which was used to make cement for plastering cisterns (as has been done in modern times near a pool at the SW corner of the city). Also, there may have been a potter’s industry near this gate, for there was clay nearby in the Valley of Hinnom as well as a water supply at the mouth of the Tyropean valley and at the spring En-rogel. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/70/0" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Jeremiah 18:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/70/1" data-bid="71-2" class="b"> 19:1, 2</a>.) The “potter’s field” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/71/0" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Matt. 27:7, 8</a>) has, since the fourth century C.E., been traditionally considered to be located on the S side of the Valley of Hinnom.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="ss"><strong><em>Fountain Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">This gate was so called because of its giving access to a spring or fountain nearby, perhaps En-rogel, which was below the junction of the Kidron Valley and the Valley of Hinnom. Probably it was at the S tip of the E hill of the city (that is, at the southern end of the “City of David”). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/72/0" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Neh. 2:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/72/1" data-bid="73-2" class="b"> 3:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/72/2" data-bid="73-3" class="b"> 12:37</a>) The Fountain Gate would afford convenient exit and access to En-rogel for those living in the City of David, while the Gate of the Ash-heaps, not far to the SW, would also lead out toward En-rogel and would likely be a better exit for the residents of the Tyropean valley and the SW hill of the city.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="ss"><strong><em>Water Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">The name of this gate may have been derived from its proximity, or at least its access, to the Spring of Gihon about midway up the E side of the city. This gate was near Ophel, not far from the Temple area. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/73/0" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Neh. 3:26</a>) The Water Gate was where one of the groups of the inauguration procession left the wall, proceeding from there to the Temple, where they assembled with the other group, apparently not traversing that part of the city wall to the E of the Temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/74/0" data-bid="75-1" class="b">Neh. 12:37-40</a>) There was a public square before this gate in which all the people gathered to hear Ezra read the Law, and where they afterward built booths to celebrate the Festival of Booths.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/75/0" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Neh. 8:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/75/1" data-bid="76-2" class="b"> 16</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="ss"><strong><em>Horse Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb">Repair work above the Horse Gate was done by the priests, which implies that its location was near the Temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/76/0" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Neh. 3:28</a>) Some have held that the Horse Gate was one providing communication between two parts of the Temple-palace quarter. They reach this conclusion from the account of Athaliah’s execution, which reports that, on being led out of the Temple by the soldiers, “she came to the entry of the horse gate of the king’s house.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/77/0" data-bid="78-1" class="b">2 Chron. 23:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/77/1" data-bid="78-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 11:16</a>) However, this was likely an entry just to the precincts of the royal palace and not the Horse Gate through which the horses passed in and out of the city itself. Nehemiah definitely includes the Horse Gate in his reconstruction description, indicating that it was a gate in the city wall. It was probably located near the SE corner of the Temple-palace area. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/78/0" data-bid="79-1" class="b">Neh. 3:28</a>) According to Jeremiah, there must have been a <span id="page627" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="627" data-before-text="627"></span>corner of the wall near this gate, probably as the wall turned toward the left as one comes up the Kidron valley, thereby following the valley’s contour (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/79/0" data-bid="80-1" class="b">Jer. 31:40</a>) The Horse Gate is omitted in the inauguration procession account, evidently because the two parts of the procession left off at the Water Gate and the Gate of the Guard, respectively, and did not walk over the section of the wall E of the Temple, where the Horse Gate and the Inspection Gate were located.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/80/0" data-bid="81-1" class="b">Neh. 12:37-40</a>.</p>

<strong>Fortifications</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><span id="page604" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="604" data-before-text="604"></span><strong>INNER WALL</strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The inner wall was heavier and thicker. After the invention of the heavy battering rams, especially as used by the Assyrians, much stronger, thicker walls were built to withstand the devastations of this instrument. A stone wall at Tell en-Nasbeh (Mizpah?) was found to average thirteen feet (4 meters) in thickness, and it is estimated to have been thirty-nine feet (12 meters) high. The top of the wall was crenelated, as were nearly all city walls. Babylon’s walls were of extraordinary height and tremendously massive.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>TOWERS</strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Towers were built into the inner walls (in addition to bastions or towers in the outer walls). They were higher than the wall, protruding from the wall sometimes as much as ten feet (c. 3 meters). They were equipped with crenelations on top and sometimes with openings below the crenelations, for the convenience of archers and stone throwers. The fact that the towers protruded from the wall enabled the defenders to cover the area along the wall between the towers, which were never placed farther than two bowshots apart and were usually much closer, enabling the defenders to command all the area along the wall. Also, a balcony at the tower’s top had openings in the floor so that archery fire and stones and firebrands could be directed straight down at the invaders below. These towers are mentioned many times in the Scriptures. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Neh. 3:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Jer. 31:38;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> Zech. 14:10</a>) The ruins at Tell en-Nasbeh (Mizpah?) indicate that the city had ten towers. Towers served also as posts for watchmen, who could see the enemy approaching from a distance.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isa. 21:8, 9</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Besides these city towers, other towers (Heb., <em>migh·dalʹ;</em> plural, <em>migh·da·lim</em>ʹ) were built in isolated places. These were constructed as “police stations” to protect wells or water sources, highways, frontiers, communication lines or supply lines. King Uzziah of Judah is noted for building towers in Jerusalem, also in the wilderness, these apparently being erected to protect the cisterns that he built to water his livestock. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:9, 10</a>) Several of such migdols have been found in the Negeb.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="ss"><strong>GATES</strong></p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">The weakest part of the defenses of a city were its gates; therefore nothing was overlooked in making the gates the most hotly defended points in the walls. Only as many gates were constructed as necessary for the traffic of the inhabitants in and out of the city during peacetime. Before the use of the chariot, the gateways were narrow, with sharp turns at the entrance so as to make maneuvering through them as difficult as possible for the enemy. Later the chariot demanded a wider roadway. Approaches to the gates were situated so that the attacking soldiers were forced to expose their right-hand or unprotected side toward the fire of the city’s defenders.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Often there was a narrow slope at the side of the rampart up toward the gate. Towers were situated on each side of the gate so that defense efforts could be concentrated there. Besides the main gate, the secondary gates were sometimes small, about large enough for a loaded donkey to pass through, and served as gates through which the defenders could make sorties against the enemy. Gates were made of wood or of wood and metal, sometimes being metal covered to resist fire. In archaeological diggings the gateways are often found to be charred, indicating that fire was used to burn the gates down. The doors of the gates often swung on pivots inserted into holes in the pavement and in the lintels above. When closed, the doors were bolted by a heavy beam of wood or metal that usually fastened into the gateposts. Babylon is spoken of as having copper doors and iron bars.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Isa. 45:2</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="ss"><strong>THE CITADEL</strong></p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Usually at the highest elevation in the city the citadel was built. It had a tower fortress and its own walls, less massive than the walls surrounding the city. Here were situated the king’s or governor’s palace and the homes of the ministers of the government. The citadel was the last stronghold of refuge and resistance. When the soldiers of the enemy breached the city walls they would have to fight through the streets of the city to reach the tower. Such a tower was the one at Thebez, which Abimelech attacked after capturing the city and where a woman broke his skull by pitching an upper millstone upon his head.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Judg. 9:50-54</a>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Many times, as a city expanded in size, the walls of the older city were left standing and new walls were built around the enlarged city. This located the citadel in a city within a city, so that the attackers would first have to penetrate the city’s lower outer wall, next get inside the enlarged city through its high inner wall, then overcome the walls of the old city and, finally, the tower itself.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="ss"><strong>WATER SUPPLY</strong></p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">This was no difficult problem if the city was located on the bank of a river. But, generally, if the city was built on a hill or a mound, the water source was below it in the form of a spring or well. Getting water inside the city could be accomplished by digging a tunnel on a gradient from the water source to a cistern at a lower point inside the city and letting gravity bring the water down. Or an excavation could be made with a stairway down to a tunnel that would run through to the water source outside so that the city’s inhabitants could reach it with their water jars. The spring or well would then be covered over, and the location hidden as thoroughly as possible from the enemy. It was through a water tunnel that Joab entered Jerusalem to capture it for David.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Sam. 5:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 11:6</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="ss"><strong>FORTIFICATIONS OF THE BESIEGING ARMY</strong></p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">At times the besieging army built fortifications of its own around its camp. This protected the camp from sorties on the part of those besieged or from attacks by outside allies of the city. These fortified camps might be round or oval-shaped and surrounded by a wall, often crenelated and with crenelated towers. For these fortifications, they would cut down the trees, sometimes for miles around the city. Jehovah’s law directed the Israelites not to cut down fruit trees for this purpose.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Deut. 20:19, 20</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="ss"><strong>FORTIFICATIONS WITH POINTED STAKES</strong></p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">In foretelling the destruction of Jerusalem, Jesus Christ indicated that her enemies would build around her a fortification with pointed stakes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Luke 19:43</a>) The historian Josephus confirms the accurate fulfillment of this prophecy. Titus argued in favor of building a fortification to keep the Jews from leaving the city so as to bring about their surrender or, if this did not materialize, to make it easier to take the city due to the resultant famine. His arguments having won out, the army was organized to undertake the project. The legions and lesser divisions of the army competed with one another to finish the task; individually the men were spurred on by a desire to please their superiors. To provide materials for the construction of this fortification the countryside about Jerusalem within a distance of about ten miles (16 kilometers) was denuded of its trees. Amazingly, according to Josephus, the over four-and-a-half-mile-long (7-kilometer-long) fortification was completed in just three days, an undertaking which ordinarily would have required a number of months. Outside the wall of this fortification thirteen places for garrisons were constructed, and their combined circumference amounted to one and one-seventh miles (c. 2 kilometers).</p>

<strong>Jerusalem</strong><br/><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">King Uzziah (829-778 B.C.E.) made notable additions to the city’s defenses, fortifying the (NW) Corner Gate and the Valley Gate (at the SW corner) with towers, as well as a tower at “the Buttress” (“the Angle,” <em>RS, JB;</em> “the Turning,” <em>JP</em>), apparently some part of the eastern wall not far from the royal buildings, either those of David or of Solomon.

<strong>Fortifications</strong><br/><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="ss"><span id="page605" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="605" data-before-text="605"></span><strong>ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCOVERIES OF NOTABLE FORTIFICATIONS</strong></p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">Following up the building operations of his father David, King Solomon was outstanding for his construction works. Besides building the magnificent temple of Jehovah at Jerusalem, he strengthened Jerusalem’s walls and built extensive fortifications at Hazor, Megiddo and Gezer. Archaeologists were guided in their excavation of these fortifications by the Bible’s statement at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Kings 9:15</a>: “Now this is the account of those conscripted for forced labor that King Solomon levied to build the house of Jehovah and his own house and the Mound and the wall of Jerusalem and Hazor and Megiddo and Gezer.” They found that the gates of these three last-named cities were all built to a single unique plan, each being fifty-six feet (17 meters) wide, with an entrance flanked on both sides by square towers and leading into a vestibule sixty-six feet (20 meters) long, with three chambers on each side. They were somewhat similar to the description of the gates of Ezekiel’s visionary temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ezek. 40:5-16</a>) Solomon’s son Rehoboam is also credited with much building. This included, besides reinforcing the fortified places, the storage of food supplies in them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">2 Chron. 11:5-10</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">Immediately above casemate walls built by Solomon at Megiddo and Hazor massive walls had been constructed, possibly built by Ahab. These were more thickly and strongly built, doubtless because of the heavy Assyrian battering rams in use during that later period. Other kings of Israel and Judah noted for their construction works are Jeroboam, who rebuilt Shechem and Penuel; Baasha, who began to build Ramah “to allow no one to go out or come in to Asa the king of Judah” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Ki. 15:17</a>); Asa, who used stones and timbers from Ramah in building operations in Geba and Mizpah; Omri the builder of Samaria, the capital of the northern kingdom; Uzziah (Azariah) the rebuilder of Elath (Eloth) and builder of towers in the wilderness; and Jotham, who built fortified places and towers.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Ki. 12:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 15:22, 23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/23/2" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> 16:23, 24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/23/3" data-bid="24-4" class="b"> 2 Ki. 14:21, 22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/23/4" data-bid="24-5" class="b"> 2 Chron. 26:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/23/5" data-bid="24-6" class="b"> 9, 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/23/6" data-bid="24-7" class="b"> 27:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/23/7" data-bid="24-8" class="b"> 4</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">Of Uzziah it is said: “He made in Jerusalem engines of war, the invention of engineers, that they might come to be upon the towers and upon the corners, to shoot arrows and great stones.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:15</a>) Just what these engines of war were is not understood. Archaeologists have discovered sculptured reliefs of Sennacherib’s assault on the city of Lachish depicting a defensive innovation that some would attribute to Uzziah. These reliefs show that upon the towers and on the corners of the walls of Lachish wooden structures holding round shields were built above the crenelated parapets. This was a great advantage for the defenders of a city in that they now could stand to full height, with both hands free to shoot arrows and to sling and throw stones at the besiegers, their bodies being much better protected than previously, when they had to expose themselves to shoot, and then dodge behind the merlons of the crenelated walls.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="ss"><strong>ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCOVERIES OF AQUEDUCTS</strong></p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb">The builders of the Megiddo fortifications used simple, yet ingenious way to get water into the city. The source of water for the city was a well in a natural cave at the western foot of the mound on which Megiddo was built. To get water into the city they sent a vertical shaft ninety-eight feet (30 meters) deep, seventy-two feet (22 meters) of this distance through solid rock, which brought them to the level of the well. From this level they cut a horizontal tunnel with a slight gradient for a distance of 220 feet (67 meters) to the well. The slight slope from the well to the bottom of the shaft allowed the water to flow into the city by gravity. The well was sealed from the outside by a thick wall.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">An amazing construction requiring superb engineering skill was accomplished by Hezekiah when he sealed up the course of the water flowing from Gihon and cut a channel or conduit about 1,750 feet (1,200 cubits or 533 meters) to bring water into Jerusalem, thereby enabling it to withstand a long siege.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:30</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb">Often cisterns, both public and individual, were built inside the city so as to have a water supply during times of siege. On the monument (now located in the Louvre of Paris) erected at Dibon, in Moab, by Mesha the king of Moab, we find the inscription “I also built its gates and I built its towers and I built the king’s house, and I made both of its reservoirs for water inside the town. And there was no cistern inside the town even at the acropolis, so I said to all the people, ‘Let each of you make a cistern for himself in his house.’”</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="ss"><strong>SYMBOLIC USES</strong></p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="sb">Since the tower or citadel of the fortified city was its last stronghold and the towers in the wilderness were the safest places of refuge for miles around, we can see the appropriateness of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Proverbs 18:10</a>: “The name of Jehovah is a strong tower. Into it the righteous runs and is given protection.” Also significant are the expressions of David: “Jehovah is my crag and my stronghold and the Provider of escape for me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">2 Sam. 22:2</a>) “Become to me a rock fortress into which to enter constantly. You must command to save me, for you are my crag and my stronghold.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ps. 71:3</a>) This would be especially meaningful to Jews who would look up at the great stronghold of Jerusalem situated on an elevation higher than nearly any other major capital city in human history, with its mighty walls of defense. It also gives meaning to God’s words through the prophet Zechariah, when Jehovah speaks of himself as “a wall of fire all around” Jerusalem. It gives his people encouraging assurance that, while walls of stone can be broken down, Jehovah himself is really the defense of his servants.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ps. 48:11-13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Zech. 2:4, 5</a>; see GATE, GATEWAY.</p>

<strong>Haughtiness</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Even a person whose heart has been humble in service of God can become haughty because of gaining wealth or power or by reason of his beauty, success, wisdom, or the acclaim of others. King Uzziah of Judah was such a person. He ruled well and enjoyed Jehovah’s blessing for many years. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001919/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2Ch 26:3-5</a>) But the Bible record states: “However, as soon as he was strong, his heart became haughty even to the point of causing ruin, so that he acted unfaithfully against Jehovah his God and came into the temple of Jehovah to burn incense upon the altar of incense.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001919/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2Ch 26:16</a>) Uzziah lifted himself up to perform priestly duties, which privilege God had expressly withheld from the kings of Israel, making kingship and priesthood separate.</p>

<strong>Plaguing the Modern “Egyptians” with Truth</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> How is this plague having its fulfillment in modern times? <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965482/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Revelation 16:2</a> gives us a clue, for it tells that as a result of the pouring out of the bowl of God’s anger hurtful and malignant ulcers came upon those who had the mark of the wild <span id="page396" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="396" data-before-text="396"></span>beast and who worshiped its image. The book entitled “‘Babylon the Great Has Fallen!’ God’s Kingdom Rules!” shows that this plague began in 1919, when the failure of the League of Nations was foretold. It was in the year 1919 that <em>The Watchtower</em> for the first time identified the symbolic sea beast of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965482/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Revelation chapter 13</a> as Satan’s visible political organization rather than an ecclesiastical system, and the idolized “image” of the beast as the League of Nations. This plague, even as the other plagues, might be said to have two aspects in modern times. One aspect is the use of the Bible to show the way the modern “Egyptians,” the worshipers of the “image” of the beast, appear in the eyes of Jehovah, and the other is the pain that this exposé gave them. Since Egypt stands for Satan’s entire visible organization, this plague affects the religious leaders and guides of both Christendom and pagandom.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> An early high point in this plague came in 1922 when, on September 8 at the Cedar Point, Ohio, convention of Jehovah’s witnesses, Joseph F. Rutherford, as president of the Watch Tower Society, called attention to King Uzziah’s becoming a leper because of his presumptuousness in mixing religion with politics in Jerusalem, in that he as king presumed to offer incense at the temple, which privilege was only for the priests of the tribe of Levi; and in this presumptuousness and its punishment King Uzziah was a prototype of Christendom. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965482/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965482/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 16-23</a>) Then referring to Christendom’s endorsement of the League of Nations as a man-made substitute for God’s kingdom, Judge Rutherford said: “Thus they denied the coming of the Lord and his Kingdom,” and at once they appeared to Jehovah God to be leprous or filled with boils and blisters, and hence unclean. And just as the sixth plague upon Egypt was an expression of Jehovah’s anger and brought pain, so did the proclamations made by his dedicated people regarding these things. Such expression of his anger at the men that had the “mark” of the beast and that worshiped its image, the League of Nations, pained the antitypical Egyptians of our twentieth century.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Since then the Watch Tower Society as publishers for the Christian witnesses of Jehovah has published and caused to be distributed much literature showing that the League of Nations and its successor, the United Nations, are futile man-made substitutes for the kingdom of God. A particularly striking recent example was the special issue of <em>Awake!</em> October 8, 1962, entitled “The United Nations or the Kingdom of God?” The Watch Tower Society printed for distribution 5,269,268 copies of the October 8, 1962, issue of <em>Awake!</em> All this publication and distribution of God’s judgment message has shown how wretched, unclean, miserable and spiritually diseased the supporters of these schemes of men must appear in the eyes of God. Such publication has been very painful to the supporters of these political instruments for world peace and security both inside and outside Christendom, and is part of the sixth plague.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>THE SEVENTH PLAGUE—HAIL, FIRE AND THUNDERS</strong></p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">17, 18.

Why was Jehovah, the omnipotent One, dealing with this stubborn, proud, yet puny man in this manner? Jehovah himself, at this point, told him: “By now I could have thrust my hand out that I might strike you and your people with pestilence and that you might be effaced from the earth. But, in fact, for this cause I have kept you in existence, for the sake of showing you my power and in order to have my name declared in all the earth.” Yes, by proceeding in this manner Jehovah was making a name for himself as well as showing Pharaoh how great and varied His divine power is. Having told Pharaoh his reason for proceeding with him the way He did, Jehovah next warned him of the seventh plague: “Are you still behaving haughtily against my people in not sending them away? Here I am causing it to rain down tomorrow about this time a very heavy hail, the like of which has never occurred in Egypt from the day it was founded until now.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965482/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ex. 9:15-19</a>.</p>

<strong>A Nation Holds a Land in Trust for God</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Before bringing the Israelites into a covenant of law with him, Jehovah said by means of Moses as mediator of the covenant: “And now if you will strictly obey my voice and will indeed keep my covenant, then you will certainly become my special property out of all other peoples, because the whole earth belongs to me. And you yourselves will become to me a <span id="page460" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="460" data-before-text="460"></span>kingdom of priests and a holy nation. . . . ”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964562/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ex. 19:5, 6</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>HELP PROVIDED BY GOD</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">If they kept this covenant, then they would become like Melchizedek, who was both a king and a priest of Jehovah at Salem. But for the time being, Jehovah was the real and only King over their nation. To help them keep covenant, Jehovah gave Moses a pattern for a house of worship. It was set up on Nisan 1, 1512 B.C.E., at the base of Mount Horeb or Sinai. Its chief article of furniture was the gold-covered “ark of the testimony,” containing the stone tablets inscribed with the Ten Commandments. It was placed in the Most Holy compartment of this house, the Tabernacle. Jehovah expressed his approval by causing the cloud of his glory to reside over the tent and fill the Tabernacle.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964562/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ex. 40:1-35</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Then Moses, at God’s command, anointed his brother Aaron as high priest and, by a ceremony that lasted seven days, installed the priesthood into office. Aaron thereby became the Anointed One or Messiah, or, as the Greek Septuagint Bible calls him, <em>Christ</em>ó<em>s,</em> the Anointed of Jehovah, but only in a priestly sense. Aaron’s sons were underpriests and all other qualified male Levites were servants of the priesthood. God manifested his acceptance of this newly installed priesthood on the eighth day, the first day of their service as priests. He caused his glory to appear to all the people and fire came out and began consuming the burnt offering on the altar.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964562/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Lev. 8:1-30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964562/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 9:1-24</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">This priesthood was not like that of Melchizedek, who was both king and priest. God was the invisible King, and so kept priesthood and kingship separate in Israel. But he foretold through Moses that the time would come when the Israelites would lose faith and would ask to have a visible human king.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964562/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Deut. 17:14-18</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Separation of priesthood and kingship continued after they got a human king and was a very serious matter. Centuries later, King Uzziah of Jerusalem ambitiously tried to add priestly duties to his kingdom powers and was smitten with leprosy, which barred him from the temple and obligated his son Jotham to take the throne as king.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964562/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:16-23</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="ss"><strong>TYPES OF GREATER THINGS</strong></p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">The offering up of incense, including that offered on the golden incense altar in the Tabernacle every morning and evening, was a duty assigned exclusively to the Aaronic priesthood. Also, they offered a male sheep as a burnt offering, the “constant burnt offering,” on the altar in the courtyard constantly, day after day.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964562/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ex. 30:7, 8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964562/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Luke 1:8-11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964562/15/2" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> Ex. 29:38-42</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">On Nisan 14 the passover was celebrated.

So it was not by accident, on Nisan 16, 33 C.E., that Jesus Christ rose from the dead.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964562/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:20</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Then seven sabbaths or weeks were counted, starting the day of Nisan 16, and on the fiftieth day wheat firstfruits were offered.

<strong>“Be Humble in Walking with Your God”</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">It is not easy for man, conceived in sin and brought forth with error, to be humble. Selfishness causes each one to want to exalt himself as Satan did. Because of this the Word of God not only contains many commands for us to be humble but also warns us against being proud. In fact, time and again the two go together, admonition to be humble and warning against pride: “God opposes the haughty ones, but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble <span id="page158" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="158" data-before-text="158"></span>ones.” “Before a crash the heart of a man is lofty, and before glory there is humility.” “The very haughtiness of earthling man will humble him, but he that is humble in spirit will take hold of glory.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961169/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jas. 4:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961169/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Prov. 18:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961169/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 29:23</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">While all in the New World society must guard against not being humble, especially must those who exercise authority over others, such as parents, those in a congregation who are teaching others in the training program, the congregation’s ministerial assistants and, above all, the overseers, be they congregation, circuit, district, branch or zone servants.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">All such have the obligation to be exemplary in being humble in their walking with God, even as they should be patterns in knowledge and zeal. Thus the apostle Peter counsels the older men: “Neither as lording it over those who are God’s inheritance, but becoming examples to the flock.” Teaching others, they must exercise care lest Paul’s rebuke applies to them: “Do you, however, the one teaching someone else, not teach yourself?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961169/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961169/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Rom. 2:21</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Another reason why overseers must be on guard is that they have so many brothers to deal with. Each contact furnishes an opportunity to be helpful or otherwise, this depending upon whether they are humble or not. Then, too, because of their position all they say and do is taken far more seriously than it would otherwise be.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Then, again, by reason of an overseer’s duties it is quite easy for him to seem too busy, or actually to be too energetic and efficient to be truly helpful toward those for whom he is responsible. This will cause him to lack fellow feeling, empathy. Thus he may fail to come down to the level of others and so be unable to say, as did the apostle Paul: “To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961169/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Cor. 9:22</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Overseers must also bear in mind the warning: “Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.” Natural talent, acquired learning or appointment to office can easily cause one to lose out on humility. “He’s good, but he knows it,” should not be said of any overseer in the New World society. Unless he keeps humble and holding a right perspective he can very easily become “puffed up with pride and fall into the judgment passed upon the Devil.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961169/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Cor. 8:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961169/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 3:6</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="ss"><strong>WHEN ESPECIALLY TO BE ON GUARD</strong></p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">It appears that there are certain times when we must especially be on guard that we keep on being humble as we walk with our God. One of these times is when we are receiving a rebuke or correction. As the Congregator wisely counsels: “If the spirit of a ruler should mount up against you, do not leave your own place, for calmness itself allays great sins.” Thus when King David was confronted by the prophet Nathan and told of his sin, he did not rise up in rage against God’s spokesman, but humbly took the rebuke. His calmness, his humility, his repentance caused his great sin to be allayed in that it did not cost him his throne nor the Kingdom covenant.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961169/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Eccl. 10:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961169/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 2 Sam. 12:1-14</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">On the other hand, there was King Uzziah, the military genius. When presumptuously proceeding to offer incense, he refused to let the priests rebuke him, but in a proud rage pushed them aside and as a result was humbled by being smitten with leprosy, dying by a plague from Jehovah. When given counsel or reproof by God’s spokesmen, that is the time for us to be humble, heeding the counsel: “The discipline of Jehovah, O my son, do not reject, and do not be disgusted with his reproof, because the one whom Jehovah loves he reproves.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961169/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:16-21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961169/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Prov. 3:11, 12</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Another particularly sensitive occasion <span id="page159" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="159" data-before-text="159"></span>when we must be on guard to keep humble is when we are given a position of responsibility. We do not want to be like rejected King Saul, who started out humbly but then took himself too seriously, acting disobediently and presumptuously and so losing out on everything. As Samuel had to tell him: “Was it not on the condition that you were little in your own eyes that you were head of the tribes of Israel and Jehovah proceeded to anoint you as king over Israel? . . . Does Jehovah have as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of Jehovah? Look! . . . rebelliousness is the same as the sin of divination, and pushing ahead presumptuously the same as using uncanny power and teraphim.” Only by continuing to remain little in our own eyes can we hope to continue to enjoy the added privileges that have come our way.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961169/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Sam. 15:17,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961169/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 22, 23</a>.</p>

<strong>Running the Race Without Stumbling</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> From the case of Satan the Devil and the warning about a newly converted man’s serving as an overseer, it becomes apparent that the possession of authority and responsibility makes one susceptible to pride. There was proud and powerful Haman, whose pride led to his own downfall. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958691/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Esther 3:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958691/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 7:9</a>) There was proud Nebuchadnezzar, who lost his sanity after glowing with pride, saying: “Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for the royal dwelling-place, by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958691/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Dan. 4:30</a>, <em>AS</em>) There was proud King Belshazzar, to whom Daniel said: “And you his son, O Belshazzar, have not humbled yourself.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958691/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Dan. 5:22</a>, <em>AT</em>) He lost a kingdom and his life. There was the pride of Herod, who arrogated glory to himself instead of <span id="page569" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="569" data-before-text="569"></span>giving it to God and so was “eaten up with worms.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958691/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 12:21-23</a>) Indeed, history is a long record of crashes of powerful men and nations, testifying to the fact that “pride is before a crash.”</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>PRESUMPTUOUSNESS PRECEDES DISHONOR</strong></p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 9.

Look what happened to King Uzziah of Judah. He was a faithful worshiper of Jehovah, but he stumbled when pride entered his life. In his later years he became strong and prosperous: “As soon as he was strong, his heart became haughty even to the point of causing ruin, so that he acted unfaithfully against Jehovah his God and came into the temple of Jehovah to burn incense upon the altar of incense.” Puffed-up King Uzziah had no business doing this. So the priests reproved him: “Go out from the sanctuary, for you have acted unfaithfully and it is not for any glory to you on the part of Jehovah God.” Did King Uzziah benefit from this reproof? No, for “Uzziah became enraged while in his hand there was a censer for burning incense, and, during his rage against the priests, leprosy itself flashed up in his forehead before the priests in the house of Jehovah.” Stricken with leprosy in his forehead! A leper until the day of his death, Uzziah lost his royal duties and his son ruled in his place. What a sad crash! And it befell one who had served Jehovah faithfully for so many years. But the rule is certain: “Has presumptuousness come? Then dishonor will come.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958691/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Prov. 28:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958691/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 26:16-21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958691/12/2" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> Prov. 11:2</a>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">10.

Do not be among the people that are never convinced about a thing unless they have experienced it. There is no reason to experience the crash that follows pride. How does one benefit, then? By guarding against presumptuous actions, saying or doing things out of self-importance that one has no business to. Keep your place in the theocratic organization, never letting pride cause you to run in the wrong course, one leading to a crash.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>PRIDE HINDERS BENEFITS OF REPROOF</strong></p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">11, 12.

He did not benefit from reproof and correction. He could have taken the priests’ reproof and left the sanctuary immediately. Such a course undoubtedly would have averted the humiliating crash he suffered. But he let pride be a hindrance to taking reproof. “Have you seen a man wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for the stupid one than for him.” Puffed-up Uzziah belittled reproof, even became enraged by it. Pride blinded him to the benefits of reproof.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958691/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Prov. 26:12</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Since correction and discipline come to all of Jehovah’s servants, we need to remember Paul’s words to the Hebrews: “You have entirely forgotten the exhortation which addresses you as sons: ‘My son, do not belittle the discipline from Jehovah, neither give out when you are corrected by him; for whom Jehovah loves he disciplines, in fact he scourges everyone whom he receives as a son.’” If a Christian belittles the discipline that comes from Jehovah through his organization, refusing to take reproof in harmony with God’s Word, then such a person is like Uzziah; he is letting pride deny him the benefits of reproof. “True,” the apostle explains, “no discipline seems for the present to be joyous, but grievous; yet afterward to those who have been trained by it it yields peaceable <span id="page570" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="570" data-before-text="570"></span>fruit, namely, righteousness.” So when correction comes from Jehovah’s organization, benefit by it. Do not let the colossus of pride stand in the way. Discipline, though at first grievous, yields peaceable fruit, righteousness and life. “Take hold on discipline; do not let go. Safeguard it, for it itself is your life.” “The reproofs of discipline are the way of life.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958691/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Heb. 12:5, 6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958691/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958691/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> Prov. 4:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958691/14/3" data-bid="15-4" class="b"> 6:23</a>.</p>

One aspect is the use of the Bible to show the way the modern “Egyptians,” the worshipers of the “image” of the beast, appear in the eyes of Jehovah, and the other is the pain that this exposé gave them.

Rutherford, as president of the Watch Tower Society, called attention to King Uzziah’s becoming a leper because of his presumptuousness in mixing religion with politics in Jerusalem, in that he as king presumed to offer incense at the temple, which privilege was only for the priests of the tribe of Levi; and in this presumptuousness and its punishment King Uzziah was a prototype of Christendom.

And just as the sixth plague upon Egypt was an expression of Jehovah’s anger and brought pain, so did the proclamations made by his dedicated people regarding these things. Such expression of his anger at the men that had the “mark” of the beast and that worshiped its image, the League of Nations, pained the antitypical Egyptians of our twentieth century.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Since then the Watch Tower Society as publishers for the Christian witnesses of Jehovah has published and caused to be distributed much literature showing that the League of Nations and its successor, the United Nations, are futile man-made substitutes for the kingdom of God.

<strong>Burial, Burial Places</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Archaeological investigations give an idea of the type of burial places used in ancient times. Aside from simple earthen graves, in Palestine these were often vaults or chambers cut in the rock, often on hillsides. Elevated places seem to have been preferred. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Josh. 24:33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/33/1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 23:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/33/2" data-bid="34-3" class="b"> 2 Chron. 32:33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/33/3" data-bid="34-4" class="b"> Isa. 22:16</a>) The chamber might be for a single burial, the body being laid in an excavated place in the floor. Or it might be arranged for multiple burials, with long slots, large enough to accommodate one body each, cut into the sides of the chamber at right angles to the walls. The narrow opening through which the body was inserted was then covered with a stone cut to fit. In other cases a benchlike niche or shelf was cut into the rear and side walls (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Mark 16:5</a>) or there might be a double row of such shelves, thus increasing the capacity of the burial place. The tomb might even consist of more than one chamber, although the single chamber seems to have been the common type among the Jews. Where the body lay exposed on a shelf, it was, of course, necessary to seal off the entrance against the depredations of wild animals. Thus, the main entrance to the chamber was closed off with a large stone, at times hinged as a door, and occasionally with a circular one set in a track and rolled in front of the <span id="page269" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="269" data-before-text="269"></span>entrance. Such circular stones, not frequently found, might weigh as much as a ton or more.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Matt. 27:60;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/35/1" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> Mark 16:3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Simplicity marks the earlier Jewish burial places. They thus contrasted greatly with the pagan tombs, which often had paintings on the walls and other ornamentation. <em>The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge</em> (Vol. II, p. 308) comments: “Wherever in Jewish tombs rich ornamentation is found, foreign influence (generally Greek) is recognized . . . the stern opposition . . . to ancestor-worship discouraged adornment of burial-places, which thus differed widely from Egyptian and Phenician tombs. This and the lack of inscriptions make it difficult to determine the date of Jewish graves.” Although Jacob erected a pillar over Rachel’s grave, perhaps a single stone (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Gen. 35:20</a>), this seems to have simply been a marker, not a monument. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">1 Sam. 10:2</a>) A “gravestone” is also mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">2 Kings 23:17</a> as marking a burial spot. Jesus referred to tombs “not in evidence, so that men walk upon them and do not know it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Luke 11:44</a>) Due to the ceremonial defilement associated with the dead, burial places of the Jewish people were frequently whitewashed, thereby advising the passersby of their presence. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Matt. 23:27</a>) This whitewashing is said to have been done annually following the latter rains, prior to the Passover.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Following the death of an individual, the body was generally washed (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Acts 9:37</a>) and anointed with aromatic oils and ointments, which, if considered a type of embalming, was not the kind done by the ancient Egyptians. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Mark 14:3-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/42/1" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> John 12:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/42/2" data-bid="43-3" class="b"> 7</a>) The body was then wrapped in cloth, generally linen.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">2 Chron. 16:14</a>) The great “funeral burning” mentioned in this latter case was evidently a burning of such spices, giving off an aromatic incense. The head might be covered by a separate cloth.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">John 20:7</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The women who went to Jesus’ tomb on the third day to grease his body with spices may have done so due to the hurried circumstances under which Jesus was buried and hence with the purpose of doing a more complete work as a means of preserving the body for a longer period or simply because of the fragrance thus produced.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Mark 16:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/47/1" data-bid="48-2" class="b"> Luke 23:55, 56</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The body was likely carried to the burial site on a bier or funeral litter, perhaps made of wickerwork, and a considerable procession might accompany it, perhaps including musicians playing mournful music.

These were customarily outside the city walls. But Judean kings were buried in the “city of David” and those of Israel were buried in the capital city of the northern kingdom. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">1 Sam. 25:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/50/1" data-bid="51-2" class="b"> 1 Ki. 22:37;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/50/2" data-bid="51-3" class="b"> 2 Chron. 9:31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/50/3" data-bid="51-4" class="b"> 24:15, 16</a>; see BURIAL PLACES OF THE KINGS, OR, OF DAVID.) J. G. Duncan in the book <em>Digging Up Biblical History</em> (1931, Vol. II, p. 186) writes: “As a rule the Hebrews, though they sometimes buried within the city walls, excavated their rock-tombs on a hill-slope near to their city. The presence of rock-tombs on one hill-slope is often a sure indication that the hill opposite or near had had a settlement on it, and, on the other hand, the absence of any indication of burials near a site is a sure proof that the site had not been occupied.” The cliffs surrounding Jerusalem abound with burial places. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Isaiah 22:16</a>.) The reference to the ”graveyard of the sons of the people” (“burial place of the common people,” <em>RS</em>) in the valley of Kidron is believed to refer to a graveyard for the poorer class.

The Great Pyramid covers an area of some thirteen acres (5.3 hectares) and is composed of 2,300,000 blocks of stone, each block weighing about two and a half tons (2.3 metric tons) on the average. The Egyptian belief in immortality of the soul was the prime reason for mummification, and they also made elaborate provisions of food, furniture and equipment for use by the deceased royalty in the “afterlife.”</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Also notable as burial places were the catacombs of Rome, used for both Jewish and Christian burials. The catacombs consisted of a network of subterranean passages with burial niches excavated in the walls of the passages. While the greater part of Rome remains unexcavated, it is believed that there are over five hundred miles (805 kilometers) of such passages or galleries, containing as many as two million graves. During times of intense persecution these Roman catacombs served as meeting places for the Christians.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">In the Hebrew Scriptures the words <em>qeʹver</em> and <em>q<sup>e</sup>vu·rah</em>ʹ are used to refer to burial places and are distinct in meaning from the Hebrew <em>sh<sup>e</sup>ʼohl</em>ʹ<em>,</em> which refers, not to an individual grave or graves but to the common grave of all mankind, gravedom. Likewise, in the Christian Greek Scriptures the Greek word <em>taʹphos,</em> the common word for burial place or grave, and the words <em>mneʹma</em> and <em>mne·meiʹon,</em> meaning “tomb” and “memorial tomb,” are distinct from the word <em>haiʹdes,</em> the Greek equivalent of <em>sh<sup>e</sup>ʼohl</em>ʹ.—See HADES; MEMORIAL TOMB; SHEOL.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"></p>

As this would place the beginning of Uzziah’s rule approximately twelve years after the death of his father, this must refer to his ‘becoming king’ in a special sense. It may be that in the twenty-seventh year of King Jeroboam the two-tribe Judean kingdom was freed from subjection to the northern kingdom, a subjection that perhaps began when Israelite King Jehoash defeated Uzziah’s father Amaziah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014429/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Chron. 25:22-24</a>) So it may be that Uzziah became king a second time in the sense of being free from the domination of Israelite King Jeroboam (II).</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Uzziah did what “was upright in Jehovah’s eyes.” This was largely due to his heeding the good instruction of a certain Zechariah (not the prophet by that name who lived in a later period). But his subjects continued improper sacrificing at high places.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014429/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Ki. 15:3, 4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014429/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 26:4, 5</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Uzziah became famous for his military successes, attained with Jehovah’s help. He restored Elath (Eloth) to the kingdom of Judah and rebuilt that city located at the head of the Gulf of Aqabah. He warred successfully against the Philistines, breaking through the walls of Gath, Jabneh and Ashdod, after which he built cities in the territory of Ashdod. Uzziah gained victories over the Arabians and Meunim, and made the Ammonites tributaries to Judah. His powerful, well-equipped fighting force came to consist of 375,000 men under the control of 2,600 heads of paternal houses. Uzziah strengthened the fortifications of Jerusalem and built engines of war there.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014429/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Ki. 14:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014429/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 26:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014429/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 6-9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014429/11/3" data-bid="12-4" class="b"> 11-15</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">This king also had great interest in agriculture and raising livestock. Uzziah hewed out many cisterns to provide an ample water supply for the livestock and erected towers in the wilderness, likely to protect the grazing herds and flocks from marauders. Farming and vinedressing operations were carried on under his direction in the mountains and in Carmel.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014429/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:10</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">It appears that Uzziah’s brilliant successes resulted in his becoming haughty to the point of invading the Holy compartment of the temple to burn incense. High Priest Azariah, accompanied by eighty underpriests, immediately followed the king into the temple and censured him for this unlawful act, urging him to leave the sanctuary. With the censer for burning incense in his hand and raging against the priests, Uzziah was miraculously stricken with leprosy in his forehead, whereupon the priests excitedly ushered him out of the temple. As an unclean leper Uzziah was cut off from all worship at the sanctuary and could not perform the kingly duties. Therefore, while Uzziah remained in a certain house until the day of his death, his son Jotham administered the affairs of state.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014429/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:16-21</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Concerning his death and burial, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014429/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 26:23</a> reports: “Finally Uzziah lay down with his forefathers; and so they buried him with his forefathers, but in the burial field that belonged to the kings, for they said: ‘He is a leper.’” This may mean that, because of his leprosy, Uzziah was buried in the ground of a field connected with the royal cemetery rather than being placed in a rock-hewn tomb.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">A limestone plaque, found at Jerusalem and thought to date from the first century C.E., bears the following inscription: “Hither were brought the bones of Uzziah, king of Judah.

<strong>Gate, Gateway</strong><br/><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb">Repair work above the Horse Gate was done by the priests, which implies that its location was near the Temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/76/0" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Neh. 3:28</a>) Some have held that the Horse Gate was one providing communication between two parts of the Temple-palace quarter. They reach this conclusion from the account of Athaliah’s execution, which reports that, on being led out of the Temple by the soldiers, “she came to the entry of the horse gate of the king’s house.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/77/0" data-bid="78-1" class="b">2 Chron. 23:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/77/1" data-bid="78-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 11:16</a>) However, this was likely an entry just to the precincts of the royal palace and not the Horse Gate through which the horses passed in and out of the city itself. Nehemiah definitely includes the Horse Gate in his reconstruction description, indicating that it was a gate in the city wall. It was probably located near the SE corner of the Temple-palace area. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/78/0" data-bid="79-1" class="b">Neh. 3:28</a>) According to Jeremiah, there must have been a <span id="page627" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="627" data-before-text="627"></span>corner of the wall near this gate, probably as the wall turned toward the left as one comes up the Kidron valley, thereby following the valley’s contour (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/79/0" data-bid="80-1" class="b">Jer. 31:40</a>) The Horse Gate is omitted in the inauguration procession account, evidently because the two parts of the procession left off at the Water Gate and the Gate of the Guard, respectively, and did not walk over the section of the wall E of the Temple, where the Horse Gate and the Inspection Gate were located.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/80/0" data-bid="81-1" class="b">Neh. 12:37-40</a>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="ss"><strong><em>Inspection Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">Some call the Inspection Gate (Heb., <em>ham-miph-qadh</em>ʹ) the Muster Gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/81/0" data-bid="82-1" class="b">Neh. 3:31</a>, <em>Ro; RS</em>) At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/82/0" data-bid="83-1" class="b">Ezekiel 43:21</a> <em>miph·qadhʹ</em> (the same Hebrew word without the article <em>ha</em>) is translated “appointed place.” It has been thought to be the same as the Gate of the Guard, or the Gate of Benjamin. Of these possibilities, the Gate of Benjamin is the more likely. (However, see “Sheep Gate,” considered earlier.) Its mention by Nehemiah in his reconstruction account would seem to support the idea that it was a gate in the E wall of the city in front of the Temple area and N of the Horse Gate. Nehemiah’s statement that there was a corner in the wall beyond the Inspection Gate would place this gate in the E wall, S of where the wall turned (likely in a northwestward direction).</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb">The account tells us that the repair work was done “in front of the Inspection Gate.” Some have understood this to refer to a repair work on the city wall in front of a Temple gate by this name. This does not seem to be the correct view, for the same expression is used respecting the Water Gate, which is acknowledged to have been a gate <em>in</em> the city wall. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/83/0" data-bid="84-1" class="b">Neh. 3:26,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/83/1" data-bid="84-2" class="b"> 31</a>) The Inspection Gate is not named in the procession account evidently because the marchers did not traverse the wall E of the Temple.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="ss"><strong><em>Gate of the Guard</em></strong></p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="sb">From this gate (called “prison gate,” <em>AV</em>) the inauguration procession walking SE along the wall left the wall and proceeded to the Temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/84/0" data-bid="85-1" class="b">Neh. 12:39, 40</a>) Some think that this gate is identical with the Inspection Gate, but this does not seem to be a likely probability.—See “Inspection Gate,” above.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="ss"><strong><em>Middle Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sb">When the Babylonians breached Jerusalem’s wall, their military officers sat in the Middle Gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/85/0" data-bid="86-1" class="b">Jer. 39:3</a>) As has been seen, several possibilities are set forth as to the location of this gate. Probably the most likely is that it is identical with the Gate of the Old City, since this gate was at the convergence of the Broad Wall, the N wall of the old city, and the W wall of the second quarter, and would be a central or commanding position. However, some say that the Middle Gate may have been the Gate of Ephraim. Another suggestion is that it was the Fish Gate, another commanding position, because this gate stood at the point where the valley dividing the city into two parts entered the city.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="ss"><strong><em>Gate of Benjamin</em></strong></p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sb">Some identify the Gate of Benjamin with the Sheep Gate. This location would fit the circumstances of Jeremiah’s attempted exit to the territory of Benjamin, evidently toward Anathoth, which lay NE of Jerusalem. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/86/0" data-bid="87-1" class="b">Jer. 37:11-13</a>) However, some believe that the Gate of Benjamin and the Inspection Gate are identical. The latter identification seems less likely, although it would also have been possible for Jeremiah to travel toward his hometown Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin from the Inspection Gate. Another argument for the Sheep Gate as being another name for the Gate of Benjamin is that Zedekiah was sitting in the Gate of Benjamin when approached by Ebed-melech with a plea in Jeremiah’s behalf. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/87/0" data-bid="88-1" class="b">Jer. 38:7, 8</a>) It is suggested that the king would be near the point of greatest concern during the Babylonian siege. The Sheep Gate on the N of the city would be the most seriously threatened by the attacking Babylonians, not the Inspection Gate, which was apparently on the E side of the Temple area, and not in a particularly vulnerable position.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="ss"><strong><em>Other gates mentioned</em></strong></p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sb">When King Zedekiah fled from the Babylonians, he went out “by the way of the gate between the double wall that is by the king’s garden.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/88/0" data-bid="89-1" class="b">Jer. 52:7, 8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/88/1" data-bid="89-2" class="b"> 39:4</a>) There is much uncertainty as to the identity of the “double wall.” However, from present knowledge, either the Gate of the Ash-heaps or the Fountain Gate might fit the circumstances described in the Scriptures, both of these being near the king’s garden. Those supporting the Fountain Gate location say that the exit from the city through this gate led through a fifteen-meter- (c. 49-foot-) long corridor between two strong walls. On the other hand, Dr. J. Simons, who advocates the Gate of the Ash-heaps as Zedekiah’s place of exit, says that the lower part of the Central (Tyropean) valley was enclosed between a supposed SW wall of the city of David and a wall discovered by archaeologist J. Bliss (apparently an old S wall), in which was the Gate of the Ash-heaps. From either of those gates Zedekiah could have fled toward the Arabah and to “the desert plains of Jericho,” where the Babylonians caught him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/89/0" data-bid="90-1" class="b">2 Ki. 25:5</a>.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/90/0" data-bid="91-1" class="b">2 Kings 23:8</a> reference is made to the “high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua, the chief of the city, which was at the left as a person came into the gate of the city.” Here “gate of Joshua” is not the name of a city gate, but evidently is a gate within the city walls leading to the governor’s residence, which was at the left as a person entered the city gate.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="ss"><strong>TEMPLE GATES</strong></p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="sb"><em>East Gate</em>. Nehemiah’s reconstruction account tells us that the keeper of the East Gate shared in the repair work.

(<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts,</em> edited by J. B. Pritchard, 1974, p. 279) One of the conspirators in the death of King Jehoash of Judah (c. 859 B.C.E.) was Zabad, the son of the Ammonitess Shimeath.

<strong>Ammonites</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Evidently out of consideration for their faithful forefather Lot, Jehovah God enabled the Ammonites to take possession of the territory previously held by the Rephaim, a towering people called the Zamzummim by the Ammonites.

Sometime prior to Israel’s entry into Canaan, however, the Amorites had dispossessed the Ammonites of some of their land and pushed them to the N and E, thereby driving a wedge between them and the Moabites (who also suffered the loss of considerable territory).

By then the Israelites had returned to serving the gods of the nations and an eighteen-year period of oppression had ensued, with the Ammonites pushing at Israel from the E while the Philistines menaced from the W. Ammonite forces not only terrorized the Israelites living in Gilead but even sallied W of the Jordan to harass the tribes of Benjamin, Judah and Ephraim. (10:6-10) Finally cleansed of false worship, the Israelites rallied under the headship of Jephthah and, after Jephthah legally refuted the Ammonite charges of a usurpation of land rights by Israel, the Ammonites were severely defeated.—10:16–11:33; see JEPHTHAH.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Some scholars have viewed Jephthah’s reference to “Chemosh your god” as erroneous, claiming that Chemosh was the national god of Moab, not Ammon.

Learning of the siege, Saul proved his merit as king, marshaled the Israelite forces and routed the Ammonites.

Hanun, Nahash’s son and successor, greatly angered David, however, by humiliating the messengers David sent to him as bearers of consolation. Becoming aware of the seriousness of the affront committed, the Ammonites sought out mercenary troops from the Syrians and prepared for an offensive against Israel, but were outmaneuvered and defeated by Israelite general Joab and his brother Abishai.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010244/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Sam. 10:1-14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010244/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 19:6-15</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The following spring Rabbah, the capital city of Ammon, came under siege by David’s forces. During one desperate sally by the besieged Ammonites, Uriah the Hittite died.

The record of the birth of the adulterine child to Bath-sheba and the later birth of Solomon may fit chronologically within the period of the siege or may simply be given in complete form in order to terminate the account involving Bath-sheba, even though one or both of the births could have taken place after the siege. While the account at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010244/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 20:1, 2</a> does not seem to indicate a protracted period, it would not be unusual if the siege had lasted into the following year. The full conquest of the Ammonite capital was finally effected by David.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010244/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Sam. 12:26-29</a>; see RABBAH.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The “crown of Malcam,” referred to in the capture of Rabbah, was evidently a crown placed on the head of the Ammonite idol god, elsewhere called Molech or Milcom. While the <em>Revised Standard Version</em> translates the Hebrew term <em>Mal·kamʹ</em> here as “their king,” it does not seem logical that a human king is referred to, inasmuch as the crown weighed “a talent of gold” or about 91.5 troy pounds (34.2 kilograms). It also seems likely that the crown’s being placed on David’s head was only a momentary act, perhaps to demonstrate the victory over this false god.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010244/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">2 Sam. 12:30</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Due to the <em>King James, American Standard</em> and <em>Douay</em> translations of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010244/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">2 Samuel 12:31</a> some have understood that the defeated Ammonites were cruelly sawed, axed and burned to death by David. Later translations (<em>RS, AT, NW, JB</em>), however, give the correct sense, showing that the Ammonites were put to forced labor working with saws and axes and in making bricks. This is substantiated by the fact that the Hebrew term rendered “brickkiln” in some translations is now known to refer instead to a wooden mold in which the clay was formed into a brick shape.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">When David withdrew to Mahanaim due to Absalom’s intrigue, it is noteworthy that one of those offering him aid was “Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah,” possibly the brother of Hanun. Further evidence that not all Ammonites were bitter enemies of Israel is the presence of Zelek the Ammonite among David’s mighty men.

One of the conspirators in the death of King Jehoash of Judah (898-858 B.C.E.) was an Ammonite servant, Zabad.

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">On the other hand, certain references may be to books that have names similar to books of the Bible but that are not actually part of the Bible. We might illustrate this with four ancient books: “the book of the affairs of the times of the kings of Judah,” “the Book of the Kings of Judah and of Israel,” “the Book of the Kings of Israel,” and “the Book of the Kings of Israel and of Judah.” While those names may sound similar to the names of the Bible books we know as 1 Kings and 2 Kings, the four books were not inspired, nor do those books find a place in the Bible canon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009207/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Ki. 14:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009207/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 16:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009207/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 20:34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009207/2/3" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 27:7</a>) They were likely just historical writings available back in the period when the prophet Jeremiah and Ezra wrote the accounts that we have in the Bible.</p>
