<strong>The More Important Healing</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> But aside from that, look at Christendom’s worse condition socially, politically, economically, judicially, morally, and religiously. Her condition is well described by Isaiah when telling of her ancient prototype, Israel: “Ah! sinful nation, guiltladen people; brood of evildoers, children who deal corruptly; who have forsaken the <span id="page305" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="305" data-before-text="305"></span>LORD, and spurned the Holy One of Israel, and gone back in estrangement from him! Where will you still be smitten, that you continue in your defection? The whole head is ailing, and the whole heart sick; from the sole of the foot to the head there is no health in it—nought but blows and bruises and bleeding wounds, that have not been pressed nor bound up nor softened with oil.” Which, then, is it that Christendom needs more, the healing of her people’s physical organisms or their spiritual healing?</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">17. Why is this the more important healing? How does Isaiah prescribe it?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Admittedly there is serious need of physical healing. Yet this physical well-being would never spare her from the woes and destruction of the impending war of Armageddon. It is the spiritual healing that is the more urgent, the more important, the really vital healing. For it is only those who seek and gain the spiritual recovery who will survive the terrible desolations and destructions of the “war of the great day of God the Almighty” and enter the healthy new world. Putting the spiritual therapy in the first place, the prophet Isaiah prescribed the course for Christendom to take and described the certain results: “‘Come now, and let us reason together,’ says the LORD: ‘If your sins be like scarlet, can they become white as snow? If they be red like crimson, can they become as wool? If you prove willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land; but if you refuse and rebel, you shall taste the sword’; for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951362/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Isa. 1:4-6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951362/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 18-20</a>, <em>AT</em>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">18. What do the physicians Christendom consults prove to be?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> But Christendom is like Asa king of ancient Jerusalem at the time of his serious disease. Of him it is written: “Yet in his disease he sought not to Jehovah, but to the physicians.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951362/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Chron. 16:12</a>, <em>AS</em>) Today Christendom turns her back on the real remedy which Jehovah prescribes in his Word and summons her religious medics to the side of her deathbed. These, with their pagan philosophies, traditions of men, empty rites, ceremonies and holy years, and worldly-mindedness, turn out to be what Job said of his false friends, “forgers of lies” and “physicians of no value”.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951362/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 13:4</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">19. How have these clergy physicians matched Jeremiah’s and Ezekiel’s descriptions of priests, prophets, and shepherds?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> With Jeremiah we can fitly raise the question: “Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951362/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Jer. 8:22</a>) The clergy physicians are quacks as far as the spiritual well-being of the people, the laity, is concerned. With two world wars already to their account and a third one menacing Christendom and, worst of all, Armageddon unavoidably threatening her, the clergy have matched Jeremiah’s description of the religious leaders who failed to avert Jerusalem’s destruction: “From the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951362/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Jer. 6:13, 14</a>) The prophet <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951362/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ezekiel (34:4</a>) testifies that they have neglected the eternal spiritual interests of God’s sheep: “The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them.” Hence God’s Word cries out woe to them, and their woe will come upon them in full at Armageddon to their destruction.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb"></p>

<strong>“Man” in the Hebrew Scriptures</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Even as <em>adám</em> sets man apart from the lower animals, so it also calls attention to <span id="page58" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="58" data-before-text="58"></span>man’s inferiority to the Creator, Jehovah God. Thus Moses was told that no human could see God and live. Samuel was reminded that a human can see only the outside, but God can see the heart. David prayed that he might not fall into human hands but into God’s hands, for having numbered the fighting men of his nation presumptuously. The temple of Solomon, David said, was to be built, not for humans, but for God. Jehoshaphat counseled the judges to remember that they were judging, not for humans, but for God. Elihu refused to give flattering titles to mere humans.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ex. 33:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 1 Sam. 16:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 1 Chron. 21:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/3" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 29:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/4" data-bid="11-5" class="b"> 2 Chron. 19:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/5" data-bid="11-6" class="b"> Job 32:21</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The psalmist twice asked why the great Creator should take note of mere humans; also, he said that, though certain ones were “gods,” they would die like earthling man. The fear of humans brings a snare, but he that trusts in Jehovah will be safe. Why go down to Egypt for help? The Egyptians are not spirits but mere humans, earthlings. And to highlight the seriousness of the selfishness of the priests in Malachi’s day, God asked: “Will earthling man rob God?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 8:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 144:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 82:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/3" data-bid="12-4" class="b"> Prov. 29:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/4" data-bid="12-5" class="b"> Isa. 31:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/5" data-bid="12-6" class="b"> Mal. 3:8</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>“ENÓSH”</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The thought behind <em>enósh,</em> weak or mortal, shows, for one thing, that the Hebrew Scripture writers had no illusions about man’s being immortal. How could they, since they received their “theology,” not from pagan sources, but from God himself, who made plain man’s mortal nature both by warning him of death in the event he sinned and by sentencing him, after he had sinned, to return to the dust from which man had been taken.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. 2:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 3:19</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><em>Enósh</em> always has an unfavorable connotation and, therefore, is never used in a complimentary sense. Fittingly, it is frequently coupled with <em>adám,</em> human, when man is contrasted with his immortal Maker, Jehovah God. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalms 8:4 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Ps 144:3</a> are typical of this coupling of <em>enósh</em> with <em>adám</em> when contrasting man with God. Thus also Moses wrote: “You make mortal man [<em>enósh</em>] go back to crushed matter, and you say: ‘Go back, you sons of men [<em>adám</em>].’” Because of the wickedness of man God warned that he would make <em>‘enósh</em> scarcer than refined gold and <em>adám</em> scarcer than the gold of Ophir.’ Putting both <em>enósh</em> and <em>adám</em> in their places are the words of Jehovah to Isaiah: “I myself am the One that is comforting you people. Who are you that you should be afraid of a mortal man [<em>enósh</em>] that will die, and of a son of mankind [<em>adám</em>] that will be rendered as mere green grass? And that you should forget Jehovah your Maker, the One stretching out the heavens and laying the foundation of the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 90:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Isa. 13:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 51:12, 13</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Particularly in the book of Job, which features God’s sovereignty in contrast to man’s puniness, is <em>enósh</em> a favorite term when making this point: “How can mortal man be in the right in a case with God?” “What is mortal man that you should rear him, and that you should set your heart upon him?” “Do you [Jehovah] have eyes of flesh, or is it as a mortal man sees that you see? Are your days like the days of mortal man, or your years just like the days of an able-bodied man?” “As one trifles with mortal man will you trifle with [God]? “ “God is much more than mortal man.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Job 9:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 7:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/2" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 10:4, 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/3" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> 13:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/4" data-bid="16-5" class="b"> 33:12</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">From his prayers we can see that David had a like keen appreciation: “Do arise, O Jehovah! Let not mortal man prove superior in strength.” “Judge the fatherless boy and the crushed one, that mortal man who is of the earth may no more cause trembling.” “As for mortal man, his days are like those of green grass.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ps. 9:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 10:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/16/2" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 103:15</a>.</p>

Their allotment of territory stretched along the Mediterranean coastal plains from below the town of Dor, S of Mount Carmel, on up to the N boundary of Palestine at Sidon.

Asher appears to be the name of a town listed as on the boundary of the tribe of Manasseh. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010414/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Josh. 17:7</a>) The suggested location is Teyasir about eleven miles (17.7 kilometers) NE of Shechem on the road to Beth-shean. However, it may be noted that Asher is also referred to in this same account at verse 10, where it clearly refers to the tribal territory of Asher.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"></p>

In these cases the Hebrew noun <em>cha·nephʹ</em> is used, meaning “[one] alienated from God,” that is, an apostate.

<strong>Our Quest for a Longer Life</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“Man, born of woman, is short-lived and glutted with agitation. Like a blossom he has come forth and is cut off, and he runs away like the shadow and does not keep existing.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999760/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 14:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">EVEN today few would contradict this reflection on the brevity of life, though it was written some 3,500 years ago. People have always found it unsatisfactory to taste the prime of life briefly and then to grow old and die. Therefore, methods to prolong life have proliferated throughout history.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In Job’s time Egyptians ate the testicles of animals in a vain attempt to regain their youth. One of the prime objectives of medieval alchemy was to produce an elixir that could lead to longer life. Many alchemists believed that artificially produced gold would give immortal life and that eating from golden plates would prolong life. Ancient Chinese Taoists reckoned that they could alter the body’s chemistry by using such techniques as meditation, breathing exercises, and diet and thus obtain immortality.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León is known for his insatiable search for the fountain of youth. An 18th-century doctor recommended in his book <em>Hermippus Redivivus</em> that young virgins be kept in a small room in springtime and their exhalations collected in bottles and used as a life-extending potion. Needless to say, none of these methods had any success.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Today, some 3,500 years after Moses recorded Job’s statement, man has walked on the moon, invented cars and computers, and investigated the atom and the cell. Yet, despite all such technological advances, we are still “short-lived and glutted with agitation.” It is true that in developed countries the life expectancy has increased dramatically over the last century. But this is mainly the result of improved health care, more efficient hygienic measures, and better nutrition. For example, from the mid-19th century to the beginning of the 1990’s, the average life span in Sweden rose from 40 to 75 years for men and from 44 to 80 years for women. But does this mean that man’s urge to live longer has been satisfied?</p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><span id="page256" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="256" data-before-text="256"></span><strong>● Why does the <em>New World Translation</em> render</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 90:2</strong></a> <strong>so differently from other translations?—B. B., United States.</strong></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">According to the <em>Revised Standard Version</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 90:2</a> reads: “Before the mountains were <em>brought forth,</em> or ever thou hadst <em>formed</em> the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting thou art God.” <em>The New World Translation</em> of this verse reads: “Before the mountains themselves were born, or you proceeded to bring forth as with labor pains the earth and the productive land, even from time indefinite to time indefinite you are God.”</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The Hebrew word for the first of these expressions is the passive voice of <em>yalad</em> and, according to Hebrew lexicographers, it means to be begotten, born, and relates to the ordinary birth process. <em>Yalad</em> is applied to both the father’s and the mother’s part, as can be seen from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 14:1</a> (“Man, <em>born</em> of woman”) and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 2:7</a> (“I have <em>become</em> your <em>father”</em>).</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The Hebrew word for the second verb in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 90:2</a> is entirely another verb and is used in connection with the birth process to call attention to the pain and travail thereof. It is the Hebrew word <em>hhil,</em> which, according to Hebrew authorities, means basically, “to have labor pains.” The form of this verb in the Hebrew text here has a sort of reflexive force in which the performer of the act suffers the accompanying sensations. In other words, he experiences the labor pains or childbirth pains. That is why the word is also defined as “to bring forth (in pain).”—Young’s <em>Analytical Concordance to the Bible.</em></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">This same word is found at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:18</a>, which reads: “The Rock who fathered you, you proceeded to forget, and you began to leave God out of memory, the One bringing you forth with childbirth pains,” without doubt referring to the miracles Jehovah wrought in Egypt in connection with the deliverance of the nation of Israel. Also, we find this Hebrew term at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Isaiah 51:2</a>, where we read: “Look to Abraham your father and to Sarah who gradually brought you forth with childbirth pains.” Also at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Proverbs 25:23</a>: “The wind from the north brings forth as with labor pains a downpour.”</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">From the foregoing references we can see the use of these words particularly in poetic writing, and we see that they are full of meaning, expressive indeed. Modern translations hide the force of these expressions by their free renderings.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Regarding the use of these terms in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Psalm 90:2</a>, it might be said that, judged by human standards, the producing of this earth and the productive land with all its complicated mechanisms and chemistry would certainly call for a great deal of effort, painful effort, as measured even by scientists today. The psalmist here speaks from a purely human standpoint and thereby shows both an active imagination and great respect for the amount of work involved for Jehovah to create these things; with what expenditure of time, of course, we do not know.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"></p>

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page37" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="37" data-before-text="37"></span><strong>Benefiting Now from Christ’s Ransom</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ is one of the greatest blessings ever made available to imperfect human creatures. Happy indeed are all those who avail themselves of it!</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Perhaps someone will say, I do not need to be ransomed. I am not in bondage. I am free. I can come and go as I please.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Free? Perhaps, in a limited sense, but not truly free, not altogether free. Are we not in bondage to the workings of sin and death in our bodies? We cannot do perfectly, morally or otherwise; neither can we stave off the dying process, can we? Absolutely not! That is why Job complained: “Man, born of woman, is short-lived and glutted with agitation”; and why the words of David apply to all of us: “Look! With error I was brought forth with birth pains, and in sin my mother conceived me.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962041/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 14:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962041/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ps. 51:5</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">How did we get into this bondage? Through the disobedience of our first parent, Adam, even as we read: “Through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned.” Our first parents ate sour grapes, as it were, and so we all have our teeth set on edge.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962041/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962041/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Jer. 31:29</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">But why should it take a ransom to relieve us of the injustice our first parent did to us? Could not God, simply out of love, forgive mankind their sins, since these are inherited? That is what the modernist clergy hold, but they thereby deny the Bible teaching of the ransom of Jesus Christ for our sins.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">No, God could not simply forgive mankind their inherited sins, for that would imply that he made a mistake in sentencing Adam to death; that he did not foresee the consequences of his judicial decision. Besides, if he did that, he would be violating his own just laws and thus lose the fear and respect of his creatures. Sin had resulted in the loss of life and so it took an unforfeited life to cancel out the effects of sin. So we read that “unless blood is poured out no forgiveness takes place,” blood standing for the life.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962041/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb. 9:22</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">However, Jehovah God could lovingly arrange for another to pay the penalty so that those victims of Adam’s transgression could be set free. Of course, to ransom mankind such a one would have to be perfect and possess the right to life. Since not one of Adam’s offspring could do this, God offered the privilege to his only-begotten Son, who gladly accepted it. So God transferred the life of his Son from heaven to earth, to the womb of a virgin. Thus it was that Jesus was born at once human and yet with the right to life, making <span id="page38" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="38" data-before-text="38"></span>it possible for him to ransom the human race.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962041/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gal. 4:4</a>.</p>

<strong>“Man” in the Hebrew Scriptures</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><em>Ish,</em> together with its plural form <em>anashím</em> (which at times also serves as the plural of <em>enósh</em>), has primarily the thought of “man,” or a person, an individual. It has no such overtones as human, mortal or able-bodied, although inherent in it is the thought of strength as of a male. The word <em>ish</em> does not appear in the Scriptures until after the word for woman, <em>ishsháh</em>—a man with a womb—appears, for in the <span id="page57" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="57" data-before-text="57"></span>strictest sense of the word only then did an <em>ish</em> become apparent; before that he was called the human, <em>adám.</em> When in the Hebrew Scriptures man is mentioned in relation to woman or sexual intercourse, invariably <em>ish</em> is used, some seventy times in all, although the word for “male” is <em>zakhár</em> and occurs seventy-nine times from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 1:27</a> onward. Typical is <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Leviticus, chapter 20</a>, dealing with God’s law regarding sex relations.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><em>Ish,</em> with its emphasis on the person, the individual, is the choice of Bible writers when writing about a “man of God,” and a “man of discernment.” When Nathan confronted King David with his sin, Nathan used this word. Did he say, “You yourself are the”—mortal? human? able-bodied man? No, but, “You yourself are [the one] the man!”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Josh. 14:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Prov. 10:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 2 Sam. 12:7</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">There are times when the other words for “man” simply would not be appropriate. Thus when the psalmist foretold that the names of those of the body of Christ who gain heavenly glory would be known he could use only <em>ish. “‘Each</em> and <em>every one</em> was born in her.’ . . . Jehovah himself will declare, when recording the peoples: ‘This is one who was born there.’” Also Moses, when exulting over Jehovah’s victory at the Red Sea, could not have referred to Jehovah as a weak mortal or a human earthling, and so had to use <em>ish</em> to convey his thought, even as rendered in the <em>New World Translation:</em> “Jehovah is a manly person of war.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 87:5, 6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Ex. 15:3</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss">“<strong>ADÁM”</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn"><em>Adám,</em> the human, the earthling, is the choice whenever Hebrew Scripture writers make reference to the creation of man: “I myself have made the earth and have created even man [the human] upon it.” <em>Adám</em> does not denote maleness any more than <em>human</em> does, and so we read that Adam, that is, the human, earthling man, called the first human pair, the <em>ish</em> and <em>ishsháh,</em> the man and the woman.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isa. 45:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Gen. 5:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 6:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/7/3" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> Deut. 4:32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/7/4" data-bid="8-5" class="b"> Eccl. 7:29</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><em>Adám</em>, the human, is almost without exception also the word preferred when man is mentioned in the same breath with the lower animals or beasts. This coupling appears in the accounts of creation, the Deluge, the plagues of Egypt and the seventy-year desolation. The psalmist praises Jehovah God for preserving both <em>adám</em> (human) and beast. And it is the human that is shown to be like the beast by the Congregator: “For there is an eventuality as respects the sons of mankind [<em>adám</em>] and an eventuality as respects the beast, and they have the same eventuality. As the one dies, so the other dies; and they all have but one spirit, so that there is no superiority of the man [human, <em>adám</em>] over the beast, for everything is vanity.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Gen. 1:26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 6:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Ex. 8:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/8/3" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> Jer. 33:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/8/4" data-bid="9-5" class="b"> Ps. 36:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/8/5" data-bid="9-6" class="b"> Eccl. 3:19-21</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Fittingly, <em>adám</em>, the earthling, human, is also the choice when speaking of the general characteristics of humankind: “The inclination of the heart of <em>man</em> is bad from his youth up.” “There is no <em>man</em> that does not sin.” “<em>Man,</em> born of woman, is short-lived and glutted with agitation.” “Surely every earthling man . . . is nothing but an exhalation,” a breath. “There is no <em>man</em> having power over the spirit to restrain the spirit,” that is, to keep from dying. “I well know, O Jehovah, that to <em>earthling man</em> his way does not belong.

<strong>God’s Way Is Love</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[71]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Seeing what God has done in fulfilling his own prophecies in the Scriptures, by sending his only-begotten Son into the world to help man to understand and become acquainted with his Creator, certainly we must say that God <em>is</em> love. From the way Jesus taught us and the way the inspired Holy Scriptures teach us we can realize that God is LOVE. But what a difference there is when it comes to the things that men teach us today about God! In <span id="page623" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="623" data-before-text="623"></span>view of such teachings of men and seeing that God has done so much with our eternal blessing in mind, we are led to ask: If God is love, how could there be a place of eternal torment, called hell, where billions of human creatures in God’s image are said to go after death of the body? There fire and brimstone are said to be burning for eternity and condemned souls are said to remain there without release, in conscious torment. How could there be even such a place as “purgatory”, where souls are said to endure excruciating pains while they await their release to be taken to heaven? Why should it be God’s will that the vast majority of people should live and suffer in such poverty and distress, so that many people say man has his hell right here on earth? How can God’s being love harmonize with such ideas and teachings of men? When the God-fearing people at Berea were taught certain things even by the apostle Paul, they went “daily searching the scriptures, whether these things were so”. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952764/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 17:11</a>, <em>Dy</em>) We can be just as noble as those Bereans were by doing the same thing.</p><p id="p72" data-pid="72" class="qu"> 8, 9. (a) Because of man’s present misery, what question do we ask about his future? (b) How would God have more love for a tree than for man?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[72]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> In their present condition those of mankind are miserable. What man is not sorrowful? He lives a few years and then goes into death. After that, according to certain teachings in this world, if he has not been a good man he must go to eternal torment in the fires of hell. Patient Job, a man who loved and served God, said this: “Man, born of a woman, living for a short time, is filled with many miseries.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952764/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 14:1</a>, <em>Dy</em>) Does it not appear that man has enough trouble on earth without having to go to a place of eternal torment after he dies in order to experience more and worse misery? So we listen with interest to what Job has to say further: “A tree hath hope. If it be cut, it groweth green again, and the boughs thereof sprout. If its root be old in the earth, and its stock be dead in the dust: at the scent of water, it shall spring, and bring forth leaves, as when it was first planted. But man when he shall be dead, and stripped, and consumed, I pray you where is he?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952764/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 14:7-10</a>, <em>Dy</em>) A tree is beautiful; it is God’s creation, but it is not intelligent.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[72]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Man is intelligent, in God’s image, and are we to believe that God loves a tree more than man, that a tree after it is cut down will sprout and grow again, but man—no; even though he has lived in his miseries here, God torments him more after death? None of us like death. We should like to sprout again as a green tree does, and we should like to live in pleasant surroundings, if only we knew how. But after death where is man? Job asked. Did Job believe he was in a burning hell, a fiery purgatory, or even a limbo?</p><p id="p73" data-pid="73" class="qu">10. What did Job pray respecting hell, and why?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[73]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> What did Job know about this subject of “hell”? At the time Job was covered with boils due to a sickness brought upon him by Satan the Devil. He was really a man in misery on earth. So in view of popular teachings about “hell”, is it not strange that Job should say this to God: “Who will grant me this, that thou mayst protect me in hell, and hide me till thy wrath pass, and appoint me a time when thou wilt remember me”? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952764/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 14:13</a>, <em>Dy</em>) Here Job, in his misery, prays to God in heaven to hide him in hell. Can you imagine his wanting to go there if hell is a place of terrible conscious torment? Certainly Job had enough trouble and was not wanting to hop out of a frying pan into a fire. No, he did not. But to avoid this seeming contradiction some have imagined that there must be a part of hell that is blissful and another part for torment. On the contrary, Job prayed as he did because <span id="page624" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="624" data-before-text="624"></span>he knew God’s arrangements and knew what “hell” in the Holy Scriptures means. He knew that sometime in the future God would remember all those that had gone to this Scriptural “hell”, and would give them an opportunity in a new world, “in which justice dwelleth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952764/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:13</a>, <em>Dy</em>) So what is that “hell”?</p>

<strong>Rescue Needed!</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Most of us will never be trapped underground like those nine coal miners or have to face death in a catastrophe. Still, we all need to be rescued, for we cannot escape the ravages of sickness and old age and finally death. “Man, born of woman, is short-lived and glutted with agitation,” observed the faithful patriarch Job. “Like a blossom he has come forth and is cut off, and he runs away like the shadow and does not keep existing.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008160/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 14:1, 2</a>) Today, some 3,500 years later, those words continue to prove true, for who of us can escape life’s fatal outcome​—death? Regardless of where we live or how well we guard our health, we need to be rescued from the clutches of suffering, old age, and death.</p>

Such an inquiry discloses that bad personality characteristics such as described above are acquired, in part, through both <em>heredity</em> and <em>environment.</em> <span id="page522" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="522" data-before-text="522"></span>Parents have passed on to their children the imprint of nearly 6,000 years of sin and death. “Through one man [Adam] sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned.” “Through the disobedience of the one man many were constituted sinners.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964642/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964642/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 19</a>) Hence David confessed, though he was ‘a man agreeable to Jehovah’s heart,’ “In sin my mother conceived me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964642/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 13:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964642/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Ps. 51:5</a>) Of sinner Adam’s offspring “there is not a righteous man, not even one.” “Who can produce someone clean out of someone unclean?” asked Job.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964642/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rom. 3:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964642/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Job 14:4</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 8.

No less is this true with the offspring of mankind. From infancy children are surrounded by the depraved environment of this corrupt world. The atmosphere created in the home by the parents may be quite good, which, of course, is the rare exception nowadays, yet the association outside the parental nest is, for the most part, ruthless and cruel. The child that comes from a good home plays and associates so often with less fortunate children. The public schooling of the youth, whether inside or outside of Christendom, is under the influence of a wicked system of things ruled by Satan the Devil and his demons.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964642/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 12:31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964642/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 4:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964642/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Eph. 2:2</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 9.

The Bible foretold what would take place after that year, saying: “So down the great dragon was hurled [from heaven], the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan, who is misleading the entire inhabited earth; he was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him. [Hence] . . . woe for the earth and for the sea, because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing he has a short period of time.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964642/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rev. 12:9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964642/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 12</a>.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">10.

His description is so accurate and faithful to the facts we might imagine we are reading a commentary in our daily newspaper instead of Paul’s nineteen-hundred-year-old letter to Timothy. “For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, self-assuming, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, disloyal, having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, without love of goodness, betrayers, headstrong, puffed up with pride, lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God, having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964642/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1-5</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>SOLID BASIS FOR HOPE</strong></p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">11, 12.

<strong>Why Do Men Die?</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Man was so created by God that he not only needed air to breathe, water to drink <span id="page327" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="327" data-before-text="327"></span>and food to eat, but also needed to maintain proper relations with his Creator. Failure to do so would have the same detrimental effect as failure to satisfy the body’s need for food and drink. It would eventually lead to death. And so it did. When the first human pair, Adam and Eve, willfully disobeyed and ate the forbidden food, God dismissed them from the paradise garden, sentencing them to a dying existence in the earth outside.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">But death did not follow immediately. Since God had created them perfect, their bodies still retained tremendous vitality. Now, however, they were imperfect. God had withdrawn his blessing, and, in time, imperfection manifested itself in their growing old and getting sick. As a precision piece of machinery will develop flaws and deteriorate if it is not operated according to the manufacturer’s specifications, so, because of breaking the laws of their Maker, the first human pair became imperfect, developed flaws in their organism, and began to deteriorate. Sickness and disease set in, and eventually death followed. After using up the tremendous vitality of his once-perfect body, Adam died at the age of 930 years, within the thousand-year-day limit God had set.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Sickness and death are therefore the result of our first parents’ disobedience and dismissal from God’s family. Just as a perfect piece of machinery cannot be produced from an imperfect mold, so Adam and Eve in their imperfection could not produce perfect children free from the inclination toward sin. Therefore, all of their offspring became infected with their liabilities of sickness and death.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964401/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 14:4</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Yes, this inclination toward sin is what is responsible for the violence that exists, as in the case of the young boy who killed his sister. It is also responsible for the breaking down of the human organism, which eventually leads to death due to aging and sickness. It is just as the Christian apostle Paul explained: “That is why, just as through one man [Adam] sin entered into the world and death through sin, and <em>thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned.”</em> This is the authoritative Bible answer as to why men today grow old and die.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964401/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="ss"><strong>HOPE FOR THE UNCONSCIOUS DEAD</strong></p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">So rather than God’s being responsible for the violence that separates loved ones from their families, as many clergymen claim, it is man himself that is to blame. God arranged for man to live and enjoy life, but it was the first human pair that rebelled and brought the condemnation of death upon themselves and all their offspring. This did not mean a one-way ticket to heaven for them, but, according to the Bible, at death man’s active life force goes out, “he goes back to his ground; in that day his thoughts do perish.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964401/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 146:4</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">It is therefore a deception and a lie for clergymen to say death is merely a transition, a releasing of the soul to enjoy life in some other state of existence. Man is a soul; he <em>“came to be a living soul.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964401/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Gen. 2:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964401/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 15:45</a>) And repeatedly the Bible speaks of the soul as being subject to death. For instance, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964401/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezekiel 18:4</a>, where it says: “The soul that is sinning—it itself will die.”</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">While it is true that when men die, they are unconscious and cannot experience any sensation, the Scriptures offer the grand hope of a resurrection from death. “Do not marvel at this,” Jesus Christ said, “because the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out.” Although death is a terrible enemy, how comforting it is to know of God’s wonderful promise of a resurrection to life!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964401/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Why Do the Righteous Suffer?</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Today human suffering is observed on every hand. Millions of people starve and <span id="page262" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="262" data-before-text="262"></span>live in extreme poverty. Unlike Job, who “did not sin or ascribe unseemliness to God,” many become embittered and blame God. This was especially true during World War II when bombs rained from the sky, spreading death and suffering to both good people and bad. Yet when men break God’s laws by hating and warring against one another, can they properly blame Him when suffering results? If a parent warns his children that they should not fight among themselves and they disregard the good counsel and assault one another with sticks and stones, is the parent responsible if bruises and injuries are suffered? He is no more responsible than God is for human suffering when people disregard his laws.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Even when righteous servants of God suffer as a result of wars and other disasters such as hurricanes, floods and earthquakes, still God is not to blame. It is true that in specific instances in times past God caused disasters to execute the wicked, but on those occasions, as in the case of the cataclysmic flood in Noah’s day, a warning was given so that there was no question in anyone’s mind that God brought the destruction as he forewarned. But there is no Scriptural authority for believing that disasters in general are calamities God brings upon people to punish them for their sins. To the contrary, earthquakes, for instance, are found to be caused primarily by the settling of the earth, and not by a direct intervention of God. Instead of such calamities being acts of God, chance and unforeseen occurrence are involved.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">When the first human pair willfully disobeyed God they were expelled from the garden of Eden. They thus lost for themselves and their descendants the special protection and blessing of their Creator. Therefore, except for special instances involving the accomplishment of God’s own purpose, what happened to mankind from day to day was governed by chance and not by God’s direction. So it is “because time and unforeseen occurrence befall them all” that good people and bad suffer similarly from natural disasters, accidents, fires, and so forth.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eccl. 9:11</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>BOTH RIGHTEOUS AND WICKED SUFFER</strong></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Sickness and disease are a chief cause of suffering. Even the young suffer painful diseases, and this is true whether one is righteous or wicked. Faithful young Timothy had trouble with his stomach and suffered “frequent cases of sickness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Tim. 5:23</a>) Since Paul makes particular mention of this in his letter, it appears that Timothy’s sickness resulted in his experiencing a great deal of suffering. It seems that Paul likewise suffered some physical affliction, which he referred to as a “thorn in the flesh.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Cor. 12:7-9</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Why did these righteous men suffer, as did other faithful Bible characters? For the same reason that righteous servants of God today do—because of inherited imperfections due to sin. Humans have received imperfect bodies from their parents, and their right conduct before God does not now change or cure such inherited weaknesses or susceptibilities to disease. Because of this a righteous person may suffer, and even perish, but a wicked one may continue a long time in his badness. On the other hand, the wicked too are born with inherited physical weaknesses that may lead to their experiencing suffering. The matter of chance and unforeseen occurrence is involved.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 14:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Rom. 5:12</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Those who have walked in the ways of righteousness may also suffer because of exercising poor judgment or failure to apply Scriptural counsel at all times. This is true of a Christian, who, contrary to Scriptural advice, marries an unbeliever and suffers marital troubles as a result. Or perhaps he uses poor judgment, not eating properly, and getting insufficient rest, so <span id="page263" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="263" data-before-text="263"></span>that he runs himself down and suffers because of it. David failed on one occasion to apply Scriptural counsel and committed adultery with Bath-sheba. This foolish act brought him much suffering, even though he repented and did not repeat his sin. Peter, too, in a spiritually weakened condition, denied Christ three times. The Scriptures say he wept bitterly.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Sam. 11:2-4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Matt. 26:75</a>.</p>

<strong>Appreciating the Power of Discernment</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[24]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> Adam and Eve, on the other hand, failed to do right because they did not have that love for God. In the case of Eve, she had been properly informed of the divine <span id="page265" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="265" data-before-text="265"></span>will through Adam, her head, and had been told what would result from her failure to follow it. For a time she had a record of unmarred integrity and was therefore a perfect woman. Then suddenly she was confronted with an alternate course to the one commanded by Jehovah. Now she had an opportunity to prove her love for God, to exercise her perceptive powers and strengthen her knowledge of right and wrong, advancing to completeness of integrity and maturity. But self-interest dulled her perceptive powers. She refused to turn to Adam or to Jehovah for guidance and, instead, followed the example and counsel of one not authorized as God’s channel of communication and was deceived thereby. Anticipating unauthorized personal benefits, she forsook her belief in God’s word; wrong became right to her and she deliberately violated God’s commandment. Her disobedient act broke her record of integrity and she lost her standing of perfection. Her mistake of disobedience cost her her life.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="qu"> 4. What mental attitude on Adam’s part caused him to join Eve in rebellion?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[25]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> And what of Adam? Adam too was fully aware of the divine will for him but, unlike Eve, was not deceived as to what would result to him if disobedient. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961322/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:14</a>) Still, like Eve, his self-interest forced out his love for God and he joined Eve in willfully breaking God’s commandment, upholding Eve in her self-made standard of good and bad. Adam’s complete disregard for Jehovah’s good pleasure and as to how the course he had chosen would affect Jehovah’s name and praise plunged him headlong into disobedience and death, with no hope of redemption. The perceptive powers that God had given him, which enabled him to speak, to write, to worship God and to seek his presence in the “breezy part of the day” in order to converse with him—these keen perceptive powers of this perfect man were abandoned in favor of self-gratification. What a contrast to the course Jesus took in humbling himself and seeking always to do God’s will!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961322/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Phil. 2:5-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961322/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> John 5:30</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="qu"> 5. (a) How can we avoid the fatal mistake of our first parents? (b) How has that mistake affected modern standards of good and bad, and what, therefore, is it foolish to assume?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[26]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> We, being imperfect children of Adam and Eve, cannot hope to duplicate Jesus’ perceptive powers nor can we now live completely free from error. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961322/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rom. 3:12</a>) But we can avoid the fatal mistake made by our first human parents. To do so we must develop and exercise our powers of discernment. Children are born with no knowledge of right and wrong. As they advance into adulthood their concept of what is good and what is bad usually develops through training by the parents and through experiences they encounter in the environment in which they grow up. Had Adam and Eve remained faithful, we, as their children, would have been properly instructed according to God’s Word and raised in a climate of righteousness. But since our first parents deliberately abandoned God’s standard, establishing their own substitute, which they handed on to their posterity, we have a basic inheritance of disobedience and a tendency to wrongdoing. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961322/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 14:4</a>) Furthermore, over the centuries beliefs and customs have come to vary completely from one end of the earth to the other. How foolish and shortsighted it is in the face of such differences for anyone to assume that his standard is right and safe just because he was raised that way and because it is the only one he has ever known!</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="qu"> 6. What has made it possible for us to know God’s perfect standard, and what is the first step in the use of our perceptive powers?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[27]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Although we are fleshly descendants of Adam and Eve, we can be grateful that Jehovah God is still the Creator of the human race, imperfect creatures though we <span id="page266" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="266" data-before-text="266"></span>may be to him and temporarily estranged from him by our inheritance from Adam. Thankful we can be too that Jehovah has not forgotten a Creator’s love for us and has not abandoned us to a course of wrongdoing without showing us the way out. Today it would be impossible for anyone to come to an accurate knowledge of God’s perfect standard if Jehovah himself had not clearly outlined it for us. This he has done in his own Book of requirements, the Holy Bible, even sending his own perfect Son to set the proper example. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961322/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:16, 17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961322/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> John 13:15</a>) How vital it is, then, to get the mind of Jesus Christ instead of doggedly holding to a false viewpoint that was inherited from our first parents and that has been further corrupted by the accepted standards of this present wicked system of things. To follow Jesus’ example is indeed the course of wisdom. It is the first step in avoiding the mistake made by Adam and Eve. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961322/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Cor. 11:3</a>) It is the first step in the use of our perceptive powers, exercising the discernment to see through the confusing and corrupting moral standards of this divided old world and making our minds over to conform to the perfect and complete will of God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961322/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Phil. 2:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961322/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Rom. 12:2</a>.</p>

<strong>What Is God’s Way to Salvation?</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">That eternal life is possible is shown by these words: “Furthermore, this is the promised thing which he himself promised us, the life everlasting.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960161/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 John 2:25</a>) The Supreme Sovereign does not make promises that are not kept. His promise of salvation from death will be fulfilled for those that love and obey him. He certainly cannot be expected to give eternal life to persons that rebelliously refuse to obey him or that ignore his provision for salvation. “Jehovah is guarding all those loving <span id="page133" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="133" data-before-text="133"></span>him, but all the wicked ones he will annihilate.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960161/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 145:20</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>SOURCE OF SALVATION</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Although some political governments want people to look to them for salvation, there is actually only one source, Jehovah God, to whom man must look for it. He is man’s Savior. He saved the human race from complete destruction during the great Flood, and he saved the nation of Israel from enslavement time and time again. King David viewed him as the source of salvation when he said: “Jehovah is my crag and my stronghold and the Provider of escape for me. My God is my rock. I shall take refuge in him, my shield and my horn of salvation, my secure height.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960161/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Sam. 22:2, 3</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">As he saved righteous persons from the Flood and from the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, so will he save such ones from the destruction of this present wicked world. But he will do more than that. He will save them from Adamic death. This was made possible by his providing the means for canceling out the effects of Adam’s sin.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Since Adam was a perfect man before he sinned, only the life of another perfect man could ransom or bring release to his descendants. It was impossible for the human race to produce this perfect human of itself, for all have been born imperfect because of having received their life force through sinner Adam. “Who can produce someone clean out of someone unclean? There is not one.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960161/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 14:4</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">As mankind’s source of salvation Jehovah God provided the perfect man, whose life could ransom the human race, by transferring the life force of his chief angelic Son in the heavens to the womb of a virgin. Because the child that was born did not receive its life through Adam’s line of descent but from God, it was perfect. Thus Jesus Christ became equal to Adam and able to ransom mankind by laying down his perfect human life. “Just as the Son of man came, not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his soul [or life] a ransom in exchange for many.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960161/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 20:28</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>DIFFERENT VIEWS OF SALVATION</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">As might be expected in a world that thinks too highly of human philosophy, there are many views regarding human salvation. There are, for example, religious persons that think belief in Jesus Christ is practically all that is necessary for salvation. Some of their preachers can be heard from time to time urging people, in a highly emotional manner, to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and be saved. Once a person is thus “saved” he is thought to be always “saved.” He is considered as having gained salvation and need never fear about losing it. What he is thought to have been saved from is the fiery hell that the unsaved or lost ones are thought to be headed for. Regarding this the evangelist Billy Graham said: “It was the awfulness of hell that caused God to contrive the marvelous atonement of Christ on the cross. . . . It was man’s utter lostness that inspired God’s uttermost salvation. . . . We should certainly shun hell because of the price God paid to save us from it.”</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Another view of salvation is that held by those who believe in universal salvation. Persons that hold to this view believe that it is incredible that God would torture unsaved ones eternally. They believe in the ultimate restoration of all sinners to God’s favor. One of the early believers in universal salvation, a bishop by the name of Titus, said, A.D. 364, that the severity of the torments of hell would “lead the wicked to repentance and so to salvation.”</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Those persons that become a bit confused by the different views on salvation <span id="page134" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="134" data-before-text="134"></span>often develop a theory of their own. They conclude that as long as a person leads a good life and does not harm his neighbor, that is all that is required for salvation. They think that God expects nothing more from them.</p>

<strong>“Proclaim Liberty Throughout All the Land”</strong><br/><p id="p37" data-pid="37" data-rel-pid="[86]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"><sup>30</sup></span> By this they became the slaves of sin, and were driven out of the paradise of Eden into the uncultivated, unsubdued earth. Themselves now slaves of sin, they <span id="page460" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="460" data-before-text="460"></span>could not bring forth perfect, righteous children. Hence all of us their descendants were born as slaves to sin. From our birth we were imperfect and subject to corruption. We were also born into the wicked world of Satan the Devil, “the god of this system of things.” Consequently we were born subject to his power.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951560/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Gen. 1:26-28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951560/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 2:7, 8</a>.</p><p id="p87" data-pid="87" class="qu">31, 32. (a) What other king has reigned, and why over all of us? (b) Why is life not through the Mosaic law, and so how is it possible?</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" data-rel-pid="[87]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="31"><sup>31</sup></span> Together with these circumstances another merciless king has been ruling over us and we have suffered as his subjects and been burdened down with sorrow and mourning. Who is that king who has filled our lives with such grief and heartaches? It is death, and the countless graves are a bitter testimony to his unrelenting rule. How did death become king over all mankind? It is because our first parents sinned against the great Lawgiver and Life-giver before any of us were born. God had warned the first man Adam that if he disobeyed God and sinned he would die. On the other hand, if Adam continued to obey God he would live on the paradise earth forever and would be the father of an earthful of perfect children. But Adam and his wife sold themselves into sin, and God rightfully sentenced them to death. He told the woman Eve that she would bring forth children with great pain and sorrow. Not perfect children, but imperfect, sinful children, condemned to death from their birth. For we read: “Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951560/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Job 14:4</a>) So we were all subject to the cruel king death from our birth by being born from Adam, and not even the law of Moses proved to be a way of escape from his reign. This explains why everybody is sinful, imperfect, and dies.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" data-rel-pid="[87]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="32"><sup>32</sup></span> Hence we read: “Through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned—. For until the Law sin was in the world, but sin is not charged against anyone when there is no law. Nevertheless, death ruled as king from Adam down to Moses, even over those who had not sinned after the likeness of the transgression by Adam.” But, whereas the law of Moses only showed up all mankind, including the Jews, to be sinners, God’s undeserved kindness came to man’s rescue and provided a way for fallen mankind to gain righteousness, the reward of which is everlasting life in a righteous new world. So we read further: “But where sin abounded, undeserved kindness abounded still more. To what end? That, just as sin ruled as king with death, likewise also undeserved kindness might rule as king through righteousness with everlasting life in view through Jesus Christ our Lord.” Everlasting life in a restored world of righteousness is therefore possible only through Jesus Christ the Son of God. In proof of this fact, the foregoing Scriptural argument goes on to say: “The wages sin pays is death, but the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951560/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12-14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951560/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 20, 21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951560/26/2" data-bid="27-3" class="b"> 6:23</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="ss"><strong>THE COST OF LIBERATION</strong></p><p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="qu">33.

If the law of Moses failed to do it, then no earthly human government can make us righteous by law and give us a clean standing before God. How, then, can we be freed from the condemnation to death which rests upon us because of being born in sin? Only by what God’s undeserved kindness does for us through his Son Jesus Christ. <span id="page461" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="461" data-before-text="461"></span>Only through him can we gain a Jubilee rest from the slavery of sin and death under Satan the Devil.

But olive trees have the remarkable ability to survive the elements. Some are estimated to be 1,000 years old. An olive tree’s expansive root system enables it to rejuvenate itself even when the trunk has been destroyed. As long as the roots remain alive, it will sprout again.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The patriarch Job was convinced that even if he should die, he would live again. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2015288/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 14:13-15</a>) He used a tree​—perhaps an olive tree—​to illustrate his confidence in God’s ability to resurrect him. “There is hope even for a tree,” Job said. “If it is cut down, it will sprout again.” When rainfall breaks a severe drought, a dry olive stump can spring back to life with shoots rising from its roots, producing “branches like a new plant.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2015288/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 14:7-9</a>.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204407/350/0">5/15/2000, pp. 27-28</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>A Luxuriant Olive Tree in the House of God</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">How did Job illustrate his conviction that God would call him forth from the grave? By means of a tree, the description of which makes it likely that he was referring to the olive. “There exists hope for even a tree,” Job said. “If it gets cut down, it will even sprout again.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000365/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Job 14:7</a>) An olive tree may be chopped <span id="page28" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>down, but that will not destroy it. Only if the tree is uprooted will it die. If the roots remain intact, the tree will sprout again with renewed vigor.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Even if a prolonged drought severely withers an old olive tree, the shriveled stump can come back to life. “If its root grows old in the earth and in the dust its stump dies, at the scent of water it will sprout and it will certainly produce a bough like a new plant.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000365/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Job 14:8, 9</a>) Job lived in a dry, dusty land where he had probably observed many an old olive stump that looked dried up and lifeless. When the rains came, however, such a “dead” tree returned to life and a new trunk emerged from its roots as if it were “a new plant.” This remarkable resilience led one Tunisian horticulturist to observe: “You can say that olive trees are immortal.”</p>

<strong>God’s Way Is Love</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[71]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Seeing what God has done in fulfilling his own prophecies in the Scriptures, by sending his only-begotten Son into the world to help man to understand and become acquainted with his Creator, certainly we must say that God <em>is</em> love. From the way Jesus taught us and the way the inspired Holy Scriptures teach us we can realize that God is LOVE. But what a difference there is when it comes to the things that men teach us today about God! In <span id="page623" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="623" data-before-text="623"></span>view of such teachings of men and seeing that God has done so much with our eternal blessing in mind, we are led to ask: If God is love, how could there be a place of eternal torment, called hell, where billions of human creatures in God’s image are said to go after death of the body? There fire and brimstone are said to be burning for eternity and condemned souls are said to remain there without release, in conscious torment. How could there be even such a place as “purgatory”, where souls are said to endure excruciating pains while they await their release to be taken to heaven? Why should it be God’s will that the vast majority of people should live and suffer in such poverty and distress, so that many people say man has his hell right here on earth? How can God’s being love harmonize with such ideas and teachings of men? When the God-fearing people at Berea were taught certain things even by the apostle Paul, they went “daily searching the scriptures, whether these things were so”. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952764/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 17:11</a>, <em>Dy</em>) We can be just as noble as those Bereans were by doing the same thing.</p><p id="p72" data-pid="72" class="qu"> 8, 9. (a) Because of man’s present misery, what question do we ask about his future? (b) How would God have more love for a tree than for man?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[72]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> In their present condition those of mankind are miserable. What man is not sorrowful? He lives a few years and then goes into death. After that, according to certain teachings in this world, if he has not been a good man he must go to eternal torment in the fires of hell. Patient Job, a man who loved and served God, said this: “Man, born of a woman, living for a short time, is filled with many miseries.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952764/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 14:1</a>, <em>Dy</em>) Does it not appear that man has enough trouble on earth without having to go to a place of eternal torment after he dies in order to experience more and worse misery? So we listen with interest to what Job has to say further: “A tree hath hope. If it be cut, it groweth green again, and the boughs thereof sprout. If its root be old in the earth, and its stock be dead in the dust: at the scent of water, it shall spring, and bring forth leaves, as when it was first planted. But man when he shall be dead, and stripped, and consumed, I pray you where is he?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952764/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 14:7-10</a>, <em>Dy</em>) A tree is beautiful; it is God’s creation, but it is not intelligent.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[72]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Man is intelligent, in God’s image, and are we to believe that God loves a tree more than man, that a tree after it is cut down will sprout and grow again, but man—no; even though he has lived in his miseries here, God torments him more after death? None of us like death. We should like to sprout again as a green tree does, and we should like to live in pleasant surroundings, if only we knew how. But after death where is man? Job asked. Did Job believe he was in a burning hell, a fiery purgatory, or even a limbo?</p><p id="p73" data-pid="73" class="qu">10. What did Job pray respecting hell, and why?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[73]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> What did Job know about this subject of “hell”? At the time Job was covered with boils due to a sickness brought upon him by Satan the Devil. He was really a man in misery on earth. So in view of popular teachings about “hell”, is it not strange that Job should say this to God: “Who will grant me this, that thou mayst protect me in hell, and hide me till thy wrath pass, and appoint me a time when thou wilt remember me”? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952764/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 14:13</a>, <em>Dy</em>) Here Job, in his misery, prays to God in heaven to hide him in hell. Can you imagine his wanting to go there if hell is a place of terrible conscious torment? Certainly Job had enough trouble and was not wanting to hop out of a frying pan into a fire. No, he did not. But to avoid this seeming contradiction some have imagined that there must be a part of hell that is blissful and another part for torment. On the contrary, Job prayed as he did because <span id="page624" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="624" data-before-text="624"></span>he knew God’s arrangements and knew what “hell” in the Holy Scriptures means. He knew that sometime in the future God would remember all those that had gone to this Scriptural “hell”, and would give them an opportunity in a new world, “in which justice dwelleth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952764/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:13</a>, <em>Dy</em>) So what is that “hell”?</p>

But olive trees have the remarkable ability to survive the elements. Some are estimated to be 1,000 years old. An olive tree’s expansive root system enables it to rejuvenate itself even when the trunk has been destroyed. As long as the roots remain alive, it will sprout again.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The patriarch Job was convinced that even if he should die, he would live again. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2015288/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 14:13-15</a>) He used a tree​—perhaps an olive tree—​to illustrate his confidence in God’s ability to resurrect him. “There is hope even for a tree,” Job said. “If it is cut down, it will sprout again.” When rainfall breaks a severe drought, a dry olive stump can spring back to life with shoots rising from its roots, producing “branches like a new plant.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2015288/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 14:7-9</a>.</p>

<strong>God’s Way Is Love</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[71]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Seeing what God has done in fulfilling his own prophecies in the Scriptures, by sending his only-begotten Son into the world to help man to understand and become acquainted with his Creator, certainly we must say that God <em>is</em> love. From the way Jesus taught us and the way the inspired Holy Scriptures teach us we can realize that God is LOVE. But what a difference there is when it comes to the things that men teach us today about God! In <span id="page623" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="623" data-before-text="623"></span>view of such teachings of men and seeing that God has done so much with our eternal blessing in mind, we are led to ask: If God is love, how could there be a place of eternal torment, called hell, where billions of human creatures in God’s image are said to go after death of the body? There fire and brimstone are said to be burning for eternity and condemned souls are said to remain there without release, in conscious torment. How could there be even such a place as “purgatory”, where souls are said to endure excruciating pains while they await their release to be taken to heaven? Why should it be God’s will that the vast majority of people should live and suffer in such poverty and distress, so that many people say man has his hell right here on earth? How can God’s being love harmonize with such ideas and teachings of men? When the God-fearing people at Berea were taught certain things even by the apostle Paul, they went “daily searching the scriptures, whether these things were so”. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952764/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 17:11</a>, <em>Dy</em>) We can be just as noble as those Bereans were by doing the same thing.</p><p id="p72" data-pid="72" class="qu"> 8, 9.

What man is not sorrowful? He lives a few years and then goes into death. After that, according to certain teachings in this world, if he has not been a good man he must go to eternal torment in the fires of hell. Patient Job, a man who loved and served God, said this: “Man, born of a woman, living for a short time, is filled with many miseries.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952764/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 14:1</a>, <em>Dy</em>) Does it not appear that man has enough trouble on earth without having to go to a place of eternal torment after he dies in order to experience more and worse misery? So we listen with interest to what Job has to say further: “A tree hath hope. If it be cut, it groweth green again, and the boughs thereof sprout. If its root be old in the earth, and its stock be dead in the dust: at the scent of water, it shall spring, and bring forth leaves, as when it was first planted. But man when he shall be dead, and stripped, and consumed, I pray you where is he?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952764/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 14:7-10</a>, <em>Dy</em>) A tree is beautiful; it is God’s creation, but it is not intelligent.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[72]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Man is intelligent, in God’s image, and are we to believe that God loves a tree more than man, that a tree after it is cut down will sprout and grow again, but man—no; even though he has lived in his miseries here, God torments him more after death? None of us like death. We should like to sprout again as a green tree does, and we should like to live in pleasant surroundings, if only we knew how. But after death where is man? Job asked. Did Job believe he was in a burning hell, a fiery purgatory, or even a limbo?</p><p id="p73" data-pid="73" class="qu">10.

<strong>“Man” in the Hebrew Scriptures</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><span id="page59" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="59" data-before-text="59"></span><strong>“GEBER”</strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">The term <em>geber</em> means one able-bodied, well-developed, physically strong, that is, a mighty one in the case of a man. While it has complimentary implications, the way it is used by the Hebrew Scripture writers keeps man cognizant of his inferior relationship to his Maker, Jehovah God. Thus we find that, when at last Jehovah God called patient Job to account because of his mistaken view of things, God twice addressed Job, not as a mere <em>ish,</em> a mere <em>adám</em> or a mere <em>enósh,</em> but he used the term <em>geber:</em> “Gird up your loins, please, like an able-bodied man, and let me question you, and you inform me,” since you were so sure of yourself as not to justify me! How fitting!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 38:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 40:7</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Pharaoh, when beginning to yield under the impact of the plagues, at first only granted permission for the able-bodied men to go into the wilderness to worship. And when the Israelites finally left Egypt we read that 600,000 able-bodied men, above twenty years old and able to fight, left Egypt together with their little ones.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ex. 10:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 12:37</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Because an able-bodied man is inclined to be “self-assuming,” trusting in his own strength, he is repeatedly singled out for reminders of the folly of such a mental attitude: “Here is the able-bodied man that does not put God as his fortress.” “What able-bodied man is there alive who will not see death?” “An able-bodied man dies and lies vanquished.” Yes, “cursed is the able-bodied man who puts his trust,” not in Jehovah, but in what is, after all, a mere “earthling man [<em>adám</em>].”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Hab. 2:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Ps. 52:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/19/2" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 89:48;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/19/3" data-bid="20-4" class="b"> Job 14:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/19/4" data-bid="20-5" class="b"> Jer. 17:5</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"><em>Geber</em> is frequently used to drive home a point by way of contrast. Thus the psalmist complains: “I have become like an able-bodied man without strength.” It would not have made much of a point had he said he became like a weak mortal, an <em>enósh,</em> because such a one does not have strength to begin with! Making the same point, Solomon observed that it is not good that “an able-bodied man should transgress over a mere piece of bread.” There might be an excuse for an <em>enósh</em> to do so, but certainly not a <em>geber.</em> The bad news he received caused Jeremiah’s bones to shake like “an able-bodied man whom wine has overcome,” hence a violent shaking. He also stressed the wretchedness of the men of Israel by employing this term: “Why is it that I have seen every able-bodied man with his hands upon his loins like a female that is giving birth, and all faces have turned pale?” Yes, this was serious when even able-bodied men, not mere <em>enósh</em> or weak mortals, were affected in this way!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 88:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Prov. 28:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/20/2" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> Jer. 23:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/20/3" data-bid="21-4" class="b"> 30:6</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Logically we are told that “one wise in strength is,” not an <em>adám, ish</em> or <em>enósh,</em> but a <em>geber,</em> “an able-bodied man.” A wise <em>geber</em> trusts not in his own strength but in Jehovah: “Blessed is the able-bodied man who puts his trust in Jehovah, and whose confidence Jehovah has become.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Prov. 24:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Jer. 17:7</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Truly, to note the way “man” is used in the Hebrew Scriptures strengthens our faith and helps us to get God’s view on man.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965607/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Dan. 5:1-4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965607/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 30</a>) They did not go to sleep merely as a drunkard who wakes up the next day; theirs was “an indefinitely lasting sleep” because they were dead.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">They were suffering the effects, not merely of literal wine, but of the symbolic “cup of the wine of rage” of Jehovah God, whom they had defied. The sword of war among them made them stagger like drunkards, and some of them, slain by the sword, would “sleep an indefinitely lasting sleep,” from which no man could awaken them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965607/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Jer. 25:15, 16,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965607/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 26</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Does this mean that none of them will be resurrected so as to be included with “the dead, the great and the small,” whom the apostle John prophetically saw standing before the throne of judgment? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965607/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Rev. 20:12, 13</a>) Apparently not. Belshazzar was the last of that line of kings. He was slain on the night Babylon fell and went into “an indefinitely lasting sleep” from which he has not awakened till now because he was not made drunk with wine, the effects of which can be slept off, but was killed, and so he is apparently included among those who are in Sheol. If that is true of him, it seems reasonable that it would be true of other Babylonians who perished at that time. How long their “indefinitely lasting sleep” will yet last before God’s power rouses them from death under the Messianic kingdom, we do not know. They cannot wake themselves up.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965607/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 14:10-12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965607/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 19-22</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"></p>

This is Job of the land of Uz in the ancient Middle East. Because of the woes mounting upon us today, some of us may get to feeling like Job and wishing that we were dead and buried in Haʹdes, or Sheol. But we should have what Job had, faith in the resurrection. He knew that when this occurred on the “last day,” he would be free from all the present troubles of mankind. If he fell asleep in death and was buried, he would rest till the “heaven” or superhuman forces now controlling mankind had passed. Their passing will allow for the start of a wonderful transformation of earthly conditions here below. Hence, Job prayed to Jehovah God:</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">20.

<strong>Your Loved Ones Can Live Again!</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3">Death causes much grief and sadness. That is why the Bible calls death an enemy. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021230/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:26</a>) In <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1102021230/0">Lesson 27</a>, you learned that Jehovah will defeat that enemy. But what will happen to the people who have <em>already</em> died? In this lesson, you will learn more about another wonderful promise of Jehovah​—he will bring billions of people back to enjoy life forever. He will resurrect them! Can that really happen? Will they be resurrected to live in heaven or on earth?</p><h3 class="du-color--red-500 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>1. What does Jehovah want to do for our loved ones who have died?</strong></h3><p id="p5" data-pid="5">Jehovah longs to bring people who have died back to life. A man of faith named Job was confident that God would not forget him when he died. He said to God: <strong>“You will call, and I will answer you [from the Grave].”</strong>​—Read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021230/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 14:13-15</a>.</p><h3 class="du-color--red-500 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>2. How do we know that the dead can be resurrected?</strong></h3><p id="p7" data-pid="7">When Jesus was on earth, God gave him the power to resurrect people.

Although Lazarus had been dead and buried for four days, Jesus brought him back to life. After praying to God, Jesus simply cried out toward the tomb: “Lazarus, come out!” And <strong>“the man who had been dead came out”</strong>​—alive!

<strong>What Happens After Death?</strong><br/>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">The Grave, simply put, is where humans go when they die; it is a symbolic place or condition where any consciousness or activity ceases. How did the faithful man Job view the Grave? He had lost all his possessions and children in one day, and then he was struck with agonizing boils all over his body. He pleaded with God: “O that in the Grave [“in hell,” Catholic <em>Douay Version</em>] you would conceal me, that you would hide me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2015562/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 1:13-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2015562/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2015562/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 14:13</a>) Clearly, Job did not understand the Grave to be a fiery hell, a place where his suffering would be even worse. Rather, he thought of it as a place of relief.</p>

<strong>The Lie That Made God Cruel</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In the Bible, the Hebrew and Greek words often translated “hell” actually refer to the common grave of mankind. For example, when Job suffered a painful illness, he prayed: “I wish you would hide me in my grave [“in hell,” <em>Douay-Rheims Version</em>].” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013805/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 14:13</a>, <em>Holy Bible​—Easy-to-Read Version</em>) Job wanted to rest, not in a place of torment or alienation from God, but in the grave.</p>

<strong>“You Will Have a Yearning”</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Consider the setting. Job, a man of outstanding faith, undergoes severe trials​—including the loss of his material possessions, the death of all his beloved children, and a painful illness. In the throes of misery, he calls out to God: “O that in Sheol [mankind’s common grave] you would conceal me!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011172/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Verse 13</a>) Job sees Sheol as a welcome relief. There, as if a treasure hidden by God, he will be free of hardship and pain.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2011172/0">a</a></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Will Sheol become Job’s permanent shelter? Job believes otherwise. He continues his prayer: “O that . . . you would set a time limit for me and remember me!” Job confidently hopes that his stay in Sheol will be temporary and that Jehovah will not forget him. Job likens the time that he will spend in Sheol to “compulsory service”​—an enforced period of waiting. For how long? “Until my relief comes,” he says. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011172/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Verse 14</a>) That relief will mean release from Sheol​—in other words, a resurrection from the dead!</p>

The prophet Jonah also appreciated that fact, for, when he was inside the big fish in the Mediterranean Sea he said: “I cried out of my affliction to the Lord, and he heard me: I cried out of the belly of hell [Latin, <em>inferi</em>], and thou hast heard my voice.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973282/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Jonas 2:3</a>, <em>Douay</em>) And then there is the psalmist David, who wrote: “Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell (Latin, <em>infernus</em>]; nor wilt thou give thy holy one to see corruption.”​—Ps. 15:10, <em>Douay.</em></p>

<strong>Part Two</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> In the face of this it is foolish for the clergy of Christendom to argue that those in Sheol or Haʹdes are still alive as immortals and are dead only in the sense of being separated from God. The psalmist David does not agree with those clergymen, for he says to Jehovah God: “Where can I go from your spirit, and where can I run away <span id="page48" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="48" data-before-text="48"></span>from your face? If I should ascend to heaven, there you would be; and if I should spread out my couch in Sheol, look! you would be there.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ps. 139:7, 8</a>) Confirming that fact, King David’s son Solomon said, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:11</a>: “Sheol and the place of destruction are in front of Jehovah.

If they dig down into Sheol, from there my own hand will take them; and if they go up to the heavens, from there I shall bring them down.” Here, because of height, the heavens are contrasted with Sheol because of depth. How could men ever dig into Sheol? Only because Sheol is in the earth where men live and dig graves.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">19.

This fact is emphasized by the deathly sick Job, when he spoke of earth’s Creator in these words: “Those impotent in death keep trembling beneath the waters and those residing in them. Sheol is naked in front of him, and the place of destruction has no covering [from him]. He is stretching out the north over the empty place, hanging the earth upon nothing.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Job 26:5-7</a>) Thus Sheol has no covering with which to hide its dead from God’s eyes, but it lies naked before him.

With good reason, then, Job prayed that his painful and shameful sickness might be terminated soon in death and that he might be laid in Sheol, out of sight from the staring eyes of men. Hence he prayed to Jehovah God:</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> “Man also has to lie down and does not get up [by his own power].

All the days of my compulsory service I shall wait, until my relief comes. You will call, and I myself shall answer you.

It was not a place in which the dead ones were forgotten, abandoned, by God. Instead, the God of Job remembered those in Sheol, and in his own set time he would call forth those in that common grave of mankind, awakening them from their death state as if awakening them from a natural sleep. For that reason the painfully sick Job was willing for God to take his life then and there, to end his terrible sufferings in the flesh, and to lay him away in death in Sheol. Job felt that God was angry with him. So if God let Job be buried out of sight in Sheol, Job could be kept secret until God’s anger had passed away and the time came for God to be favorable to those in Sheol and to resurrect them from death to life under favorable conditions.</p>

That is something man cannot do. There will be a resurrection of the dead, the three Hebrews believed. So to die as martyrs in the fiery furnace meant to them to die and be kept in secret, asleep, for a time indefinite to them, but after that a resurrection. They knew of Job’s hard experience and likely recalled his words: “O that in Sheol [the grave] you would conceal me, that you would keep me secret until your anger turns back, that you would set a time limit for me and remember me!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965003/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 14:13</a>) Job was not afraid to go into the grave or Sheol, because he knew there would be a resurrection from it in God’s promised due time. Jehovah said to Abraham that through him and his seed all nations of the earth would be blessed. How could that be without the resurrection of the peoples of all nations? Abraham, Job and the three Hebrews knew, as do honest students of the Bible today, that the grave is where mankind in general goes and that those there are in an unconscious state. David, in support of this, wrote: “In death there is no mention of you; in Sheol who will laud you?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965003/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 6:5</a>) The psalmist said: “Hear this, all you peoples.

<strong>Is Hell Hot?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">But does not “hell” appear in the Hebrew Scriptures? Yes. So let us do the logical thing and pry into the background of that word “hell.” Webster’s unabridged dictionary tells us that hell corresponds to the Hebrew <em>Sheol</em> and the Greek <em>Hades.</em> It also says that hell comes from the English <span id="page69" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="69" data-before-text="69"></span>word <em>helan,</em> meaning “to conceal.” So we have found that the early meaning of the word “hell” carried no thought of any kind of heat. It merely meant “concealed.” We have found, too, that the original Hebrew word, usually translated “hell” in English Bibles, is <em>Sheol</em>. Now what does <em>Sheol</em> mean? It simply means “a hollow place.” So the original Hebrew word perfectly corresponds with the original or early meaning of the English word “hell.”</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Now that the clergy have put fire into the word “hell,” the vital question is, Did the inspired Hebrew Bible writers say that conscious life and red-hot activity exist in <em>Sheol</em> or hell? No, quite the opposite! Instead of blazing fire it is described as a “land of darkness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955081/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 10:21</a>) Instead of a place of soul-chilling shrieks it is described as a place of “silence.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955081/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 115:17</a>) The Catholic Douay Bible, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955081/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955081/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 10</a>, says: “The living know that they shall die, but the dead know nothing more. Neither have they a reward any more: for the memory of them is forgotten. Whatsoever thy hand is able to do, do it earnestly: for neither work, nor reason, nor wisdom, nor knowledge, shall be in hell [Sheol, <em>AS</em>], whither thou art hastening.” So, since the “dead know nothing more,” or as the <em>King James Version</em> says, “the dead know not any thing,” it would be impossible for them to know conscious torment. And since there is no work in hell, how can there be activity, red-hot or otherwise?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>JACOB, JONAH, JOB AND JESUS</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Now let us examine what Jacob said concerning hell. After hearing that his son had seemingly been killed by a beast, Jacob said: “I will go down to my son into hell [Sheol, <em>AS</em>], mourning.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955081/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 37:35</a>, <em>Dy</em>) Did Jacob visualize his son in a steaming, scorching fire? And did Jacob expect to go to such a place? Clearly, Jacob did not view hell as being red-hot.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">After the prophet Jonah had been swallowed by a big fish, Jonah prayed: “I cried out of the belly of hell [Sheol, <em>AS</em>]: and thou hast heard my voice.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955081/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Jonas 2:3</a>, <em>Dy</em>) Was it red-hot where Jonah was? No, it must have been damp and dark, although warm at fish-body temperature. Jonah spoke the way he did because he understood hell or <em>Sheol</em> to be the grave. For, had not Jehovah delivered him, the fish’s belly would certainly have become Jonah’s grave. If hell were eternal, Jonah would not have gotten out.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Job was a faithful servant of God. Trying to break Job’s integrity, the Devil placed Job in a miserable state of affairs. So the suffering Job prayed to God: “Who will grant me this, that thou mayst protect me in hell [Sheol, <em>AS</em>], and hide me till thy wrath pass, and appoint me a time when thou wilt remember me?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955081/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 14:13</a>, <em>Dy</em>) Since Job was already being tormented by the Devil, would he pray to be “protected” in, of all places, a Devil-managed compartment of red-hot coals? Hardly! Job would not pray to go from the frying pan into the fire! Job understood hell to be the common grave of mankind where he would rest until the resurrection.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The prophet Amos records Jehovah’s words to those who would try to escape the Almighty’s wrath: “Though they go <span id="page70" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="70" data-before-text="70"></span>down even to hell, thence shall my hand bring them out.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955081/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Amos 9:2</a>, <em>Dy</em>) Would the wicked, trying with all their might to flee from the wrath of God, dig into a place that would bring them only red-hot torture?</p>

<strong>God’s Way Is Love</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[71]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Seeing what God has done in fulfilling his own prophecies in the Scriptures, by sending his only-begotten Son into the world to help man to understand and become acquainted with his Creator, certainly we must say that God <em>is</em> love. From the way Jesus taught us and the way the inspired Holy Scriptures teach us we can realize that God is LOVE. But what a difference there is when it comes to the things that men teach us today about God! In <span id="page623" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="623" data-before-text="623"></span>view of such teachings of men and seeing that God has done so much with our eternal blessing in mind, we are led to ask: If God is love, how could there be a place of eternal torment, called hell, where billions of human creatures in God’s image are said to go after death of the body? There fire and brimstone are said to be burning for eternity and condemned souls are said to remain there without release, in conscious torment. How could there be even such a place as “purgatory”, where souls are said to endure excruciating pains while they await their release to be taken to heaven? Why should it be God’s will that the vast majority of people should live and suffer in such poverty and distress, so that many people say man has his hell right here on earth? How can God’s being love harmonize with such ideas and teachings of men? When the God-fearing people at Berea were taught certain things even by the apostle Paul, they went “daily searching the scriptures, whether these things were so”. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952764/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 17:11</a>, <em>Dy</em>) We can be just as noble as those Bereans were by doing the same thing.</p><p id="p72" data-pid="72" class="qu"> 8, 9. (a) Because of man’s present misery, what question do we ask about his future? (b) How would God have more love for a tree than for man?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[72]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> In their present condition those of mankind are miserable. What man is not sorrowful? He lives a few years and then goes into death. After that, according to certain teachings in this world, if he has not been a good man he must go to eternal torment in the fires of hell. Patient Job, a man who loved and served God, said this: “Man, born of a woman, living for a short time, is filled with many miseries.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952764/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 14:1</a>, <em>Dy</em>) Does it not appear that man has enough trouble on earth without having to go to a place of eternal torment after he dies in order to experience more and worse misery? So we listen with interest to what Job has to say further: “A tree hath hope. If it be cut, it groweth green again, and the boughs thereof sprout. If its root be old in the earth, and its stock be dead in the dust: at the scent of water, it shall spring, and bring forth leaves, as when it was first planted. But man when he shall be dead, and stripped, and consumed, I pray you where is he?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952764/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 14:7-10</a>, <em>Dy</em>) A tree is beautiful; it is God’s creation, but it is not intelligent.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[72]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Man is intelligent, in God’s image, and are we to believe that God loves a tree more than man, that a tree after it is cut down will sprout and grow again, but man—no; even though he has lived in his miseries here, God torments him more after death? None of us like death. We should like to sprout again as a green tree does, and we should like to live in pleasant surroundings, if only we knew how. But after death where is man? Job asked. Did Job believe he was in a burning hell, a fiery purgatory, or even a limbo?</p><p id="p73" data-pid="73" class="qu">10. What did Job pray respecting hell, and why?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[73]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> What did Job know about this subject of “hell”? At the time Job was covered with boils due to a sickness brought upon him by Satan the Devil. He was really a man in misery on earth. So in view of popular teachings about “hell”, is it not strange that Job should say this to God: “Who will grant me this, that thou mayst protect me in hell, and hide me till thy wrath pass, and appoint me a time when thou wilt remember me”? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952764/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 14:13</a>, <em>Dy</em>) Here Job, in his misery, prays to God in heaven to hide him in hell. Can you imagine his wanting to go there if hell is a place of terrible conscious torment? Certainly Job had enough trouble and was not wanting to hop out of a frying pan into a fire. No, he did not. But to avoid this seeming contradiction some have imagined that there must be a part of hell that is blissful and another part for torment. On the contrary, Job prayed as he did because <span id="page624" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="624" data-before-text="624"></span>he knew God’s arrangements and knew what “hell” in the Holy Scriptures means. He knew that sometime in the future God would remember all those that had gone to this Scriptural “hell”, and would give them an opportunity in a new world, “in which justice dwelleth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952764/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:13</a>, <em>Dy</em>) So what is that “hell”?</p>

<strong>A Look at Martin Luther</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The Hebrew and Greek words, <em>sheol</em> and <em>hades,</em> that have been translated as hell in some versions of the Bible mean the common grave of mankind. For example, faithful Job says, according to the Catholic <em>Douay Version:</em> “Who will grant me this, that thou mayst protect me in hell, and hide me until thy wrath pass, and appoint me a time when thou wilt remember me?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101972164/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 14:13</a>) Obviously, Job is speaking about being hidden, not in a place of torment, but in the grave until the resurrection. There are Bible versions that use the word “grave” here instead of “hell.” Despite this Scriptural truth, Lutherans to this day hold to the Catholic doctrine of eternal torment in hell.</p>

The Bible shows that people in “the Grave” are in a state of nonexistence.</p><ul><li><p id="p14" data-pid="14"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>  <strong>The dead are unconscious and so cannot feel pain.</strong> “Neither work, nor reason, nor wisdom, nor knowledge, shall be in hell.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502013345/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:10</a>, <em>Douay-Rheims Version</em>) Hell is not filled with sounds of pain. Instead, the Bible says: “Let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave [hell, <em>Douay-Rheims</em>].”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502013345/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 31:17</a>; <em>King James Version</em> (30:18, <em>Douay-Rheims</em>); <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502013345/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 115:17</a>.</p></li><li><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>  <strong>God has set death, not torment in a fiery hell, as the penalty for sin.</strong> God told the first man, Adam, that the penalty for breaking God’s law would be <strong>death</strong>.

If God were actually sending Adam to a fiery hell, He surely would have mentioned it. God has not changed the punishment for defying his laws. Long after Adam sinned, God inspired a Bible writer to say: “The wages sin pays is <strong>death.</strong>” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502013345/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Romans 6:23</a>) No further penalty is justified, because “the one who has died has been acquitted from his sin.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502013345/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Romans 6:7</a>.</p></li><li><p id="p16" data-pid="16"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>  <strong>The idea of eternal torment is repugnant to God.</strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502013345/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Jeremiah 32:35</a>) Such an idea is contrary to the Bible’s teaching that “God is love.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502013345/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 John 4:8</a>) He wants us to worship him out of love, not fear of eternal torment.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502013345/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 22:36-38</a>.</p></li><li><p id="p17" data-pid="17"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>  <strong>Good people went to hell.</strong> The Bibles that use the word “hell” indicate that faithful men, such as Jacob and Job, expected to go to hell.

<h2><strong>The history of hellfire</strong></h2><p id="p64" data-pid="64"><strong>Pagan origin:</strong> The ancient Egyptians believed in a fiery hell. The funerary text <em>Book Ȧm-Ṭuat</em> (Amduat), which historians date back to the 16th century B.C.E., describes those who “shall be cast down headlong into the pits of fire; and . . . shall not be able to flee from the flames.”—<em>The Egyptian Heaven and Hell.</em></p><p id="p65" data-pid="65"><strong>Not taught by the earliest Christians:</strong> “It is noteworthy that in the N[ew] T[estament] we do not find hell fire to be a part of the [early Christian] preaching.”—<em>A Dictionary of Christian Theology</em>.</p><p id="p66" data-pid="66"><strong>Greek philosophy crept in:</strong> “From the middle of the 2nd century [C.E.] Christians who had some training in Greek philosophy began to feel the need to express their faith in its terms . . . The philosophy that suited them best was Platonism [the teachings of Plato].” (<em>Encyclopædia Britannica</em>) That philosophy included belief in fiery torment after death. “Of all classical Greek philosophers, the one who has had the greatest influence on traditional views of Hell is Plato.”—<em>Histoire des enfers</em> (<em>The History of Hell</em>).</p><p id="p67" data-pid="67"><strong>Hellfire was used to justify torture:</strong> During the time period commonly referred to as the Spanish Inquisition, those convicted of heresy and burned at the stake were said to be given “a taste of what perpetual hellfire would be like,” supposedly in hopes that they would repent before dying. (<em>The Spanish Inquisition,</em> by Jean Plaidy) Similarly, Queen Mary I of England burned some 300 Protestants at the stake, reportedly believing that “as the souls of heretics are afterwards to be eternally burning in hell, there could be nothing more proper than to imitate the divine vengeance, by burning them on earth.”—<em>Universal History,</em> by Alexander Tytler.</p><p id="p68" data-pid="68"><strong>Modern changes:</strong> Some denominations have softened their teaching about hell, apparently based more on a desire to please their members than to reject a false teaching. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502013345/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">2 Timothy 4:3</a>) “People want a God who’s warm and fuzzy . . . It’s counter to the culture of today to talk about sin and guilt.”—Professor Jackson W. Carroll.</p>

<strong>Your Loved Ones Can Live Again!</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3">Death causes much grief and sadness. That is why the Bible calls death an enemy. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021230/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:26</a>) In <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1102021230/0">Lesson 27</a>, you learned that Jehovah will defeat that enemy. But what will happen to the people who have <em>already</em> died? In this lesson, you will learn more about another wonderful promise of Jehovah​—he will bring billions of people back to enjoy life forever. He will resurrect them! Can that really happen? Will they be resurrected to live in heaven or on earth?</p><h3 class="du-color--red-500 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>1. What does Jehovah want to do for our loved ones who have died?</strong></h3><p id="p5" data-pid="5">Jehovah longs to bring people who have died back to life. A man of faith named Job was confident that God would not forget him when he died. He said to God: <strong>“You will call, and I will answer you [from the Grave].”</strong>​—Read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021230/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 14:13-15</a>.</p><h3 class="du-color--red-500 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>2. How do we know that the dead can be resurrected?</strong></h3><p id="p7" data-pid="7">When Jesus was on earth, God gave him the power to resurrect people. Jesus raised a 12-year-old girl and a widow’s son back to life.

Although Lazarus had been dead and buried for four days, Jesus brought him back to life. After praying to God, Jesus simply cried out toward the tomb: “Lazarus, come out!” And <strong>“the man who had been dead came out”</strong>​—alive!

<strong>Compulsory Service</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Hebrew word <em>tsa·vaʼʹ,</em> which often applies to military service or service in war, also means “compulsory labor,” that is, to pay off debt or guilt. Thus Jerusalem was to be told that her “military service” had been fulfilled and her error had been paid off.

<strong>“You Will Have a Yearning”</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Will Sheol become Job’s permanent shelter? Job believes otherwise. He continues his prayer: “O that . . . you would set a time limit for me and remember me!” Job confidently hopes that his stay in Sheol will be temporary and that Jehovah will not forget him. Job likens the time that he will spend in Sheol to “compulsory service”​—an enforced period of waiting. For how long? “Until my relief comes,” he says. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011172/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Verse 14</a>) That relief will mean release from Sheol​—in other words, a resurrection from the dead!</p>

It was not a place in which the dead ones were forgotten, abandoned, by God. Instead, the God of Job remembered those in Sheol, and in his own set time he would call forth those in that common grave of mankind, awakening them from their death state as if awakening them from a natural sleep. For that reason the painfully sick Job was willing for God to take his life then and there, to end his terrible sufferings in the flesh, and to lay him away in death in Sheol. Job felt that God was angry with him. So if God let Job be buried out of sight in Sheol, Job could be kept secret until God’s anger had passed away and the time came for God to be favorable to those in Sheol and to resurrect them from death to life under favorable conditions.</p>

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page325" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="325" data-before-text="325"></span><strong>Will the Dead Live Again?</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">Millions have asked this question. Here is the Bible’s authoritative answer.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">RECENTLY, under the caption “In Memoriam,” these words appeared in a prominent newspaper: “Brody—Iris (Mother Daughter) 1st anniversary. In loving everlasting memory. Dad, Mom and Michael.” Below it a similar notice read: “Donnelly—Adeline Moclair. In loving and cherished memory of a wonderful wife and mother whose presence we miss more each day.”</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Such heartfelt expressions demonstrate a common experience of the living—we miss our dead. Their absence is a real loss. As is true of any great loss, we wonder if there is any possibility of recovering it. Sometimes we believe the loss could have been prevented had a loved one received timely or better treatment. That was the belief of the woman Martha, who poured out her grief to Jesus: “Lord, if you had been here my brother would not have died.” When Jehovah God’s Son replied: “Your brother will rise,” Martha responded: “I know he will rise in the resurrection on the last day.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962401/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 11:21,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962401/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 23, 24</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">How did this woman know this? Was she the victim of a delusion or a pet superstition? Was the wish perhaps father to the belief? Not at all. Martha had faith in Jehovah, the miracle-working God, the true Creator of life. Undoubtedly ever since her childhood Martha had known the inspired Bible report of the first man and woman’s creation. Martha knew that her God had formed Adam from dust. By blowing into Adam’s nostrils the breath of life the man came to be a living soul. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962401/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 2:7</a>) It was not hard for Martha to believe that such a God could raise the dead, even after they had again become dust.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In fact, in the sacred history of her ancestors Martha could have learned a number of faith-inspiring things about the resurrection. There was the ancient Bible account of the patriarch Abraham, for example. In proof of his faith that Jehovah could raise the dead, Abraham was willing to obey God’s command to sacrifice Isaac, his son. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962401/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb. 11:17-19</a>) From the ancient book of Job Martha probably remembered that integrity keeper’s statement: “If an able-bodied man dies can he live again? All the days of my compulsory service I shall wait, until my relief comes. You will call, and I myself shall answer you. For the work of your hands you will have a yearning.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962401/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 14:14, 15</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Martha’s conviction that the dead would live again very likely drew support from the sacred historical report about a resurrection in the city of Zarephath. There a widow’s son had died during a visit of Elijah the prophet. When Elijah earnestly petitioned Jehovah to let life return into the dead boy, God listened and acted—the dead child lived again. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962401/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Ki. 17:17-23</a>) Also recorded in the sacred writings of Martha’s people was God’s promise to the beloved prophet Daniel: “You will rest, but you will stand up for your lot at the end of the days.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962401/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Dan. 12:13</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>FURTHER ASSURANCE</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The coming of Jesus, the long-awaited Messiah, brought further assurance that the dead will live again. One day, before Martha’s brother Lazarus took sick and died, Jesus provided new information on the resurrection hope, saying: “For just as <span id="page326" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="326" data-before-text="326"></span>the Father raises the dead up and makes them alive, so the Son also makes those alive whom he wants to. Most truly I say to you, The hour is coming, and it is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who have given heed will live. Do not marvel at this, because the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life, those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962401/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 5:21,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962401/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 25,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962401/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 28, 29</a>) Later on, Jesus again brought up the subject, saying: “This is the will of him that sent me, that I should lose nothing out of all that he has given me but that I should resurrect it at the last day. For this is the will of my Father, that everyone that beholds the Son and exercises faith in him should have everlasting life, and I will resurrect him at the last day.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962401/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 6:39, 40</a>.</p>

<strong>Hope for the Soul</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">In the minds of nations rejecting Jehovah God and his Son Christ Jesus that question has led to the doctrine of soul immortality. Not so, however, in the minds of those who penned the foregoing inspired <span id="page360" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="360" data-before-text="360"></span>Bible descriptions of a mortal soul. You may be sure that they had a hope. Rest assured that the God who gave his first perfect human creation the hope of living forever if obedient did not leave these faithful, if dying, Bible writers without hope.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Paul the apostle reviews some of their faithful life histories in his letter to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957441/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">the Hebrews, chapter eleven</a>. With eloquence he records their triumphs of faith, triumphs over sword, fire, beasts, opposing kingdoms, yes, and their own weaknesses. Why did they endure all this so faithfully? “In order that they might attain a better resurrection.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957441/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Heb. 11:32-35</a> <em>NW</em>) Not immortality, but resurrection is our hope!</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Resurrect a soul that has disintegrated? How? What is there to resurrect? What trace remains of faithful men now dead for centuries? The one factor in the universe that allows resurrection is memory, the greatest memory in the universe, God’s memory. “The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957441/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Prov. 10:7</a>) The willfully wicked may be gone forever, gone and forgotten, but, because of Jehovah’s powerful memory, faithful men like Abraham, Isaac and Jacob “are all living from his standpoint.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957441/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Luke 20:38</a>, <em>NW</em>) True, as living souls they have long since passed out of existence; they “are not,” but Jehovah is the God “who makes the dead alive and calls the things that are not as though they were.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957441/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Rom. 4:17</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Faithful life patterns are preserved indelibly, in all their intricate detail, in the mind of the One who is able to have a personal acquaintance with each and every one of seemingly innumerable stars: “He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957441/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 147:4</a>) Laid away in their tombs, wherever they may be, the faithful are encompassed by God’s illimitable memory. Moreover, “the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957441/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29</a>, <em>NW</em>) He whose matchless power created or constituted the first human souls can reconstitute faithful human souls back to life again, can re-stand them again to life. That is the meaning of resurrection.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">That is the true object of man’s desire, the accomplished end of his long search for continued existence, the answer to his question, voiced by faithful Job: “If a man die, shall he live again?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957441/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Job 14:14</a>) “Yes,” answers the Bible, “if his faithfulness preserves him in God’s memory.” To some people in these troubled last days of this old world even greater blessings may come, the privilege of surviving this world’s end and never dying, even as “a few people, that is, eight souls, were carried safely through the water” when the flood of Noah’s day descended. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957441/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:20</a>, <em>NW</em>) May your reasonings, longings, searchings, set your faith and hope, not on false pagan immortality promises, but on the God-given promise you have seen through the eyes of his Word.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Your Loved Ones Can Live Again!</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3">Death causes much grief and sadness. That is why the Bible calls death an enemy.

In this lesson, you will learn more about another wonderful promise of Jehovah​—he will bring billions of people back to enjoy life forever. He will resurrect them! Can that really happen? Will they be resurrected to live in heaven or on earth?</p><h3 class="du-color--red-500 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>1. What does Jehovah want to do for our loved ones who have died?</strong></h3><p id="p5" data-pid="5">Jehovah longs to bring people who have died back to life. A man of faith named Job was confident that God would not forget him when he died. He said to God: <strong>“You will call, and I will answer you [from the Grave].”</strong>​—Read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021230/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 14:13-15</a>.</p><h3 class="du-color--red-500 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>2.

Although Lazarus had been dead and buried for four days, Jesus brought him back to life.

<strong>Can a Cut-Down Tree Sprout Again?</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The patriarch Job was convinced that even if he should die, he would live again. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2015288/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 14:13-15</a>) He used a tree​—perhaps an olive tree—​to illustrate his confidence in God’s ability to resurrect him. “There is hope even for a tree,” Job said. “If it is cut down, it will sprout again.” When rainfall breaks a severe drought, a dry olive stump can spring back to life with shoots rising from its roots, producing “branches like a new plant.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2015288/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 14:7-9</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Just as a cultivator longs to see the roots of a cut-down olive tree spring up again, Jehovah God longs to restore his deceased servants and many others to life. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2015288/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 22:31, 32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2015288/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> John 5:28, 29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2015288/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Acts 24:15</a>) What a joy it will be to welcome back the dead and see them enjoy productive lives once again!</p>

<strong>Death Does Not End It All!</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Addressing Almighty God, Job answered his own question, saying: “You will call, and I will answer you. You will long for the work of your hands.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2014004/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 14:15</a>) Job felt sure that Jehovah longed for the day when He would resurrect His faithful servant. Was that mere wishful thinking on Job’s part? Not at all.</p>

<strong>“You Will Have a Yearning”</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Why is Job convinced that his relief will come? Because he knows how our loving Creator feels about His faithful worshippers who have died. Says Job: “You will call, and I myself shall answer you. For the work of your hands you will have a yearning.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011172/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Verse 15</a>) Job acknowledges that he is the work of God’s hands. The Life-Giver who was responsible for Job’s formation in the womb can certainly restore him to life after he has died.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011172/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 10:8, 9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011172/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 31:15</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Job’s words teach us a tender lesson about Jehovah: He has special attachment to those who, like Job, place themselves in his hands, allowing him to mold and shape them into people who are desirable in his eyes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011172/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 64:8</a>) Jehovah treasures his faithful worshippers. For loyal ones who have died, he has “a yearning.” The Hebrew word thus rendered is “unquestionably one of the strongest words to express the emotion of longing desires,” says one scholar. Yes, not only does Jehovah remember his worshippers but he also longs to restore them to life.</p>

For instance, consider these inspired words of the faithful man Job: “If an able-bodied man dies can he live again? All the days of my compulsory service I shall wait, until my relief comes. You will call, and I myself shall answer you. For the work of your hands you will have a yearning.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007367/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 14:14, 15</a>) What do those words mean?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Job knew that after he died, a time of waiting in the sleep of death lay ahead of him. He viewed that time as “compulsory service,” an enforced period of waiting for release. To him, that release was a certainty. Job realized that his relief would come. Why? Because he knew of Jehovah’s feelings. Jehovah would “have a yearning” to see his faithful servant again. Yes, God longs to bring back to life all righteous individuals. Jehovah will also give others an opportunity to live forever in Paradise on earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007367/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 23:43;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007367/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> John 5:28, 29</a>) Since it is God’s will to carry out that purpose, who can stop him?</p>

He suffered greatly at Satan’s hands. Unlike his false companions, who never mentioned the resurrection, Job drew comfort from this hope and asked: “If an able-bodied man dies can he live again?” In answer Job himself declared: “All the days of my compulsory service I shall wait, until my relief comes.” Addressing his God, Jehovah, he acknowledged: “You will call, and I myself shall answer you.” Concerning the feelings of our loving Creator, Job noted: “For the work of your hands you will have a yearning.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005322/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Job 14:14, 15</a>) Yes, Jehovah eagerly anticipates the time when faithful ones return to life in the resurrection.

But Almighty God surely has the power to perform such a miracle! The real issue is whether Jehovah is <em>disposed</em> to bring the dead back to life. The righteous man Job asked: “If an able-bodied man dies can he live again?” Then, he gave this reassuring answer: “You will call, and I myself shall answer you.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997122/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Job 14:7-14</a>) Faithful Job said: “You [Jehovah] will call, and I myself shall answer you.

For the work of your hands you will have a yearning.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995361/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 14:14, 15</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">In other words, although Job would pass into nonexistence, God would not forget him. Job had faith that the time would come when Jehovah God would “call” him back to life by means of a resurrection.</p>

<strong>Does the Soul Survive Death?</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">After Job asked the question, “Can [man] live again?” he went on to give the inspired answer. He said: “You [Jehovah] will call, and I myself shall answer you. For the work of your hands you will have a yearning.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1990641/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Job 14:14, 15</a>) Yes, the Bible holds out the hope of a resurrection for all those in God’s memory. He yearns to restore faithful servants of his, like Job, to life! Christ Jesus confirmed the reality of this hope, saying: “Do not marvel at this, because the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life, those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1990641/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29</a>.</p>

<strong>Millions Now Dead Will Live Again</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Since Jesus is ‘the exact representation of Jehovah God’s very being,’ we rightly expect no less of our heavenly Father.

You will call, and I myself shall answer you. For the work of your hands you will have a <em>yearning.”</em> Yes, Jehovah God has a yearning for those in Sheol or Hades, in particular for those who, like Job, proved their integrity to him under severe trials.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975085/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Job 14:14, 15</a>.</p>

<strong>Part Two</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> In the face of this it is foolish for the clergy of Christendom to argue that those in Sheol or Haʹdes are still alive as immortals and are dead only in the sense of being separated from God. The psalmist David does not agree with those clergymen, for he says to Jehovah God: “Where can I go from your spirit, and where can I run away <span id="page48" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="48" data-before-text="48"></span>from your face? If I should ascend to heaven, there you would be; and if I should spread out my couch in Sheol, look! you would be there.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ps. 139:7, 8</a>) Confirming that fact, King David’s son Solomon said, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:11</a>: “Sheol and the place of destruction are in front of Jehovah. How much more so the hearts of the sons of mankind!” Just as Jehovah knows what is in the hearts of men, so he knows who are in Sheol.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">18.

If they dig down into Sheol, from there my own hand will take them; and if they go up to the heavens, from there I shall bring them down.” Here, because of height, the heavens are contrasted with Sheol because of depth. How could men ever dig into Sheol? Only because Sheol is in the earth where men live and dig graves.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">19. What does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/63/0" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Job 26:5-7</a> show regarding God’s knowledge of Sheol?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> Those in Sheol or Haʹdes are not beyond the knowledge and power of Jehovah. This fact is emphasized by the deathly sick Job, when he spoke of earth’s Creator in these words: “Those impotent in death keep trembling beneath the waters and those residing in them. Sheol is naked in front of him, and the place of destruction has no covering [from him]. He is stretching out the north over the empty place, hanging the earth upon nothing.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Job 26:5-7</a>) Thus Sheol has no covering with which to hide its dead from God’s eyes, but it lies naked before him. He knows who are there.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">20, 21. Because of what facts about those in Sheol did Job pray, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Job 14:12-15</a>, for God to hide him there?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> Away back there in the sixteenth century before our Common Era patient Job knew that those dead in Sheol are really dead; they feel no pain, even as they experience no pleasure, and are not conscious of anything at all. With good reason, then, Job prayed that his painful and shameful sickness might be terminated soon in death and that he might be laid in Sheol, out of sight from the staring eyes of men. Hence he prayed to Jehovah God:</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> “Man also has to lie down and does not get up [by his own power]. Until heaven is no more they will not wake up, nor will they be aroused from their sleep. O that in Sheol you would conceal me, that you would keep me secret until your anger turns back, that you would set a time limit for me and remember me! If an able-bodied man dies can he live again? All the days of my compulsory service I shall wait, until my relief comes. You will call, and I myself shall answer you. For the work of your hands you will have a yearning.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Job 14:12-15</a>.</p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">22. By his words in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/65/0" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Job 14:12-15</a>, how did Job show he did not believe Sheol to be a “land of no return”?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> Judged by these words, Sheol (Haʹdes, <em>LXX</em>) was not a “land of no return” to Job. It was not a place in which the dead ones were forgotten, abandoned, by God. Instead, the God of Job remembered those in Sheol, and in his own set time he would call forth those in that common grave of mankind, awakening them from their death state as if awakening them from a natural sleep. For that reason the painfully sick Job was willing for God to take his life then and there, to end his terrible sufferings in the flesh, and to lay him away in death in Sheol. Job felt that God was angry with him. So if God let Job be buried out of sight in Sheol, Job could be kept secret until God’s anger had passed away and the time came for God to be favorable to those in Sheol and to resurrect them from death to life under favorable conditions.</p>

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page325" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="325" data-before-text="325"></span><strong>Will the Dead Live Again?</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">Millions have asked this question. Here is the Bible’s authoritative answer.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">RECENTLY, under the caption “In Memoriam,” these words appeared in a prominent newspaper: “Brody—Iris (Mother Daughter) 1st anniversary. In loving everlasting memory. Dad, Mom and Michael.” Below it a similar notice read: “Donnelly—Adeline Moclair. In loving and cherished memory of a wonderful wife and mother whose presence we miss more each day.”</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Such heartfelt expressions demonstrate a common experience of the living—we miss our dead. Their absence is a real loss. As is true of any great loss, we wonder if there is any possibility of recovering it. Sometimes we believe the loss could have been prevented had a loved one received timely or better treatment. That was the belief of the woman Martha, who poured out her grief to Jesus: “Lord, if you had been here my brother would not have died.” When Jehovah God’s Son replied: “Your brother will rise,” Martha responded: “I know he will rise in the resurrection on the last day.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962401/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 11:21,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962401/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 23, 24</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">How did this woman know this? Was she the victim of a delusion or a pet superstition? Was the wish perhaps father to the belief? Not at all. Martha had faith in Jehovah, the miracle-working God, the true Creator of life. Undoubtedly ever since her childhood Martha had known the inspired Bible report of the first man and woman’s creation. Martha knew that her God had formed Adam from dust. By blowing into Adam’s nostrils the breath of life the man came to be a living soul. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962401/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 2:7</a>) It was not hard for Martha to believe that such a God could raise the dead, even after they had again become dust.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In fact, in the sacred history of her ancestors Martha could have learned a number of faith-inspiring things about the resurrection. There was the ancient Bible account of the patriarch Abraham, for example. In proof of his faith that Jehovah could raise the dead, Abraham was willing to obey God’s command to sacrifice Isaac, his son. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962401/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb. 11:17-19</a>) From the ancient book of Job Martha probably remembered that integrity keeper’s statement: “If an able-bodied man dies can he live again? All the days of my compulsory service I shall wait, until my relief comes. You will call, and I myself shall answer you. For the work of your hands you will have a yearning.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962401/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 14:14, 15</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Martha’s conviction that the dead would live again very likely drew support from the sacred historical report about a resurrection in the city of Zarephath. There a widow’s son had died during a visit of Elijah the prophet. When Elijah earnestly petitioned Jehovah to let life return into the dead boy, God listened and acted—the dead child lived again. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962401/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Ki. 17:17-23</a>) Also recorded in the sacred writings of Martha’s people was God’s promise to the beloved prophet Daniel: “You will rest, but you will stand up for your lot at the end of the days.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962401/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Dan. 12:13</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>FURTHER ASSURANCE</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The coming of Jesus, the long-awaited Messiah, brought further assurance that the dead will live again. One day, before Martha’s brother Lazarus took sick and died, Jesus provided new information on the resurrection hope, saying: “For just as <span id="page326" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="326" data-before-text="326"></span>the Father raises the dead up and makes them alive, so the Son also makes those alive whom he wants to. Most truly I say to you, The hour is coming, and it is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who have given heed will live. Do not marvel at this, because the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life, those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962401/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 5:21,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962401/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 25,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962401/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 28, 29</a>) Later on, Jesus again brought up the subject, saying: “This is the will of him that sent me, that I should lose nothing out of all that he has given me but that I should resurrect it at the last day. For this is the will of my Father, that everyone that beholds the Son and exercises faith in him should have everlasting life, and I will resurrect him at the last day.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962401/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 6:39, 40</a>.</p>

<strong>A Marvelous Hope</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Since Jehovah God gave life to the first human pair, Adam and Eve, it logically follows that he can also restore to life those who are now sleeping in death. This is what the ancient patriarch Job believed. On account of the intense suffering he was enduring, he directed these words to God: “O that in Sheol [gravedom] you would conceal me, . . . that you would set a time limit for me and remember me! . . . You will call, and I myself shall answer you. For the work of your hands you will have a yearning.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101975762/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 14:13-15</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong><em>Basis for Hope</em></strong></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">By reason of God’s creating Adam and Eve and endowing them with the ability to procreate, humans are the ‘work of God’s hands.’ As descendants of sinner Adam, they are imperfect and subject to death. Yet God does not want to see the human family as a whole reduced to the lifeless dust from which he created the first man Adam. He yearns or longs for the day that he has determined upon for restoring billions of dead humans to life.</p>

<strong>Bag</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Syrian army officer Naaman gave greedy Gehazi “two talents of silver in two bags [Heb., <em>hhari·timʹ</em>], with two changes of garments, and gave them to two of his attendants, that they might carry them.” Since a talent was equal to about 91.5 pounds (troy) or about 34.2 kilograms, it is evident that such container (<em>hha·rit</em>ʹ) must have been of ample size <span id="page181" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="181" data-before-text="181"></span>and strength to hold a talent plus a change of garment, and, hence, when filled, was about as much as one man could carry.

Judging from these later types, they were likely made of woven cotton or flexible rushes, or of leather. These bags were used by traders or merchants for carrying weights required in business transactions where products, grains or precious metals had to be weighed out.

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204407/405/0">12/1/1961, pp. 718-720</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>United Against Nations in the Valley of Decision</strong><br/><p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[96]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"><sup>27</sup></span> What do these symbolic locusts look like? John says: “And the likenesses of the locusts resembled horses prepared for battle; and upon their heads were what seemed to be crowns like gold, and their faces were as men’s faces, but they had hair as women’s hair. And their teeth were as those of lions; and they had breastplates like iron breastplates. And the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running into battle. Also, they have tails and stings like scorpions; and in their tails is their authority to hurt the men five months.” From this description we note that the remnant of Jehovah’s anointed witnesses were brought forth in 1919 for warfare, a spiritual warfare from that year till the actual outbreak of the “war of the great day of God the Almighty,” commonly called Armageddon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Rev. 16:14-16</a>) Hence they looked like horses, which in Bible times were used for warfare. “The horse <span id="page719" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="719" data-before-text="719"></span>is something prepared for the day of battle,” says <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Proverbs 21:31</a>.</p><p id="p97" data-pid="97" class="qu">28. What is denoted by the crowns on the locusts’ heads, their having hair like women, and their having breastplates like iron ones?</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[97]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="28"><sup>28</sup></span> The symbolic locusts are royal warriors, as denoted by the goldlike crowns upon the locusts’ heads; for by being anointed with God’s spirit they have been made “joint heirs with Christ” and have been assigned a crown and throne in Christ’s kingdom of a thousand years. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Rom. 8:16, 17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Luke 22:28-30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/29/2" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> Rev. 3:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/29/3" data-bid="30-4" class="b"> 21</a>) During this time of spiritual warfare with Christendom these symbolic locusts are mere humans gifted with intelligence, as denoted by their “men’s faces.” Like Hebrew warriors in the field who did not have barbershop facilities, they let their head of hair grow to the length of women’s hair, so that they had a hairy mane and looked like lions for fierceness. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 Chron. 12:8</a>) Appropriately, then, “their teeth were as those of lions,” that could devour solid food, flesh, like the strong judgment message of God’s vengeance against Christendom. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Heb. 5:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/31/1" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 3:1, 2</a>) Their hearts, the organs of love for God and for his righteousness, hence hearts that know no fear but are courageous, are well protected as if by impenetrable breastplates of iron. So they never lose love and courage.</p><p id="p98" data-pid="98" class="qu">29. How do the symbolic locusts make a terrific noise, and for how long are they authorized to torment men not having the seal?</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[98]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="29"><sup>29</sup></span> Like a huge swarm of winged locusts that are capable of flying for a thousand miles or more, they unitedly make a noise that sounds like a squadron of war chariots rattling along to the beat of many horses’ hoofs into the battle. It is a terrific sound. The symbolic locusts shout as from the house-tops and let God’s judgment message be heard over a vast distance in the territory that they cover. Fear of the enemy does not soften down their message to a mere whisper. Jehovah’s war declaration must be sounded loudly. He is responsible for the hurting of feelings that the message causes to the ones who are stung by it. For the brief time interval till Armageddon breaks out, “five months,” as it were, the symbolic locusts must use their scorpion-like tails, God’s Word, “the sword of the spirit,” and must strike men against whom God’s judgment is directed. It is not God’s time to spare feelings. His enemies have to be exposed and notified of coming judgment.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Eph. 6:17</a>.</p><p id="p99" data-pid="99" class="qu">30. Who is king over the symbolic locusts, and what do his names in Hebrew and Greek mean and show?</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[99]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"><sup>30</sup></span> The symbolic locusts must follow their King, Jesus Christ. John says of them: “They have over them a king, the angel of the abyss. In Hebrew his name is Abadʹdon, but in Greek he has the name Apollyon.” The resurrected heavenly Jesus Christ is the “angel of the abyss,” for he holds the “keys of death and of Haʹdes.” In the finale of the universal war of Armageddon he will bind and pitch Satan the Devil and his spirit demons into the abyss of deathlike inactivity. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Rev. 20:1-3</a>) When Jesus was on earth as a man, he was a Hebrew, and now in his capacity as Jehovah’s royal Executioner he is called by the Hebrew name Abadʹdon, which means Destruction. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Job 26:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 28:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/34/2" data-bid="35-3" class="b"> 31:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/34/3" data-bid="35-4" class="b"> 12:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/34/4" data-bid="35-5" class="b"> 14:19</a>) In the Greek in which the inspired Christian Scriptures were written his similar title is Apollyon, which means Destroyer. This name clearly shows that he comes to the throne at God’s right hand to rule first in the midst of his enemies and to destroy them in execution of Jehovah’s righteous judgment, Jehovah’s judicial decision against them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Jas. 4:12</a>.</p><p id="p100" data-pid="100" class="qu">31. (a) How, like locusts, do the Witnesses move forward, and of what quality is this indicative? (b) What keeps them united?</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[100]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="31"><sup>31</sup></span> The symbolic locusts who must proclaim the judgment message before the judgment is executed in the “low plain of the decision” have Jesus Christ as their King, but he is invisible. They have no <span id="page720" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="720" data-before-text="720"></span>visible king any more than literal locusts have: “The locusts have no king, and yet they go forth all of them divided into groups.” For the reason that they move forward in groups or swarms, they are “instinctively wise,” although being among the “smallest” things on earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Prov. 30:24,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/36/1" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 27</a>) The symbolic locusts, the anointed witnesses of Jehovah, move forward united, grouped according to their local congregations. But this is not due to any locust instinct. It is due to the heavenly wisdom imparted by God’s spirit. Also, their following their heavenly King Jesus Christ as the Leader whom God had enthroned is what keeps them united in their attack upon the men not sealed. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Rev. 7:2-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/37/1" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> 9:4</a>) Willingly, obediently, they subject themselves to his command; and this is what may also be pictured by the fact that the symbolic locusts “had hair as women’s hair,” since a woman’s long hair naturally is a sign of her subjection, a sign of having authority on her head.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/38/1" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/38/2" data-bid="39-3" class="b"> Ps. 110:3</a>.</p>
