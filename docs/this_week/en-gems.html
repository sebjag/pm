<strong>How Practical Is the Bible?</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span id="page326" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="326" data-before-text="326"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> What about the atheist charge that the Bible is contradictory? It is a hasty assumption. For example, the atheist may point to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 1:4</a> which says “the earth abideth for ever”, and then flip the pages to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:10</a> and read: “The earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.” He gloats that here is a contradiction that proves the Bible unreliable. However, in the first instance it is the literal earth that does abide forever; while in the second reference the term “earth” stands for the peoples generally and their organized governments under Satan. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:4</a>) The context shows this correct, for it had just mentioned that the earth in Noah’s day was destroyed by water. We know the flood did not destroy the literal earth; it is still here. It did wash out of existence the wicked peoples and governing arrangements upon the surface of the earth. This symbolical reference to peoples as “earth” is not infrequent. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Ki. 10:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Ps. 66:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 98:9</a>) Or, the atheist may say Christ contradicted himself, one time telling his disciples not to provide themselves with purses and on another occasion instructing them to do so. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 10:9, 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Luke 10:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 22:35, 36</a>) In the first instance they were being sent forth on missionary work, to trust in God’s provision for them as workers worthy of their pay. They would be taking spiritual food to the people, and interested persons would gladly respond with some material help for the preachers. But in the second instance Jesus was about to be nailed to the torture stake, his followers scattered, persecution set in, with enemies on all sides, and even those favoring the message fearful of showing friendliness for Christ’s followers. Then Christians would have to make provision for their material needs.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 4. Why is the atheist so readily deceived?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> By ignoring the context and possible symbolic meanings of scriptures the atheist thinks he finds contradictions, and because he is looking for contradictions he ends his search with his superficial reading, happy, feeling rewarded, thinking he has found what he was seeking. He does not wish to continue his study to get an understanding that would bring harmony to the passages that his prejudiced mind views as contradictory. He has his reward.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 6:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 16</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 5. How do modernist clergy view the Bible, and why?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> The modernist clergy join in with the attacks on the Bible because they are caught in this trap: “The fear of man leads one into a snare.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Prov. 29:25</a>, <em>AT</em>) The popular concept of the day is that the Bible is only myth and legend, and its only value is literary. Fearing the scorn of the worldly wise and trying to keep pace with the intellectual classes and stay in their favor, the modernist clergy abandon the Bible truths to embrace the theories and philosophies of the smart men of this world. The Bible sounds a warning against such spineless deserters: “Look out: perhaps there may be some man that will carry you off as his prey through the philosophy and empty deception according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary things of the world and not according to Christ.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Col. 2:8</a>, <em>NW</em>) Typical of those who abandon the Bible in fact but cling to it for a selfish living is the attitude expressed by the head of a theological seminary in Denver, Colorado. He said: “The biggest challenge of religious education is to fit a camel-train philosophy into a diesel civilization.” This is just another way of saying that the Bible is not practical, that it is too old-fashioned for our day, that it is about as out-of-date as a camel train would be in our fast-moving, machine-age civilization.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 6. How do fundamentalist clergy make it seem ridiculous and void?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Creed-bound fundamentalist clergymen <span id="page327" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="327" data-before-text="327"></span>that always take the Bible so literally make it ridiculous. After emoting at length on how God is love, they turn right around and say that he torments people forever in a lake of fire and brimstone. However, if the punishment of the wicked were to be torment, why did Jehovah tell Adam that to disobediently eat the forbidden fruit would mean death? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Gen. 2:17</a>) If the wages of sin is eternal torment, why does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Romans 6:23</a> say: “The wages sin pays is death”? (<em>NW</em>) To withstand eternal burning in a lake of fire, one would have to be immortal. And so these fundamentalists teach concerning man’s soul. But if the human soul is immortal, why does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ezekiel 18:4</a> state: “The soul that sinneth, it shall die”? And if man is immortal, what need is there for a resurrection through Christ Jesus? In many ways such clergymen make God’s Word appear ridiculous and void by their religious traditions and creeds.</p>

He was commanded to take some of the older men of the people and the priests out the Gate of the Potsherds (or, Gate of the Ash-heaps), located at the SE corner of Jerusalem, to the Valley of Hinnom in the area of Topheth. There he declared Jehovah’s pronouncement: “Look! there are days coming . . . when this place will be called no more Topheth and the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of the killing.” Then, smashing an earthenware flask before their eyes, he continued with Jehovah’s judgment: “In the same way I shall break this people and this city . . . and in Topheth they will bury until there is no more place to bury.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011982/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Jer. 19:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011982/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011982/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 10, 11</a>) In other words, the slaughter, not of sacrificial victims to Molech, but by the sword of God’s judgment, would be so great that some bodies would lie unburied in the valley. This would pollute it to an even greater degree than Josiah had done.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Evidently Jeremiah’s prophetic words do not mean that such sacrifices to Molech were still going on in Jeremiah’s time, so soon after Josiah’s reformation, but that Jehovah would punish the nation for their practices, past as well as present, and for the innocent blood shed by them, particularly the human sacrifices during Manasseh’s reign. The prophet, in another pronouncement, told the nation that they would be punished for what Manasseh had done. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011982/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Jer. 15:4</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011982/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Kings 23:26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011982/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Jeremiah 32:30-35</a>.)

In prayer she mentioned that she desired to make a solemn vow to serve Jehovah, unconditionally. She realized that such a vow of dedication required exclusive devotion in spite of her husband’s opposition. She prayed that, when the next circuit assembly came with its baptismal arrangement for water immersion, it would become possible for her to symbolize her dedication. In answer to her prayer her domestic situation became sufficiently clear to enable her to attend the assembly and to be baptized. When she was being baptized she further prayed in gratefulness. Yes, prayer brought favorable results to this lady, including increased spiritual strength to fulfill her dedication vow.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>THANKS AT MEALTIMES</strong></p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu"> 5, 6.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964684/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mark 6:41</a>) Not only was there a need for Jesus to express thanks to Jehovah for this miracle, but it also resulted in bringing Jehovah’s peace upon the assembled crowd during their feeding.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> There is the report of a family of five, all of whom last year became dedicated to Jehovah. After their baptism the father decided to put into practice the offering of prayer at each meal, just as it is done at all the Bethel homes of the office staffs of Jehovah’s witnesses in various parts of the earth. This family’s appreciation for what Jehovah provides had become keener. So with softened hearts the family felt the need to express thanks for each meal as evidence of Jehovah’s fulfilled promise to provide his servants with their daily necessities. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964684/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 6:11</a>) No longer is the mealtime a disordered affair, with each grabbing food to be eaten as quickly as possible and then dashing out as if the home were just a quick gasoline filling station. Now the mealtime has become a happy family meeting, the taking of food is with order and manners, there is interesting Christian conversation and Jehovah’s blessing of peace has settled down upon the household. Truly such prayers bring results.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>PRAYERS HINDERED DUE TO SIN</strong></p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu"> 7, 8. (a) What did Peter mean by “in order for your prayers not to be hindered”? (b) Give a modern example.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Peter in the first century C.E. counseled husbands to conduct themselves in a proper manner toward their wives “in order for your prayers not to be hindered.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964684/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:7</a>) In this way Peter emphasizes that when one prays he must always be spiritually right with his God. One must be morally clean and free from guilt of willful wrongdoing. Where one stands guilty or unacceptable before God there is a ‘hindering’ to the prayer. In other words, one is hindered from praying correctly by a guilty conscience and Jehovah’s hearing ear is not favorably extended. So there is no response to the prayer. Jehovah has turned a deaf ear to the petition. For this reason the majority of the prayers of the unrighteous ones in the world are never answered.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964684/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 66:18, 19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964684/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Prov. 15:29</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> For example, recently it was experienced in one congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses that, whenever a certain male member was asked to offer prayer for the congregation at its meetings, he repeatedly would fail to ask for forgiveness of sins. It became rather noticeable as a ‘hindering’ to the prayer. Later this man’s course <span id="page561" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="561" data-before-text="561"></span>of conduct came to be in question. It was found that this minister in fact had been morally unclean all this time. Though married, and his wife being an active member of the congregation, he had had immoral relations with another woman on the outside. His “hindered” prayer actually led to his exposure and final disfellowshiping.</p>

A prophetic description of it is given in the sixty-fifth psalm, addressed to God in Zion. In part, it says: “You have turned your attention to the earth, that you may give it abundance; you enrich it very much. The stream from God is full of water. You prepare their grain, for that is the way you prepare the earth. There is a drenching of its furrows, a leveling off of its clouds; with copious showers you soften it; you bless its very sprouts. You have crowned the year with your goodness, and your very tracks drip with fatness. The pasture grounds of the wilderness keep dripping, and with joyfulness the very hills gird themselves. The pastures have become clothed with flocks, and the low plains themselves are enveloped with grain.

Today the man that has everything that his heart could wish in the way of food and drink, including what the doctors of his health may prescribe, cannot keep himself alive forever. More than material food is needed <em>now;</em> more than natural food will be needed <em>then</em> under God’s kingdom. Jesus Christ, even at the end of a forty-day fast, quoted God’s own words and said: “It is written, ‘Man must live, not on bread alone, but on every utterance coming forth through Jehovah’s mouth.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965283/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 4:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965283/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Deut. 8:3</a>) Even more than material food, spiritual food is needed, and this spiritual food is the Word of God.

On another occasion when he was hungry, and before eating the natural food offered to him, he said: “My food is for me to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965283/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">John 4:34</a>) In a warning against becoming victims of materialism Jesus said: “Guard against every sort of covetousness, because even when a person has an abundance his life does not result from the things he possesses.” “For the soul is worth more than food and the body than clothing.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965283/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Luke 12:15,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965283/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 23</a>) There is the danger, especially for the hungry, to make material earthly food a god and to worship their belly as their god.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">14.

Thus God and his people were on the march to take possession of the Promised Land. There were many enemies in the way before ever they would get complete possession of the whole land. In recognition of this, Moses as mediator between God and the nation of Israel called upon God to take the lead, just as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967802/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Numbers 10:35, 36</a> tells us in these words: “It would occur that when the Ark would set out, Moses would say: ‘Do arise, O Jehovah, and let your enemies be scattered; and let those who intensely hate you flee from before you.’ And when it would rest, he would say: ‘Do return, O Jehovah, to the myriads of thousands of Israel.’”</p>

<strong>“Let God Arise, Let His Enemies Be Scattered”</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> A man who witnessed both what took place at Perazim and what took place later at Gibeon in the eleventh century before <span id="page650" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="650" data-before-text="650"></span>our Common Era was King David of Jerusalem. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967802/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Sam. 5:17-25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967802/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 14:8-17</a>) The clearing out of those Philistine enemies at Perazim and Gibeon did not do away completely with all the enemies of God’s kingdom that Jehovah had established there in the Middle East with King David as his visible representative on the throne of Jerusalem. There were many other enemies that yet remained in the strip of land that Jehovah God had promised to give to David’s forefather, the patriarch Abraham, a strip running from the great river Euphrates to the river of Egypt. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967802/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Gen. 15:17-21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967802/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 12:1-9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967802/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 13:14-18</a>) Other powerful enemies, such as the Syrians, remained in this general land area and needed to be either destroyed or subdued and made vassals. King David was under God’s command to deal with these enemies in such a way as to bring fulfillment to God’s promise to give “all the land” to the descendants of his faithful friend Abraham. David must have had these enemies in mind when he wrote the opening words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967802/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 68 (verses one through three</a>):</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> “Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered, and let those who intensely hate him flee because of him.

Fittingly, then, King David was inspired to write and to quote the words of the man whom Jehovah God used when starting this victory march, namely, the prophet Moses, in the sixteenth century B.C.E. Moses at that time found himself in the wilderness of Sinai in Arabia, along with the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel and also with a “vast mixed company” of non-Israelites.

In the spring of the previous year Jehovah God had miraculously delivered all these from Egypt, even destroying the armies of the Egyptians under Pharaoh when they tried to overtake the fleeing Israelites as they crossed through the dried-up bed of the Red Sea. In the third month thereafter the Israelites and the “mixed crowd” reached Mount Sinai, and there Jehovah God made a national covenant or contract with them.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> According to the law of this national covenant a sacred tabernacle was erected for God’s worship.

At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006401/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 68:5</a>, for example, David calls God “a judge of widows,” who are often elderly.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2006401/0">a</a> In other Bible translations, the word “judge” is rendered “defender,” “protector,” and “champion.” Clearly, Jehovah cares for widows. In fact, the Bible says that if they are mistreated, his anger blazes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006401/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Exodus 22:22-24</a>) Widows​—and all faithful elderly ones—​are highly valued by God and by his servants. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006401/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 16:31</a> expresses the view of Jehovah God and of his people when it states: “Gray-headedness is a crown of beauty when it is found in the way of righteousness.”</p>

I felt very lonely.” One scripture that helped her was <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018021/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 68:6</strong></a><strong>:</strong> “God gives those who are alone a home to dwell in.” She explains: “I knew that the verse could not just mean a home in a physical sense now. Rather, I came to understand that God offers us a spiritual home, a place of real safety that provides genuine connections and emotional attachment to others who love Jehovah. But I knew that I could not get closer to others until I first got closer to Jehovah. So <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018021/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 37:4</strong></a> helped with that: ‘Find exquisite delight in Jehovah, and he will grant you the desires of your heart.’”</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ex. 19:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Ps. 68:8</a>) Jehovah had a direct hand in this display of power, for he spoke out of the mountain by means of an angel.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex. 19:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Gal. 3:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Heb. 12:18-21</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">At times the fear-inspiring force of earthquakes has been an evidence of Jehovah’s hand in judging violations of his law. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Nah. 1:3-6</a>) An earthquake was the executional method used by Jehovah against the rebellious Dathan and Abiram and the household of Korah, the earth opening its mouth and swallowing them down alive into Sheol. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Num. 16:27,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 32, 33</a>) Elijah experienced a quaking of the earth before Jehovah spoke to correct his viewpoint and to send him back to further service assignments. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Ki. 19:11-18</a>) Earthquakes have been a miraculous aid to Jehovah’s people, as when Jonathan and his armor-bearer courageously attacked a Philistine outpost. Jehovah backed up their faith in him by bringing about an earthquake that threw the entire camp of the Philistines into confusion, so that these killed off one another and were thoroughly routed.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Sam 14:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/6/3" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> 15, 16,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/6/4" data-bid="7-5" class="b"> 20,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/6/5" data-bid="7-6" class="b"> 23</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">On the day of Jesus’ death, about three o’clock in the afternoon, an earthquake took place, splitting rock-masses open, causing the memorial tombs to be opened and causing dead bodies to be thrown from their graves. The curtain of the sanctuary in the temple rebuilt by Herod was torn in two, from top to bottom. Prior to this, darkness had fallen over the land. Some think that volcanic action was involved, for often volcanoes belch out smoke and dust that blacken the sky. But there is no real evidence that there was any volcanic action connected with this earthquake. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 27:45,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 51-54;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Luke 23:44, 45</a>) Another earthquake occurred on the day of Jesus’ resurrection, when an angel descended from heaven and rolled away the stone from in front of his tomb. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 28:1, 2</a>) The apostle Paul and his companion Silas, while in prison at Philippi, had their prayers and songs of praise answered by a great earthquake that opened the prison doors and loosened the bonds of the prisoners. This led to the conversion of the jailer and his household.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 16:25-34</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Jesus foretold earthquakes in great number and magnitude as a feature of the sign of his second presence. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 24:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 7, 8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Mark 13:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/10/3" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 8</a>) Since 1914 C.E., and especially since 1948, there has been an increase in the number of earthquakes, especially of major ones. Before 1948, they occurred in clusters, with a rest period between, but since then there has been a major quake almost annually, in addition to a great number of smaller ones.—See <em>The Encyclopedia Americana,</em> Annuals, 1965-1967, under “Earthquakes.”</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In the fifty-one-year period 1915-1965, 592,036 persons were reported killed by major earthquakes. There are 1,000 quakes a year large enough to cause damage.—<em>World Almanac</em> 1967, pp. 254, 276.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>FIGURATIVE AND SYMBOLIC USES</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Earthquakes are often used figuratively in the Scriptures to describe the shaking and overthrow of nations and kingdoms. Ancient Babylon trusted in false gods such as Nebo and Marduk, which in the people’s imaginations filled their heavens. They also relied greatly on the strength of their mighty military force, but God said in pronouncement against Babylon: “I shall cause heaven itself to become agitated, and the earth will rock out of its place at the fury of Jehovah of armies.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa. 13:13</a>) As far as Babylon was concerned, it must have been a great shock when her empire fell and her territory ceased to belong to Babylon as the third world power and became merely a province in the Persian Empire—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Dan. 5:30, 31</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Elsewhere, David describes Jehovah as fighting for him as by means of an earthquake. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Sam. 22:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Ps. 18:7</a>) Jehovah speaks of rocking the heavens and the earth, and the sea and the dry ground, of rocking all nations in behalf of his people, with the result that the desirable things of all the nations would come in and he would fill his house with glory.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Hag. 2:6, 7</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The apostle Paul uses as an illustration the awe-inspiring display at Sinai, comparing it with the greater and more awesome assemblage of the Christian congregation of the firstborn before God and his Son and Mediator at the heavenly Mount Zion. He goes on to follow through with the illustration of the earthquake that took place at Sinai and gives a symbolic application, encouraging Christians to continue serving in courage and faith, realizing that the Kingdom and those who hold on to it will be able to remain standing while all other things of the symbolic heavens and earth are shaken to pieces.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Heb. 12:18-29</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The greatest earthquake of all yet to come is a symbolic one, described in connection with the seventh of the symbolic seven final plagues of Revelation. It is pictured as wrecking, not one or two cities, as some of the most violent earthquakes have done, but “the cities of the nations.” John’s account of this cataclysm reads: “A great earthquake occurred such as had not occurred since men came to be on the earth, so extensive an earthquake, so great. And the great city [Babylon the Great] split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011208/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Rev. 16:18, 19</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"></p>

Before ever he declared the Ten Commandments from atop Mount Sinai, he caused terrifying demonstrations in earth and sky, to impress the people of Israel with the fact that their Lawgiver was no mere puny human creature, but was the God of heaven and earth. If the inanimate things of creation are moved at his invisible presence, why should not his intelligent human creatures who behold his wondrous works of creation also be moved?

This was spiritually reinvigorating to the people of his inheritance and strengthening to them like food.

They spent a long time​—forty years—​as a tent community in the wilderness and outside the borders of the Promised Land.

Also, women make up the greater number of over 1,000,000 full-time Kingdom proclaimers worldwide.

In obedience to God’s “saying,” or command, the men of Israel fought against the enemy nations of the Promised Land and defeated them. This gave Israelite women good news to proclaim in victory celebrations. Today, women ministers play a notable role as Kingdom proclaimers telling out the good news relating to Jehovah’s “saying,” which includes serving notice on the nations that they will soon be subdued by the Messianic King, Jesus Christ.</p>

People will be judged on the basis of the way they obey what is written in them.—P. 523.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>● What did Jesus mean when he said that Jerusalem would be trampled upon “until the appointed times of the nations are fulfilled”?</strong></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">He meant that the royal line of King David, which ruled from Jerusalem, would be kept low, inoperative, from 607 B.C.E. until he, Jesus, the permanent heir of David, would be enthroned as king in heavenly Jerusalem in 1914 C.E.—Pp. 612, 613, 616.</p>

How thankful the Christian witnesses of Jehovah can be that at their Disciple-making District Assemblies last year they received a detailed explanation of this psalm! And in particular do they have cause for rejoicing that all of Jehovah’s people today can have a share in letting all men see Jehovah’s victory processions. “They have seen your processions, O God, the processions of my God, my King, into the holy place.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 68:24</a>.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1968486/0">a</a></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Among the first of Jehovah’s victory processions recorded in the Word of God was that which took place at the time that Jehovah God gave his people Israel the victory over the pursuing Egyptians under Pharaoh by drowning them all in the Red Sea. There Moses and the sons of Israel sang a song of victory in which the women joined, dancing, playing tambourines and singing in response to the men. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex. 15:1-21</a>) In later years, as Jehovah gave further victories to his people over their pagan foes, there were other victory processions.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Sam. 18:6, 7</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In modern times Jehovah won a great victory by means of the Greater David, Jesus Christ, when he and his angels cast Satan and his angels out of heaven between 1914 and 1918. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rev. 12:1-12</a>) Certainly that was a victory deserving a public procession, for it marked the birth of God’s heavenly kingdom as well as a victory over Satan and his demons. All the preaching that Jehovah’s people do even today is a part of this victory procession.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Mark 13:10</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Since then Jehovah God has also given other victories to his people. Bitterly opposed by religious and political foes, the Witnesses have won victories in the courts of the land and before other governmental bodies, particularly in the United States, but also in Canada, Great Britain, Germany and elsewhere. As a result bans have been lifted, their form of worship has been recognized and they have been given constitutional or other legal guarantees and protection in many lands.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Taking the lead in these victory processions are “the gifts in the form of men,” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 68:18</a>. Who are these? The apostle Paul tells us: “He gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelizers, some as shepherds and teachers, with a view to the training of the holy ones, for ministerial work, . . . until we all attain to the oneness in the faith and in the accurate knowledge of the Son of God, to a full-grown man.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Eph. 4:11-13</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">While it is the men that have taken the lead in these victory processions, women have had no insignificant part therein, even as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">verse 11 of Psalm 68</a> tells: “Jehovah himself gives the saying; the women telling the good news are a large army.” How true it is that the women publishing the good news are a large army! By far the majority of the more than one million Kingdom proclaimers going from house to house, making return visits, conducting Bible studies in the homes of the people and standing on the street corners preaching the good news are womenfolk! And most of them do this while at the same time caring for their families.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 68</a> also tells “congregated throngs” to bless Jehovah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps 68 Vs. 26</a>) What congregated throngs have been doing this in modern times, as at the gathering of more than a quarter of a million persons at Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds in New York city in the summer of 1958! Beginning with July this year there will be still more congregated throngs blessing Jehovah throughout the northern hemisphere as the Christian witnesses of Jehovah meet at their four-day “Good News for All Nations” District Assemblies. Surely these assemblies will help many more persons to see Jehovah’s victory processions!</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">So let every dedicated Christian living in lands where these assemblies are to be held put forth every effort to attend an assembly. More than that, let all such attend fully conscious of their spiritual need, and so be present at all sessions, paying close attention and taking notes. At the same time let them resolve also to know the ‘greater happiness that comes from giving’ by contributing in various ways to the success of these assemblies, thus sharing in letting all men see Jehovah’s victory processions.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 5:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Acts 20:35</a>.</p>

<strong>“Let God Arise, Let His Enemies Be Scattered”</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> The force of this poetic account of God’s dealings ought not to be lost on God’s enemies today. These enemies try to stand in the way of God’s accomplishing his purpose <span id="page654" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="654" data-before-text="654"></span>with regard to his people, his bringing them successfully into the righteous new order that he has promised. The “time of the end” as foretold in his Word has come upon the nations of this world, beginning in 1914 at the end of the Gentile Times, “the appointed times of the nations.” They refuse to get out of power during this “time of the end” and peacefully give way to God’s exercising sovereignty over the earth of his creation. So it becomes necessary for Almighty God to oust them. He must arise against them in battle. This he will do at the battlefield of Armageddon. In the meantime the enemy nations continue to block the progress of God’s people as they work at advancing the earthly interests of God’s kingdom.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">21. As in David’s case, how did the enemies try to keep Jesus Christ from reigning, and with what success?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> The kingdom is not that of ancient David in earthly Jerusalem, but that of the promised Son of David, Jesus Christ, who was born into the family line of David through the Jewish virgin Mary by a miracle of God. The enemies tried to keep David from ruling as king on Mount Zion in Jerusalem, but they were disgracefully defeated when God arose against them. Likewise the enemies tried to keep the Son of David, Jesus Christ, from ruling as king, but they too bowed in defeat. They killed Jesus Christ outside Jerusalem on the day that the Jewish passover lamb was killed, but on the third day Almighty God raised him from the dead as a glorious immortal spirit Son. The Son of David then ascended to his heavenly Father. There Jehovah God laid him as a royal Stone in the heavenly Zion, to begin ruling there in God’s due time, that is, in 1914. Then God would begin to make all the Gentile nations a footstool under the feet of the Son of David.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967802/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Luke 21:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967802/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Isa. 28:16-21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967802/20/2" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> Ps. 110:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967802/20/3" data-bid="21-4" class="b"> Acts 2:34-36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967802/20/4" data-bid="21-5" class="b"> Heb. 10:13</a>.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">22.

After he predicted the persecutions upon his faithful followers, Jesus said: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967802/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matt. 24:7-14</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> Thus God is serving notice upon the enemy nations.

But these Kingdom witnesses have prayed: “Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered.” In answer, God has cleared the way for them to serve notice upon the enemy nations by preaching the good news that God’s kingdom was established in the hands of the Son of David in 1914. This has meant a series of victories for Jehovah, making it possible that today the Kingdom notice is being served on the nations in 199 lands and in 164 languages. The very birth of God’s kingdom in the heavens meant a victory by Him over Satan the Devil and his demons. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967802/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Rev. 12:5-12</a>) The expanding of the work of serving notice about the Kingdom upon more and more nations has meant further victories for Jehovah God. Such divine victories serve as good news that should be told to the peoples.</p>

In this day of Jehovah he has brought forth his nation of spiritual Israel, a nation not captive to any of the nations of this world. He has given them a spiritual position before him, a theocratic position occupied by no others on earth, so that he has, as it were, caused a ‘land to be born’ in this great day of Jehovah for their residence.

<strong>“Let God Arise, Let His Enemies Be Scattered”</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> It is nothing for this Almighty God Jehovah to move heaven and earth to show that he is the God of creation and all its laws. He displayed his power to do so at Mount Sinai in Arabia, where he brought his people in the third month after delivering them from slave-driving Egypt. Before ever he declared the Ten Commandments from atop Mount Sinai, he caused terrifying demonstrations in earth and sky, to impress the people of Israel with the fact that their Lawgiver was no mere puny human creature, but was the God of heaven and earth. If the inanimate things of creation are moved at his invisible presence, why should not his intelligent human creatures who behold his wondrous works of creation also be moved? He can move heaven and earth to carry out his will. The divine quality of power to do this the psalmist King David called <span id="page652" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="652" data-before-text="652"></span>to mind and mentioned, to Jehovah’s praise, as he said:</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> “O God, when you went forth before your people, when you marched through the desert . . . the earth itself rocked, heaven itself also dripped because of God; this Sinai rocked because of God, the God of Israel.

We meet, not only to praise the universal Sovereign and his kingdom, but to help one another to praise him before people on the outside who need salvation. Our determination should be: “As for me, in my integrity I shall walk. O redeem me and show me favor.

Yet Jehovah has separated his people from this world by his truth, which has made them free, and by his organization of them that they may all act together in doing his one will for them. In this day of Jehovah he has brought forth his nation of spiritual Israel, a nation not captive to any of the nations of this world. He has given them a spiritual position before him, a theocratic position occupied by no others on earth, so that he has, as it were, caused a ‘land to be born’ in this great day of Jehovah for their residence.

<strong>Dove</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Varieties and Description.</strong> The most common varieties of doves found in Israel are the rock dove (<em>Columba livia</em>), the ring dove (<em>Columba palumbus;</em> also called the wood pigeon), and the stock dove (<em>Columba oenas</em>). Ring doves are found particularly in the forests of Gilead and Carmel. The stock dove settles chiefly around Jericho and on the eastern side of the Jordan, while the rock dove breeds on the coastlands, along the gorges of the Jordan Valley and the highlands to the west. Doves characteristically have a plump, full-breasted body, a graceful neck, a small rounded head with rather slender bill, and short legs. The feathers are very compact, giving the bird a rather sleek look. The doves are frequently of a blue-gray color, while some have an iridescent sheen on parts of the plumage, causing it to take on a metallic appearance in the golden sunlight. This may be alluded to at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001216/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 68:13</a>, although the reference there to “the wings of a dove covered with silver and its pinions with yellowish-green gold” is thought by some to refer to some richly wrought piece of art taken as spoil.</p>

<strong>Highlights From Book Two of Psalms</strong><br/><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006402/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b"><strong>68:13</strong></a>​<strong>—How were “the wings of a dove covered with silver and its pinions with yellowish-green gold”?</strong> Certain doves of a blue-gray color have an iridescent brightness on some of their feathers. Their plumage takes on a metallic appearance in the golden sunlight. David was perhaps likening the victorious Israelite warriors coming forth from a battle to such a dove​—strong of wing and brilliant in appearance. As some scholars suggest, the description may also fit a work of art, a trophy, taken as spoil. In any case, David was alluding to the victories Jehovah gave his people over their enemies.</p>

He displayed his power to do so at Mount Sinai in Arabia, where he brought his people in the third month after delivering them from slave-driving Egypt. Before ever he declared the Ten Commandments from atop Mount Sinai, he caused terrifying demonstrations in earth and sky, to impress the people of Israel with the fact that their Lawgiver was no mere puny human creature, but was the God of heaven and earth. If the inanimate things of creation are moved at his invisible presence, why should not his intelligent human creatures who behold his wondrous works of creation also be moved? He can move heaven and earth to carry out his will. The divine quality of power to do this the psalmist King David called <span id="page652" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="652" data-before-text="652"></span>to mind and mentioned, to Jehovah’s praise, as he said:</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> “O God, when you went forth before your people, when you marched through the desert . . . the earth itself rocked, heaven itself also dripped because of God; this Sinai rocked because of God, the God of Israel.

But there, by giving them the Ten Commandments and all the other laws of his covenant and by establishing his pure organized worship among them, Jehovah God began causing a downpour of spiritual blessings. This was spiritually reinvigorating to the people of his inheritance and strengthening to them like food. They found that they had to live, not by physical food alone, but by every word proceeding out of God’s mouth. They spent a long time​—forty years—​as a tent community in the wilderness and outside the borders of the Promised Land. But in the closing year Jehovah brought them to the borders of the “land flowing with milk and honey.” Then the local kings began offering resistance. What now was there to do?

The divine quality of power to do this the psalmist King David called <span id="page652" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="652" data-before-text="652"></span>to mind and mentioned, to Jehovah’s praise, as he said:</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> “O God, when you went forth before your people, when you marched through the desert . . . the earth itself rocked, heaven itself also dripped because of God; this Sinai rocked because of God, the God of Israel. A copious downpour you began causing to fall, O God; your inheritance, even when it was weary​—you yourself reinvigorated it. Your tent community​—they have dwelt in it; with your goodness you proceeded to make it ready for the afflicted one, O God.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967802/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 68:7-10</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">14.

But there, by giving them the Ten Commandments and all the other laws of his covenant and by establishing his pure organized worship among them, Jehovah God began causing a downpour of spiritual blessings. This was spiritually reinvigorating to the people of his inheritance and strengthening to them like food. They found that they had to live, not by physical food alone, but by every word proceeding out of God’s mouth. They spent a long time​—forty years—​as a tent community in the wilderness and outside the borders of the Promised Land. But in the closing year Jehovah brought them to the borders of the “land flowing with milk and honey.” Then the local kings began offering resistance. What now was there to do?

Why do you, O you mountains of peaks, keep watching enviously the mountain that God has desired for himself to dwell in? Even Jehovah himself will reside there forever. . . .

<strong>Baruch</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the fourth year of King Jehoiakim, 625 B.C.E., Baruch began writing in a scroll the prophetic <span id="page193" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="193" data-before-text="193"></span>message of Jerusalem’s doom, dictated by Jeremiah. In the late fall of the following year, 624, Baruch read the scroll aloud “in the ears of all the people” at the entrance of Jehovah’s house. He was then summoned to read it to an assembly of the princes, who, moved by what they heard and fearing the consequences when the word got to the king’s ears, urged Baruch and Jeremiah to hide. Jehoiakim, upon hearing the denunciation, burned the scroll piece by piece, and commanded that Baruch and Jeremiah be brought before him, “but Jehovah kept them concealed.” At Jeremiah’s dictation, Baruch then wrote another scroll like the first, but containing “many more words” from the mouth of Jehovah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010569/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jer. 36:1-32</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Sixteen years later, in the tenth year of Zedekiah, only months before Jerusalem was sacked, Baruch took the deeds for the property Jeremiah purchased from a cousin and put them in an earthenware vessel for preservation and safekeeping.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010569/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jer. 32:9-16</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">At one point during the writing of the first scroll, when Baruch complained of his weariness, Jehovah warned him: ‘Do not keep on seeking great things for yourself.’ Nevertheless, because of his faithfulness he was promised preservation and safety “in all the places to which you may go,” not only during the terrible siege of Jerusalem, but afterwards when the rebellious populace compelled him and Jeremiah to go down to Egypt with them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010569/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jer. 45:1-5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010569/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 43:4-7</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">There is a large amount of contradictory tradition concerning Baruch’s later life, and his name has been erroneously attached to apocryphal writings, all of which are of little or no account. (See APOCRYPHA.) However, it is quite certain that Baruch was a man of ability and a very capable assistant to Jeremiah. This conclusion is supported by the fact that on one occasion Azariah and others accused him of being the real instigator that engineered Jeremiah’s warning messages from behind the scenes.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010569/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jer. 43:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">2.

It was as though Jehovah himself was taking the captives and returning to Mount Zion in triumph. Many of these were available as slaves; and with these captives gifts could be made in the form of men, especially to the Levites to do the menial work at the tabernacle of God’s worship.

<strong>Baruch</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the fourth year of King Jehoiakim, 625 B.C.E., Baruch began writing in a scroll the prophetic <span id="page193" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="193" data-before-text="193"></span>message of Jerusalem’s doom, dictated by Jeremiah. In the late fall of the following year, 624, Baruch read the scroll aloud “in the ears of all the people” at the entrance of Jehovah’s house. He was then summoned to read it to an assembly of the princes, who, moved by what they heard and fearing the consequences when the word got to the king’s ears, urged Baruch and Jeremiah to hide. Jehoiakim, upon hearing the denunciation, burned the scroll piece by piece, and commanded that Baruch and Jeremiah be brought before him, “but Jehovah kept them concealed.” At Jeremiah’s dictation, Baruch then wrote another scroll like the first, but containing “many more words” from the mouth of Jehovah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010569/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jer. 36:1-32</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Sixteen years later, in the tenth year of Zedekiah, only months before Jerusalem was sacked, Baruch took the deeds for the property Jeremiah purchased from a cousin and put them in an earthenware vessel for preservation and safekeeping.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010569/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jer. 32:9-16</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">At one point during the writing of the first scroll, when Baruch complained of his weariness, Jehovah warned him: ‘Do not keep on seeking great things for yourself.’ Nevertheless, because of his faithfulness he was promised preservation and safety “in all the places to which you may go,” not only during the terrible siege of Jerusalem, but afterwards when the rebellious populace compelled him and Jeremiah to go down to Egypt with them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010569/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jer. 45:1-5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010569/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 43:4-7</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">There is a large amount of contradictory tradition concerning Baruch’s later life, and his name has been erroneously attached to apocryphal writings, all of which are of little or no account. (See APOCRYPHA.) However, it is quite certain that Baruch was a man of ability and a very capable assistant to Jeremiah. This conclusion is supported by the fact that on one occasion Azariah and others accused him of being the real instigator that engineered Jeremiah’s warning messages from behind the scenes.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010569/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jer. 43:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">2.

Regarding Jehovah, David said: “You have made my mountain to stand in strength,” probably meaning that Jehovah had exalted David’s kingdom and firmly established it.

With reference to this choosing, David wrote: “The mountainous region of Bashan is a mountain of God [that is, created by God]; the mountainous region of Bashan is a mountain of peaks. Why do you, O you mountains of peaks, keep watching enviously the mountain that God has desired for himself to dwell in? Even Jehovah himself will reside there forever. . . . Jehovah himself has come from Sinai [where he first revealed his presence to the entire nation of Israel] into the holy place.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Ps. 68:15-17</a>) The mountainous region of Bashan may be said to reach its crest in Mount Hermon and, therefore, this mountain may be meant by the words the “mountain of God” and the “mountain of peaks.” Although Mount Hermon towers far above Mount Zion, Jehovah chose the less conspicuous location for his place of dwelling.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">After the temple was built on Mount Moriah, the term “Zion” came to include the temple site and therefore Zion remained God’s holy mountain.

There is no evidence that such a thing ever took place in connection with the literal temple at Jerusalem. But there is evidence of a fulfillment upon the Christian congregation of spiritual Israel, which is associated with the spiritual temple of Jehovah God. The invitation to become part of spiritual Israel began to be extended to non-Jews in the year 36 C.E. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/63/0" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Acts 10:34, 35</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:9, 10</a>.)

The fact that the “mountain of the house of Jehovah” was to be above mountains and hills would point to the exalted position of true worship, for mountains and hills anciently served as sites for idolatrous worship and for sanctuaries of false deities.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/0" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Deut. 12:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/1" data-bid="68-2" class="b"> Jer. 3:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/2" data-bid="68-3" class="b"> Ezek. 18:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/3" data-bid="68-4" class="b"> 11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/4" data-bid="68-5" class="b"> 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/5" data-bid="68-6" class="b"> Hos. 4:13</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong><em>Obstacles</em></strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">At times mountains represent obstacles.

Men are largely interested in the politics of this world. They prefer human politics and nationalism to the kingdom of God, which reigns from the heavenly Mount Zion.

The war chariots of God are in tens of thousands, thousands over and over again. Jehovah himself has come from Sinai into the holy place.

It is now thought that the “lofty mountain” on which Jesus Christ was transfigured before his disciples Peter, James and John was Mount Hermon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967803/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 17:1, 2</a>) Despite the height of the mountainous area of Bashan, Jehovah God chose Mount Zion as the height on which to establish the capital city of King David and to have his holy ark of the covenant located there, near David’s palace.

On Mount Zion King David was said to sit on “Jehovah’s throne” as his visible representative.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967803/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:23</a>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 4.

When Jehovah, as represented by his ark of the covenant, moved there, he was ascending on high, accompanied triumphantly by tens of thousands of war chariots, as it were, seeing that Mount Zion had been gained for his earthly kingdom by war. David his anointed king was given victory over the enemies in the Promised Land. Many captives were taken, many of these stubbornly resisting God’s chosen people in taking over the land. It was as though Jehovah himself was taking the captives and returning to Mount Zion in triumph. Many of these were available as slaves; and with these captives gifts could be made in the form of men, especially to the Levites to do the menial work at the tabernacle of God’s worship. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967803/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezra 8:20</a>) In this way Jehovah did take “gifts in the form of men.” Also, he started residing in the Promised Land, even though stubborn enemies had to be subdued.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 5.

Because Jehovah’s only-begotten Son Jesus Christ as a man was the Son of David, the heavenly height on which Jehovah has enthroned this glorified Son may be likened to Mount Zion. There in the celestial Mount Zion is where Jehovah God laid Jesus Christ as the Royal Stone after he had resurrected him from the dead, all of this in fulfillment of the prophecy of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967803/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isaiah 28:16</a>.

Jehovah chose this symbolic mountain as the seat of government instead of the earthly Mount Zion or any mountain peak of Bashan. But, like the Jewish rulers, the kings of Christendom do not want any heavenly seat of government over them; they prefer their own lofty governmental mountains on earth.</p>

With reference to this choosing, David wrote: “The mountainous region of Bashan is a mountain of God [that is, created by God]; the mountainous region of Bashan is a mountain of peaks. Why do you, O you mountains of peaks, keep watching enviously the mountain that God has desired for himself to dwell in? Even Jehovah himself will reside there forever. . . .

There is no evidence that such a thing ever took place in connection with the literal temple at Jerusalem. But there is evidence of a fulfillment upon the Christian congregation of spiritual Israel, which is associated with the spiritual temple of Jehovah God. The invitation to become part of spiritual Israel began to be extended to non-Jews in the year 36 C.E.

The fact that the “mountain of the house of Jehovah” was to be above mountains and hills would point to the exalted position of true worship, for mountains and hills anciently served as sites for idolatrous worship and for sanctuaries of false deities.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/0" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Deut. 12:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/1" data-bid="68-2" class="b"> Jer. 3:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/2" data-bid="68-3" class="b"> Ezek. 18:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/3" data-bid="68-4" class="b"> 11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/4" data-bid="68-5" class="b"> 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/5" data-bid="68-6" class="b"> Hos. 4:13</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong><em>Obstacles</em></strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">At times mountains represent obstacles.

It was as though Jehovah himself was taking the captives and returning to Mount Zion in triumph. Many of these were available as slaves; and with these captives gifts could be made in the form of men, especially to the Levites to do the menial work at the tabernacle of God’s worship.

And in particular do they have cause for rejoicing that all of Jehovah’s people today can have a share in letting all men see Jehovah’s victory processions. “They have seen your processions, O God, the processions of my God, my King, into the holy place.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 68:24</a>.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1968486/0">a</a></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Among the first of Jehovah’s victory processions recorded in the Word of God was that which took place at the time that Jehovah God gave his people Israel the victory over the pursuing Egyptians under Pharaoh by drowning them all in the Red Sea. There Moses and the sons of Israel sang a song of victory in which the women joined, dancing, playing tambourines and singing in response to the men. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex. 15:1-21</a>) In later years, as Jehovah gave further victories to his people over their pagan foes, there were other victory processions.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Sam. 18:6, 7</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In modern times Jehovah won a great victory by means of the Greater David, Jesus Christ, when he and his angels cast Satan and his angels out of heaven between 1914 and 1918. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rev. 12:1-12</a>) Certainly that was a victory deserving a public procession, for it marked the birth of God’s heavenly kingdom as well as a victory over Satan and his demons. All the preaching that Jehovah’s people do even today is a part of this victory procession.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Mark 13:10</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Since then Jehovah God has also given other victories to his people. Bitterly opposed by religious and political foes, the Witnesses have won victories in the courts of the land and before other governmental bodies, particularly in the United States, but also in Canada, Great Britain, Germany and elsewhere. As a result bans have been lifted, their form of worship has been recognized and they have been given constitutional or other legal guarantees and protection in many lands.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Taking the lead in these victory processions are “the gifts in the form of men,” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 68:18</a>. Who are these? The apostle Paul tells us: “He gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelizers, some as shepherds and teachers, with a view to the training of the holy ones, for ministerial work, . . . until we all attain to the oneness in the faith and in the accurate knowledge of the Son of God, to a full-grown man.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Eph. 4:11-13</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">While it is the men that have taken the lead in these victory processions, women have had no insignificant part therein, even as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">verse 11 of Psalm 68</a> tells: “Jehovah himself gives the saying; the women telling the good news are a large army.” How true it is that the women publishing the good news are a large army! By far the majority of the more than one million Kingdom proclaimers going from house to house, making return visits, conducting Bible studies in the homes of the people and standing on the street corners preaching the good news are womenfolk! And most of them do this while at the same time caring for their families.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 68</a> also tells “congregated throngs” to bless Jehovah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps 68 Vs. 26</a>) What congregated throngs have been doing this in modern times, as at the gathering of more than a quarter of a million persons at Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds in New York city in the summer of 1958! Beginning with July this year there will be still more congregated throngs blessing Jehovah throughout the northern hemisphere as the Christian witnesses of Jehovah meet at their four-day “Good News for All Nations” District Assemblies. Surely these assemblies will help many more persons to see Jehovah’s victory processions!</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">So let every dedicated Christian living in lands where these assemblies are to be held put forth every effort to attend an assembly. More than that, let all such attend fully conscious of their spiritual need, and so be present at all sessions, paying close attention and taking notes. At the same time let them resolve also to know the ‘greater happiness that comes from giving’ by contributing in various ways to the success of these assemblies, thus sharing in letting all men see Jehovah’s victory processions.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 5:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Acts 20:35</a>.</p>

The war chariots of God are in tens of thousands, thousands over and over again. Jehovah himself has come from Sinai into the holy place.

It is now thought that the “lofty mountain” on which Jesus Christ was transfigured before his disciples Peter, James and John was Mount Hermon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967803/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 17:1, 2</a>) Despite the height of the mountainous area of Bashan, Jehovah God chose Mount Zion as the height on which to establish the capital city of King David and to have his holy ark of the covenant located there, near David’s palace.

On Mount Zion King David was said to sit on “Jehovah’s throne” as his visible representative.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967803/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:23</a>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 4.

When Jehovah, as represented by his ark of the covenant, moved there, he was ascending on high, accompanied triumphantly by tens of thousands of war chariots, as it were, seeing that Mount Zion had been gained for his earthly kingdom by war. David his anointed king was given victory over the enemies in the Promised Land. Many captives were taken, many of these stubbornly resisting God’s chosen people in taking over the land. It was as though Jehovah himself was taking the captives and returning to Mount Zion in triumph. Many of these were available as slaves; and with these captives gifts could be made in the form of men, especially to the Levites to do the menial work at the tabernacle of God’s worship. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967803/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezra 8:20</a>) In this way Jehovah did take “gifts in the form of men.” Also, he started residing in the Promised Land, even though stubborn enemies had to be subdued.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 5.

Because Jehovah’s only-begotten Son Jesus Christ as a man was the Son of David, the heavenly height on which Jehovah has enthroned this glorified Son may be likened to Mount Zion. There in the celestial Mount Zion is where Jehovah God laid Jesus Christ as the Royal Stone after he had resurrected him from the dead, all of this in fulfillment of the prophecy of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967803/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isaiah 28:16</a>.

But in the typical fulfillment of these words, in which King David took part, it was not Jehovah himself that literally ascended on Mount Zion and took his royal seat there and pitched his tent of worship there. In a direct way it was David, the anointed ruler and warrior who represented Jehovah, that did so. So, as represented in David, Jehovah God did these things.

By waging the first world war of 1914-1918 the nations of Christendom proved that they rejected God’s kingdom and rejected the Royal Stone to whom he had assigned a place on the heavenly Mount Zion, the rightful seat of government for all the earth. They climaxed this rejection of God’s Royal Stone by voting in 1919 in favor of a League of Nations, mainly nations of Christendom. But the Royal Stone whom the political builders, backed by the religious clergy, thus rejected, Jehovah God confirmed in his exalted position on the heavenly Mount Zion, in a complete fulfillment of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967803/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Isaiah 28:16</a>. Jehovah God made that fact apparent by freeing his people in 1919 from Babylonish bondage and then giving “gifts in men.”</p>

<strong>Kingdom Missionaries, the Bringers of the Best News</strong><br/><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> The apostles were not the only evangelists of the Christian congregation. All <span id="page202" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="202" data-before-text="202"></span>the dedicated, baptized members of the congregation who had possession of the good news were under responsibility to pass it on to others, to spread the good news and thus to act as evangelists. This fact became manifest, even at a time when one would think that a news agent would quit circulating news that got him into trouble, namely, at a time of religious persecution.</p><p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">24. In proof of this, what does the Record say regarding the persecuted ones?</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> This was after the Jews stoned Stephen, one of seven men who were appointed to serve as special assistants to the apostles in the congregation at Jerusalem. Concerning this evangelizing under fierce persecution it is written: “Saul [of Tarsus], for his part, was approving of the murder of him. On that day great persecution arose against the congregation which was in Jerusalem; all except the apostles were scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria. But reverent men carried Stephen to the burial and they made a great lamentation over him. . . . However, those who had been scattered went through the land declaring the good news of the word. Philip, for one, went down to the city of Samaria and began to preach the Christ to them. But when they believed Philip who was declaring the good news of the kingdom of God and of the name of Jesus Christ, they proceeded to be baptized, both men and women.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959241/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Acts 8:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959241/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 4, 5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959241/29/2" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> 12</a>) In this case, not the apostles who remained at Jerusalem, but the scattered disciples did the evangelizing. They all had the honor and joy of being evangelists.</p><p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu">25. Who were the Christians that were designated “evangelists,” and how was the gift of these foretold?</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[67]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"><sup>25</sup></span> All persons who become dedicated, baptized followers of the leading Evangelist Jesus Christ copy him and become evangelists and are correctly spoken of as such. Yet there were those in the first-century congregation who were especially chosen and designated as such. These men who were specially distinguished by the title “evangelist” were gifts from the Lord Jesus Christ after he had been resurrected from the dead and had ascended to heaven to the right hand of the great Evangelist Jehovah God. The giving of these living gifts in the form of men had long been foretold, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959241/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalm 68:18</a>, in these words: “You have ascended on high; you have carried away captives; you have taken gifts in the form of men, yes, even the stubborn ones, to reside among them, O Jah God.”</p><p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="qu">26. With what argument does Paul make the application of this prophecy?</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[68]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"><sup>26</sup></span> The good news commentator, Paul, makes the application of this prophecy, saying to the Christian congregation or the “body of the Christ”: “Now to each one of us undeserved kindness was given according to how the Christ measured out the free gift. Wherefore he says: ‘When he ascended on high he led captive a multitude; he gave gifts in men.’ Now the expression ‘he ascended’, what does it mean but that he also descended into the lower regions, that is, the earth? The very one that descended is also the one that ascended far above all the heavens that he might give fullness to all things. And he gave some [gifts] as apostles, some as prophets, some as missionaries [or, evangelists], some as shepherds and teachers, with a view to the training of the holy ones for ministerial work, for the building up of the body of the Christ.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959241/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Eph. 4:7-12</a>, <em>margin; AT.</em></p><p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="qu">27. How were those men properly called “evangelists,” and why, therefore, could they be spoken of as “missionaries”?</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[69]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"><sup>27</sup></span> We note here that evangelists or missionaries, whom God gave by the glorified Jesus Christ, are ranked after the apostles and the prophets but before the shepherds (pastors) and teachers. Why were <span id="page203" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="203" data-before-text="203"></span>these men who were given as gifts to the congregation distinguished from all the rest of the congregation who did evangelistic work by spreading the good news? It must be because they did evangelizing work in an outstanding manner or on a larger scale, or in a greater territory or special territory. Evidently they were specially sent on a mission of proclaiming the good news. For this reason they could be spoken of as missionaries of the good news.</p>

Jehovah has said: ‘From Bashan I shall bring back, I shall bring them back from the depths of the sea, in order that you may wash your foot in blood, that the tongue of your dogs may have its portion from the enemies.”’​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967803/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ps. 68:19-23</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> During this “time of the end,” and under the worldwide persecution that was foretold to come upon Christ’s faithful followers, just how the willing “captives” of the victorious Jesus Christ ever escaped being wiped out of existence is a wonder. It can only be explained by the fact that Jehovah is a “God of saving acts” and to him “belong the ways out from death.” In this connection we must remember that from 1918 onward till Armageddon God cut short the days of the tribulation upon the worldly nations and kingdoms. He did this, as Jesus Christ foretold, for the sake of his chosen ones, in order that some flesh might be saved on earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967803/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Matt. 24:21, 22</a>) This cutting short of the tribulation has worked out for the salvation of even the anointed remnant of those whom God has chosen for the heavenly kingdom with Christ.</p>

<strong>To Whom Do You Belong?</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">However, does this mean that the individual, especially one who is keenly interested in doing God’s will, belongs to the State in a total or complete sense? Must his subjection be rendered even at the expense of his intimate relationship with God, who says that He is as a husband to <span id="page358" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="358" data-before-text="358"></span>his people? No. While Jesus urged men to pay back to Caesar what belonged to Caesar, he also said that men should pay back “God’s things to God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964441/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 22:21</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">So while certain duties must be rendered to the State because they rightly belong within its jurisdiction, there are other duties that must be rendered only to Almighty God because they belong only within his jurisdiction. They cannot be rendered to anyone else. Hence, the subjection of God-fearing persons to the political state is <em>relative, not total,</em> because no man or organization of men can rightfully demand what belongs to God.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The illustration of a husband and a wife can again be applied to this situation. A wife might rightfully go to work for another man at his place of business. But if her employer required that she submit totally to him, in all areas, including the intimate details pertaining to married life, then his demands would be out of order and could not be complied with. The employer would be demanding what the wife could rightly give only to her husband. Any pressure to get her to switch her loyalty and devotion from her husband would be wrong. The employer could rightly require only that she fulfill the obligations of her secular employment. He could not rightfully go beyond that, invading the area that belongs to her husband, and expect her to comply. As a devoted wife she could not do so.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">This same principle applies to man’s relationship with God. God is the Creator. He gave man life and provided him with the things necessary to sustain life. He rightfully can require something in return, as a husband who provides for his wife requires certain things of her. While God permits human governments to exercise a measure of control over individuals, as an employer might over a man’s wife, He does not give such governments of men the right of absolute control, requiring submission even in those areas that belong only to Him.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Those in covenant relationship with God have an intimate relationship with him. All who are dedicated to him must fulfill their obligations toward him. They appreciate that their loyalty, their integrity, their devotion and worship belong to God. So do their lives. They cannot sacrifice them for another cause. They appreciate that they must give <em>total</em> submission to God, while giving <em>relative</em> submission to organizations of men, including political governments. They cannot give their lives, loyalty and worship to another, when these belong only to God. To transfer to the political state such intimate aspects of one’s relationship to God would be a violation of this relationship. It would be like a wife’s agreeing to have intimate relations with another man not her husband. That would be adultery. For one of God’s servants to give total loyalty and worship to the political state would likewise be adultery, spiritual adultery. It is as God himself explains in his Word: “Adulteresses, do you not know that the friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever, therefore, wants to be a friend of the world is constituting himself an enemy of God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964441/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jas. 4:4</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Men in positions of political control would do well to consider this: Just as a husband is angered by one who demands that his wife violate her marriage obligations, so God is angered at any who demand that his servants violate their obligations to him. When such persons go to the point of persecuting those who want to do God’s will, what then? The Bible answers: “Indeed God himself will break the head of his enemies in pieces.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964441/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 68:21</a>) God assures us that he will ‘avenge the blood of his slaves.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964441/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Rev. 19:2</a>) “Jehovah is guarding all those loving him, but <span id="page359" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="359" data-before-text="359"></span>all the wicked ones he will annihilate.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964441/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 145:20</a>.</p>

Jehovah has said: ‘From Bashan I shall bring back, I shall bring them back from the depths of the sea, in order that you may wash your foot in blood, that the tongue of your dogs may have its portion from the enemies.”’​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967803/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ps. 68:19-23</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> During this “time of the end,” and under the worldwide persecution that was foretold to come upon Christ’s faithful followers, just how the willing “captives” of the victorious Jesus Christ ever escaped being wiped out of existence is a wonder. It can only be explained by the fact that Jehovah is a “God of saving acts” and to him “belong the ways out from death.” In this connection we must remember that from 1918 onward till Armageddon God cut short the days of the tribulation upon the worldly nations and kingdoms. He did this, as Jesus Christ foretold, for the sake of his chosen ones, in order that some flesh might be saved on earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967803/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Matt. 24:21, 22</a>) This cutting short of the tribulation has worked out for the salvation of even the anointed remnant of those whom God has chosen for the heavenly kingdom with Christ.</p>

How thankful the Christian witnesses of Jehovah can be that at their Disciple-making District Assemblies last year they received a detailed explanation of this psalm! And in particular do they have cause for rejoicing that all of Jehovah’s people today can have a share in letting all men see Jehovah’s victory processions. “They have seen your processions, O God, the processions of my God, my King, into the holy place.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 68:24</a>.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1968486/0">a</a></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Among the first of Jehovah’s victory processions recorded in the Word of God was that which took place at the time that Jehovah God gave his people Israel the victory over the pursuing Egyptians under Pharaoh by drowning them all in the Red Sea. There Moses and the sons of Israel sang a song of victory in which the women joined, dancing, playing tambourines and singing in response to the men.

All the preaching that Jehovah’s people do even today is a part of this victory procession.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Mark 13:10</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Since then Jehovah God has also given other victories to his people. Bitterly opposed by religious and political foes, the Witnesses have won victories in the courts of the land and before other governmental bodies, particularly in the United States, but also in Canada, Great Britain, Germany and elsewhere. As a result bans have been lifted, their form of worship has been recognized and they have been given constitutional or other legal guarantees and protection in many lands.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Taking the lead in these victory processions are “the gifts in the form of men,” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 68:18</a>. Who are these? The apostle Paul tells us: “He gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelizers, some as shepherds and teachers, with a view to the training of the holy ones, for ministerial work, . . . until we all attain to the oneness in the faith and in the accurate knowledge of the Son of God, to a full-grown man.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Eph. 4:11-13</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">While it is the men that have taken the lead in these victory processions, women have had no insignificant part therein, even as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">verse 11 of Psalm 68</a> tells: “Jehovah himself gives the saying; the women telling the good news are a large army.” How true it is that the women publishing the good news are a large army! By far the majority of the more than one million Kingdom proclaimers going from house to house, making return visits, conducting Bible studies in the homes of the people and standing on the street corners preaching the good news are womenfolk! And most of them do this while at the same time caring for their families.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 68</a> also tells “congregated throngs” to bless Jehovah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps 68 Vs. 26</a>) What congregated throngs have been doing this in modern times, as at the gathering of more than a quarter of a million persons at Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds in New York city in the summer of 1958! Beginning with July this year there will be still more congregated throngs blessing Jehovah throughout the northern hemisphere as the Christian witnesses of Jehovah meet at their four-day “Good News for All Nations” District Assemblies. Surely these assemblies will help many more persons to see Jehovah’s victory processions!</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">So let every dedicated Christian living in lands where these assemblies are to be held put forth every effort to attend an assembly. More than that, let all such attend fully conscious of their spiritual need, and so be present at all sessions, paying close attention and taking notes. At the same time let them resolve also to know the ‘greater happiness that comes from giving’ by contributing in various ways to the success of these assemblies, thus sharing in letting all men see Jehovah’s victory processions.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 5:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Acts 20:35</a>.</p>

The apostle Paul tells us: “He gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelizers, some as shepherds and teachers, with a view to the training of the holy ones, for ministerial work, . . . until we all attain to the oneness in the faith and in the accurate knowledge of the Son of God, to a full-grown man.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Eph. 4:11-13</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">While it is the men that have taken the lead in these victory processions, women have had no insignificant part therein, even as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">verse 11 of Psalm 68</a> tells: “Jehovah himself gives the saying; the women telling the good news are a large army.” How true it is that the women publishing the good news are a large army! By far the majority of the more than one million Kingdom proclaimers going from house to house, making return visits, conducting Bible studies in the homes of the people and standing on the street corners preaching the good news are womenfolk! And most of them do this while at the same time caring for their families.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 68</a> also tells “congregated throngs” to bless Jehovah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps 68 Vs. 26</a>) What congregated throngs have been doing this in modern times, as at the gathering of more than a quarter of a million persons at Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds in New York city in the summer of 1958! Beginning with July this year there will be still more congregated throngs blessing Jehovah throughout the northern hemisphere as the Christian witnesses of Jehovah meet at their four-day “Good News for All Nations” District Assemblies. Surely these assemblies will help many more persons to see Jehovah’s victory processions!</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">So let every dedicated Christian living in lands where these assemblies are to be held put forth every effort to attend an assembly. More than that, let all such attend fully conscious of their spiritual need, and so be present at all sessions, paying close attention and taking notes. At the same time let them resolve also to know the ‘greater happiness that comes from giving’ by contributing in various ways to the success of these assemblies, thus sharing in letting all men see Jehovah’s victory processions.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 5:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968486/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Acts 20:35</a>.</p>

Like Jesus then, we do not now ask for these legions <span id="page188" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="188" data-before-text="188"></span>of angels to intervene in a violent way for us before the divine time. Yet we know they surround us with their protection. “The angel of Jehovah encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ps. 34:7</a>, <em>AS</em>) We know that at present they are “spirits for public service” whom God sends forth to minister to his Kingdom heirs and their companions of good will. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Heb. 1:14</a>, <em>NW</em>) Take courage, then, even though you seem standing alone.

He bestowed the birthright to the great Abrahamic promise upon Jacob and changed his name to Israel. We may be sure that he loves his spiritual Israel today, those who are Israelites inwardly by faith in Jehovah and in his promised Seed Jesus Christ. And now their good-will companions are beloved with them. Having the God of Jacob as our lofty retreat, there is no need for us to organize refuge farms in isolated places, retire to ourselves there and quit the field of activity as Kingdom publishers. Trust in the great God of Jacob is not demonstrated by hiding in seclusion but is demonstrated by courageously going forth onto the field of action and spreading his message of life. “Jehovah preserveth the faithful.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 31:23</a>, <em>AS</em>) Retreating into him as our high tower means to keep in unity with him wherever we may be in the line of duty. That way we stay inside the organization of his theocratic people who are scattered all over the earth. By carrying out organization instructions as contained in God’s Word, we work like our fellow witnesses everywhere else. Unitedly we publish the name and government of Jehovah, bidding all life-seekers to take refuge under Him.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">22.

And who will make lasting peace, and how?</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> Wonderful it will be to realize the third and last stanza of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Psalm 46</a>. It takes the viewpoint of a survivor after the world calamity of Armageddon: “Come view the doings of Jehovah, who hath set desolations in the earth: causing wars to cease unto the end of the earth, the bow he breaketh and cutteth asunder the spear, waggons he burneth with fire.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps. 46:8, 9</a>, <em>Ro. Pss</em>.) This invitation, uttered by those within the visible organization of Jehovah God, positively assures us there will be survivors on earth after Armageddon will have swept away this old world with the broom of destruction and cleansed the earth for the righteous new world. The survivors will be informed and will know it is Jehovah by his mighty Warrior Jesus Christ who has set the then visible desolations in the earth. Such desolations will not have destroyed the earth or ruined it beyond restoration to a paradise state like the garden of Eden. They will only have ‘brought to ruin those ruining the earth’. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Rev. 11:18</a>, <em>NW</em>) God will not destroy his footstool, the earth, but will glorify it under the kingdom of his Christ. Thus it is Jehovah by Christ who ends all forms of war on the earth by destroying all the warmongers, ‘scattering the peoples that delight in war’ and demolishing their terrible weapons of war.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ps. 68:30</a>.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">23.

Pss.], and know that I am <span id="page189" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="189" data-before-text="189"></span>God: I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.” This advice corresponds with that given at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Psalm 2:10-12</a> (<em>AS</em>): “Now therefore be wise, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve Jehovah with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, for his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all they that take refuge in him.” After decades of testimony we may not now expect political and religious rulers to appreciate and follow this advice and learn to know that Jehovah is God in a way that means salvation to them. But we may look for individuals of all nations to desist from all acts against Jehovah and his theocratic organization and to give in, be still and learn to know him and do good to Christ’s brothers. This means everlasting life.</p>

<strong>Ethiopia</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The Ethiopian eunuch who was ‘over the treasures’ of Queen Candace, and to whom Philip preached, was obviously a circumcised Jewish proselyte. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011397/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 8:27-39</a>) He was thus not viewed as a Gentile and hence did not precede Cornelius as the first uncircumcised Gentile convert to Christianity. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011397/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts chap. 10</a>) For him to engage in worship at the temple in Jerusalem would require that the Ethiopian have been converted to the Jewish religion and aIso his having been circumcised. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011397/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ex. 12:48, 49;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011397/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Lev. 24:22</a>) In view of the Mosaic law forbidding the entry of castrated persons into the congregation of Israel (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011397/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Deut. 23:1</a>), it is evident that the Ethiopian was not a eunuch in a fleshly sense. The Hebrew word for “eunuch” (<em>sa·ris</em>ʹ) in a broad or special sense also meant an officer, as at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011397/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Genesis 39:1</a>, where an officer of Pharaoh, Potiphar, a married man, is called a <em>sa·risʹ.</em> Had he been an actual eunuch the Ethiopian officer would not have been a proselyte and, if not <span id="page535" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="535" data-before-text="535"></span>a proselyte, Philip would not have baptized him, since the good news had not yet begun to be extended to the uncircumcised Gentiles.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Ethiopia (Cush) is one of the lands among which the Jewish exiles were scattered after the Babylonian conquest of Judah.

Egyptian hieroglyphic writing was being used for official Ethiopian inscriptions. A native language and script called Meroitic is known from the century prior to the start of the Common Era and for some centuries thereafter. The language called Ethiopic was the vernacular language during the Common Era up until the fourteenth century. It is of Semitic origin as is the present-day language of modern Ethiopia called Amharic. The <em>Encyclopedia Americana</em> (1956 ed., Vol. 10, p. 547) states that during the time of Roman control there was a great influx of Arabian peoples into this region and that the population continued to be mainly Arabian from the fourth century C.E. on.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"></p>
