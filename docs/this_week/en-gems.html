Noah “proved himself faultless among his contemporaries” as a man who “walked with the true God.” That faithful patriarch and his family survived the Flood because he pursued the life course outlined by Jehovah.

<strong>Painting With Words</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Solomon and his father, David, wrote in the traditional Hebrew form of their day. Hebrew verse, which was often sung to musical accompaniment, is not dependent on rhyme. Rather, it is noted for its rhythm of thought, or ideas—a literary form called <em>parallelism.</em> Lines may be synonymous in expression, or they may present contrasting thoughts. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102001408/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 37:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102001408/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 9</a>) Often the second line expands the thought of the first by adding something fresh. Observe how this is done at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102001408/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 119:1</a>:</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sp"><em>Happy are the ones faultless in their way,</em></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sz"><em>The ones walking in the law of Jehovah.</em></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Note how the second line reveals what it means to be faultless, namely, to walk in the law of Jehovah. Because Biblical Hebrew employs parallelism, or sense rhythm, rather than rhyme, it is more readily translated.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/102001408/1">b</a></p>

<strong>Happiness Despite a Lawless, Loveless World</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[25]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> A man who anciently qualified for enjoying such happinesses as were set forth by the Jewish Messiah, Jesus Christ, was the inspired Jewish writer of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 119</a>, the longest psalm of the Bible. In line with the reasons given by Jesus Christ for being happy, the psalmist was conscious of his spiritual need. Also, he <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>was mournful, he was mild-tempered, he hungered and thirsted for righteousness, he was merciful, he was reproached and persecuted, and he had every sort of wicked thing lyingly said against him. He wrote the psalm hundreds of years before our Common Era, while the nation of Israel was still under the Law covenant that had been mediated by the prophet Moses between Jehovah God and the nation in 1513 B.C.E. at Mount Sinai. Properly the psalmist had no fault to find with the Law of that covenant, for it was God-given. He well knew that the pagan nations all around the land of Israel had nothing to compare with that divine Law. He looked upon it as most enlightening, saying in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps 119 verses 105 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 130</a>: “Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light to my roadway. The very disclosure of your words gives light, making the inexperienced ones understand.”</p>

Witnesses of Jehovah have suffered persecution inside and outside the lands of Christendom in which they are under ban at the present time. However, the enemy has failed in the purpose of his foul, unjustified persecution! To the amazement of the enemy, the Witnesses who are “walking in the law of Jehovah” and “observing his reminders” are moved to rejoice over their sufferings for Jehovah God and his Christ. They are reminded of what Jesus Christ said in his list of happinesses: “Happy are you poor, because yours is the kingdom of God. Happy are you whenever men hate you, and whenever they exclude you and reproach you and cast out your name as wicked for the sake of the Son of man. Rejoice in that day and leap, for, look! your reward is great in heaven, for those are the same things their forefathers used to do to the prophets [including the psalmist].” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Psalm 119:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/35/1" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> Luke 6:20,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/35/2" data-bid="36-3" class="b"> 22, 23</a>) Sharing in Jehovah’s delight, his persecuted Witnesses continue to “magnify the law and make it majestic.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Isaiah 42:21</a>.</p>

Do we want to be happy? We can be. How? There are twenty-four happinesses or beatitudes in the Psalms that tell us the secret of how to be happy with the happiness that will never end. It is instructive for us to hear some of these beatitudes! The very book of Psalms opens with a beatitude, “Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked ones, and in the way of sinners has not stood and in the seat of ridiculers has not sat. But his delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1, 2</a>) The beatitude in the Second Psalm is one that not only world rulers but all of us under the shadow of Armageddon ought to heed: “Serve Jehovah with fear and be joyful with trembling. Kiss the son, that He may not become incensed and you may not perish [from] the way, for his anger flares up easily. Happy are all those taking refuge in him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Ps. 2:11, 12</a>.</p><p id="p98" data-pid="98" class="qu">38.

Jehovah himself will guard him and preserve him alive. He will be pronounced happy in the earth, and you cannot possibly give him over to the soulful desire of his enemies.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Ps. 41:1, 2</a>, <em>margin</em>) Correction from Jehovah is meant to result in our happiness: “Happy is the able-bodied man whom you correct, O Jah, and whom you teach out of your own law, to give him quietness from days of calamity, until for the wicked one a pit is excavated.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/60/0" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Ps. 94:12, 13</a>) Obedience to God’s command results in unusual happiness: “Happy is the man in fear of Jehovah, in whose commandments he has taken very much delight.” “Happy are the ones faultless in [their] way, the ones walking in the law of Jehovah.

As we approach the day of days when Jehovah will make wars to cease to the extremity of the earth, breaking the enemy armaments to pieces and setting astonishing events in the earth, we need to keep united as his people and to meet together as often as can be arranged. “Look! how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Ps. 133:1</a>) To promote that goodness and pleasantness of unitedly dwelling together we should take hold of the opportunity and build one another up as fellow believers <span id="page637" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="637" data-before-text="637"></span>and fellow servants. We meet, not only to praise the universal Sovereign and his kingdom, but to help one another to praise him before people on the outside who need salvation. Our determination should be: “As for me, in my integrity I shall walk. O redeem me and show me favor. My own foot will certainly stand on a level place; among the congregated throngs I shall bless Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/65/0" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Ps. 26:11, 12</a>) “I will laud you in the big congregation; among a numerous people I shall praise you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/66/0" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Ps. 35:18</a>.</p>

Despite the psalmist’s repeated use of these words that may sound legalistic, there is no evidence that he was a professional lawyer or jurist or even a judge. He was foremost a student of Jehovah’s recorded Word, which fact is borne out by his use of the expression “your word” 15 times.

Do we want to be happy? We can be. How? There are twenty-four happinesses or beatitudes in the Psalms that tell us the secret of how to be happy with the happiness that will never end. It is instructive for us to hear some of these beatitudes! The very book of Psalms opens with a beatitude, “Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked ones, and in the way of sinners has not stood and in the seat of ridiculers has not sat. But his delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1, 2</a>) The beatitude in the Second Psalm is one that not only world rulers but all of us under the shadow of Armageddon ought to heed: “Serve Jehovah with fear and be joyful with trembling. Kiss the son, that He may not become incensed and you may not perish [from] the way, for his anger flares up easily. Happy are all those taking refuge in him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Ps. 2:11, 12</a>.</p><p id="p98" data-pid="98" class="qu">38.

Jehovah himself will guard him and preserve him alive. He will be pronounced happy in the earth, and you cannot possibly give him over to the soulful desire of his enemies.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Ps. 41:1, 2</a>, <em>margin</em>) Correction from Jehovah is meant to result in our happiness: “Happy is the able-bodied man whom you correct, O Jah, and whom you teach out of your own law, to give him quietness from days of calamity, until for the wicked one a pit is excavated.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/60/0" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Ps. 94:12, 13</a>) Obedience to God’s command results in unusual happiness: “Happy is the man in fear of Jehovah, in whose commandments he has taken very much delight.” “Happy are the ones faultless in [their] way, the ones walking in the law of Jehovah.

As we approach the day of days when Jehovah will make wars to cease to the extremity of the earth, breaking the enemy armaments to pieces and setting astonishing events in the earth, we need to keep united as his people and to meet together as often as can be arranged. “Look! how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Ps. 133:1</a>) To promote that goodness and pleasantness of unitedly dwelling together we should take hold of the opportunity and build one another up as fellow believers <span id="page637" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="637" data-before-text="637"></span>and fellow servants. We meet, not only to praise the universal Sovereign and his kingdom, but to help one another to praise him before people on the outside who need salvation. Our determination should be: “As for me, in my integrity I shall walk. O redeem me and show me favor. My own foot will certainly stand on a level place; among the congregated throngs I shall bless Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/65/0" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Ps. 26:11, 12</a>) “I will laud you in the big congregation; among a numerous people I shall praise you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/66/0" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Ps. 35:18</a>.</p>

Drug abuse also causes many problems, cutting some young lives short. Debased music; violent and immoral films, TV shows, and videos; and pornography on the Internet exert a devastating influence on the young. Therefore, the question asked by the psalmist is very much on the minds of many parents and youths today.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">To his own question, the same psalmist provided this answer: “By keeping on guard according to your word.” Certainly, God’s Word, the Bible, contains fine direction for young people, and by following it, many youths are having success in life. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002723/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 119:105</a>) Let us examine some examples of youths who love God and who endeavor to remain spiritually strong in a pleasure-seeking and materialistic world.</p>

Neglecting theocratic association, they strike up friendships with worldly vacationers. Reasoning that these are ‘really nice people,’ some Christians have joined them in questionable activities.

<strong>Youth, Get Saved from This Crooked Generation</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> This whole world is geared to cater to the “desire of the eyes,” and especially to the eyes of youth. Every weapon of its advertising arsenal is used to bombard the mind of youth, your mind, with its cheap, blatant, often dishonest come-on techniques. Doubtless you have often reproved baby brother or sister for her endless cry “I want that, I want that,” as each new bauble comes to view. But are teen-agers any better? It is true they want more expensive baubles such as automobiles, lots of clothing in the most up-to-date mode, the latest in hi-fi; in fact, all kinds of gadgets the possession of which makes them no happier. But they are still suffering from a childish mania for possessing everything they see. If life in a new system of things is really what you want, then you will have to learn to say No to the “desire of the eyes.” And this does not mean closing your eyes so that you will not be able to see this world’s gaudy window display. Jesus warns: “Keep your eyes open and guard against every sort of covetousness, because even when a person has an abundance <span id="page146" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="146" data-before-text="146"></span>his life does not result from the things he possesses.” And again: “What benefit will it be to a man if he gains the whole world but forfeits his soul?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964164/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 12:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964164/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Matt. 16:26</a>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 8.

Youths and adults who fashion their lives according to this world’s standards, who are unduly concerned about what their chums or their neighbors think about them, have really made little advance from the infant stage when they proudly held out some shiny bagatelle and said: “Look what I have!” In order to be popular, to show that one is just as good as anyone else, youth of today will do anything, however ludicrous or senseless it may be. They quickly fall in line with and adopt each new kind of haircut or hairdo. Every fashion fad that comes along is succumbed to, even if it gives them the freakish or the sexy look. They will spend hour after hour on the dance floor going through all sorts of contortions to the beat of the modern tom-toms. Practically everything they do is dictated by majority rule, gang rule. The desire to be well thought of leads youth into degrading and hurtful practices such as smoking, excessive drinking, drug addiction, as well as loose and immoral living. Instead of setting before themselves a good example or a high standard, they are content to settle for the very low average. Parents often hear the expression, “Everyone else is doing it, so why not me?” presented as a strong argument.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 9.

<strong>Bring Your Heart Back to Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">However, such Bible study must be more than just an absorbing of facts.

It comes from a root meaning simply “to say” and so refers to something said.

This world stresses mental brilliance, but Jehovah looks on the heart. What good is the world’s wisdom when out of a wicked heart it is moved to misuse it and make it foolish in Jehovah’s sight? Is it not better to have an average mind directed into right uses by a good heart than to have a brilliant one misdirected into harmful channels by an evil heart? Do not world leaders even now admit that it is the world’s morals rather than its brains that cry for improvement? But this wicked system refuses the change of heart it needs for survival of Jehovah’s war of Armageddon, though many individuals are abandoning it in order to get the heart change required for preservation, namely, the erasing of wrong precepts from the figurative heart and getting Jehovah’s law written there in their place. How is this done? Please read the next article for the answer.</p>

It should therefore be done conscientiously and with the benefit of prayer. Study is a part of our worship and is done to improve our worship.</p>

<strong>“Do Not Forget All His Doings”</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Humankind is the creation of Jehovah God. He knows better how we should conduct our lives and live them than anyone else does. Educators and scientists think they know better how to teach and conduct the lives of children. Parents who believe the Word of God and observe God’s commandments, however, are the ones that have the responsibility. It cannot be given to the State. The Israelites were instructed to teach their children the things <span id="page14" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>that they saw and heard and to inculcate in the minds of their children the principles of truth and righteousness. The State is not doing this, and every year fewer people teach their children what the Bible counsels. Every person who professes to be a true Christian should say: “With your orders I will concern myself, and I will look to your paths. For your statutes I shall show a fondness. I shall not forget your word.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969002/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 119:15, 16</a>) How pointed and direct this advice! Have you concerned yourself as to what Jehovah’s statutes are? Do you want to know the orders of God and his regulations for proper living? Even in the normal processes of life most people recognize order and law and get acquainted with the rules of the land, but far more important are the laws that Jehovah has had written. These pertain to our living, and our children’s living, forever. We must show a fondness for His statutes, and we must not forget his Word, the Holy Bible. Teach them to your children.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu">13.

They study the Bible in five meetings each week. That does not mean that they will remember every scripture and be able to quote the whole Bible verse by verse, but by reading the Bible regularly they will get the overall picture of what Jehovah’s way of life is for mankind, what his principles of truth and righteousness are; and they appreciate the way that they should conduct their lives in relationship to others, their children and neighbors, and especially in relationship to God.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">14.

Jehovah does not force one to do something. Really one’s life, or whatever life one will have in the future, is dependent on one’s own course of action. Hence one dare not forget the law of God. One must know right from wrong. Through speaking the truth one feels confident that Jehovah will find pleasure in the voluntary offerings of one’s mouth. At all times one must be very much interested in having Jehovah God teach one his own judicial decisions, that is, Jehovah’s judicial decisions. A person does not want to be the judge as to what is right and what is wrong. God makes the judicial decisions. We must get in line with them for our own welfare. It pays to do what is right. A Christian wants Jehovah God to state what is the right way, the correct course to take. The Christian must make the decision. No one else can, because the Christian knows that he personally is responsible to God, the Giver of life.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">15.

Jehovah said to the man: “From every tree of the garden you may eat to satisfaction. But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad you must not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will positively die.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969002/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Gen. 2:16, 17</a>) God was not making it difficult for the first man that he created and put in the paradise of Eden to keep on living. Of all of the trees in the garden—and there may have been thousands of them—he could freely eat, but there was just one he should not eat from, at least for the present. After God created Adam he created a helpmate, Eve. He saw that it was not good for the man to continue by himself. When Adam saw Eve after she was created from his rib, Adam exclaimed: <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>“This is at last bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.

But one day Satan by the form of the serpent began to say to the woman: “‘Is it really so that God said you must not eat from every tree of the garden?’ At this the woman said to the serpent: ‘Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat. But as for eating of the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden, God has said, “You must not eat from it, no, you must not touch it that you do not die.’” At this the serpent said to the woman: ‘You positively will not die. For God knows that in the very day of your eating from it your eyes are bound to be opened and you are bound to be like God, knowing good and bad.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969002/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Gen. 3:1-5</a>.</p>

May all men of good will see the wonderful things Jehovah’s law teaches and have the same desire as the psalmist had: “Uncover my eyes, that I may look at the wonderful things out of your law.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959605/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 119:18</a>) Soon Jehovah will demonstrate in His battle of Armageddon that His law is supreme and that there is no authority in heaven or on earth above His law. It is a very dangerous attempt to put human laws above God’s law. Therefore Jehovah’s witnesses uphold and maintain their loyalty toward Jehovah’s law, and no power can legally force them to transgress this unique law or make them put imperfect, failing man-made laws first and God’s law second.

<strong>Reminders and Orders of the God of a New System</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> What a fine standard the psalmist set for true Christians associated with Jehovah’s visible organization in the midst of this lawless, loveless world! Living up to it has proved rewarding. In their environment filled with enemies of their God, they feel just as the psalmist did, like an “alien resident.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984448/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 119:19,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984448/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 54</a>) Yet they feel that nothing matches God’s regulations for proper living. They had a narrow escape during World War I of 1914-18. During those war-mad years the enemies reached high up into the personnel of Jehovah’s visible organization to hasten the destruction of his people, even to the point of wrongly imprisoning the president and other highly responsible men at the headquarters of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. The experience was like what <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984448/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Psalm 119:69</a> describes: “The presumptuous have smeared me with falsehood.

By means of the Kingdom message proclaimed worldwide by Jehovah’s Witnesses, Jehovah has rebuked these cursed ones, just as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 119:21</a> says: “You have rebuked the cursed presumptuous ones, who are straying from your commandments.” Far different is the case of the faithful ones whom such presumptuous persecutors reproach and revile, just as was the case with the psalmist: “The presumptuous ones themselves have derided me to the extreme.

Some of these reminders come to the fore during personal Bible reading, while others take the form of information or comments presented at Christian meetings. Much of what we read or hear on these occasions is not new to us. Likely, we have considered similar information before. Since we are inclined to forget, though, we continually need to refresh our memories with regard to Jehovah’s purposes, laws, and instructions. We should appreciate God’s reminders. They renew our spirit by helping us to keep in focus the reasons that motivated us to adopt a godly life course. Thus, the psalmist sang to Jehovah: “Your reminders are what I am fond of.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006446/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 119:24</a>.</p>

<strong>Where to Turn for Counsel</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">In psychoanalysis there is also the great danger that the analyst may impose his own values on you, confusing his personal ideals with impersonal truths. Patients often develop an exaggerated admiration for their analysts. As Abraham Kaplan, professor of philosophy and member of the Academy of Psychoanalysis, warned: “The <span id="page39" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="39" data-before-text="39"></span>danger here is that the analyst may accept the role of omniscient moral authority in which the patient casts him.” But the analyst is not an all-wise authority on morals, as Kaplan readily admits: “Psychoanalysis cannot tell us what is virtuous and what is not. It cannot establish premises to deduce the principles of morality.” Obviously, psychoanalysis is not the answer to some very basic questions. If it helps people get on the go again, it does not point them in God’s direction. Being able to travel is not enough; you must know where you are going. If psychoanalysis cannot tell us what is moral or immoral in the sight of God, who judges our actions, then it is hardly a safe guide.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>THE IDEAL COUNSEL</strong></p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The ideal counsel must be convenient, understandable, available to all and inexpensive. It must give right moral standards and direction, and it should be absolutely correct. Is there such counsel available today? Yes, there is. The Creator saw to that when he provided the sixty-six inspired books of the Holy Bible. Here you find counsel that is convenient, inexpensive and completely reliable. In contrast to the human counselors who have lived short lives and often erred, the eternal God who gives counsel has “done wonderful things, counsels from early times, in faithfulness, in trustworthiness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963041/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 25:1</a>) Through his book of counsel God gives commandments, instruction, discipline, wisdom and understanding for successful living. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963041/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Prov. 4:1-9</a>) The Bible’s power for lighting your way was aptly expressed by the inspired psalmist: “Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light to my roadway.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963041/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 119:105</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Sacred history contains many examples of persons who faced personal crises and came through them successfully by heeding Jehovah God’s advice. The record also contains the tragic cases of men and women whose lives and eternal hopes were lost by ignoring or opposing Jehovah’s counsel. It is for our lasting benefit that the heavenly Father admonishes: “My son, my law do not forget, and my commandments may your heart observe, because length of days and years of life and peace will be added to you. Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding. In all your ways take notice of him, and he himself will make your paths straight.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963041/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Prov. 3:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963041/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 5, 6</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">In God’s book of counsel you will find, among other things, practical advice on marriage problems, child training, chastity, right view of money, good manners, how to handle disputes, business and labor practices, peace of mind, happiness, how to pray and the proper worship of your Creator. Thoroughly discussed is God’s purpose for man and this earth. You will learn why God has permitted wickedness for a time, how his Kingdom will usher in a new world of life and righteousness, and when he will resurrect the remembered dead. In the Bible is hope for the future and courage for the present. This counsel from God is in your own home, in your own copy of the Bible.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Turn to the Bible for God’s advice. Put Scriptural principles into practice and you will see how clearly and wisely they light your path. Then, like the psalmist, you will confidently say: “Your reminders are what I am fond of, as men of my counsel.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963041/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 119:24</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"></p>

Very likely, ‘his soul was sleepless from grief’ because of such circumstances. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005283/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Psalm 119:28</a>) But Hezekiah trusted in God, was a good king, and did “what was right in Jehovah’s eyes.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005283/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">2 Kings 18:1-5</a>) With reliance on God, we too can endure trials as integrity keepers.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005283/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">James 1:5-8</a>.</p>

The 119th Psalm is of interest, for some believe that Hezekiah composed it, doing this while still a prince. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997523/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 119:46,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997523/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 99, 100</a>) So his circumstances may be indicated by the words: “Even princes have sat; against me they have spoken with one another. As for your servant, he concerns himself with your regulations. My soul has been sleepless from grief.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997523/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 119:23,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997523/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 28</a>) Surrounded by practicers of false religion, Hezekiah may have become an object of scorn among members of the royal court, so much so that sleep was difficult. Yet, he pursued virtue, in time became king, and “continued to do what was right in Jehovah’s eyes . . . In Jehovah the God of Israel he trusted.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997523/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Kings 18:1-5</a>.</p>

<strong>A “Simple Eye” Is Needed</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Effort is required to maintain a “simple” eye, one that does not look desiringly upon what is wrong. There being sinful inclinations within us, we should at all times strive to keep these under control, praying that we do not begin to look upon something bad as desirable. This would be in keeping with the prayerful expression of the psalmist: “Make my eyes pass on from seeing what is worthless.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973485/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 119:37</a>.</p>

<strong>Happiness Despite a Lawless, Loveless World</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[28]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> In that opening stanza of 8 Hebrew lines we note the key words <em>law, reminders, orders, regulations, commandments,</em> and <em>judicial decisions.</em> All through the 176 Hebrew verses, the psalmist emphasizes those words. For example, he uses the word “law” 25 times, “reminders” 22 times, “orders” 21 times, “regulations” 21 times, “commandments” 20 times, “judicial decision(s)” 21 times, with the related word “commandment” being used twice in the psalm. Despite the psalmist’s repeated use of these words that may sound legalistic, there is no evidence that he was a professional lawyer or jurist or even a judge. He was foremost a student of Jehovah’s recorded Word, which fact is borne out by his use of the expression “your word” 15 times. If he was the king of the nation of Israel, he was under the divine command to write a personal copy of the Law of Jehovah’s covenant with Israel for his own study and use. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 17:14-18</a>) The psalmist did not find the close study of Jehovah’s “word” <span id="page16" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>with these features in mind to be boring, wearisome. He longed for what would help him to be law-abiding.

He should seek for counsel on the problem, first, from the Bible. As the psalmist said: “I have called with my whole heart. Answer me, O Jehovah. Your regulations I will observe.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978087/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ps. 119:145</a>) God, knowing our problems in advance, saw to it that counsel on all human problems was written in his inspired Word. The person may also consult others who can help him to see what the Bible says on the matter, even seeking their prayers in his behalf. He should persist in praying until he gets a clear understanding on what is the wise course to take. If he does not do so, he will not be showing God that he has faith or that he is really concerned about getting God’s answer. That was the point in Jesus’ parable about the widow who persisted in appealing to the judge for relief before he finally granted it.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978087/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Luke 18:1-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978087/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Jas. 1:5-8</a>.</p>

<strong>Psalm 119 Magnifies Jehovah’s Word</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">With reference to God’s stated purpose for his servants, there is another Hebrew word, <em>e·dah’,</em> translated REMINDERS (“instructions,” <em>NE</em>). This can mean a witness or a testimony, and it comes from a root meaning to go over again, to repeat, for which reason it is translated “reminders” (<em>NW</em>). The psalmist expresses great appreciation for these reminders and repeatedly tells of having kept them.

In marked contrast with such breakers of the law of God’s new covenant, which commands brotherly love, the psalmist said as a pattern for Jehovah’s Witnesses of today: “Falsehood I have hated, and I do keep detesting it. Your law I have loved.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Psalm 119:163</a>) He desired to be wholehearted in his law keeping. He expresses his dislike of a halfhearted, lukewarm attitude, saying: “The halfhearted ones I have hated, but your law I have loved.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Psalm 119:113</a>) This is how Jesus Christ feels toward Christendom today, for it resembles the congregation in ancient Laodicea.

There can be no straddling of the fence. Warm love must be the moving force behind obedience to God. Jehovah could never inspire a wholehearted servant of his to say anything less forceful than this: “I shall show a fondness for your commandments that I have loved.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Psalm 119:47</a>.</p>

It should therefore be done conscientiously and with the benefit of prayer. Study is a part of our worship and is done to improve our worship.</p>

<strong>Happiness Despite a Lawless, Loveless World</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Persecution on a world scale was foretold for Jehovah’s Witnesses during these last days of this dying old system of things under the unyielding rule of the symbolic dragon, Satan the Devil. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Revelation 12:17</a> points out his target, saying: “The dragon grew wrathful at the woman [Jehovah’s wifelike organization], and went off to wage war with the remaining ones of her seed [aside from the newborn Kingdom], who observe the commandments of God and have the work of bearing witness to Jesus.” The persecution comes principally from those who presume to stray away from what God commands for these last days of the dragon’s visible system of things on earth. By means of the Kingdom message proclaimed worldwide by Jehovah’s Witnesses, Jehovah has rebuked these cursed ones, just as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 119:21</a> says: “You have rebuked the cursed presumptuous ones, who are straying from your commandments.” Far different is the case of the faithful ones whom such presumptuous persecutors reproach and revile, just as was the case with the psalmist: “The presumptuous ones themselves have derided me to the extreme. From your law I have not deviated.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Psalm 119:51</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">13. (a) Despite the wicked designs of persecutors, to what outcome does keeping God’s law lead?

So with no maliciousness the psalmist could pray: “Let the presumptuous <span id="page19" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>ones be ashamed, for without cause they have misled me. As for me, I concern myself with your orders.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 119:78</a>) Jehovah makes sure that even the persecution works out for good and that the persecutors do not really fraudulently gain anything. He responds to the prayer of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Psalm 119:122</a>: “Act as a surety for your servant for what is good. May the presumptuous ones not defraud me.” Death on a mass scale threatened Jehovah’s Witnesses during the dictatorships of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, but by not forgetting the law and commandments of their God, they stood firm and many survived. In the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Psalm 119:60, 61</a>, the survivors can say: “I hurried up, and I did not delay to keep your commandments. The very ropes of the wicked ones surrounded me. Your law I did not forget.” The Almighty God is able to cut or break asunder the ropes of restraint tied about his Witnesses by their enemies and thus to free his servants in his due time for the work that he has ordained for them to do during this conclusion of the system of things.</p>

Living up to it has proved rewarding. In their environment filled with enemies of their God, they feel just as the psalmist did, like an “alien resident.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984448/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 119:19,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984448/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 54</a>) Yet they feel that nothing matches God’s regulations for proper living. They had a narrow escape during World War I of 1914-18. During those war-mad years the enemies reached high up into the personnel of Jehovah’s visible organization to hasten the destruction of his people, even to the point of wrongly imprisoning the president and other highly responsible men at the headquarters of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. The experience was like what <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984448/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Psalm 119:69</a> describes: “The presumptuous have smeared me with falsehood.

As for me, I concern myself with your orders.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 119:78</a>) Jehovah makes sure that even the persecution works out for good and that the persecutors do not really fraudulently gain anything. He responds to the prayer of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Psalm 119:122</a>: “Act as a surety for your servant for what is good. May the presumptuous ones not defraud me.” Death on a mass scale threatened Jehovah’s Witnesses during the dictatorships of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, but by not forgetting the law and commandments of their God, they stood firm and many survived. In the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Psalm 119:60, 61</a>, the survivors can say: “I hurried up, and I did not delay to keep your commandments. The very ropes of the wicked ones surrounded me. Your law I did not forget.” The Almighty God is able to cut or break asunder the ropes of restraint tied about his Witnesses by their enemies and thus to free his servants in his due time for the work that he has ordained for them to do during this conclusion of the system of things.</p>

<strong>Are You Truly a Spiritual Person?</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Prayer is also an invaluable aid to bring our thoughts toward those of God. The humble person, when talking to Jehovah in prayer, is reminded of how far removed he is from God’s perfection and of his need to wrench his thinking away from the world and to elevate it like Jehovah’s. “Pray incessantly,” therefore, is good advice. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974246/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:17</a>) That is, besides praying regularly on occasions customarily set aside for it in the congregation or in your family, develop an inclination toward prayer, a readiness throughout each day and night to look constantly for Jehovah’s direction. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974246/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Psalm 119:62</a>.)

<strong>What Does the Bible Say About Friendship?</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>The Bible teaches that good friendships should be based on something deeper than similar interests or hobbies. For example, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/500100116/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 119:63</a> states: “I am a friend of all who fear you<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/500100116/0">a</a> and of those who keep your orders.” Note that the Bible writer states that he chose friends who have a healthy fear of displeasing God and a desire to live by God’s standards.</p>

<strong>Choose Your Friends Wisely</strong><br/><h1 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>Choose Your Friends Wisely</strong></h1><p id="p3" data-pid="3">Close friends add to our happiness during good times, and they strengthen us during hard times. But the Bible warns us that not everyone is a good friend. So how can you choose good friends? Consider the following questions.</p><h3 class="du-color--purple-600 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>1. How will the friends you choose affect you?</strong></h3><p id="p5" data-pid="5">We tend to become like the people we spend time with. This can be good or bad​—and that is true whether we spend time with them in person or on social media. As the Bible says, <strong>“the one walking with the wise will become wise, but the one who has dealings with the stupid [those who do not love Jehovah] will fare badly.”</strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021248/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 13:20</a>) Friends who love and worship Jehovah can help you to stay close to him and to make good decisions. But close friends outside the congregation can cause us to draw away from Jehovah. No wonder the Bible encourages us to choose our friends wisely! When our friends are people who love God, we benefit both ourselves and them. We are able to “keep encouraging one another and building one another up.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021248/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 5:11</a>.</p><h3 class="du-color--purple-600 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>2. How will your choice of friends affect Jehovah?</strong></h3><p id="p7" data-pid="7">Jehovah chooses his friends carefully. <strong>“His close friendship is with the upright.”</strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021248/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:32</a>) How would Jehovah feel if we were to choose friends who do not love him? He would be very disappointed! (Read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021248/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">James 4:4</a>.) On the other hand, Jehovah will be pleased and will choose us as friends if we reject bad association and draw close to him and to those who love him.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021248/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 15:1-4</a>.</p><h2 class="du-color--coolGray-400 du-fontSize--basePlus1 du-letterSpacing--8 du-constrainStylesToTextWidth du-borderStyle-top--solid du-borderColor-top--coolGray-400 du-borderWidth-top--4 du-margin-top--12 du-padding-top--4" id="p8" data-pid="8"><span id="page202" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="202" data-before-text="202"></span><strong>DIG DEEPER</strong></h2><p id="p9" data-pid="9">Examine why our choice of friends is so important, and see how you can develop friendships that will truly enrich your life.</p><h3 class="du-color--purple-600 du-margin-top--0" id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>3.

<strong>Reminders and Orders of the God of a New System</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> As we near the catastrophic end of this lawless, loveless system of things and the end of the separating of the people of the nations, as when a shepherd separates his sheep from the goats, in the company of whom do we want to be found? In the company of the goatlike ones who will be cut off everlastingly from all existence or in the company of sheeplike lovers of Jehovah God? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984448/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Matthew 25:31-46</a>) It is none too soon to choose the right partners. It is now the time to make the choice of the psalmist, who said of the Supreme Being: “A partner I am of all those who do fear you, and of those keeping your orders.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984448/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Psalm 119:63</a>) We know what will be the portion of those who fear Jehovah God, and we want to participate with them in this soul-satisfying portion, to Jehovah’s own joy. Because we love him, we are deeply and constantly concerned with pleasing him by doing what he requires of us. The psalmist well expresses our determination, saying: “With your orders I will concern myself, and I will look to your paths.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984448/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalm 119:15</a>.</p>

<strong>Do You Associate or Merely Attend?</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">This shows that more is required than merely to call another person “brother” or “sister.” Rather, we need to cultivate the close love that really proves us to be <span id="page570" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="570" data-before-text="570"></span>a brother or sister to our Christian associates. It is necessary that we love “neither in word nor with the tongue, but in deed and truth.” The Christian command is “that the one who loves God should be loving his brother also.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969687/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 John 3:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969687/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 4:21</a></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>REAL FRIENDS</strong></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">As already noted, one of the definitions of the word associate is “to join as a friend.” Jehovah’s witnesses frequently use the term “friends” when they refer to their Christian brothers and sisters. But to be a real friend involves more than attending meetings with another, or even being acquainted with another’s name. It means that we have cultivated an affection for the person.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">What is the basis for cultivating real friends? Jesus indicated this when he said: “You are my friends if you do what I am commanding you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969687/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 15:14</a>) This shows that true Christian friendships are established upon mutual interest in doing what Christ commands. Jesus’ friends are those who obey him—it makes no difference to him what their age, national background or race is. So it is among true Christians. Yes, mutual interest in serving God draws them closer together than can even family ties.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Jesus Christ indicated that this is the way it should be. For on one occasion, when it was reported to him that his mother and fleshly brothers wanted to see him, Jesus said: “My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969687/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 8:21</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>COMPANIONSHIP</strong></p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">To associate also involves ‘joining as a companion.’ And what is a companion? He is one who goes along with another, one who shares what another is doing. When you come to meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses, do you really feel that you are a companion of those present, or do you still feel somewhat out of place?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">If you feel awkward, or that you do not ‘fit in,’ could it be that you are not yet fully sharing, or going along with, what Jehovah’s people are doing? Jehovah’s witnesses are devoted completely to ‘preaching the good news of the kingdom in all the inhabited earth before the end comes.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969687/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>) Thus, really to associate as companions with them you need to become involved wholeheartedly in this preaching activity. You need to pursue a course of life that is in complete harmony with Christian principles.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>PARTNERSHIP</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Another definition of the verb associate is ‘to join as a partner.’ A partner is defined as ‘a player on the same side,’ ‘one who shares.’ Do you really feel as a partner to those at the meetings? Do you really feel that you are all on the same side? The Bible psalmist wrote: “A partner I am of all those who do fear you [Jehovah], and of those keeping your orders.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969687/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 119:63</a>) If you are determined to take an uncompromising stand on the side of Jehovah God and his kingdom, you should feel close partnership with those at the meetings.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The psalmist David expressed the feeling of ones who really associate with God’s people when he exclaimed: “I rejoiced when they were saying to me: ‘To the house of Jehovah let us go.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969687/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 122:1</a>) Yes, David rejoiced for the opportunity to associate with the people of God. And notice the expression “let us go.” Not only was he concerned with his own attendance, but he felt close to all those expressing interest in Jehovah’s worship. May you have this same feeling as you share in the meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"></p>

<strong>The Faithful Creator</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> These works astound in their wisdom and scope. How rich is earth’s store of minerals and oil, and how abundant that essential commodity—water! Jehovah made also the air for man to breathe, and to be maintained in freshness and purity—a provision that unthankful men have abused in these “last days” by filling the atmosphere with smog and radioactive fallout. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1, 2</a>) He brought forth a luxuriant variety of plant life, endowed with remarkable powers of photosynthesis, whereby sunlight is captured and built into energy-rich food. And what a wide range of menus he prepared for man’s future enjoyment! Moreover, he created the colorful array of fish, bird and animal life, for the service and pleasure of man. Truly God’s preparation and provisioning of earth as his gift to humankind is a superlative example of his faithfulness and loving-kindness. <span id="page299" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="299" data-before-text="299"></span>What heartfelt admiration and praise it should excite among God-fearing men!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 37:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Job 12:7-10</a>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 9, 10. In what respects is man himself a masterpiece among Jehovah’s creations?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> In making man himself, Jehovah provided a mind, a body, a set of organs and an ability and capacity for work that are a miracle of miracles in all the material creation. Consider, for example, the God-given abilities of speaking, listening, writing and reading. Even though fallen from perfection, the man of God can exclaim: “I shall laud you because in a fear-inspiring way I am wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful, as my soul is very well aware.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 139:14</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> What a wondrous masterpiece of construction is the upright human frame! The design and balance of the body, its mechanics and its chemistry, and the amazing hookup of nerves, mind and senses, are without parallel in human scientific achievement. Reflect on those ten marvelously designed levers, the human fingers. Even the smartest engineer could never have thought out, or manufactured, anything so beautifully utilitarian. Reflect, too, that no human production on this earth, from a tiny transistor to a mighty ocean liner, could have been constructed without the skillful manipulation of those God-given fingers.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Prov. 31:10-13</a>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">11. How does the miracle of reproduction show forth the Creator’s faithfulness?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> As further loving provision of the faithful Creator, man was endowed with power to reproduce his kind. “Male and female he created them. Further, God blessed them and God said to them: ‘Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth and subdue it.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Gen. 1:27, 28</a>) Is there anything so marvelous in the realm of the material creation as this miracle of reproduction? No outside architect or blueprint decides the form that a growing embryo shall take. The egg cell, once made fertile, divides and multiplies of itself. By miraculous processes—designed by the all-wise Creator, and passed down through each generation of humankind—the embryo develops true to pattern, producing head, body, arms and legs. No outside building materials need be brought in to fashion those sparkling eyes, that powerful heart, or the soft hair that will provide beauty and protection. All is brought forth wondrously from the laboratory of the ever-multiplying cells. As the end of the divinely ordered process, another baby is born, with prospect of further growth to the full radiance of manhood or womanhood. Truly we can thank and praise the faithful Creator for his arrangement whereby we have received the gift of human life.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 139:15-17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Eccl. 11:5</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">12. What expression should mankind make in thankfulness for God’s provisions?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> With perfection of wisdom Jehovah made the earth for man and man for the earth. In gratitude all mankind should declare: “Bless Jehovah, O my soul. O Jehovah my God, you have proved very great. With dignity and splendor you have clothed yourself. How many your works are, O Jehovah! All of them in wisdom you have made.” Mortal man should want to use all his God-given body, abilities and vital force to the honor of his God and Maker. His expression should be: “Your loving-kindness, O Jehovah, has filled the earth. Teach me your own regulations. All your commandments are faithfulness itself.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 104:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/18/2" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> 119:64,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/18/3" data-bid="19-4" class="b"> 86</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>FAITHFULNESS TO THE CREATOR</strong></p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">13.

The loving-kindness of the faithful Creator should prompt the God-given human mind to make just such a petition. What a marvelous faculty is that of mind! How thankful <span id="page300" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="300" data-before-text="300"></span>we can be that “God went on to say: ‘Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness’”! Thus Jehovah placed in mortal man godly intelligence and attributes of mind that He and His beloved heavenly Son exercise so wonderfully. Man was made with the capacity to appreciate the divine principles that would govern his existence. God’s laws were plainly stated to him. In loving obedience man could now show gratitude for all of Jehovah’s bounteous provision in the earthly paradise.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Gen. 1:26-31</a>.</p>

<strong>Are Your Prayers “Prepared as Incense”?</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> If our prayers are to ascend to God as sweet-smelling incense, we must pray in faith. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999042/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:6</a>) When Christian elders find a spiritually sick person receptive to their Scriptural help, their “prayer of faith will make the indisposed one well.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999042/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">James 5:15</a>) Prayers offered in faith are pleasing to our heavenly Father, and so is prayerful study of God’s Word.

<strong>Be Taught by Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Still, at times, because of human frailty or some other valid reason, Jehovah does teach his servants by experience. That is, by means of miracles or his providences <span id="page342" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="342" data-before-text="342"></span>he indicates his will or drives home certain lessons. He let the Israelites go hungry in the wilderness and then fed them on miraculous manna ‘in order to make them know,’ that is, to teach them, “that not by bread alone does man live.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Deut. 8:2, 3</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Because the Israelite Achan let covetousness overreach him God permitted the entire nation to suffer defeat at Ai to impress upon Joshua and all his people the seriousness of Achan’s offense. Thereafter God repeatedly let his people come under pagan subjection to bring them to their senses. This thought is inherent in the psalmists’ words: “Before I was under affliction I was sinning by mistake.” “Show us just how to count our days in such a way that we may bring in a heart of wisdom.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Josh. 7:1-26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Judg. 10:9-16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Ps. 119:67;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/10/3" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 90:12</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">While God’s servants today cannot point to like miracles, God does, at times, indicate his will for them by means of his providences. Thus the wholly unexpected obtaining of an abundance of essential fuel back in 1919 indicated to them what was God’s will in a certain matter, even as their inability to find suitable accommodations in 1958 indicated that it was not God’s will to have certain camping facilities in connection with the Divine Will International Assembly.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>TAUGHT BY HOLY SPIRIT</strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Jehovah God also uses his holy spirit to teach us. By holy spirit is not meant a third person of a mysterious trinity, but God’s active force, by means of which he carries out his purposes. Even as he used it to inspire men to write his Word, so by means of it he gives understanding of that Word. Thus only after receiving holy spirit at Pentecost did the early Christians understand God’s will for them, even as Jesus foretold: “The helper, the holy spirit which the Father will send in my name, that one will teach you all things and bring back to your minds all the things I told you.” As the apostle Paul also noted: “Eye has not seen and ear has not heard, neither have there been conceived in the heart of man the things which God has prepared for those who love him.” But “to us God has revealed them through his spirit, for the spirit searches into all things, even the deep things of God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">John 14:26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 2:9, 10</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">To receive this enlightening holy spirit requires knowledge of God’s Word, faith in it and works in harmony with that faith. We “receive the spirit . . . due to obedient hearing by faith.” Only then will God answer our prayers for the holy spirit. But more than that, it is also necessary for us to have contact or association with God’s visible channel or earthly organization—a fact driven home by the experience of the early Christians.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gal. 3:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Acts 8:15-17</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong>BY A VISIBLE ORGANIZATION</strong></p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Jehovah as the great Teacher has ever used human instruments to teach his earthly children. Adam taught Eve; Noah taught his family; Abraham taught his household; Moses taught his people. In particular was the tribe of Levi, together with its priests, the teaching instrument in ancient Israel: “For the lips of a priest are the ones that should keep knowledge, and the law is what people should seek from his mouth; for he is the messenger of Jehovah.” When this teaching body failed to do its duty, God “kept sending against them by means of his messengers [the prophets], . . . because he felt compassion for his people.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Mal. 2:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 36:15</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">When on earth Jesus proved himself to be the greatest instrument or Teacher this earth had ever seen.

He taught his people on the mountainside, on the seaside, in their homes, synagogues and the temple. As he himself testified: “Day after day I used to sit in the temple teaching.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 26:55</a>.</p>

Living up to it has proved rewarding. In their environment filled with enemies of their God, they feel just as the psalmist did, like an “alien resident.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984448/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 119:19,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984448/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 54</a>) Yet they feel that nothing matches God’s regulations for proper living. They had a narrow escape during World War I of 1914-18. During those war-mad years the enemies reached high up into the personnel of Jehovah’s visible organization to hasten the destruction of his people, even to the point of wrongly imprisoning the president and other highly responsible men at the headquarters of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. The experience was like what <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984448/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Psalm 119:69</a> describes: “The presumptuous have smeared me with falsehood.

In effect, this is what happened to the psalmist at the hands of persecutors. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1987206/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Verse 84 of Ps 119</a>) His distressed state was probably evident in his dismal countenance and lined face, and his entire body may have been so affected as to have lost some of its moisture. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1987206/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 32:4</a>.) Thus he may have felt as worthless as a withered skin bottle that others cast aside as unsuitable to hold liquids. Yet he had not ‘forgotten God’s regulations.’</p>

<strong>Bottle</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Gibeonites told Joshua: “These are the wine skin-bottles that we filled new, and, look! they have burst.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010784/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 9:13</a>) Such a thing could happen in time because of pressure built up due to active fermentation of the wine. Suffering Job said: “Look! My belly is like wine that has no vent; like new skin bottles it wants to burst open.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010784/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 32:19</a>) Generally, however, new wineskins would be able to withstand the internal pressure developed due to fermentation of the wine. Yet, old wineskins would in time become hard and lose their elasticity, and they were then likely to burst. Hence, Jesus Christ fittingly said: “Neither do people put new wine into old wineskins; but if they do, then the wineskins burst and the wine spills out and the wineskins are ruined. But people <span id="page254" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="254" data-before-text="254"></span>put new wine into new wineskins, and both things are preserved.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010784/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 9:17</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">David, a fugitive beleaguered by foes, referred to the skin bottle figuratively. Requesting God, in whom he placed his trust, not to forget his tears, David said: “Do put my tears in your skin bottle.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010784/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 56:8</a>) It is said that skins filled with wine were sometimes hung where they could be smoked so as to protect them from insects or to impart quickly certain desired properties to the wine. On the other hand, when not in use, skin bottles might be hung in a room without a chimney and thus become darkened by smoke from fires built there. These wineskins would soon lose their elasticity and shrivel up. Perhaps with this in mind, the psalmist who was beset with trials said: “For I have become like a skin bottle in the smoke.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010784/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 119:83</a>; see POTTER; VESSELS.</p>

<strong>Sleep</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">However, “death” and “sleep” may also be contrasted. Concerning, a dead girl, Christ Jesus said: “The little girl did not die, but she is sleeping.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014066/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matt. 9:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014066/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Mark 5:39;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014066/24/2" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> Luke 8:52</a>) As he was going to resurrect her from death, Jesus may have meant that <span id="page1517" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1517" data-before-text="1517"></span>the girl had not ceased forever to exist but would be as one awakened from her sleep. Also, this girl had not been buried, nor had her body had time to begin decaying, as had the body of Lazarus.

So with no maliciousness the psalmist could pray: “Let the presumptuous <span id="page19" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>ones be ashamed, for without cause they have misled me. As for me, I concern myself with your orders.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 119:78</a>) Jehovah makes sure that even the persecution works out for good and that the persecutors do not really fraudulently gain anything. He responds to the prayer of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Psalm 119:122</a>: “Act as a surety for your servant for what is good. May the presumptuous ones not defraud me.” Death on a mass scale threatened Jehovah’s Witnesses during the dictatorships of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, but by not forgetting the law and commandments of their God, they stood firm and many survived. In the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Psalm 119:60, 61</a>, the survivors can say: “I hurried up, and I did not delay to keep your commandments. The very ropes of the wicked ones surrounded me. Your law I did not forget.” The Almighty God is able to cut or break asunder the ropes of restraint tied about his Witnesses by their enemies and thus to free his servants in his due time for the work that he has ordained for them to do during this conclusion of the system of things.</p>

He likely had in mind that man’s concept of perfection is limited. In contrast, God’s commandment has no such limit. Its guidance applies to all aspects of life. “To all perfection I see a limit,” reads the <em>New International Version,</em> “but your commands are boundless.”</p>

<strong>Divine Laws Are for Our Benefit</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> One of the psalmists​—likely a prince of Judah and a future king—​expressed a feeling that is not usually associated with law. He exclaimed to God: “How I do <em>love</em> your law!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002283/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 119:97</a>) This was no mere emotional outburst. It was an expression of love for God’s will as set out in his law. Jesus Christ, the perfect Son of God, had similar feelings. Jesus was prophetically described as saying: “To do your will, O my God, I have delighted, and your law is within my inward parts.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002283/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 40:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002283/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Hebrews 10:9</a>) What about us? Do we find delight in doing God’s will? Are we convinced of the usefulness and benefits of Jehovah’s laws? What place does obedience to God’s laws have in <span id="page14" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>our worship, in our daily life, in our decision-making, and in our relationships with others? To love divine law, we do well to understand why God has the right to formulate and enforce laws.</p>

<strong>Mind the Spirit and Live!</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>“How I Do Love Your Law!”</strong></p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">10. Why is obeying Jehovah’s law necessary in order to mind the spirit?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> If we are to mind the spirit, knowledge of God’s Word is not enough. King Solomon had a very good grasp of Jehovah’s standards, but he failed to live by them during the latter part of his life. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001204/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Kings 4:29, 30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001204/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 11:1-6</a>) If we are spiritually-minded, we will see the need not only for knowing what the Bible says but also for obeying God’s law wholeheartedly. That means making a conscientious examination of Jehovah’s standards and diligently endeavoring to follow them. The psalmist had this kind of attitude. He sang: “How I do love your law! All day long it is my concern.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001204/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 119:97</a>) When we are truly concerned about following God’s law, we are moved to display godly qualities. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001204/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:1, 2</a>) Instead of being helplessly attracted to wrongdoing, we manifest the fruitage of the spirit, and a desire to please Jehovah turns us away from vile “works of the flesh.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001204/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Galatians 5:16,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001204/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 19-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001204/17/2" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> Psalm 15:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">11.

One way is by carefully <span id="page17" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>examining its value. Consider God’s law that limits sexual relations to marriage and forbids fornication and adultery. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001204/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:4</a>) Does obeying this law deprive us of anything good? Would a loving heavenly Father make a law that denies us something beneficial? Of course not! Look at what is happening in the lives of many who do not live in harmony with Jehovah’s moral standards. Unwanted pregnancies often lead them to abortions or perhaps into premature and unhappy marriages. Many have to rear a child without a husband or a wife. Furthermore, those who practice fornication expose themselves to sexually transmitted diseases. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001204/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>) And if a servant of Jehovah commits fornication, the emotional effects can be devastating. Trying to suppress the naggings of a guilty conscience can cause sleepless nights and mental anguish. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001204/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Psalm 32:3, 4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001204/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 51:3</a>) Is it not obvious, then, that Jehovah’s law prohibiting fornication is designed to protect us? Yes, there is indeed great benefit in maintaining moral cleanness!</p>

<strong>Study—Rewarding and Enjoyable</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> The psalmist states that he showed concern for Jehovah’s laws, commandments, and reminders. He sings: “With your orders I will concern myself, and I will look to your paths. . . . I shall raise my palms to your commandments that I have loved, and I will concern myself with your regulations. How I do love your law! All day long it is my concern.

It should therefore be done conscientiously and with the benefit of prayer. Study is a part of our worship and is done to improve our worship.</p>

To Jehovah’s revealed word, including the Mosaic Law code. At first glance some might dismiss the Law code as outdated and wonder how anyone could love it. However, as we meditate on the various features of the Mosaic Law, as did the psalmist, we can appreciate the wisdom behind that Law. Aside from the many prophetic aspects of the Law, there are its sanitary and dietary stipulations, which promoted cleanness and good health.

<strong>Psalm 119 Magnifies Jehovah’s Word</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Law is defined as “a body of rules recognized by a state or community as binding upon its members.” The term appears nearly always in the singular form, whereas “commandment” more often than not is in the plural. The psalmist certainly had a great appreciation of God’s law, for he said: “The <em>law</em> of your mouth is good for me, more so than thousands of pieces of gold and silver.” “How I do love your <em>law!</em> All day long it is my concern.” “Abundant peace belongs to those loving your <em>law,</em> and for them there is no stumbling block.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973207/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 119:72,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973207/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 97,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973207/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 165</a>.</p>

The evolution theory was being taught, and the girls, twelve years of age, were told to write a composition “proving that there is no God.” One of the girls, whose mother is a witness of Jehovah, stood up and asked the schoolmistress to excuse her from that duty. “I cannot write such a composition,” she said, “because I believe in the living God.” The schoolmistress thereupon told her to write a composition proving that God exists. In one hour the class had to hand in the papers, and this young girl had written:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● “Oftentimes we observe the beauty of nature, and every intelligent person asks himself, How did all this come into existence? The evolution theory teaches us that there is no God and everything came into existence by itself; that man descended from the monkey and that life developed from a little worm, through the strength of the sun and physical laws until man appeared. But this calls for some questions:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">● “Why does this evolution not go on, since there are still so many monkeys? Why did only one monkey develop in that way and not all? The evolutionists tell us, according to what we have been taught, that only one female monkey gave birth to the original man. But even if it had been so, one monkey would have had to bear the male and another monkey would have had to bear the female man in order to guarantee procreation.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">● “But let us also look at the vegetation. A plant does everything to satisfy the insects, which fly from flower to flower to pollinate them; and so they serve the flowers, and in return get food from them. What wonderful harmony! And how did this all come about? Did ever the plants hold a conference with the insects and make some agreement and now stick to this agreement, even better than men stick to their agreements, these men who pretend to be so intelligent? It is only logical that all this is governed by a higher power! Let men, who think they are so wise, produce one such plant without a grain of seed and let them prove this way that these plants can come into existence from nothing.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">● “But what about the stars and the unexplored universe? In what wonderful order the sun, the moon and the stars move for thousands of years without going wrong. Our greatest scientists have launched satellites around the earth that hardly remain for one year. Therefore I could ask: The famous scientists of today, are they not even as clever as that which they call nature? No! I simply cannot accept that these wonderful laws in nature came into existence by themselves and function by themselves. I believe that every intelligent man has to admit that someone had to establish these laws and has to control them, and this is God!</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">● “It is written in the Bible that the first human pair was created by God and there was a uniform climate throughout the whole earth, as we learned it in the book <em>The New Geology,</em> where it is written: ‘Fossils of plants and animals show, that in those times there existed a mild spring climate throughout the earth.’ This corresponds with the Bible record about conditions before the Flood. Yes, we are told that the Flood is merely a legend, but we have learned in school from scientists who write that in Greenland and Spitzbergen fossils of plants, such as oak and cinnamon trees and others, have been found that grow in India and China. This all proves that there was a flood. The churches have presented God as a tyrant, but the Bible teaches that he is perfect love, that in Hebrew his name is JHVH, and commonly this name is pronounced Jehovah. It is in this God that I do believe, because he promised everlasting life on a paradise earth to obedient men. It is reasonable and good to believe this.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">● After a few days the papers were returned. This girl did not get hers, however, and the schoolmistress said that her composition was not a good one. To show this to the whole class, she said that she would read it to them, which she did. When she finished reading it, the whole class applauded and some girls called out: “This is the nicest one!” The schoolmistress was puzzled over this and gave the composition to the director of the school. It got before the school board, where it was also read. The girl had to appear before the school board. There she was able to give a witness about the Kingdom hope, whereupon her teachers told her that she was too young to judge these matters. True it is of those trained in God’s Word: “Wiser than my enemies your commandment makes me.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961125/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 119:98</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"></p>

It should therefore be done conscientiously and with the benefit of prayer. Study is a part of our worship and is done to improve our worship.</p>

<strong>Psalm 119 Magnifies Jehovah’s Word</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The term ORDERS (“precepts” in the <em>New English Bible</em> [<em>NE</em>]) translates the Hebrew word <em>piq·qoh·dimʹ.</em> It comes from the same root as the word “overseer” and means “to inspect.” Its English equivalents mean ‘instructions with explicitness as to details’ and ‘rule of action.’ With warm appreciation the psalmist speaks of these “orders”: “O see that I have loved your own <em>orders.”</em> “I have observed your own <em>orders.”</em> “Owing to your <em>orders</em> I behave with understanding.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973207/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 119:159,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973207/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 100,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973207/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 104</a>.</p>

To survive this world’s end, what must parents and children do?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[28]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> Jehovah God through his inspired Word informs us what to do to survive this world’s end. “Acquire wisdom, acquire understanding,” is the wise counsel. “Do not forget and do not turn aside from the sayings of my mouth. Do not leave it and it will keep you. Love it and it will safeguard you.” “For wisdom is for a protection the same as money is for a protection; but the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom itself preserves alive its owners.” Therefore, if parents are to survive this time of trouble with their children and enter the promised new world, they must search out the wisdom of Jehovah, be taught of his ways and live according to them. The accurate knowledge of Jehovah’s Word will become a protective shield about them in this hour of temptation and crisis.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961205/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Prov. 4:5, 6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961205/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Eccl. 7:12</a>.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="qu"> 3. (a) When should children begin to be taught, and how? (b) What responsibility rests on parents regarding children and their aim in life? (c) To prevent children from going astray, what else must children be taught, and in what way is this best done?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> Early in life children must be taught the wisdom of Jehovah, the principles of Christian living. As soon as the child is old enough to ask questions about life, it is old enough to receive forthright answers. It is not necessary to explain things in detail for a child, just answer the questions briefly, plainly and happily. There is no reason why we should hedge. Jehovah is plain speaking in the Bible and parents can be just as plain when speaking to their children. It is the responsibility of the parents to give a child a goal in life. Christian parents will want to make the new world with its blessings and life that goal for their child. To that end they will inculcate now in their child the principles of new-world living. This should include instruction on the facts of life, the child’s biological make-up, its basic emotions and desires. At no time should parents feel it necessary to weave in fairy-tale stories about “storks carrying babies” when explaining the origin of life. The miracle of birth is nothing to be ashamed of. Satisfy the little curious minds with the “whys” and “wherefores” of life, because if you do not tell them, someone else will, but what children may learn from others may not always be the truth. Children should also be taught the need for self-control, that the driving force in them toward procreation has power to attract, to embarrass, divide and destroy a happy relationship if misused. Children must be taught that there are rights and wrongs and must learn to distinguish between them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961205/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Heb. 5:14</a>) They must grow to appreciate that many wrongs do not make a right, that widespread immorality among men does not justify one’s becoming immoral, that Jehovah’s laws must be regarded above all else if one is to gain life. Because “the inclination of the heart of man is bad from his youth up,” and because “foolishness is tied up with the heart of a boy,” it may be necessary to restrain, discipline and even punish the child to keep him from going astray. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961205/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 8:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961205/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Prov. 22:15</a>) A child learns best by loving parental example. A child properly trained will be able to say as the psalmist did: “From every bad path I have restrained my feet, in order that I may keep your word.” Yes, the Word of Jehovah will be a safeguard in this wayward world.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961205/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 119:101-105</a>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu"> 4. (a) What Bible warning do we have about the dangers of sex? (b) What is the unhealthy moral state of the world, and with what consequence to youth?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Perhaps the most dangerous of all corruptions <span id="page180" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="180" data-before-text="180"></span>to youth is the modern attitude toward sex. It was so with the children of Israel just before they entered the Promised Land. For forty years many of them persevered; then on the plains of Moab, just before receiving the realization of their dream, thousands of them fell victim to immoral practices with the daughters of Moab. Twenty-four thousand of them perished in one day! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961205/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Num. 25:1-9</a>) We today stand in a similar position. Before us is the new world of promise, but around us is a “sex crazy” world. As a Harvard professor said: We live under the “continuous pressure of a gigantic army of omnipresent sex stimuli.” Books and films that excite suggestiveness are most popular. Rape, homosexuality, illegitimacy and venereal disease abound. Stories of the debauched lives of celebrated Hollywood notables flood the newspapers, but seldom, if ever, does one read of the lives of decent, moral people who have reared healthy children for the good of the community. This moral breakdown was foretold to take place “in the last days.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961205/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1-7</a>) It is bringing forth its fruitage: “For whatever a man is sowing, this he will also reap.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961205/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gal. 6:7</a>) Everywhere can be seen an open revolt against morals and conventions, with a devastating effect on youth especially. Polls taken in several colleges revealed that 79 percent of the students approved of sex relations before marriage. Some 36 percent of the boys questioned said that they were determined to go as far as they could when out with girls within three dated engagements. Lovely boys and girls are known to have lost complete control of themselves morally, finally ending up confused, frightened, depressed and on the verge of suicide. Parents of the New World society, know that these conditions also face your children who are forced by circumstance to rub elbows with the children of the world. So watch over your children, because their lives are involved.</p>

<strong>The Bible and Your Future</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><strong>IMAGINE</strong> you are walking along a dark path late one evening. Although the sun has long since set, you do not feel hopelessly lost, for you have in your hand a powerful flashlight. When you point it downward, you see clearly what is immediately in front of you. And when you point it forward, its piercing beam illuminates your path far into the distance.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In some ways, the Bible is like such a flashlight. As we considered in the preceding articles, God’s Word can help us deal with what is immediately in front of us​—the day-to-day problems that we all face in this uncertain world. But the Bible does more. It also provides an illuminating view of the future, enabling us to see and follow a path that leads to lasting happiness and contentment. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018023/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 119:105</a>) How so?</p>

Left on their own, however, imperfect humans are completely lost. They simply cannot find the road to true peace and happiness. Why have they been unable to reach that destination? More than 2,500 years ago, the prophet Jeremiah stated: “It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007323/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jeremiah 10:23</a>) Anyone who tries to direct his own step without accepting qualified help inevitably faces frustration.

Why? Because he understands better than anyone else the makeup of humans. And he is fully aware of how the human race got sidetracked and became lost. He also knows what is required for them to get back on course. Furthermore, as the Creator, Jehovah <em>always</em> knows what is best for us. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007323/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 48:17</a>) Thus, we can fully trust his promise as recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007323/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 32:8</a>: “I shall make you have insight and instruct you in the way you should go.

Indeed, when we read the Bible and let it guide us, we are experiencing firsthand what is described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007323/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 30:21</a>: “Your own ears will hear a word behind you saying: ‘This is the way.

First, it serves as a lamp to our foot. When we face day-to-day challenges, principles found in the Bible should guide our steps so that we make wise decisions and avoid the traps and pitfalls of this world. Second, God’s reminders light our roadway, helping us to make choices that are consistent with our hope of living forever in God’s promised Paradise. With the road ahead well-lit, we will be able to discern the consequences​—good or bad—​of a particular course.

Some decisions may seem relatively minor, but we may at times be confronted with a situation that challenges our morality, our honesty, or our neutral stand. To face such trials successfully, we must have our “perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007323/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Hebrews 5:14</a>) By obtaining accurate knowledge of God’s Word and developing an understanding of its principles, we train our conscience so that we will make decisions that please Jehovah.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007323/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:21</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 7.

Are you an adult who is sincerely trying to make Jehovah’s heart rejoice? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007323/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Proverbs 27:11</a>) If so, you are to be commended. But imagine for a moment that some workmates offer you a ticket to accompany them to a sporting event. They enjoy your companionship at work and would like to socialize with you outside the work environment. You might have the strong impression that these individuals are not bad people. They might even have some good principles. What will you do? Would there be any danger in accepting the invitation? How can God’s Word help you to make a good decision in this matter?</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 8. What Scriptural principles help us to reason on the matter of associations?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Consider a few Scriptural principles. The first one that may come to mind is found at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007323/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>, which says: “Bad associations spoil useful habits.” Does adhering to this principle require that you shun unbelievers entirely? The Scriptural answer to that question is no. After all, the apostle Paul himself showed loving consideration for “people of all sorts,” including unbelievers. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007323/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 9:22</a>) The very nature of Christianity demands that we show an interest in others​—including those who do not share our beliefs. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007323/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Romans 10:13-15</a>) Indeed, how can we follow the counsel to “work what is good toward all” if we isolate ourselves from people who might need our help?​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007323/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Galatians 6:10</a>.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 9. What Bible counsel helps us to be balanced in our relationship with our workmates?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> However, there is a clear difference between being friendly toward a workmate and being that one’s close companion. Here is where another Scriptural principle enters the picture. The apostle Paul warned Christians: “Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007323/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>) What is <span id="page16" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>the meaning of the phrase “do not become unevenly yoked”? Some Bible translations render those words “do not team up,” “do not try to work together as equals,” or “stop forming inappropriate relationships.” At what point does a relationship with a workmate become inappropriate? When does it cross the line and become an uneven yoking? God’s Word, the Bible, can direct your step in this situation.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">10. (a) How did Jesus choose companions? (b) What questions can help a person to make good decisions about associations?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Consider the example of Jesus, who from creation onward had a love for humans. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007323/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Proverbs 8:31</a>) While on earth, he forged a close bond with his followers. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007323/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">John 13:1</a>) He even “felt love” for a man who was religiously misguided. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007323/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Mark 10:17-22</a>) But Jesus also set clear boundaries regarding his choice of close companions. He formed no close ties with people who were not sincerely interested in doing his Father’s will. On one occasion, Jesus stated: “You are my friends if you do what I am commanding you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007323/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">John 15:14</a>) True, you may get along well with a particular workmate. But ask yourself: ‘Is this person willing to do what Jesus commands? Does he or she want to learn about Jehovah, the one whom Jesus instructed us to worship? Does he or she have the same moral standards that I as a Christian have?’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007323/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Matthew 4:10</a>) As you talk with your workmates and insist on applying Bible standards, the answers to these questions will be evident.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">11. Cite situations in which God’s utterances should guide our steps.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> There are many other situations in which God’s utterances can be like a lamp to our foot. For example, an unemployed Christian may be offered a sorely needed job. However, the schedule is demanding, and if he accepts the job, he will be absent for a number of Christian meetings and will miss out on other activities related to true worship. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007323/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Psalm 37:25</a>) Another Christian may be strongly tempted to view entertainment that clearly violates Bible principles. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007323/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:17-19</a>) Still another might <span id="page17" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>be prone to take offense at the imperfections of fellow believers. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007323/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Colossians 3:13</a>) In all such situations, we should let God’s Word be a lamp to our foot. Really, by following Bible principles, we can successfully face any challenge in life. God’s Word is “beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007323/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>“A Light to My Roadway”</strong></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">12.

We are not left in the dark when it comes to the future, for the Bible explains the meaning of distressing world conditions and what the outcome will be. Yes, we realize that we are living in “the last days” of this wicked system of things.

That is why it is vital that we “pay more than the usual attention” when we gather for instruction with fellow believers and when we personally read God’s Word. The information we take in will help us to make wise and beneficial decisions that please Jehovah and make his heart rejoice.

He wrote the psalm hundreds of years before our Common Era, while the nation of Israel was still under the Law covenant that had been mediated by the prophet Moses between Jehovah God and the nation in 1513 B.C.E. at Mount Sinai. Properly the psalmist had no fault to find with the Law of that covenant, for it was God-given. He well knew that the pagan nations all around the land of Israel had nothing to compare with that divine Law.

Science simply does not know what it is doing or where it is going, in any universal sense; and if the good it does is fundamental, the damage it does is absolutely unrepairable.”<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1964723/1">b</a> This responsibility for causing ill was also noted by Nobel Prize-winning scientist Dr. Harold Urey,<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1964723/2">c</a> who said that the intellectual ideas of the scientific revolution have eroded morality and religion. He stated that the skepticism of the scientific community already has spread into the general population, and he predicted that it will spread ever more widely in the future, adding that this may even be indirectly responsible for the rise of social evils such as delinquency. In view of all this, it is little wonder that one author acidly said: “If the present condition of international hatred, mass murder, violated treaties, forgotten honor, and civilian <span id="page592" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="592" data-before-text="592"></span>extermination in the holy name of war are the best that evolution can accomplish, we should hand the whole mess back to the monkeys and ask them to stir up another batch!”<a id="footnotesource4" data-fnid="4" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1964723/3">d</a></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>GOD’S SERVANTS KNOW THE TRUE GUIDE</strong></p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 6.

They have not turned to false guides, but they rely on the only true guide available to man, God’s Word, the Holy Bible. That is why God’s people remain unperturbed in the midst of world turmoil. They have long known that the Bible foretold exactly the distressing things we see taking place throughout the world in our day, for it warned: “But know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, self-assuming, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, disloyal, having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, without love of goodness, betrayers, headstrong, puffed up with pride, lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God.” Would these conditions improve? Those fortified with truth from God’s true guide for man know that in these last days “wicked men and impostors will advance from bad to worse, misleading and being misled.” They recognize the truth of Jesus’ words when he prophesied the anguish of nations so evident today: “While men become faint out of fear and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964723/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1-4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964723/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964723/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Luke 21:26</a>.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 7, 8.

They know that the Creator of man is the only one who can provide what man needs in order to walk properly. He has done that by providing his Word, the Bible, which gives them the knowledge they need to guide them in matters of peace, morality, life and worship. It tells them accurately why things are as they are and what the future holds, because its Author knows all these things; as it is written: “Remember the first things of a long time ago, that I am the Divine One and there is no other God, nor anyone like me; the One telling from the beginning the finale, and from long ago the things that have not been done; the One saying, ‘My own counsel will stand, and everything that is my delight I shall do’; . . .

Let him carry on prayer.” Yes, he turns to God, regularly communing with him in prayer and taking time to meditate on the portions of his Word that help him to get his problem in proper perspective. If necessary, he may also talk to the overseer of his congregation or some other mature Christian to make sure that he is taking into consideration all the scriptures that bear on his situation. But then, bearing his own load of responsibility, he does not ask someone else to make his decisions for him. He faces up to the situation, determining which course he as a dedicated Christian ought to pursue. Then, trusting in Jehovah to uphold him, he courageously walks in the way that will keep him close to God.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>DISCERNMENT, NOT FANATICISM</strong></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">All such fine application of Bible principles is a matter of discernment, not fanaticism.

Through his “faithful and discreet slave” organization God has provided rich spiritual food, and we should regularly use the publications that contain that food. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963127/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45-47</a>) It is recommended that every Christian household have its own reference library containing Bibles, each year’s copies of the <em>Watchtower</em> and <em>Awake!</em> magazines, the Watch Tower Society’s current bound books, and other such information as is provided for those who are regularly engaging in the ministry. It might also be helpful to have a good dictionary, a Bible concordance and perhaps a Bible dictionary. Also on hand should be the <em>Watch Tower Publications Index</em> and its annual supplements. These are basic tools for seeking wisdom and discernment from God’s Word.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">When a question or problem arises, get in the habit of carrying your own load of responsibility. Turn to your <em>Index</em> or the index contained in the back of others of the Society’s publications and locate the subject or text involved. If you do not have a certain publication to which you are referred, put forth the effort to locate it in the local Kingdom Hall library or at the home of a friend.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Do your research and come to the best conclusion that you are able to reach. Youths should check their conclusions with their parents. Wives may verify their findings by asking their dedicated husbands. Anyone can check an important matter with his congregation overseer. While offering the needed help, the overseer will also do well to inquire if the individual has done any research and thinking of his own on the question. At times it may be necessary to write to the Society about a matter if it is important in one’s ministry. But all are urged to learn to discern the Bible principles involved in a matter just as the Society would.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963127/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ps. 119:105</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">By carrying your own load of responsibility you will enjoy greater use of your perceptive powers as you grow to maturity and in usefulness to Jehovah God and his organization.

And, like them, you will find Jehovah’s protection and favor in faithfully carrying your own load of responsibility.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963127/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Gal. 6:5</a>.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb"></p>

This is even more true of what might be called spiritual light, light for the mind and the heart. Without this light men are blind, lost, do not know which way to go, for it simply is not in man himself to direct his own steps. Proof of this is seen in the sorry state of affairs in which men find themselves today. Look where we may, we find confusion, strife and wickedness due to selfishness and conflicting theories as to what is best for man in science and art, in religion and politics.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jer. 10:23</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Who is to blame for this sorry state of affairs? Not the Creator, for he has provided man with spiritual light, with an infallible guide, his Word, the Bible. Concerning it the one man whose life more greatly affected mankind for good than any other one that ever lived, Jesus Christ, once said, “Your word is truth.” It is, as a psalmist long ago expressed it, ‘a lamp for our feet, a light for our roadway.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 17:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ps. 119:105</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">This Word of God is known as The Book and itself consists of sixty-six books. The term “books” here is used in a special sense, since twenty-eight of these are less than six pages in length, and the five shortest average less than a page each of the ordinary Bible. The largest as well as perhaps the best known among the sixty-six books is the book of Psalms, it accounting for about 8 percent of the entire inspired Scriptures.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In the original Hebrew this book was known as <em>T<sup>e</sup>·hil·limʹ,</em> meaning “Praises.” There are 150 of these psalms, almost half of which are credited to David, the shepherd king. Written over a period of more than a thousand years, they do indeed have as their theme the praises of Jehovah God. In them their writers praise Jehovah God, call on others to praise him and give many, many reasons for doing so. Interwoven in among these many psalms is what might be termed an epitome of the Hebrew Scriptures, for in them much is found to throw light on life’s roadway in the way of Bible history, Bible prophecy, Bible doctrine and exhortation to right conduct.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>THE LIGHT OF BIBLE HISTORY</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Information concerning God’s mighty deeds and his dealings with human creatures in times past throws light on life’s roadway.

From him sprang the Israelites, Edomites and Ishmaelites, also the Medanites and Midianites. Not only does archaeology testify to the historicity of Abram and his forebears but, above all, Jesus Christ and his apostles did, for they referred to him more than seventy times.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960643/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chron. 1:28,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960643/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 32,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960643/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 34</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Ur, the city of his home, was situated about fifty miles from the Persian Gulf near the juncture of the Euphrates and the Tigris rivers. The city was said to be “of the Chaldeans,” because it was situated in the lower part of Mesopotamia, which, centuries after Abram’s day, was occupied by the Chaldeans.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960643/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 11:28,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960643/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960643/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 15:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960643/2/3" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> Acts 7:2</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In Abram’s day Ur was no mean city, although no longer the powerful Sumerian capital that it was some 150 years earlier, before the Elamites invaded it. Within its oval-shaped, partly-broken-down wall lived at least a quarter of a million inhabitants. According to Keller, in <em>The Bible as History,</em> Ur at that time was a “powerful, prosperous, colorful and busy capital city.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">But, above all, Ur was a religious city. The entire northwest quarter of it was given over to pagan worship, chiefly that of the moon god Nanna and his consort Ningal, and in this section were located the ziggurat and temples. As if this were not enough, chapels for the worship of other gods were scattered throughout the city, and every home, except those of the poorest people, had its own chapel. “Its religion was a polytheism of the grossest type,” says archaeologist Woolley in his book <em>Abraham.</em> Such, then, was the city in which Abram was reared.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>“FATHER OF ALL THOSE HAVING FAITH”</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Faith is proved by works.

The first real test of faith that came upon Abram, according to God’s Word, was when he quite likely was about seventy years of age and God appeared to him and said: “Go your way out of your country and from your relatives and from the house of your father to the country that I shall show you, and I shall make a great nation <span id="page522" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="522" data-before-text="522"></span>out of you and I shall bless you and I will make your name great; and prove yourself a blessing. And I will bless those who bless you, and him that calls down evil upon you I shall curse, and all the families of the ground will certainly bless themselves by means of you.” Stephen makes it clear that this call to Abram was issued “while he was in Mesopotamia, before he took up residence in Haran.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960643/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 12:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960643/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Acts 7:2</a>.</p>

Those in responsible positions, such as circuit and district servants, congregation servants and ministerial servants in the congregation, are all part of this theocratic structure. Their appointment to service is to be viewed in that way. And knowing this they feel a great responsibility before God to discharge their assignments properly. As the apostle Paul so aptly stated it: “Pay attention to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the <em>holy spirit has appointed you overseers,</em> to shepherd the congregation of God, which he purchased with the blood of his own [Son].” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957446/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Acts 20:28</a>, <em>NW</em>) Servants in the congregations are not such because some man has selected them.

How?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> God’s Word, the Bible, was written under the inspiration of the holy spirit. In it is found a detailed description of the ones who may be overseers in the congregations. These requirements are set forth by God himself, and his active force continues to operate in our time to move the governing body and others in positions of responsibility because they do adhere closely to the written Word. When those instructions are carefully followed and only such ones as are described in the Scriptures are appointed as overseers, just who is selecting them? Not man, because he did not establish the standard to follow. It is Jehovah God himself who, by means of his holy spirit, is appointing them to be overseers.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957446/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 119:105;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957446/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Prov. 3:5, 6</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>WHO MAY SERVE</strong></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">10.

By older men is meant not merely persons who are older in a physical sense. Age does not necessarily make a man mature in spiritual matters, although years of experience are definitely an asset. Maturity that qualifies one for special privileges of service includes both knowledge and experience. An overseer should be diligent in study in order to meet that standard. He should have a good knowledge of the history of the organization, sound understanding of doctrinal matters and thorough appreciation of organization instructions. While it is true that he is no doubt very busy in looking after the congregation, he should always keep up on his study, not only for his own benefit, but also as an example in this to the brothers.

None should be able to point the finger at him as one who is negligent in his work or who fails to conform to the standards of the Bible. This is true in all things. Consequently, if he is married he must be the husband of just one wife. In habits, too, <span id="page372" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="372" data-before-text="372"></span>he should be moderate. As to eating, he must not be a glutton.

He is diligent, yes; but he does not go to the extreme of ruining his health. If he finds pleasure in wholesome recreation, that too is proper. But never would he go to the foolish extreme of becoming a lover of pleasures more than a lover of God by allowing it to crowd out theocratic activities.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957446/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Phil. 4:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957446/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 2 Tim. 3:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957446/20/2" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> 4</a>.</p>

Our Milky Way is just one of a million million milky ways or galaxies in the known universe. All of these millions and billions and trillions of stars are hurtling through space, each keeping in its assigned orbit, each running on a schedule of split-second timing so flawless that we set our most accurate timepieces by their movements. Can men guide them? No. And this Jehovah called to Job’s notice saying: “Can you send forth Mazzaroth in its season, and lead forth the Bear with its satellites? Do you know the laws of the heavens?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952044/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 38:32, 33</a>, <em>AT.</em></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Birds migrate for hundreds and thousands of miles, without map or compass, without ever having made the trip before. Can man guide the birds on their southward flight? God queried Job: “Is it by your understanding that the hawk soars, and spreads his wings toward the south?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952044/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 39:26</a>, <em>AT</em>) To the backsliding, rebellious Israelites Jehovah said: “Even the stork knows her time for assembly and migration, and the crane and swallow keep the season of their coming, but my people know not the decrees of the Everliving [Jehovah].”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952044/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jer. 8:7</a>, <em>Fenton.</em></p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">God guides the stars by his laws of motion and gravitation. Man cannot guide them. God guides the migrating birds by his laws of instinct. Man cannot guide them. Man cannot even guide himself. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952044/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jeremiah 10:23</a> (<em>AS</em>) states: “O Jehovah, I know that the way of man is not in himself; it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.” The stars heed God’s laws, the birds obey the migration laws, but men balk at God’s laws for them. But if God is capable of guiding the stars by natural law, of guiding the birds by instinct, then is he not capable of guiding man by the Bible? “Thy word is a lamp to my feet, and a light on my path.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952044/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 119:105</a>, <em>AT.</em></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Consider a few of the fields in which God’s Word gives sure guidance. It is a guide in matters of marriage. When Israel entered Canaan they were told concerning the heathen: “You must not intermarry with them, neither giving your daughters in marriage to their sons, nor receiving their daughters for your sons; for they would turn your sons from following me to serving alien gods.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952044/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Deut. 7:3, 4</a>, <em>AT</em>) To Christians the same prohibition was carried over when they were told to marry “only in the Lord”.

Solomon was one of such. He married women not in the truth, probably reasoning that they were nice girls, and that he could get them into the truth after marriage. Instead, they got him out of the truth. God’s guiding Word was right, and Solomon’s rejection of it was so wrong it cost <span id="page50" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="50" data-before-text="50"></span>him eternal life.

For many it is also becoming the best dust-collector of our time. The most-sold but proportionately least-read book. Why? The Bible’s worth comes under assault from many quarters. The scientist says it is not scientific, the atheist says it is contradictory, the modernist clergy say it is legend, the fundamentalists make it appear ridiculous and void, and the people generally dismiss it as impractical for guidance in this hardheaded, realistic, wicked old world. But it is not unscientific, not contradictory, not legendary, not ridiculous and void, and above all it is not impractical. The scientist, the atheist, the modernist and fundamentalist clergy, and the people generally are wrong, for the Bible is the most scientific, consistent, factual, reasonable and practical book on earth! It alone is the reliable lamp and light for the feet and pathways of men.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 119:105</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 2.

Though the Bible is not provided as a textbook on science, yet when it touches on scientific matters it is accurate and true. For example, science teaches that man’s speech evolved from grunts and growls as he ascended from some primitive ape, but the known facts are that the older the language the more difficult and complex it is, forcing the authorities in the field to conclude that instead of speech evolving from simple to complex the exact opposite is true. This matches the Bible account, that man was created perfect, with full powers of speech, capable of expressing in fine shades of meaning the thoughts of a perfect mind.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1951401/0">a</a> Also, scientists scoff at the Bible account of Jacob engineering spotted offspring from his flocks by making the females look at a spotted pattern-work of rods, such ideas of prenatal influence or maternal impressions being now largely discarded. However, the scientists overlook that this was only Jacob’s opinion, and that in a dream that followed Jehovah corrected Jacob and showed him the real reason for the spotted offspring, a reason in harmony with Mendel’s laws of heredity, which scientists did not appreciate until this twentieth century.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1951401/1">b</a> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 30:37-43;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 31:10-12</a>) Finally, ridicule comes from scientists because the Bible classes the rabbit with animals that chew the cud. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Lev. 11:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Deut. 14:7</a>) But now a few alert scientists have discovered that rabbits do accomplish in effect or principle a chewing of the cud, by a strange process causing food to go through its digestive system twice.

Jehovah could never inspire a wholehearted servant of his to say anything less forceful than this: “I shall show a fondness for your commandments that I have loved.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Psalm 119:47</a>.</p>

<strong>The Big Issue—Are We for or Against Divine Rulership?</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Still another quality needed by those who would remain in God’s favor is faithfulness. This was emphasized in the discourse “What Is Looked for Is to Be Found Faithful,” and it was most helpful in getting a proper evaluation of matters. As the speaker stated: ‘God can give ability to anyone, or can accentuate one’s ability. But faithfulness is prized by Him, for this is something that the individual must develop himself. A faithful-hearted person is one whom God can use for any purpose he desires.’</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Love and hate were two more qualities talked about, and <em>both</em> are necessary for the Christian to have in order to enjoy divine approval. In this discourse, “The Godly Qualities of Love and Hate,” it was pointed out that one must love the things God loves. On the other hand, one must hate what He hates, including fornication, adultery, loose conduct, slander, vicious gossip and avowed enemies of God. Godly <span id="page603" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="603" data-before-text="603"></span>love is a strong force in doing what is right, while godly hate protects one from walking contrary to Jehovah’s way.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972726/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 119:113;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972726/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Prov. 6:16-19</a>.</p>

<strong>“What Prevents Me from Getting Baptized?”</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> The one submitting himself to baptism <span id="page306" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="306" data-before-text="306"></span>has broken former ties with Christendom or heathendom. This seemingly difficult step is being taken every day. In Africa the influence of witch doctors and fear of voodoo have been broken through the determination of newly dedicated and baptized Christians. In the Orient the powerful hold of ancestor worship has been repudiated even by old grandmothers who have worshiped their ancestors for many decades. This step has lost them old friends and acquaintances—something that is not easy for them, for to most Oriental people the standing among their friends and neighbors is more important than anything else in life. From all kinds of former beliefs people have come, dedicating and symbolizing that dedication by water immersion. Then they keep right on walking in their integrity. They have done what the Scriptures tell them to do, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960364/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>: “‘Therefore get out from among them, and separate yourselves,’ says Jehovah, ‘and quit touching the unclean thing,’ ‘and I will take you in.’”</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> That is just what Jehovah has done today. How marvelous it is and how awe-inspiring it has been to see the spirit of Jehovah work on the minds of those formerly bound by pagan customs to repudiate the worship of demons and become ardent worshipers of Jehovah! This means making the mind over, and sometimes even a change of circumstances, but nothing has prevented them from dedicating and then being baptized. Some of these baptized ones were formerly followers of Buddha, striving for the nothingness of nonexistence. Some were formerly Confucianists, believing the best way of life was to follow a passive course of character development. Some were fiercely nationalistic Shinto worshipers of the Japanese emperor; some were Taoists, Mohammedans, Hindus, demon worshipers and atheists. Jehovah has taken them all in. Dedication and baptism became the door through which they were taken in. Any dedicated ones today thinking of postponing baptism should look at these marvelous modern-day examples of faithfulness from every quarter of the globe. By not holding back they have overcome all obstacles that might have prevented them from getting baptized.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">14. Why must dedication never be “halfhearted”?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Dedication can never be a “halfhearted” thing. The footnote rendering of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960364/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 119:113</a> substitutes the expression, “the double-minded ones I have hated,” for the main rendering, “the halfhearted ones I have hated.” Those understanding the necessity of dedication and baptism, but who for some reason hold back, are really being double-minded. One mind urges them to dedicate, the other influences them to try to hold on just a little longer to the glittering pleasures of this world. The greatest of Jesus’ two commandments was to “love Jehovah your God with your <em>whole</em> heart and with your <em>whole</em> soul.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960364/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 22:37</a>) No room for halfhearted dedication there. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960364/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">James (4:8</a>) admonishes the “indecisive ones” to draw close to God, and he will “draw close to you.” Those who hold back are also holding themselves just outside that close, warm relationship with our Creator that comes with full dedication.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">15. How should desire for dedication and baptism be developed in the hearts of the good-will people?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> Jesus’ command to go and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them, was given to faithful Christians of the early congregation. These loyal ones taught the seriousness of baptism to the new converts. So today, it is the responsibility of the mature to teach the seriousness of baptism. It is part of the upbuilding of the weak, for which the strong are responsible to the great Shepherd. By patient, tactful teaching and example <span id="page307" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="307" data-before-text="307"></span>they develop in the new person the desire for baptism. This is done gradually, but from very early in the weekly home Bible study that one conducts with the good-will person. Paul says: “For ‘anyone that calls upon the name of Jehovah will be saved’. However, how will they . . . hear without someone to preach?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960364/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rom. 10:13-15</a>) In the same manner, how will people of good will know the way to translate their newly learned truth into New World living and dedication if the mature Christians do not develop the desire in the hearts of these good-will persons?</p>

<strong>Is Interfaith God’s Way?</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> After separating his people from the false faiths of Egypt, and disgracing the Egyptian cults in the process, Jehovah gave his law to his people in the wilderness. This law specifically forbade any interfaith movements. Certainly brotherhood with the false worshipers in the Promised Land was not being established by “a divine command” or as “a religious duty” in these words of instruction from Jehovah: “You must be careful never to make any compact with these natives of the land to which you are going, lest that allure you into danger; you must demolish their altars and break their obelisks and cut down their sacred poles (for you must never worship any other god: the Eternal whose [disposition] is jealous is a jealous God), lest you make a compact with the nations, deserting to their gods, sacrificing to their gods, agreeing to partake of their sacrificial meals, marrying your sons to their daughters, who will desert to their gods and make your sons desert also.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952081/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ex. 34:12-16</a>, <em>Mo;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952081/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Deut. 7:1-6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952081/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 16,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952081/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 25, 26</a>) Interfaith <span id="page71" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="71" data-before-text="71"></span>compacts with false worshipers were outlawed by Jehovah. Even such nonreligious associations as marriage were forbidden as being dangerous to the integrity of the true worshiper.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu"> 7. What resulted when Israel failed to heed this command?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> However, the Israelites did not heed this command against interfaith and intermarriage with the demon-worshiping heathen in Canaan, and as a result they were oppressed and enslaved and were no longer effective in Jehovah’s service. They compromised and made compacts with the native inhabitants of the Promised Land and failed to root out and utterly destroy demon religion; rather they came under bondage to it. Therefore Jehovah said: “I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952081/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Judg. 2:3</a>) Because of their unwise tolerance of false worship the Israelites were pierced with thorny demonism and snared by false gods. Even Israel’s wisest human king was unable to ignore with impunity Jehovah’s counsel against entangling alliances with the heathen. The account of this king’s disobedience and the disastrous results is found at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952081/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Kings 11:1-11</a>, <em>Mo:</em></p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 8.

He married many foreign women—Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Phoenicians, and Hittites—belonging to nations against whom the Eternal had warned the men of Israel, ‘You must not mix with them, nor let them mix with you, for they will be sure to seduce you to follow their gods.’ Solomon clung to these women in love. When he grew old, he had no undivided mind for the Eternal his God, as his father David had; his wives seduced him to follow foreign gods. Solomon did what was evil in the eyes of the Eternal; he did not follow the Eternal faithfully, as his father David had done. For he put up shrines for Astartê the goddess of the Phoenicians, and for Milkom the detestable idol of the Ammonites, and for Kemôsh the detestable idol of Moab, on a hill to the east of Jerusalem. He did the same for all his foreign wives, burning incense and offering sacrifice to their gods. The Eternal was angry with Solomon for letting himself be seduced from the Eternal, the God of Israel, who had twice appeared to him and given him this order, that he was not to follow foreign gods; he did not obey what the Eternal had ordered, and so the Eternal said to Solomon, ‘Since this is your mind, since you have not obeyed my compact and the rules I laid down for you, I will tear the kingdom from you and give it to your servant.’”</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 9.

This may have promoted good will with his foreign wives and brought a measure of religious peace into his household life, just as interfaith movements today may subdue religious differences in national life. But it brought no peace with God. Along with his catering to the demon gods of his foreign wives, he kept up a pretense of also serving Jehovah, but he flouted the divine law: “You must love the LORD your God with all your mind and all your heart and all your strength.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952081/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Deut. 6:5</a>, <em>AT</em>) “He had no undivided mind” for Jehovah’s worship, but split his attentions. The psalmist expressed Jehovah’s view when he wrote: “I hate men who are half and half.” Prior to the fall of unfaithful Judah in 607 B.C. condemnation was pronounced against those who did “swear to Jehovah and swear by Malcam”. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952081/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 119:113</a>, <em>Mo;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952081/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Zeph. 1:5</a>, <em>AS</em>) They were like many of the faiths in <span id="page72" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="72" data-before-text="72"></span>Christendom today that take the name of God and Christ on their lips but teach and practice demon doctrines and pagan ceremonies.

<strong>Keeping the Mind Renewed</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> With our blessed knowledge from God’s Word we must train our minds in right ways of thinking and in right processes and efforts. Otherwise, we can become persons whose minds have gone bad again, “men completely corrupted in mind, disapproved as regards the faith,” as Paul speaks of them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951763/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951763/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2 Tim. 3:8</a>, <em>NW</em>) Our everlasting existence depends upon our establishing a righteous ‘law of the mind’. Our eternal destiny depends upon what we fix our attention on. “For,” as we read at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951763/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Romans 8:5-7</a> (<em>NW</em>), “those who are in accord with the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those in accord with the spirit on the things of the spirit. For the minding of the flesh means death, but the minding of the spirit means life and peace; because the minding of the flesh means enmity with God, for it is not under subjection to the law of God, nor, in fact, can it be.” If we get our minds off the truth and let them be corrupted again with the things of the Devil’s visible organization, it means the finish of us. “Their finish is destruction, and their god is their belly, and their glory consists in their shame, and they <span id="page626" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="626" data-before-text="626"></span>have their minds upon things on the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951763/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Phil. 3:18, 19</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 6. Remembering what warning example, why fear corruption of mind?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> It is right that we fear lest our minds should be corrupted while we are in this world in which the great Serpent is slyly crawling around and misleading the people. The apostle expressed that fear when he said: “I am afraid that somehow, as the serpent seduced Eve by its craftiness, your minds might be corrupted away from the sincerity and the chastity that are due the Christ.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951763/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Cor. 11:3</a>, <em>NW</em>) We remember that originally Eve had a healthy mental process or law, according to God’s revelations in the garden of Eden. But the Devil, alias the Serpent, came along and tried to put unhealthful ideas into her head. Instead of repelling them, Eve entertained them and this breakdown of the righteous law of her mind led to her being tempted into sin. She thought more on the desirability of eating forbidden fruit than on the truth of God’s word and his warning against eating. Following the righteous law in her mental processes, fixing her thoughts on God’s word as being the truth even if it made the Serpent a liar, would have spared her from being tempted and being drawn into temptation and sinning.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 7. Where does enmity against God start?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> If we, today, while the same Tempter is still about, establish the righteous ‘law of the mind’ and resolutely stick to the thinking processes of the new mind, it will keep us from entering into temptation and sinning. Enmity against God starts in the mind. The apostle tells us who have been reconciled to God: “You . . . were once alienated and enemies because your minds were on the works that were wicked.” He says that before we gave ourselves in obedience to God “we all at one time conducted ourselves in harmony with the desires of our flesh, doing the things the flesh and the thoughts willed, and we were naturally children of wrath even as the rest”.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951763/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Col. 1:21 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951763/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Eph. 2:2, 3</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 8.

The greatest of the commandments that was ever given to men requires us to love God with all our mental powers. Jesus pointed out what this greatest commandment is when he quoted it from God’s Law and said: “You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951763/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 22:37</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951763/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Deut. 6:5</a>, <em>AS;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951763/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 10:27</a>) What we think on habitually greatly affects and influences us and induces us to take a certain way. To be thinking one way and yet be doing another thing outwardly is hypocrisy. We must think lovingly toward Jehovah God. That means thinking to please him by obeying him and taking faithful care of everything that honors his name and furthers the interests of his kingdom.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 9. What judgment comes against double-minded ones?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> We cannot wholeheartedly serve God with a double mind. The psalmist rightly expressed it: “I hate them that are of a double mind; but thy law do I love.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951763/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 119:113</a>, <em>AS</em>) “I hate men who are half and half, I love thy law.” (<em>Mo</em>) Jesus hates them, too, and says to the many modern Laodiceans: “So, because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I am going to vomit you out of my mouth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951763/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Rev. 3:16</a>, <em>NW</em>) If you are of a double mind, dividing your attentions between this world and God and not making your mind over wholly to the image which God approves, it will in course of time betray itself without fail. That will mean your rejection. You will become corrupted mentally with infection from this world and you will enter into temptation. That is the very thing that has happened to Christendom. <span id="page627" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="627" data-before-text="627"></span>Your love of God with all your thinking processes is what you owe Him.

<strong>Light on Life’s Roadway from the Psalms</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Wisely the Psalms show us the need to concern ourselves with the law of God, with the other parts of God’s Word as well: “Happy is the man” whose “delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.” “I shall certainly meditate on all your activity, and with your dealings I will concern myself.” “How I do love your law! <span id="page552" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="552" data-before-text="552"></span>All day long it is my concern.”—1:1, 2; 77:12; 119:97.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">While such admonition, either direct or indirect, either explicit or implied, is to be expected in the book of the Psalms, what is often overlooked is that it is also filled with wise admonition as to daily conduct. For example, time and again its writers show that they appreciate that “bad associations spoil useful habits.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:33</a>) “I have hated the congregation of evildoers, and with the wicked ones I do not sit.” “In his eyes anyone contemptible is certainly rejected.” “Anyone of haughty eyes and of arrogant heart, him I cannot endure.” “Get away from me, you evildoers, that I may observe the commandments of my God.”—26:5; 15:4; 101:5; 119:115.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">The Psalms also throw light on life’s roadway by their wise counsel as to what should be our attitude when we see the wicked prosper: “Be agitated, but do not sin. Have your say in your heart, upon your bed, and keep silent. Sacrifice the sacrifices of righteousness, and trust in Jehovah.” “Do not show yourself heated up because of the evildoers. Do not be envious of those doing unrighteousness. For evildoers themselves will be cut off, but those hoping in Jehovah are the ones that will possess the earth.”—4:4, 5; 37:1, 9.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Then again, the Psalms enlighten by showing what God approves and what he disapproves: “O Jehovah, who will be a guest in your tent? . . . He who is walking faultlessly and practicing righteousness and speaking the truth in his heart. He has not slandered with his tongue. To his companion he has done nothing bad, and no reproach has he taken up against his intimate acquaintance. . . . A bribe against the innocent one he has not taken.” (15:1-3, 5) “Safeguard your tongue against what is bad, and your lips against speaking deception. Turn away from what is bad, and do what is good; seek to find peace, and pursue it.” “Lovers of Jehovah, hate what is bad.”—34:13, 14; 97:10.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">We have further light on our roadway by the very things the psalmist prays for: “Mistakes—who can discern? From concealed sins pronounce me innocent. Also from presumptuous acts hold your servant back; do not let them dominate me. In that case I shall be complete, and I shall have remained innocent from much transgression. Let the sayings of my mouth and the meditation of my heart become pleasurable before you, O Jehovah.” (19:12-14) “O Jehovah, my heart has not been haughty, nor have my eyes been lofty.” “Do set a guard, O Jehovah, for my mouth; do set a watch over the door of my lips. Should the righteous one strike me, it would be a loving-kindness; and should he reprove me, it would be oil upon the head, which my head would not want to refuse.”—131:1; 141:3, 5.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">Truly, today there is need of light, spiritual light for guidance on life’s roadway. Such light certainly is to be found in the book of Psalms, along with other books of the Bible, for the Psalms contain much history, many prophecies, right doctrine and an abundance of fine admonition in addition to its many songs of praise to and expressions of trust in Jehovah God. “Make melody to God, make melody. Make melody to our King, make melody. For God is King of all the earth; make melody, <em>acting with discretion.”</em>—47:6, 7.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Happiness Despite a Lawless, Loveless World</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> Seeing that Jehovah’s Witnesses are proceeding in agreement with Jehovah’s law for this time, the presumptuous persecutors try to bring about the downfall of the law-abiding Witnesses, just as was illustrated in the case of the psalmist, who said: “The presumptuous have excavated pitfalls to get me, those who are not in accord with your law.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalm 119:85</a>) The putting of the presumptuous schemers to shame means not merely the exposure of their misleading ways but, more particularly, the vindication of Jehovah as the true God. So with no maliciousness the psalmist could pray: “Let the presumptuous <span id="page19" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>ones be ashamed, for without cause they have misled me. As for me, I concern myself with your orders.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 119:78</a>) Jehovah makes sure that even the persecution works out for good and that the persecutors do not really fraudulently gain anything. He responds to the prayer of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Psalm 119:122</a>: “Act as a surety for your servant for what is good. May the presumptuous ones not defraud me.” Death on a mass scale threatened Jehovah’s Witnesses during the dictatorships of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, but by not forgetting the law and commandments of their God, they stood firm and many survived. In the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Psalm 119:60, 61</a>, the survivors can say: “I hurried up, and I did not delay to keep your commandments. The very ropes of the wicked ones surrounded me. Your law I did not forget.” The Almighty God is able to cut or break asunder the ropes of restraint tied about his Witnesses by their enemies and thus to free his servants in his due time for the work that he has ordained for them to do during this conclusion of the system of things.</p>

That is a recognition of the fact that ideas conveyed to the minds of men are more powerful than merely physical force. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953805/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Heb. 11:34</a>, <em>NW</em>) Not only is God’s Word more powerful than physical force and violence, but it is mightier than the penned or spoken words of all the propaganda agencies of this ungodly old world. It is alive. The old world is dying, and its words are death-dealing. Common also is the motto “Actions speak louder than words.” Such motto recognizes the fact that it is possible to say one thing and do another. What a person eventually does reveals that which is in his heart, even though his speech may deceive.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953805/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 23:3</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">12.

A person can say to God, ‘I am thy servant,’ and yet refrain from serving Jehovah. He can ask for understanding, but can avoid the study of God’s Word, from which alone understanding can come. Profession can be made that a person loves God’s commandments above gold and yet the one so professing can disregard God’s commandments, reading them in the Bible and not following them, but instead turning his time and efforts to the acquiring of gold. If God’s precepts concerning all things are actually esteemed to be right and held valuable and proper for keeping, then the servant of Jehovah, upon coming to an understanding concerning Jehovah’s counsel upon any matter, will follow that counsel and will actually and literally avoid falsities because he hates them, delighting rather in his very being to keep the wonderful testimonies of God.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">13.

The fact cannot be overemphasized that words symbolize ideas. God’s ideas must get into your <span id="page660" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="660" data-before-text="660"></span>mind, and in order for them to be powerful they must have an effect upon your thinking and your course of life. Therein is their power; but simply having a book called the Bible in the possession of individuals or of nations without applying the things that God has caused to be set out in that book is of no benefit to the possessors. The result of following God’s Word is the worship of Jehovah and hence life for his worshipers. Simple faith in the Scriptures, based on an understanding and appreciation of them and on love for God and uprightness, is the great requirement filled by the Word of God.</p>

Today that which was foreshadowed by Jerusalem, and the Jewish people over which she ruled, is involved on a tremendously larger scale. Christendom, her modern-day lawbreaking counterpart, is far greater than ancient Jerusalem and the nation of Israel.

Of the Word of God and the word and violence of men, which is more powerful?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Common is the saying to the effect that the pen is mightier than the sword. That is a recognition of the fact that ideas conveyed to the minds of men are more powerful than merely physical force. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953805/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Heb. 11:34</a>, <em>NW</em>) Not only is God’s Word more powerful than physical force and violence, but it is mightier than the penned or spoken words of all the propaganda agencies of this ungodly old world. It is alive. The old world is dying, and its words are death-dealing. Common also is the motto “Actions speak louder than words.” Such motto recognizes the fact that it is possible to say one thing and do another. What a person eventually does reveals that which is in his heart, even though his speech may deceive.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953805/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 23:3</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">12.

It is time for Jehovah to work; for they have made void thy law. Therefore I love thy commandments above gold, yea, above fine gold. Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way. Thy testimonies are wonderful; therefore doth my soul keep them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953805/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 119:125-129</a>, <em>AS</em>) The beautiful and wonderful expressions contained in this passage can be repeated without either the speaker’s or the hearer’s actually believing them. A person can say to God, ‘I am thy servant,’ and yet refrain from serving Jehovah. He can ask for understanding, but can avoid the study of God’s Word, from which alone understanding can come. Profession can be made that a person loves God’s commandments above gold and yet the one so professing can disregard God’s commandments, reading them in the Bible and not following them, but instead turning his time and efforts to the acquiring of gold. If God’s precepts concerning all things are actually esteemed to be right and held valuable and proper for keeping, then the servant of Jehovah, upon coming to an understanding concerning Jehovah’s counsel upon any matter, will follow that counsel and will actually and literally avoid falsities because he hates them, delighting rather in his very being to keep the wonderful testimonies of God.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">13.

The fact cannot be overemphasized that words symbolize ideas. God’s ideas must get into your <span id="page660" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="660" data-before-text="660"></span>mind, and in order for them to be powerful they must have an effect upon your thinking and your course of life. Therein is their power; but simply having a book called the Bible in the possession of individuals or of nations without applying the things that God has caused to be set out in that book is of no benefit to the possessors. The result of following God’s Word is the worship of Jehovah and hence life for his worshipers. Simple faith in the Scriptures, based on an understanding and appreciation of them and on love for God and uprightness, is the great requirement filled by the Word of God.</p>

Also, he <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>was mournful, he was mild-tempered, he hungered and thirsted for righteousness, he was merciful, he was reproached and persecuted, and he had every sort of wicked thing lyingly said against him. He wrote the psalm hundreds of years before our Common Era, while the nation of Israel was still under the Law covenant that had been mediated by the prophet Moses between Jehovah God and the nation in 1513 B.C.E. at Mount Sinai. Properly the psalmist had no fault to find with the Law of that covenant, for it was God-given. He well knew that the pagan nations all around the land of Israel had nothing to compare with that divine Law. He looked upon it as most enlightening, saying in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps 119 verses 105 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 130</a>: “Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light to my roadway.

For example, he uses the word “law” 25 times, “reminders” 22 times, “orders” 21 times, “regulations” 21 times, “commandments” 20 times, “judicial decision(s)” 21 times, with the related word “commandment” being used twice in the psalm. Despite the psalmist’s repeated use of these words that may sound legalistic, there is no evidence that he was a professional lawyer or jurist or even a judge. He was foremost a student of Jehovah’s recorded Word, which fact is borne out by his use of the expression “your word” 15 times. If he was the king of the nation of Israel, he was under the divine command to write a personal copy of the Law of Jehovah’s covenant with Israel for his own study and use.

<strong>Happiness Despite a Lawless, Loveless World</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> When we compare the international and national laws of the lands that are under the unseen control of “the father of the lie,” Satan the Devil, with Jehovah’s law, we can join the psalmist in saying: “Your law is truth. You are near, O Jehovah, and all your commandments are truth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">John 8:44;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Psalm 119:142,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/12/2" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> 151</a>) So by “walking in the law of Jehovah,” we, like the psalmist, will be safeguarded from walking in the way of worldly error to our own hurt, bodily and spiritually. This works for our happiness. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 119:1</a>) It works for our having divine blessing and approval. This affects our hearts, just as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 119:97,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 126, 127</a> indicates. The psalmist was under the Mosaic Law covenant that contained the “Torah,” the body of divine law that embodied many hundreds of distinct laws. Jehovah’s anointed witnesses of today are under the new covenant (of which Jesus Christ is the Mediator) with a “law” written, as it were, “in their heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984447/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>) By studying the Christian Greek Scriptures, they get acquainted with the new covenant “law” and its commandments.</p>

<strong>Restrictions of Christian Freedom</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Thus we see how vital it is for the Christian not to exceed his bound of relative freedom to delve in the doctrines of demons as expounded by false religion. Such exercise of free will brings one into the clutches of the Devil and puts him in bondage to unrighteousness. That one soon finds himself cast out into outer darkness; and how great is that darkness! <span id="page408" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="408" data-before-text="408"></span>Therefore a Christian’s life and thinking must be fed daily on teachings of truth which are gathered from God’s revealed Word of truth. Truth abides forever. Truth is indestructible. Basking in the sunshine of truth is freedom indeed.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952486/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ps. 146:6</a>, <em>AS;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952486/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">John 7:16, 17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952486/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 13:8</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Jesus well contrasted the two courses. In the following he compares those who build their structure of faith on the “rock-mass” of truth with those foolish ones who build on the “sand” of untruth. “Therefore everyone that hears these sayings of mine and does them will be likened to a discreet man, who built his house upon the rock-mass. And the rain poured down and the floods came and the winds blew and lashed against that house, but it did not cave in, for it had been founded upon the rock-mass. Furthermore, everyone hearing these sayings of mine and not doing them will be likened to a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand. And the rain poured down and the floods came and the winds blew and struck against that house and it caved in, and its collapse was great.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952486/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matt. 7:24-27</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>LAWS THEOCRATIC</strong></p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">13, 14. (a) How does the basis of God’s laws contrast with the basis of many of man’s laws? Illustrate. (b) What happened to the principles behind the Mosaic Law covenant when God brought the legal force of the Law to an end A.D. 33 and thus made it not binding upon Christians?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> Though many of man’s laws may be based on falsely conceived principles, laws theocratic as legislated by the great Sovereign Superior, Jehovah God, are soundly based on principles of truth. “Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is truth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952486/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps. 119:142</a>, <em>AS</em>) No legal fictions make up God’s law. For example, the divine law still in force to this day which forbids murder is based on the plain principle of fact that man is mortal. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952486/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Gen. 9:6</a>) False religions teach directly to the contrary the fiction that man is immortal. So just as true principles are used to build up all the many Bible doctrines, so true principles lie behind all of God’s laws.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952486/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">1 Cor. 9:8-10</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Actually, each of the hundreds of laws comprising the Law covenant, as given to Moses in 1513 B.C., is based on one or more principles of truth. As a matter of fact, a multitude of righteous principles came to man’s attention for the first time when as a revelation the Law covenant was given to the Israelites. For this reason when God brought the legal binding force of the Law covenant to an end “by nailing it to the [Jesus’] torture stake” A.D. 33, he did not destroy the eternal principles of truth which came to man’s notice by means of it. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952486/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Col. 2:14</a>, <em>NW</em>) These principles of truth found in the Law, still preserved for us in the Bible, continue to guide Christians in their way of righteousness. And so the sanctions of the Law covenant are as dead as the Law covenant itself and thus are not binding upon Christians today. “You are not under law but under undeserved kindness.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952486/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Rom. 6:14</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">15.

Laws being rules of action dictated by the superior for the conduct of the inferior, the inferior is obliged to obey in these matters. In addition to the law’s forbidding murder, already referred to, the Christian is also forbidden to eat blood, must abstain from fornication, must keep himself from worshiping idols, must not forsake the gathering together in assemblies, and so on. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952486/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Gen. 9:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952486/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> Acts 15:20,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952486/30/2" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> 29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952486/30/3" data-bid="31-4" class="b"> Heb. 10:25</a>, <em>NW</em>) Then let us not forget the two great laws or commandments Jesus gave us. “‘You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.’ This is <span id="page409" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="409" data-before-text="409"></span>the greatest and first commandment. The second, like it, is this: ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952486/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Matt. 22:37-39</a>, <em>NW</em>) These and the many other rules laid down for Christians in the Christian Greek Scriptures from the true superior authorities, Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, are part of the boundaries of a Christian’s relative freedom.</p>

Do not say the same things over repetitiously. Some think that prayer is more effective this way. But that is not what Jesus recommended.

<strong>Nicodemus</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">About two and a half years later, following the Festival of Booths, the Pharisees sent officers to lay <span id="page1224" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1224" data-before-text="1224"></span>hold of Jesus. On the officers’ return empty-handed, the Pharisees belittled them for making a report favorable to Jesus, whereupon Nicodemus spoke up, saying: “Our law does not judge a man unless first it has heard from him and come to know what he is doing, does it?” For this the others ridiculed him.

<strong>How Complete Is God’s Forgiveness?</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">The erroneous teaching of suffering for sins after death and of which suffering indulgences are supposed to be able to relieve one is based on a false premise, namely, that man has a soul that is separate and distinct from his body, and that it is immortal, leaving the body at death. But neither scientists nor surgeons have <span id="page680" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="680" data-before-text="680"></span>ever found such a soul in man, nor has anyone else found any evidence of such a thing. Man’s consciousness depends upon his organism; seriously harm it, as in an accident, and his consciousness suffers. The Bible teaching is in support of this scientific fact, for it tells us that, upon creation, man “came to be a living soul.” As for man as a soul being immortal, God’s Word plainly negates such a teaching, stating: “The soul that is sinning—it itself will die.” The hope for the dead lies, not in a supposedly immortal soul, but in a resurrection, which the Bible assures us will include “both the righteous and the unrighteous.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966841/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gen. 2:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966841/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Ezek. 18:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966841/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966841/10/3" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> Acts 24:15</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">More than that, not only does the Bible have nothing to say about indulgences and an immortal soul, but it likewise has nothing to say about such a place as purgatory. It tells of God’s creating heaven and earth but never mentions a purgatory, the word not occurring in the Bible from Genesis through Revelation.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>SUPPOSED OBJECTIONS CONSIDERED</strong></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Those who teach such doctrines as indulgences, immortality of the human soul and purgatory claim that these teachings are supported by Jesus’ words at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966841/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 12:47, 48</a>, about those knowing his Father’s will and not doing it being beaten with many strokes. However, no illustration can properly be used or interpreted to contradict plain statements of the Bible, but must be construed in harmony with them. Jesus was here stating a principle and a prophecy to be fulfilled at his second coming while his professed disciples were still alive in the flesh on earth.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Another text used to support the indulgence structure is <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966841/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 3:15</a>, which reads: “If anyone’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved; yet, if so, it will be as through fire.” Clearly, here literal fire is not meant, for Christians do not build with literal “gold, silver, precious stones,” or with “wood materials, hay, stubble,” as mentioned in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966841/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Co 3 verse 12</a>. More than that, it speaks of the person being saved as through fire because his works are burned. He built carelessly or unwisely in this life; in this life his works are destroyed and it is in this life, therefore, that he will be saved, as through fire of testing.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">God’s Word shows Him to be reasonable, just, loving and righteous. He has made provision for the forgiveness of sins that are not willful by the ransom sacrifice of his Son, Jesus Christ. Since that sacrifice cleanses us from all sin and consciousness of guilt, it leaves nothing to be paid for by temporal punishment, and which punishment might be or is supposed to be obviated by indulgences. Especially is there nothing left to be paid after death, since in death man is wholly unconscious, without any thoughts until the resurrection, if that be his lot. Yes, God’s forgiveness is complete.</p>

<strong>Champions of the Truth</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><strong>“Keep Your Eyes Ahead of the Night Watches”</strong> was the theme of the talk delivered by Michael Burnett, one of the Gilead School instructors. The Israelites divided the night from sundown to sunrise into three watches of four hours each. The final one, from 2:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m., was the darkest and coldest and was the time it was most difficult to stay awake. The psalmist occupied his mind with Jehovah’s sayings so that during the final watch of the night, he would <span id="page30" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="30" data-before-text="30"></span>not drift off to sleep. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012575/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 119:148</a>) “You will need to be watchful,” Brother Burnett told the students. “You will have some dark discouraging days and will see the effects of the cold, loveless world. You need a plan of action.” He then reminded them that they should tackle challenging study projects in order to keep themselves spiritually watchful. Brother Burnett illustrated his point: “Each day, you pray to Jehovah because you want him to be your friend. So, let Jehovah, as your friend, talk to you every day through the pages of the Bible. The night is well along, so plan how you will use your days ahead, and in that way you will keep your eyes ahead of the night watches.”</p>

<strong>Answering the Roman Governor’s Question, “What Is Truth?”</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[83]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Well, then, how was Jesus “full of . . . <span id="page648" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="648" data-before-text="648"></span>truth”? How was he the one through whom “the truth came to be”? Why does the apostle John contrast Jesus with Moses? Did not the prophet Moses bring the truth in his days, more than fourteen centuries before Christ? Was not the Law that God gave to Moses for the Jewish nation the truth? Yes. Centuries after the giving of the Law through Moses, the inspired psalmist said to God the Lawgiver: “Those in pursuit of loose conduct have come near; they have got far away from your own law. You are near, O Jehovah, and all your commandments are truth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 119:150, 151</a>) The very fact that the Law as given through Moses condemned his own people as sinners proves that this Law was true to righteousness and holiness. Because of its perfection, that Law condemned the Jews to death. So, in defense of the goodness of God’s law, the apostle Paul writes:</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[83]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> “And the commandment which was to life, this I found to be to death. For sin, receiving an inducement through the commandment, seduced me and killed me through it [that is, through the commandment that condemned sinners to death]. Wherefore, on its part, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rom. 7:10-12</a>.</p><p id="p84" data-pid="84" class="qu">12, 13. (a) What did the law of Moses require for the Jews to gain life by it, and why did that Law not miss its purpose? (b) How did the apostle Paul make that point clear, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/77/0" data-bid="78-1" class="b">Galatians 3:23-25</a>?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[84]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> So the Law given through Moses was not erroneous. Rather, it pointed out what error was. The Law given through Moses was not a mistake. The Ten Commandments that were a part of that Law were no mistake. The Law required perfect obedience on the part of the Jews in order for them to gain everlasting life by keeping it. But none of the Jews of ordinary birth could keep the Law perfectly and gain everlasting life by the works of the Law. Yet that Law served its purpose, for it identified or pointed out the Perfect One who did keep the Law flawlessly, the One who thus escaped condemnation by the Law and who was therefore pronounced completely righteous and deserving of everlasting life because of his unblemished righteousness. That the Law given through Moses did not miss its purpose and that it was no erroneous attempt or failure, the Jewish Christian apostle Paul made clear with these words:</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[84]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> “Before the [Christian] faith arrived, we were being guarded under law, being delivered up together into custody, looking to the faith that was destined to be revealed. Consequently the Law has become our tutor leading to Christ, that we might be declared righteous due to faith. But now that the faith has arrived, we are no longer under a tutor [the Law].”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gal. 3:23-25</a>.</p><p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="qu">14. (a) How was the law of Moses more than just a legal code? (b) How was this true respecting the priesthood for which the Law provided?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[85]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> The Law given through Moses was more than just a legal code, more than a systematized set of laws for human conduct. In many ways it was prophetic. It commanded many things that were prophetic of good things to come. For instance, the Law set up a priesthood for the Jewish nation in the family of Aaron, the older brother of Moses. This was prophetic of how Jehovah God would set up a High Priest who would offer sacrifice for the lasting benefit of all mankind. This spiritual, heavenly High Priest would also have underpriests, these being taken from among men and being able to sympathize with men in their sinful estate and imperfection.</p><p id="p86" data-pid="86" class="qu">15. Of what were the features of the annual Jewish atonement day prophetic?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[86]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> The Law ordered that every year a national atonement day should be held on the tenth day of the seventh lunar month of the Jews. On that day atonement was <span id="page649" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="649" data-before-text="649"></span>to be made for both the priesthood and all the rest of the Jewish nation by means of the sacrifice of an unblemished bull and goat, the blood of which was sprinkled in the Most Holy of the sanctuary. Also, their sins were to be carried away into oblivion by a scapegoat. All that was prophetic of how God’s great High Priest would offer up a sacrifice to atone for mankind’s sin and would serve as a real Sin Bearer to carry away mankind’s sin into oblivion. All this provision would be an expression of loving-kindness on God’s part.</p>

It is a wise reminder that the apostle Paul gives us, when he writes: “We can do nothing against the truth, but only for the truth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965841/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2 Cor. 13:8</a>) For that reason we should not, by a course contrary to God’s Word, cause the truth of God to show forth in triumph over us. To receive His blessing we should take a positive course in favor and support of God’s truth and publish it abroad to His glory and praise.</p>

<strong>Are You an Opportunist?</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Opportunists are plentiful in this world, which is why dishonest dealings, lying, cheating and immorality are so prevalent in high and low places. How often governments sign peace treaties only to break them and invade and plunder the territory of a neighbor without regard for principle or for the consequences to those vanquished! A tragic example of governmental <span id="page324" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="324" data-before-text="324"></span>opportunism occurred recently when the United States dishonored a treaty that had given a tribe of Seneca Indians land for a reservation. Authorities wanted to build a dam that would flood the reservation and cause the Indians to lose their homes, property and heritage. The treaty guaranteeing their rights was signed in 1794 by President George Washington. Ordinarily treaties have the force of law to back them up, but not even the Supreme Court would uphold the treaty rights of the Indians. Because of commercial and political opportunism, Indian treaties have been dishonored for decades.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">While you may not have the chance to break a national treaty, you do have occasions in everyday life to demonstrate whether you are an opportunist. For instance, if you were invited to eat at the home of persons who could not afford anything fancy, would you break the engagement if later someone else offered to take you to a very expensive restaurant and a theater that same evening? If you did, you would be an opportunist, since it was not ill health, an accident, or some such circumstance that caused you to make the change, but your desire for a “better deal.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">When making out your income-tax return, do you deduct more in contributions to charities than you have actually paid? When driving, do you run through stop signs or red lights in isolated areas where you feel nobody is watching? When shopping, do you pick up items without paying for them when no one looks? Do you play up to someone in authority just for your own personal advantage? If you do such things, you are an opportunist!</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">While you may feel such things are innocent, especially ‘since everybody does them,’ you must appreciate that persons who stand up for right principles do not do them. They know that opportunists are disgusting to God. As <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964400/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 119:158</a> states: “I have seen those who are treacherous in dealing, and I do feel a loathing, because they have not kept [God’s] saying.”</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">However, does this mean that all who break agreements are opportunists? No. If a man agrees to rob a bank, but then is stricken by conscience and breaks the agreement, he is hardly an opportunist. The agreement he broke was wrong to begin with. He broke it because of right principle, not in spite of it.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">This also applies where one marriage partner has agreed to accept the religion of his mate, or has agreed to raise his children in a certain religion, but then learns of true religion. He changes his former religion, adopts true religion and begins to instruct his children in his new faith. Is this opportunism? No, because it is done for the sake of truth, for God’s righteous laws. Actually, he would displease God if he did not take advantage of the opportunity to practice true religion. Continuing in a false religion is wrong. Abandoning it is not only right, but mandatory, even if it means breaking a previous agreement to do so.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Take advantage of proper opportunities to serve God and man. Build a personality based on the righteous principles of honesty, integrity, fair dealing, and consideration for others. Do as the psalmist, who said: “I have made a sworn statement, and I will carry it out, to keep your righteous judicial decisions.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964400/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 119:106</a>) Follow the example of Jesus Christ when he said: “Just let your word <em>Yes</em> mean Yes, your <em>No,</em> No,” and do not be an opportunist!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964400/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 5:37</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Reminders and Orders of the God of a New System</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> The psalmist tells us how he felt and what he did about those divine “orders.” In this way he served as a dependable example to us today. He appreciated that this course of life was under God’s observation and that he had to be careful how he conducted himself under Jehovah’s Law covenant. For good reason he said: “I have kept your orders and your reminders, for all my ways are in front of you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984448/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 119:168</a>) Reminders are a stimulus to the memory, but orders are directives issued by a superior to a subordinate. They set out what is to be done and how it is to be done by the servant, slave, employee or soldier in a dutiful way. Orders are things stronger than precepts; and the Hebrew word thus translated, namely, <em>piqudimʹ,</em> means “appointments; charges.” Did these divine orders seem burdensome or distasteful to the psalmist, especially if keeping them caused one to be falsely accused or misrepresented? Let us listen to him: “O see that I have loved your own orders. O Jehovah, according to your loving-kindness preserve me alive.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984448/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 119:159,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984448/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 169</a>.</p>

<strong>Psalm 119 Magnifies Jehovah’s Word</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The term ORDERS (“precepts” in the <em>New English Bible</em> [<em>NE</em>]) translates the Hebrew word <em>piq·qoh·dimʹ.</em> It comes from the same root as the word “overseer” and means “to inspect.” Its English equivalents mean ‘instructions with explicitness as to details’ and ‘rule of action.’ With warm appreciation the psalmist speaks of these “orders”: “O see that I have loved your own <em>orders.”</em> “I have observed your own <em>orders.”</em> “Owing to your <em>orders</em> I behave with understanding.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973207/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 119:159,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973207/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 100,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973207/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 104</a>.</p>

He instructed the kings of Israel to make their own copies of the written Law, and he appointed the Levites to teach that Law to the people. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023240/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Deut. 17:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023240/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 31:24-26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023240/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Neh. 8:7</a>) After the exile of the Jews to Babylon, a group of professional copyists began to make numerous copies of the Hebrew Scriptures. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023240/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezra 7:6</a>, ftns.) These men were conscientious. Eventually, copyists began to count not only the words but even the letters so as to be sure that everything was accurately transcribed. Even so, because of human imperfection, some small errors crept into the Bible text. However, many copies of the same text were made, so those errors could later be identified. How?</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>6.</strong><strong> How could errors in copies of the Bible be identified?</strong></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Modern scholars have a reliable way to identify errors made by those who copied the Bible text. To illustrate: Suppose 100 men are assigned to copy a page of text by hand. One of the men makes a slight error in his copy. One way we could detect that error is by comparing his copy with all the others. Similarly, by comparing a number of Bible manuscripts, scholars are able to identify errors or omissions that one copyist may have made.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong><strong> How accurate were many Bible copyists?</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Those who copied Bible manuscripts took pains to do so accurately. Consider an example that proves this point. The oldest complete manuscript of the Hebrew Scriptures dates back to 1008 or 1009 C.E. It is called the Leningrad Codex. In recent times, however, a number of Bible manuscripts and fragments have been discovered that are about 1,000 years older than the Leningrad Codex. Someone might think that after those manuscripts were copied and recopied over a period of 1,000 years, the text of the Leningrad Codex would bear little resemblance to the text of those older manuscripts. Yet, that is not the case. Scholars who compared the earlier manuscripts with the later ones found that despite some relatively slight variations in wording, the substance of the Bible’s message was accurately preserved.</p>

After comparing surviving manuscripts of the Greek Scriptures with other works of the same time period, one scholar concludes: “As a general rule there are more [copies of the Greek Scriptures], . . . and they tend to be more complete.” The book <em>Anatomy of the New Testament</em> states: “One can be confident that what we read in a responsible modern translation [of the Greek Scriptures] represents substantially what the ancient authors wrote.”</p>

One expert in world politics recently observed: “There is no advanced industrial democracy in the world more politically divided, or politically dysfunctional, than the United States today.” And Britain, the other part of this world power, has been especially divided in recent years by opposing opinions regarding what ties it should maintain with countries in the European Union. These divisions have made it almost impossible for the Anglo-American World Power to act decisively.</p>

He zealously preached to other inmates about God’s Kingdom and helped at least four of them to learn the truth. When the day of his execution arrived, Jack was a changed man. One of his attorneys said: “Jack is not the same person I knew 20 years ago.

<strong>“Let God Be Found True”</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> Such a God as this has inspired the writing of the Holy Scriptures. What confidence we should therefore have that these Scriptures are exclusively the truth, as distinct from all the other religious books that have been written, belonging to the religious systems of this world, ancient and modern! The very essence or substance of the written Word of God is <span id="page682" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="682" data-before-text="682"></span>truth, his Word being in full harmony with the facts and never once departing from actualities or from the successful carrying out of God’s glorious purpose. From its very beginning God’s written Word is the truth, and such truth moves on through the sixty-six Bible books to a grand climax of truth concerning God’s established kingdom for the eternal blessing of mankind.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">22. How is it true that the substance or sum of God’s Word is truth?</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> Added together, the sixty-six books of the Bible sum up to be a full, complete statement and expression of truth. That is why truth seekers love the Bible. The psalmist nicely expressed the matter when, under inspiration, he wrote in appreciation of God: “O see that I have loved your own orders. O Jehovah, according to your loving-kindness preserve me alive. The substance [or, sum] of your word is truth, and every righteous judicial decision of yours is to time indefinite.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965841/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 119:159, 160</a>; marginal reading, 1957 edition.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">23. Why could the psalmist say that God’s commandments are truth?</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> All of God’s commandments, as recorded in his written Word, are for the carrying out of the truth. They are given for the purpose of keeping the obedient ones in accord with the truth. His commandments are issued in order to move persons and things on to the realization of God’s prophecies, that thus these may come true. Sometimes persons who have got far away from God’s law in loose conduct come near to us to do us harm; but God is also near us if we lovingly and loyally keep his commandments. As the psalmist gratefully expressed the matter: “You are near, O Jehovah, and all your commandments are truth. Long ago I have known some of your reminders, for to time indefinite you have founded them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965841/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ps. 119:150-152</a>) Marvelously, those reminders and testimonies that God founded so long ago have continued till today, despite all efforts of the enemies of truth to overthrow and destroy them by destroying copies of the Bible and destroying believers in the Bible. But, says <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965841/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Psalm 117:2</a>, “the trueness of Jehovah is to time indefinite.”</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">24.

God’s truth has always prevailed and will always prevail. It is a wise reminder that the apostle Paul gives us, when he writes: “We can do nothing against the truth, but only for the truth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965841/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2 Cor. 13:8</a>) For that reason we should not, by a course contrary to God’s Word, cause the truth of God to show forth in triumph over us. To receive His blessing we should take a positive course in favor and support of God’s truth and publish it abroad to His glory and praise.</p>

The armor is the same for each and every one of us, and with it we can stand firm unitedly and hold the enemy at bay and beat back their assaults. So keep on each piece. Keep your heart fixed on righteousness, God’s righteousness, for your protection.

Keep your head helmeted with the right hope which leads to no disappointment. Strengthen your grip on the sword of the spirit, God’s Word.

We may be in prison or concentration camp because of demonized men and governments, but our enemies cannot take our spiritual armor off us. We can still retain this armor and fight in it there in detention, for Paul himself was wearing this armor in prison at Rome when he wrote us to wear it. And as we fight in it we can keep in communication with God and his invisible organization by means of prayer, every form of prayer, praise, thanksgiving, appreciation, petitions, and earnest supplications, for ourselves and for our brothers, our fellow fighters.

It is by individually studying the Bible and taking courage from God’s Word. This will give one assurance that the end of wickedness and of the multiplier of fears is at hand. There has not been enough personal study of God’s Word by mankind. If man studied the Bible, he would have the answers to our everyday problems, fears and anxieties. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:16, 17</a>) Learn for yourself how the Bible can be a light to your roadway in these difficult times. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 119:105</a>) Moreover, it is by obeying God’s laws and principles that great peace of mind and heart comes to the Christian. David stated: “Seven times in the day I have praised you because of your righteous judicial decisions. Abundant peace belongs to those loving your law, and for them there is no stumbling block.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 119:164, 165</a>) Do you personally want this peaceful, assuring outlook? Then study further into God’s Word and profit from the splendid examples of courage in times past. Learn from the course of action exemplified by such men as David, Isaac and others.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Rom. 15:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 10:11</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">11-13.

(c) What benefits come to those who “wait for Jehovah”?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Now we shall consider what a man of great personal courage had to say about gaining courage, that quality of the mind that enables one to meet danger and difficulties with firmness. David once said: “In you, O Jehovah, have I taken refuge. O may I never be ashamed. In your righteousness provide escape for me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 31:1</a>) Thus, the opening verse of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 31</a> provides some helpful direction on gaining courage, for it shows that a Christian must take refuge in Jehovah and never be ashamed to call on him for help, recognizing his complete dependence on Jehovah. We invite you now to read the whole thirty-first <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 31</a>. In it you will discover that David completely relied on Jehovah in all that he said and did. As you come to the end of this Psalm you will note the key to the whole matter, for the real basis for courage is “waiting for Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 31:24</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> What does it mean to “wait for Jehovah”? The word “wait” here is the Hebrew verb <em>Yahhál,</em> and by implication this word means to be patient, to hope, to expect, to trust. Even when David was outlawed by the king of the very nation of Israel, his own people, he did not try to take matters into his own hand but waited on Jehovah for the outcome, and he was indeed blessed by him. And what about Isaac? For 180 years this faithful man did not see the land of promise in his possession, and yet he, like David, waited on Jehovah. They had this in common. This was the basis of their sticking to the work that Jehovah had given them. It was their source of courage. It kept them moving ahead, enduring, happy in their privileges and responsibilities before Jehovah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 146:5</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> Christians today do well to learn from <span id="page428" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="428" data-before-text="428"></span>these ancient examples and “wait for Jehovah,” completely relying on him and following his principles at all times. Why? Even though Christians are in the world they can be no part of it. Hence, dedicated Christians are urged: “Do not be loving either the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him; because everything in the world—the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one’s means of life—does not originate with the Father, but originates with the world. Furthermore, the world is passing away and so is its desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 John 2:15-17</a>.</p>

<strong>“Keep from Becoming Causes for Stumbling”</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span id="page541" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="541" data-before-text="541"></span>Yet, according to Jesus, if we are careless and cause others to stumble, we can expect the same fate as Cain: “The Son of man will send forth his angels, and they will collect out from his kingdom all things that cause stumbling and persons who are doing lawlessness, and they will pitch them into the fiery furnace. There is where their weeping and the gnashing of their teeth will be.” “But whoever stumbles one of these little ones who put faith in me, it is more beneficial for him to have hung around his neck a millstone . . . and to be sunk in the wide, open sea.” It is indeed a sobering thought that those causing stumbling will be classed with those doing lawlessness and that it would have been better for them first to have perished in the sea.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961650/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 13:41, 42;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961650/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 18:6</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">True, were all Christians fully mature, there would be no danger of stumbling another: “The inclination that is well supported you will safeguard in continuous peace.” “Abundant peace belongs to those loving your law, and for them there is no stumbling block.” But since not all Christians are strong in faith and mature, we must exercise care. The issue really is self-interest versus another’s spiritual interests, or, which is more important, luxuries for ourselves or another’s necessities? “All things are lawful; but not all things are advantageous. All things are lawful; but not all things build up. Let each one keep seeking, not his own advantage, but that of the other person.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961650/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 26:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961650/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Ps. 119:165;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961650/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 1 Cor. 10:23, 24</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In fact, Christians must exercise care lest they stumble “people on the outside.” “Keep from becoming causes for stumbling to Jews as well as Greeks and to the congregation of God, even as I am pleasing all people in all things, not seeking my own advantage but that of the many, in order that they might get saved.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961650/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Tim. 3:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961650/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 10:32, 33</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>BY THOUGHTLESS USE OF THE TONGUE</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">One of the commonest ways in which one might become a cause for stumbling is by the thoughtless use of that “unruly injurious thing,” his tongue. “If any man seems to himself to be a formal worshiper and yet does not bridle his tongue, but goes on deceiving his own heart, this man’s form of worship is futile.” Why? Because he might stumble others by using vulgar, obscene or profane language or by saying things that he ought not. Wisely therefore we are counseled: “Let nothing go forth unrestrained from your mouth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961650/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jas. 3:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961650/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 1:26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961650/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 1 Sam. 2:3</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Do you freely criticize? True, your remarks may be accurate, but is it really your prerogative to express criticism and do you do so in a kind manner and at the right time? Are you destructive, causing stumbling, or constructive, truly helpful and encouraging as well as enlightening?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Are you prone to gossip? Gossip is small talk and it might be argued that only immature ones would be stumbled by it; but it is the very immature ones that you must consider. Those in Paul’s day who stumbled on account of meat certainly were immature, yet he said that he would never eat meat again if it caused his brother to stumble. So watch even your light, small talk.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961650/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Cor. 8:13</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Do you betray confidences? To the extent that others consider you mature, experienced, wise, dependable, to that extent they will be likely to take you into their confidence. To betray it reflects unreliability on your part and might easily stumble those looking to you for help.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Do you like to speculate regarding the meaning of certain scriptures or fulfillment of prophecies? To express private, personal opinions that seem plausible to you but for which you have little or no basis, can easily confuse the immature, causing them to stumble. Besides, it tends <span id="page542" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="542" data-before-text="542"></span>to draw undue attention to yourself, and so might even cause you to stumble. Instead of seeking glory for yourself, honor God and look to his organization for instruction.</p>

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page611" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="611" data-before-text="611"></span><strong>Why Must You Know Your Bible?</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE Bible is Almighty God’s written revelation to mankind. It contains the thoughts of God in the language of men. It is the only inspired book that reveals God, his purposes, the duties of man and the requirements for life. As Sir Matthew Hale, lord chief justice of England, once said: “The Bible is the only source of all Christian truth;—the only rule for the Christian life;—the only book that unfolds to us the realities of eternity.”</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">You must know your Bible to know God. This is important because without a knowledge of God no man will gain everlasting life. Jesus Christ said: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961760/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) So knowing God and Christ and having knowledge of God’s requirements for gaining everlasting life are closely linked together.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Bible is the only sure guide in the worship of God, which is another reason why you must know your Bible. Worshipers of Jehovah should “be filled with the accurate knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual discernment, in order to walk worthily of Jehovah to the end of fully pleasing him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961760/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Col. 1:9, 10</a>) Yes, we must know God’s will if we are to “walk worthily” before him.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">By means of such God-approved worship one finds peace with God, peace with one’s fellow man and peace with oneself, which is so vital to happiness. Wrote the psalmist: “Abundant peace belongs to those loving your law, and for them there is no stumbling block.” The American journalist Horace Greeley declared: “It is impossible to enslave mentally or socially a Bible-reading people. The principles of the Bible are the groundwork of human freedom.” Are not the gaining of divine approval, the finding of peace and freedom worth-while reasons for knowing your Bible?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961760/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 119:165</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In addition to these, there is another compelling reason why you should know your Bible. We are living in the time when, as God has foretold, he will sweep away all wickedness and firmly establish an everlasting new world of righteousness. This he will do by means of his kingdom, his heavenly government in the hands of his Son Jesus Christ. To survive that time of destruction and gain the blessings of God’s new world, we must submit to the rule of his kingdom now. The Bible, the book that has as its very theme the kingdom of God, shows us how. Yes, a knowledge of the Bible with obedience to it means life.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"></p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960002/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Zeph. 2:3</a>) Jehovah’s witnesses in all parts of the world want to prove themselves worthy ministers of God by steadfastly preaching the good news of God’s kingdom. They want to show appreciation for the ordination they have received from Jehovah and prove by right works that they can live Christian lives. Their vocation is their call to the divine service of their God. By putting on this new personality, which was created according to God’s will in true righteousness and loving-kindness, they can serve better and accomplish more. Jehovah’s witnesses, God’s ordained ministers, will devote their full time to Christian <span id="page18" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>living and will conduct themselves in this old world as Jesus did. They remember what he said: “If you were part of the world, the world would be fond of what is its own. Now because you are no part of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, on this account the world hates you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960002/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">John 15:19</a>) But even though the world hates them, Jehovah’s witnesses are going to show love toward all persons in the world and are going to stay at peace with them.

For Jehovah’s eyes are upon the righteous.”</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"><sup>25</sup></span> As ordained ministers before Jehovah God, Jehovah’s witnesses will carry out His will. “In fact, to this course you were called, because even Christ suffered for you, leaving you a model for you to follow his steps closely. He committed no sin, nor was deceit found in his mouth. When he was being reviled, he did not go to reviling in return. When he was suffering, he did not go to threatening, but kept on committing himself to the one who judges righteously.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960002/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:21-23</a>) To him also his ordained ministers commit themselves in ever doing right.</p>

Such temporary loss of memory, which occurs frequently, is called retrieval failure. Scientists compare it to trying to find a misplaced object in a cluttered room. . . . A good way to ensure remembering a piece of information is to study it long after you think you know it perfectly.” Diligent study and repetition will help us to recall God’s reminders and comply with them for our own good.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 7.

Such temporary loss of memory, which occurs frequently, is called retrieval failure. Scientists compare it to trying to find a misplaced object in a cluttered room. . . .

<strong>Reminders and Orders of the God of a New System</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> The psalmist tells us how he felt and what he did about those divine “orders.” In this way he served as a dependable example to us today. He appreciated that this course of life was under God’s observation and that he had to be careful how he conducted himself under Jehovah’s Law covenant. For good reason he said: “I have kept your orders and your reminders, for all my ways are in front of you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984448/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 119:168</a>) Reminders are a stimulus to the memory, but orders are directives issued by a superior to a subordinate. They set out what is to be done and how it is to be done by the servant, slave, employee or soldier in a dutiful way. Orders are things stronger than precepts; and the Hebrew word thus translated, namely, <em>piqudimʹ,</em> means “appointments; charges.” Did these divine orders seem burdensome or distasteful to the psalmist, especially if keeping them caused one to be falsely accused or misrepresented? Let us listen to him: “O see that I have loved your own orders. O Jehovah, according to your loving-kindness preserve me alive.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984448/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 119:159,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984448/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 169</a>.</p>

Stop and think. If you get in only two hours instead of three, due to helping three weak ones, think how much more praise this means to Jehovah. Four times two equals eight hours instead of your individual three. Maybe <em>you</em> will be praised more by men if you put in more hours working by yourself, but <em>Jehovah</em> is praised more when more praisers are in the field. Paul counsels: Keep “an eye, not in personal interest upon just your own matters, but also in personal interest upon those of the others.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Phil. 2:4</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="ss"><strong>PRAISING JEHOVAH WITH THE POWERS OF SPEECH</strong></p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">21.

For, says the apostle Peter, “maintain your conduct fine among the nations.” Why so? In order, Peter continues, “that . . . they may as a result of your fine works of which they are eyewitnesses <em>glorify God.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:12</a>) So when dealing with outsiders you must be patient and long-suffering. You must show kindness and neighbor love. You must exercise self-control. You must prove your uncompromising integrity to Jehovah when facing the everyday issues. And there are so many issues presented by this materialistic, sex-crazed system of things, including such vital matters as blood transfusions, regimented servitude and saluting of images of the State, all of which must be met with the same intelligent determination as displayed by first-century Christians who boldly declared: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Acts 5:29</a>.</p>

Now the wiping out of the whole human family by warfare with nuclear weapons threatens. Not merely this, but antireligious hatred embitters more and more human hearts. After all forms of false religion are destroyed, God’s enemies will have to deal with Jehovah’s Witnesses. When the irreligious opposers of God’s Kingdom close in upon the surviving witnesses of Jehovah, these will as never before need superhuman help. They will have to be covered with the protective shadow of an almighty hand, God’s hand. They will have a basis for appealing for that divine hand to come to their aid, just as stated in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984448/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Psalm 119:173</a>: “May your hand serve to help me, because your orders I have chosen.” Under <span id="page25" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>those most challenging circumstances, Jehovah’s hand will not prove too short in reaching ability so that it cannot save God-fearing observers of his orders.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984448/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Isaiah 50:2</a>.</p>

<strong>Happiness Despite a Lawless, Loveless World</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[28]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> In that opening stanza of 8 Hebrew lines we note the key words <em>law, reminders, orders, regulations, commandments,</em> and <em>judicial decisions.</em> All through the 176 Hebrew verses, the psalmist emphasizes those words. For example, he uses the word “law” 25 times, “reminders” 22 times, “orders” 21 times, “regulations” 21 times, “commandments” 20 times, “judicial decision(s)” 21 times, with the related word “commandment” being used twice in the psalm. Despite the psalmist’s repeated use of these words that may sound legalistic, there is no evidence that he was a professional lawyer or jurist or even a judge. He was foremost a student of Jehovah’s recorded Word, which fact is borne out by his use of the expression “your word” 15 times. If he was the king of the nation of Israel, he was under the divine command to write a personal copy of the Law of Jehovah’s covenant with Israel for his own study and use.

He longed for what would help him to be law-abiding.
