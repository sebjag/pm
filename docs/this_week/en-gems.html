<strong>Training Our Conscience to Do More for Us</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> The heart is vitally involved with this higher conception of moral duty, namely, the conscience. Hence, the need for what the Bible calls “a pure heart,” or ‘a clean heart.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976644/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Pss. 51:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976644/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 73:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976644/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Matt. 5:8</a>) This is a heart whose only motive and desire is to serve Jehovah exclusively and to hallow his name. The reasonings of the heart deeply affect one’s conscience for good or for bad. So, if we examine our conscience and the way it operates we may also discern the heart’s desires and motives. We will see whether we have a good heart or a bad one. Also, as we become aware of our moral obligations, we will be able to look into the workings of our heart and mind, and see the kind of person we truly are within, as God sees us.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976644/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Sam. 16:7</a>.</p>

<strong>Bearing the Burden of Injustice</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[28]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> So disturbing has it been for them to face injustice that some of God’s servants have found themselves giving way to serious doubts about the value of an upright life. This is what happened to Asaph,<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1978765/0">a</a> a prominent Levite musician during the reign of King David. He wrote compositions that were used for many centuries in public worship. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978765/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Chron. 29:30</a>) Along with Heman and Jeduthun, Asaph ‘prophesied with the harps, with the stringed instruments and with the cymbals.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978765/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Chron. 25:1</a>) Evidently such prophesying involved their rendering praise and thanks to God while accompanying themselves with instrumental music. Likely Asaph, Heman and Jeduthun did this with the feeling and intensity characteristic of the prophets. Furthermore, their expressions, set to music, conveyed vital messages to the Israelites. Truly, Asaph was highly favored. Yet, during a certain period of his life, he came to be in grave spiritual danger. In one of his inspired songs, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978765/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 73</a>, Asaph admits: “My feet had almost turned aside, my steps had nearly been made to slip.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978765/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps 73 Vs. 2</a>.</p>

<strong>Safeguarded by Faith and Hope</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Yet even though true Christians have such faith and hope, they cannot allow themselves to lose sight of the fact that, if they are careless, the world’s materialistic view can infect them. Their faith can weaken and their hope can grow dim. This is what happened to a man named Asaph who lived many centuries ago. He found that his attitude about the prosperity of the wicked had deprived him of joy. Regarding his feelings, Asaph wrote:</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="si"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>“As for me, my feet had almost turned aside, my steps had nearly been made to slip. For I became envious of the boasters, when I would see the very peace of wicked people. For they have no deathly pangs; and their paunch is fat. They are not even in the trouble of mortal man, and they are not plagued the same as other men. Therefore haughtiness has served as a necklace to them; violence envelops them as a garment. Their eye has bulged from fatness; they have exceeded the imaginations of the heart. They scoff and speak about what is bad; about defrauding they speak in an elevated style. They have put their mouth in the very heavens, and their tongue itself walks about in the earth. And they have said: ‘How has God come to know? And does there exist knowledge in the Most High?’ Look! These are the wicked, who are at ease indefinitely. They have increased their means of maintenance. Surely it is in vain that I have cleansed my heart and that I wash my hands in innocence itself.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975045/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 73:2-9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975045/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 11-13</a>.</p>

Give an example.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Many young ones choose to forget Jehovah because they feel that being a Witness is too restrictive. A brother in Spain recalls how he felt as a teenager: “I was attracted to the world because the truth seemed difficult and rigid. It meant sitting, studying, going to meetings, putting on a tie, and those were not things I enjoyed doing.” Do you sometimes feel that you are missing out because you serve God? Perhaps it will surprise you to know that one of the writers of the Bible experienced those very feelings. Please open your Bible and read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999644/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 73</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 8.

For I became envious of the boasters, when I would see the very peace of wicked people.” According to the superscription, this psalm was written by Asaph. He was a Levite musician and a contemporary of King David. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999644/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 25:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999644/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 2 Chronicles 29:30</a>) Although he had the fine privilege of serving in God’s temple, he “became envious” of men who boasted about their lawlessness. Things appeared to go well for them; they apparently enjoyed peace and security. In fact, their seeming successes ‘exceeded the imaginations of their hearts.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999644/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps 73 Verses 5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999644/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 7</a>) They would talk about their exploits “in an elevated style,” that is, in an arrogant manner.

You may hear them shamelessly boast of their sexual escapades, their wild parties, and their indulgence in alcohol and drugs. When you contrast their life of so-called pleasure with the narrow way you must walk as a Christian, you might sometimes feel “envious of the boasters.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999644/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matthew 7:13, 14</a>) Asaph himself got to the point where he exclaimed: “Surely it is in vain that I have cleansed my heart and that I wash my hands in innocence itself.

<strong>The End of Crime Now Near!</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Please note the words of the psalmist Asaph: “I became envious of the boasters, when I would see the very peace of wicked people.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989601/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 73:3</a>) Yes, envy of a criminal’s prosperity and life-style entices many to adopt lawless ways. Glamorizing crime on television and in the press makes it more acceptable rather than stimulating a hatred of what is bad.</p>

<strong>Can You Be Contented with Your Lot in Life?</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">For example, there was the Levite Asaph, a well-known singer and musician. He wrote: “I became envious of the boasters, when I would see the very peace of wicked people. They are not even in the trouble of mortal man, and they are not plagued the same as other men.” Therefore, he began to say to himself: “It is in vain that I have cleansed my heart and that I wash my hands in innocence itself.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981162/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 73:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981162/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981162/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 13</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">In effect, Asaph asked himself: ‘What is the use of trying to do what is right? Others are getting away with badness. Why not I?’ But then he discerned that his reasoning was wrong. While at the sanctuary with other worshipers of Jehovah, he came to recognize that the prosperity of the wicked is short-lived.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981162/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 73:15-19</a>.</p>

When Asaph observed the prosperity of the wicked, envy was stirred up within him. Unscrupulous men would boast about the wealth that they had accumulated by fraudulent means. Despite their lawlessness, things seemed to go very well for them. Outward appearances gave every indication that they were enjoying peace and security. In fact, despite their vile way of life, ‘they had no deathly pangs’; even their life appeared to come to a peaceful end, without horrible pangs of death. They had enough food, and no particular health problems interfered with their enjoyment of meals. Their eyes were not sunken from lack of nourishment but “bulged from fatness.” These men shamelessly continued in their wicked ways. Their arrogance or haughtiness was like an ornament to them, “a necklace.” So many were their violent deeds that they were ‘covered with them as with a garment.’ At all times they were dressed in violence. Being successful in their unrighteous scheming, they ‘surpassed the imaginations of their hearts.’ This encouraged them to speak about their fraudulent practices “in an elevated style,” in an arrogant manner. ‘They would put their mouths in the heavens and their tongue would walk about in the earth.’ No regard did they have for anyone in heaven or on earth. Their tongue was left unbridled, and their mouths spewed forth what their tongue pleased.</p>

Wicked people prospered, likely ‘increasing their means of maintenance’ by fraudulent means. They seemed to escape penalty for the worst wrongdoing, but Asaph was plagued “all day long”​—from when he awoke until he retired at night. He felt that Jehovah was correcting him every morning.

<strong>Attitudes and Gestures</strong><br/><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb"><strong>Innocence, and Denial of Responsibility.</strong> <em>Washing hands.</em> Innocence in a matter or the act of relieving oneself of responsibility was figuratively demonstrated by one’s washing one’s hands. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/107/0" data-bid="108-1" class="b">De 21:6</a>) In this way the psalmist declares his innocence at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/108/0" data-bid="109-1" class="b">Psalm 73:13</a>; see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000467/109/0" data-bid="110-1" class="b">Psalm 26:6</a>.

<strong>Bathing</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Ceremonial bathing on the part of the Israelites in general was required for various reasons. Anyone who recovered from leprosy, anyone who contacted things touched by those with “a running discharge,” a man who had an emission of semen, a woman after menstruation or hemorrhaging, or anyone having sexual intercourse was “unclean” and had to bathe. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000579/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Le 14:8, 9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000579/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 15:4-27</a>) One in a tent with, or touching, a human corpse was “unclean” and had to be purified with cleansing water. If anyone refused to comply with this regulation, he “must be cut off from the midst of the congregation, because it is Jehovah’s sanctuary that he has defiled.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000579/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Nu 19:20</a>) Appropriately, then, washing is used figuratively to denote a clean standing before Jehovah.

<strong>How You Benefit from Pursuing Godly Devotion</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> In this world, nothing else has any real stability. Death can rob us of dear relatives and friends. Accidents or disease may leave us or loved ones helpless and crippled. Property can be stolen or destroyed. Hence, to make material things, position or any earthly relationship the real basis for our contentment can lead to bitter disappointment. Such disappointment might even cause one to blame God and come to reason wrongly as did Asaph: “All to no purpose have I kept my heart pure, and washed my hands in innocence.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975126/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Ps. 73:13</a>, <em>An American Translation</em>) Unchecked, such reasoning could cause one to stop pursuing godly devotion.</p>

He exclaimed: “Surely on slippery ground is where you place them. You have made them fall to ruins. O how they have become an object of astonishment as in a moment!

Worse yet, they suffer alienation from God.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999644/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">James 4:4</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> A young Witness in Spain observed this truth firsthand. As a youth, she led a double life, being deeply involved with a group of godless youths. Before long, she fell in love with one of them​—a drug addict. Though she abstained from using drugs herself, she purchased drugs for him. “I even helped him insert the needle,” she admits. Fortunately, this sister was brought to her senses and restored to spiritual health. But how shocked she was to learn some time later that her drug-using boyfriend had died of AIDS. Yes, just as the psalmist said, godless people are “on slippery ground.” Some may die unexpectedly as a result of their loose life-style. As for the rest, unless they change their ways, they will in the near future face “the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his powerful angels in a flaming fire, as he brings vengeance upon those who do not know God and those who do not obey the good news about our Lord Jesus.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999644/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">2 Thessalonians 1:7, 8</a>.</p>

<strong>Why Do Other Youths Have All the Fun?</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Fortunately, Asaph came to his senses before he did anything rash. He made a visit to “the grand sanctuary of God,” and in those wholesome surroundings, he gave matters serious thought. Before long Asaph had drawn a remarkable conclusion regarding godless pleasure seekers: “Surely on slippery ground is where you place them. You have made them fall to ruins.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101996526/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 73:17, 18</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The same can be said of many of your pleasure-seeking peers. They may think that they are having a good time now. But the enjoyment of sin is only <em>temporary!</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101996526/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:25</a>) Because they do not follow Bible standards, they are standing “on slippery ground” and are in constant danger of experiencing a terrible crash—suddenly and without warning. God’s Word declares: “Whatever a man is sowing, this he will also reap.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101996526/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Galatians 6:7</a>) Surely you have heard of young ones your age who have already suffered premature death, sexually transmitted disease, unwanted pregnancy, or jail as a result of “fun” escapades. Does it not benefit you, then, to steer clear of such things?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101996526/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Isaiah 48:17</a>.</p>

The seeming prosperity of the wicked is but temporary. Because their life centers solely around corruptible material possessions, they are standing “on slippery ground” and are in constant danger of experiencing a terrible crash, suddenly and without warning. At the latest, death will overtake them in old age, and their ill-gotten gain will be of no value in securing for them a longer life. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978765/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 49:6-12</a>) Their prosperity will be like a dream that quickly passes. It may even be that justice will catch up with them long before they reach old age. The unchangeable law of God may go into effect against them: “Whatever a man is sowing, this he will also reap.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978765/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Gal. 6:7</a>) Since they have turned their backs on the Most High, the only One who could help them, the full impact of the disaster comes crashing down on them. They are left completely helpless, without hope and comfort. When Jehovah thus arouses himself against them, he will view their “image,” their pomp and position, with contempt, as something worthless.</p>

Yet, Asaph ‘was constantly with God, who had taken hold of his right hand.’ If we err in our thinking but seek Jehovah’s counsel as Asaph did, God will take us by the hand, to support and lead us. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993527/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Jeremiah 10:23</a>.) Only by applying his counsel can we be led into a happy future. We may suffer humiliation for a time, but Jehovah will bring about a reversal, ‘taking us to glory,’ or honor.</p>

<strong>Jehovah Is My Share</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> At the sanctuary, Asaph began to view things from God’s perspective. You may have had a similar experience. Perhaps at one point you lost sight of your spiritual privileges to some extent and began to focus on what you were lacking in a material way. But by studying God’s Word and by going to Christian meetings, you came to see things Jehovah’s way. Asaph perceived what would eventually happen to the wicked. He thought about his lot and realized that Jehovah would take hold of his right hand and lead him. Asaph could thus say to Jehovah: “Besides you I do have no other delight on the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011682/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 73:23,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011682/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 25</a>) He then referred to God as his share. <strong>(<em>Read</em></strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011682/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b"><strong><em>Psalm 73:26</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em>)</strong> Although the psalmist’s ‘organism and heart might fail,’ God would be his “share to time indefinite.” The psalmist was confident that Jehovah would remember him as a friend. His faithful service would not be forgotten. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011682/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Eccl. 7:1</a>) How reassuring that must have been for Asaph! He sang: “As for me, the drawing near to God is good for me. In the Sovereign Lord Jehovah I have placed my refuge.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011682/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 73:28</a>.</p>

<strong>“This Is Your Day”</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><strong>“Keep Jehovah as the Rock of Your Heart.”</strong> Speaking on that captivating topic, based on <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011093/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 73:26</a>, Gary Breaux, a member of the United States Branch Committee, helped the students to appreciate the need for relying on Jehovah. In what sense is Jehovah like a rock? “A rock can hold down a piece of paper in a windstorm,” Brother Breaux stated. “In a similar way, Jehovah can be a stabilizing influence that can guard your heart.” Of course, the heart can mislead us when we are faced with tests of endurance.

That was no little flock!” That’s correct, they were a great crowd, part of those Jesus called his “other sheep.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">John 10:16</a>) They hope to live here on earth in God’s new world, under the righteous rule of Christ Jesus and his heavenly congregation.

That there would be a great crowd associated with the true congregation we have further proof, in the words of John, another apostolic foundation: “I saw, and, look! <em>a great crowd,</em> which no man was able to number, out of all nations and tribes and <span id="page560" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="560" data-before-text="560"></span>peoples and tongues, . . . crying with a loud voice, saying: ‘Salvation we owe to our God, who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Rev. 7:9, 10</a>) No mention is made of attributing salvation to any mysterious third person of a supposed “trinity,” for the Christian congregation does not hold to Christendom’s mistaken belief in this regard.

Why must I congregate?” Because it is Jehovah’s will for you. If you really study your Bible closely you will soon learn this. You must be congregated to be part of God’s “household.” Christians are commanded to “consider one another to incite to love and right works, not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and all the more so as you behold the day drawing near.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Heb. 10:24, 25</a>) If it is your custom to absent yourself from meetings of the congregation, how can you encourage and incite others to love Jehovah and fulfill his will? How can others encourage and incite you? Jehovah did not inspire the Scriptures in order to isolate believers. Paul said he wrote to Timothy in order “that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in God’s household, which is the congregation of the living God, a pillar and support of the truth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">1 Tim. 3:15</a>) You serve as part of the pillar supporting God’s Word of truth in your community when you are congregated, working closely with the congregation. Moreover, a wise person must do more than <em>read</em> God’s law. Jehovah says he must also <em>listen:</em> “A wise person will listen and take in more instruction.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Prov. 1:5</a>) In order to listen he must be assembled where Jehovah’s servants are speaking. To keep away from Jehovah and the doing of his will is to show an adulterous spirit. “Look! the very ones keeping away from you will perish. You will certainly silence every one adulterously leaving you. But as for me, the drawing near to God is good for me. In the Sovereign Lord Jehovah I have placed my refuge, to declare all your works.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Ps. 73:27, 28</a>) No adulterer will inherit God’s kingdom.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Eph. 5:5</a>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu">10.

Dozens of families in the rural sections have abandoned their homes and moved to larger cities, because, where they lived, it became nearly impossible to meet together and even more difficult to witness for God’s kingdom. What practical wisdom! Evidently their viewpoint is that of the psalmist: “I rejoiced when they were saying to me: ‘To the house of Jehovah let us go.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Ps. 122:1</a>) If, as a Christian, you are determined to walk with Jesus, you must go where he is. The Revelation shows he is walking in the midst of his congregation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Rev. 2:1</a>) Wherever two or three are congregated in his name, he is among them.

Read about it at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Luke 10:1-12</a>. Specific instructions are given on how to effectively preach and teach Jehovah’s law to men of good will. First-century Christians also gave close attention to “public reading, to exhortation, to teaching.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:13</a>) You will rejoice to find this same studious attention to Bible reading and study at each of the five weekly meetings of the Christian congregation today. The theocratic ministry school is a good example. Men and women, young and old, give practice sermons, followed by personal counsel. Isaiah’s words have come true: They will all be “taught by Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Isa. 54:13</a>) Early in the week, usually on a Tuesday night, the congregation copies the early Christian example and meets in a private home in your community; in fact, in several homes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Rom. 16:5</a>) Find out where the nearest group meets in your neighborhood. Become a regular participant. Jehovah will pour you out such a blessing in wisdom and understanding that you will not be able to contain it. The desire to communicate what you learn to others will well up in you. Go along with the members of that service center and learn how they say “Come” to others. Do this and you will take the first steps toward becoming a true Christian.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997367/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 146:3, 4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997367/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Proverbs 17:23</a>) So rather than squander his precious time, energy, and resources trying to do away with all the wickedness around him, he focused on his relationship with God. Asaph declared: “As for me, the drawing near to God is good for me. In the Sovereign Lord Jehovah I have placed my refuge.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997367/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 73:28</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Today, those who engage in corrupt business practices often enjoy material advantages. Many may even boast of their disregard for God’s moral laws. But they will not prevail indefinitely. “Surely on slippery ground is where you place them,” observed Asaph. “You have made them fall to ruins.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997367/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 73:18</a>.</p>

<strong>Prosperity Can Test Your Faith</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Appreciating the need for reliance on Jehovah, Asaph added: <em>“Whom do I have in the heavens?

God is the rock of my heart and my share to time indefinite.</em> <em>For, look! the very ones keeping away from you will perish.

Even if our organism and heart should fail, he will strengthen us and give stability to our heart so that we do not lose hope and courage amid adversities. Intimacy with Jehovah is a priceless possession. Letting it go would spell calamity for us along with all who abandon him. Like Asaph, therefore, let us draw close to God and throw all our anxiety upon him.

This is what the psalmist came to appreciate. We read: “I am constantly with you; you have taken hold of my right hand. With your counsel you will lead me, and afterward you will take me even to glory. Whom do I have in the heavens? And besides you I do have no other delight on the earth.

<strong>Safeguarded by Faith and Hope</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Although Asaph had nearly been caused to stumble due to his failure to appreciate this all-important relationship, he succeeded in recovering himself. He, like the psalmist David, came to see that a fine relationship with Jehovah God meant more than anything else. How did this change in Asaph’s outlook come about? Realizing that his thinking was wrong, Asaph went to the sanctuary. There, among the congregation of Jehovah’s people, he began to discern that the seeming prosperity of the wicked is only short-lived, whereas a good relationship with God leads to permanent blessings, including material ones. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975045/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 73:15-22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975045/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 72:16</a>) Out of the abundance of an appreciative heart, Asaph then expressed himself to God in the words found at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975045/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 73:23-28</a>:</p>

<strong>Congregating All Nations at Jehovah’s House</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> “But who were all those witnesses of Jehovah at Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds the year you assembled a quarter of a million people in New York city? That was no little flock!” That’s correct, they were a great crowd, part of those Jesus called his “other sheep.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">John 10:16</a>) They hope to live here on earth in God’s new world, under the righteous rule of Christ Jesus and his heavenly congregation.

That there would be a great crowd associated with the true congregation we have further proof, in the words of John, another apostolic foundation: “I saw, and, look! <em>a great crowd,</em> which no man was able to number, out of all nations and tribes and <span id="page560" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="560" data-before-text="560"></span>peoples and tongues, . . . crying with a loud voice, saying: ‘Salvation we owe to our God, who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Rev. 7:9, 10</a>) No mention is made of attributing salvation to any mysterious third person of a supposed “trinity,” for the Christian congregation does not hold to Christendom’s mistaken belief in this regard.

Why must I congregate?” Because it is Jehovah’s will for you. If you really study your Bible closely you will soon learn this. You must be congregated to be part of God’s “household.” Christians are commanded to “consider one another to incite to love and right works, not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and all the more so as you behold the day drawing near.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Heb. 10:24, 25</a>) If it is your custom to absent yourself from meetings of the congregation, how can you encourage and incite others to love Jehovah and fulfill his will? How can others encourage and incite you? Jehovah did not inspire the Scriptures in order to isolate believers. Paul said he wrote to Timothy in order “that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in God’s household, which is the congregation of the living God, a pillar and support of the truth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">1 Tim. 3:15</a>) You serve as part of the pillar supporting God’s Word of truth in your community when you are congregated, working closely with the congregation. Moreover, a wise person must do more than <em>read</em> God’s law. Jehovah says he must also <em>listen:</em> “A wise person will listen and take in more instruction.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Prov. 1:5</a>) In order to listen he must be assembled where Jehovah’s servants are speaking. To keep away from Jehovah and the doing of his will is to show an adulterous spirit. “Look! the very ones keeping away from you will perish. You will certainly silence every one adulterously leaving you. But as for me, the drawing near to God is good for me. In the Sovereign Lord Jehovah I have placed my refuge, to declare all your works.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Ps. 73:27, 28</a>) No adulterer will inherit God’s kingdom.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Eph. 5:5</a>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu">10.

Dozens of families in the rural sections have abandoned their homes and moved to larger cities, because, where they lived, it became nearly impossible to meet together and even more difficult to witness for God’s kingdom. What practical wisdom! Evidently their viewpoint is that of the psalmist: “I rejoiced when they were saying to me: ‘To the house of Jehovah let us go.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Ps. 122:1</a>) If, as a Christian, you are determined to walk with Jesus, you must go where he is.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Rev. 2:1</a>) Wherever two or three are congregated in his name, he is among them.

Specific instructions are given on how to effectively preach and teach Jehovah’s law to men of good will. First-century Christians also gave close attention to “public reading, to exhortation, to teaching.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:13</a>) You will rejoice to find this same studious attention to Bible reading and study at each of the five weekly meetings of the Christian congregation today. The theocratic ministry school is a good example. Men and women, young and old, give practice sermons, followed by personal counsel. Isaiah’s words have come true: They will all be “taught by Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Isa. 54:13</a>) Early in the week, usually on a Tuesday night, the congregation copies the early Christian example and meets in a private home in your community; in fact, in several homes.

Jehovah will pour you out such a blessing in wisdom and understanding that you will not be able to contain it. The desire to communicate what you learn to others will well up in you. Go along with the members of that service center and learn how they say “Come” to others. Do this and you will take the first steps toward becoming a true Christian.

However, it seems likely that the name is there used as referring to the house of which he was paternal head, since some of the psalms (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000400/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps 79,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000400/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 80</a>) evidently describe events later than Asaph’s day.</p>

<strong>Tribe</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Hebrew words often rendered “tribe” (<em>mat·tehʹ</em> and <em>sheʹvet</em>) both mean “rod” or “staff.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004475/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex 7:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004475/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Pr 13:24</a>) Apparently these words came to signify “tribe” in the sense of a group of persons led by a chief or chieftains carrying a scepter or staff. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004475/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Nu 17:2-6</a>.) In most cases where the context shows that either word has the thought of “tribe,” it is used in regard to one of the tribes of Israel, such as “the tribe [<em>mat·tehʹ</em>] of Gad” or “the tribe [<em>sheʹvet</em>] of the Levites.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004475/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jos 13:24,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004475/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 33</a>) However, the ‘tribe that God redeemed as his inheritance,’ mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004475/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 74:2</a>, evidently refers to the entire nation of Israel, speaking of it as a “tribe” or people distinct from other nations and peoples. And the term “tribe” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004475/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Numbers 4:18</a> seems to be used in a more restrictive sense, as applied to the Kohathites who were a subdivision of the tribe of Levi. The Egyptian “tribes” of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004475/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 19:13</a> must apply to certain categories of people, whether according to region, caste, or something else.</p>

Loving his name means to treasure, guard, defend, fight for it. Such are honored by Jehovah. How keenly we feel the hurt to his holy name! How we despise the workers of iniquity, and those who would tear down God’s organization! So we pray: “Do thou unto them as unto Midian, as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the river Kishon; who perished at Endor, who became as dung for the earth. . . . make them like the whirling dust; as stubble before the wind.

The apostle Paul said: “This takes into account that it is righteous on God’s part to repay tribulation to those who make tribulation for you, but, to you who suffer tribulation, relief along with us at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his powerful angels in a flaming fire, as he brings due punishment upon those who do not know God and those who do not obey the good news about our Lord Jesus.

Here the term “sea monsters [Heb., <em>than·ni·nimʹ,</em> plural of <em>tan·ninʹ</em>]” is used as a parallel expression to “Leviathan,” and the crushing of the heads of Leviathan may well refer to the crushing defeat administered to Pharaoh and his army at the time of the Exodus.

<strong>Sea Monster</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">This generally translates the Hebrew word <em>tan·ninʹ</em> (<em>tan·nimʹ,</em> “sea monster” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003868/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eze 29:3</a> and “marine monster” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003868/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eze 32:2</a>).

<strong>Sealskin</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The fact that seals were evidently unclean for food would not necessarily rule out using their skins as a covering for the tabernacle. For instance, whereas the lion and the eagle were “unclean” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013779/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Lev. 11:13,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013779/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 27</a>), the heavenly cherubs seen by Ezekiel in vision were depicted with four faces, including that of a lion and of an eagle.

While seals are generally associated with Arctic and Antarctic regions, some seals favor warmer climates. Today monk seals still inhabit part of the Mediterranean Sea, as well as other warmer waters. Over the centuries man has greatly reduced the number of seals, and in Bible times these animals may have been abundant in the Mediterranean and in the Red Sea. As late as 1832 Calmet’s <em>Dictionary of the Holy Bible</em> (p. 139) observed: “On many of the small islands of the Red sea, around the peninsula of Sinai, are found seals.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The ancient Egyptians engaged in commerce on the Red Sea and, of course, received goods from many of the Mediterranean regions. So the Egyptians would have had access to sealskins. Hence, when the Israelites left Egypt, they might have taken with them the sealskins they already had, along with others obtained when the Egyptians gave into their hands an abundance of valuable things.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013779/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ex. 12:35, 36</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"></p>

Not to heathendom whose people worship millions of gods of their own making, and who, for the most part, never even heard of the great name of the true God Jehovah. The “godless” Communists who dominate a great portion of the earth’s surface bitterly hate and fight against the name of Jehovah and are against his Word of truth, the Holy Bible. The same is true of millions of Moslems throughout the earth. Well, what about Christendom with her nearly 920,000,000 members? Alas! Christendom is a dominant part of the United Nations and as such is very much a part of “the present wicked system of things” of which Satan the Devil is god. She therefore constitutes herself “an enemy of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gal. 1:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 4:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Jas. 4:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> Eph. 2:2</a>) Furthermore, like Judaism, Christendom deliberately tries to hide Jehovah’s holy name from the people by never mentioning it in her pulpits and by removing it from her popular translations of the Bible.

Simon Peter related how God “for the first time turned his attention to the [non-Jewish] nations to take out of them <em>a people for his name.</em> And with this the words of the Prophets agree, just as it is written, ‘After these things I shall return and rebuild the booth of David that is fallen down . . . in order that those who remain of the men may earnestly seek Jehovah, together with people of all the nations, <em>people who are called by my name,</em> says Jehovah.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 15:14-17</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>THE PRIVILEGES OF THE PRAISERS</strong></p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 9.
