<strong>Studying the Word of Life</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Most of the kings who ruled Jehovah’s chosen people ignored this command. They failed to study the divine Word and to follow the guidance of its wise counsel. Relying upon their own wisdom, they led the people in the very way God warned them not to go. They foolishly turned from the path of obedience to God and sank into the stinking mire of idolatry. “They kept <span id="page522" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="522" data-before-text="522"></span>walking in the statutes of the nations whom Jehovah had driven out from before the sons of Israel, and in the statutes of the kings of Israel that they had made; and the sons of Israel went searching into the things that were not right toward Jehovah their God and kept building themselves high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen clear to the fortified city; and they kept setting up for themselves sacred pillars and sacred poles upon every high hill and under every luxuriant tree; and there on all the high places they continued to make sacrificial smoke the same as the nations whom Jehovah had taken into exile because of them, and they kept doing bad things to offend Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963642/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Ki. 17:8-11</a>.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 5.

Failing to feed their minds upon the spiritually nourishing truths Jehovah provided them, they became empty-headed like the dumb idols they foolishly worshiped. They saw nothing wrong with playing a double role as priests of Jehovah and priests of the despicable idols and the abominable high places. “‘For both the prophet and the priest themselves have become polluted. Also in my own house I have found their badness,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963642/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jer. 23:11</a>) One of the few exceptions to this waywardness was in the days of Jehoshaphat.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 6.

King Jehoshaphat made certain that they did. At his orders they went throughout the land on regular teaching circuits. This upbuilding work strengthened the people and helped them to walk the way of obedience to God. “They began teaching in Judah, and with them there was the book of Jehovah’s law; and they kept going around through all the cities of Judah and teaching among the people.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963642/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Chron. 17:9</a>) If this constructive effort to instruct the people in God’s Word had continued during the reigns of succeeding kings, the history of that nation would be greatly different from what it proved to be. Rulers like Jehoshaphat were too few in the royal line of twenty-three Judean rulers.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>FINDING THE BOOK OF THE LAW</strong></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 7, 8.

(b) Why did the temple need repairing?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> The rule of Josiah was one of the most remarkable in the history of the Judean kingdom. What largely contributed to this was the written Word of God. Like Jehoshaphat, who ruled more than 250 years before him, Josiah had deep respect for that divine guide. Desiring to walk in the way of obedience to Jehovah, he instituted an intensive campaign to stamp out the abominable practice of idolatry that had eaten into the vitals of the nation during the reigns of his father and grandfather, Amon and Manasseh. Images were pulverized, the bones of Baal priests were burned on their altars and the altars pulled down. The sacred pole was pulled out of the temple and destroyed, as well as the chariots of the sun that had been used in sun worship. No longer would he permit the horses that were dedicated to the sun to enter the temple and defile it. Even the valley of Hinnom was made unusable for idolatrous practices by being made into a city dump.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963642/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Chron. 34:3-7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963642/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 23:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963642/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 10, 11</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> In the eighteenth year of his reign when he was only twenty-five years of age Josiah ordered the temple of Jehovah to be repaired. Apparently major repairs had <span id="page523" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="523" data-before-text="523"></span>not been done on the temple since the days of Jehoash, over 200 years before the days of Josiah. During the fifty-five years that Josiah’s grandfather, Manasseh, reigned and the two years that his father, Amon, ruled, the upkeep of the temple had been neglected, although it was used in the practice of idolatry for much of that period. It appears that some of the chambers or outer buildings of the temple had been ruined by idolatrous kings and needed to be rebuilt.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963642/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Chron. 34:8-11</a>.</p>

Why can the teaching of the general priesthood be called a forgotten and neglected doctrine?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>THE Christian doctrine of the “general priesthood” is probably not one of those you learned about in school or Sunday school. In fact, to a great many this will be the first time they ever heard about it. It has, for good reasons, been Christendom’s forgotten and neglected doctrine. For centuries it was hardly mentioned from the pulpits, the young people did not learn about it during their preparations for confirmation, the students of theology found only a page or two about it in their voluminous dogmatics, and the layman could find very little or nothing about it in the religious sections of bookstores and libraries. Still, the first Christians knew it and lived it.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 2. What change have the last years brought relative to the attention given to the general priesthood?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> The last years have seen a change in this respect. In theological circles worldwide, the old doctrine of the general priesthood has been taken out, dusted off and put uppermost on the agenda together with such important subjects as the nature and unity of the Christian church. “Today,” says a professor of theology, “there is hardly another subject that has been taken up with so much energy and seriousness both in the Roman Catholic Church, which is taking the lead, and the Evangelical Churches.” What, then, is the general priesthood? To put it short: It is the Biblical teaching that every spirit-begotten Christian is a priest. To understand the full scope of this doctrine, some historical background will be a help.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 3. (a) What is a priest? (b) What is the Levitical priesthood? (c) What were the two basic priestly duties of such Levites?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> A priest is a minister of God. In the nation of Israel a priesthood was provided for by law. “The priests the sons of Levi must approach, because they are the ones Jehovah your God has chosen to minister to him.” That is why that priesthood is often referred to as the Levitical priesthood. Its official services were twofold, and Moses summed them up by the words: “Let them instruct Jacob in your judicial decisions and Israel in your law. Let them render up incense before your nostrils and a whole offering on your altar.” So when the Levites were “teaching in Judah, and with them there was the book of Jehovah’s law; and they kept going around through all the cities of Judah and teaching among the people,” they were ministers of God; and when the Levite sons of Aaron offered the sacrifices of incense, grain and animals on Jehovah’s altar in behalf of the people, they were ministers of God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963163/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deut. 21:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963163/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 33:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963163/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 2 Chron. 17:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963163/1/3" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> Mal. 2:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963163/1/4" data-bid="2-5" class="b"> Leviticus chaps. 1-7 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963163/1/5" data-bid="2-6" class="b"> Le 16</a>.</p>

Why can the teaching of the general priesthood be called a forgotten and neglected doctrine?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>THE Christian doctrine of the “general priesthood” is probably not one of those you learned about in school or Sunday school. In fact, to a great many this will be the first time they ever heard about it. It has, for good reasons, been Christendom’s forgotten and neglected doctrine. For centuries it was hardly mentioned from the pulpits, the young people did not learn about it during their preparations for confirmation, the students of theology found only a page or two about it in their voluminous dogmatics, and the layman could find very little or nothing about it in the religious sections of bookstores and libraries. Still, the first Christians knew it and lived it.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 2. What change have the last years brought relative to the attention given to the general priesthood?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> The last years have seen a change in this respect. In theological circles worldwide, the old doctrine of the general priesthood has been taken out, dusted off and put uppermost on the agenda together with such important subjects as the nature and unity of the Christian church. “Today,” says a professor of theology, “there is hardly another subject that has been taken up with so much energy and seriousness both in the Roman Catholic Church, which is taking the lead, and the Evangelical Churches.” What, then, is the general priesthood? To put it short: It is the Biblical teaching that every spirit-begotten Christian is a priest. To understand the full scope of this doctrine, some historical background will be a help.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 3. (a) What is a priest? (b) What is the Levitical priesthood?

In the nation of Israel a priesthood was provided for by law. “The priests the sons of Levi must approach, because they are the ones Jehovah your God has chosen to minister to him.” That is why that priesthood is often referred to as the Levitical priesthood. Its official services were twofold, and Moses summed them up by the words: “Let them instruct Jacob in your judicial decisions and Israel in your law. Let them render up incense before your nostrils and a whole offering on your altar.” So when the Levites were “teaching in Judah, and with them there was the book of Jehovah’s law; and they kept going around through all the cities of Judah and teaching among the people,” they were ministers of God; and when the Levite sons of Aaron offered the sacrifices of incense, grain and animals on Jehovah’s altar in behalf of the people, they were ministers of God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963163/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deut. 21:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963163/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 33:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963163/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 2 Chron. 17:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963163/1/3" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> Mal. 2:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963163/1/4" data-bid="2-5" class="b"> Leviticus chaps. 1-7 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963163/1/5" data-bid="2-6" class="b"> Le 16</a>.</p>

<strong>Studying the Word of Life</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Most of the kings who ruled Jehovah’s chosen people ignored this command. They failed to study the divine Word and to follow the guidance of its wise counsel. Relying upon their own wisdom, they led the people in the very way God warned them not to go. They foolishly turned from the path of obedience to God and sank into the stinking mire of idolatry. “They kept <span id="page522" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="522" data-before-text="522"></span>walking in the statutes of the nations whom Jehovah had driven out from before the sons of Israel, and in the statutes of the kings of Israel that they had made; and the sons of Israel went searching into the things that were not right toward Jehovah their God and kept building themselves high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen clear to the fortified city; and they kept setting up for themselves sacred pillars and sacred poles upon every high hill and under every luxuriant tree; and there on all the high places they continued to make sacrificial smoke the same as the nations whom Jehovah had taken into exile because of them, and they kept doing bad things to offend Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963642/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Ki. 17:8-11</a>.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 5.

Failing to feed their minds upon the spiritually nourishing truths Jehovah provided them, they became empty-headed like the dumb idols they foolishly worshiped. They saw nothing wrong with playing a double role as priests of Jehovah and priests of the despicable idols and the abominable high places. “‘For both the prophet and the priest themselves have become polluted. Also in my own house I have found their badness,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963642/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jer. 23:11</a>) One of the few exceptions to this waywardness was in the days of Jehoshaphat.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 6.

King Jehoshaphat made certain that they did. At his orders they went throughout the land on regular teaching circuits. This upbuilding work strengthened the people and helped them to walk the way of obedience to God. “They began teaching in Judah, and with them there was the book of Jehovah’s law; and they kept going around through all the cities of Judah and teaching among the people.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963642/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Chron. 17:9</a>) If this constructive effort to instruct the people in God’s Word had continued during the reigns of succeeding kings, the history of that nation would be greatly different from what it proved to be. Rulers like Jehoshaphat were too few in the royal line of twenty-three Judean rulers.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>FINDING THE BOOK OF THE LAW</strong></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 7, 8.

What largely contributed to this was the written Word of God. Like Jehoshaphat, who ruled more than 250 years before him, Josiah had deep respect for that divine guide. Desiring to walk in the way of obedience to Jehovah, he instituted an intensive campaign to stamp out the abominable practice of idolatry that had eaten into the vitals of the nation during the reigns of his father and grandfather, Amon and Manasseh. Images were pulverized, the bones of Baal priests were burned on their altars and the altars pulled down. The sacred pole was pulled out of the temple and destroyed, as well as the chariots of the sun that had been used in sun worship. No longer would he permit the horses that were dedicated to the sun to enter the temple and defile it. Even the valley of Hinnom was made unusable for idolatrous practices by being made into a city dump.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963642/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Chron. 34:3-7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963642/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 23:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963642/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 10, 11</a>.</p>

Not at all! His creatures determine their own destiny by the course of action they take. But the Great Potter can and does, for his own wise, just and loving reasons, choose the time, manner and circumstances for rewarding the righteous and punishing the wicked.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Note how clear this point is made at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965442/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jeremiah 18:6-8</a>: “Look! As the clay in the hand of the potter, so you are in my hand, O house of Israel. At any moment that I may speak against a nation and against a kingdom to uproot it and to pull it down and to destroy it, and that nation actually turns back from its badness against which I spoke, I will also feel regret over the calamity that I had thought to execute upon it.”</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 7. How can Jehovah’s role as the Great Potter be illustrated?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> To illustrate: All of Jehovah’s creatures might be likened to clay vessels in a potter’s workshop whom Jehovah God, as the Potter, can and does mold as he pleases. But it is up to the individual piece of clay as a free moral agent and an intelligent creature to choose how he wants to react to Jehovah’s patterns and pressures, either submitting to Jehovah and righteousness, or resisting Jehovah and hardening himself in wickedness. But once the creature has manifested his attitude, Jehovah may, can and does at times mold that one further and further, either toward honorable service or toward dishonorable use, as suits Jehovah’s sovereign will and purposes.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> 8, 9. What Scriptural examples show how the Great Potter deals with vessels made fit for destruction?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Thus we read that a “bad spirit” from Jehovah came upon King Saul, but this was only after Saul’s heart had gone bad, to the point of no return then, and after Jehovah had finally rejected Saul. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965442/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Sam. 18:10</a>) Likewise we read of a “deceptive spirit” as being sent from Jehovah upon the four hundred prophets of Israel who were false to begin with, so that their deceptive prophesying prevailed upon King Ahab and he went to his death. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965442/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Chron. 18:5-27</a>) Similarly Jesus told Judas: “What you are doing get done more quickly.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965442/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 13:27</a>) Jesus was not putting the idea of betraying him into the mind of Judas, but Judas had gone to the point of no return. Had not Jesus exposed Judas as the one that would betray his Master, and had not Judas failed to deny it or to protest his innocence? Judas did not repent or change his course of action, and so we read that then Satan the Devil entered him, and it was only after this that Jesus said to him: “What you are doing get done more quickly.” And so also with ancient Pharaoh of Egypt in Moses’ day. Jehovah God did not coerce him or arbitrarily harden Pharaoh’s heart or cause him to act against his better judgment, but God simply chose a method of dealing with Pharaoh that allowed him to seek his own further advantage and so harden his heart ever more.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Well did the apostle Paul refer to Jehovah’s molding the wicked proud Pharaoh of old, for, without a doubt, that is the most striking instance recorded in the Scriptures in which Jehovah God asserted his authority and power in dealing with his earthly creatures as a potter handles clay. The Great Potter had commanded his people, the Israelites, to go into the wilderness for three days with all their little ones and their flocks to worship him, and Pharaoh had refused to let God’s people go. Haughty Pharaoh taunted and sneered: “Who is Jehovah, so that I should obey <span id="page363" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="363" data-before-text="363"></span>his voice to send Israel away? I do not know Jehovah at all and, what is more, I am not going to send Israel away.” The means that Jehovah God used to make Pharaoh know who Jehovah really is and to make him let God’s people go were ten plagues, which plagues are full of prophetic significance for our time.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965442/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ex. 5:2</a>.</p>

So he offered to exercise his power upon Ahab’s prophets to speak, just to speak, letting them speak out of their own hearts what they wanted to speak to please the one supporting them, their king. Thus the spirit creature or angel was responsible, not for their lies, but merely for their speaking.</p><p id="p86" data-pid="86" class="qu">33.

He knew that Ahab desired to be fooled by the lie, especially when the liars were so many. Hence Jehovah told the spirit creature that the operation of his power upon Ahab’s prophets would open the way for them to utter the death-dealing lie, and it would win out over the faithful warning of Jehovah’s prophet Micaiah. It did and Ahab shed his blood like an executed criminal for canines to lick, and Jehovah the God of truth stood exonerated of lies.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956084/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">1 Ki. 22:29-38;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956084/40/1" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 18:1-34</a>.</p><p id="p87" data-pid="87" class="qu">34.

Not at all! His creatures determine their own destiny by the course of action they take.

At any moment that I may speak against a nation and against a kingdom to uproot it and to pull it down and to destroy it, and that nation actually turns back from its badness against which I spoke, I will also feel regret over the calamity that I had thought to execute upon it.”</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 7. How can Jehovah’s role as the Great Potter be illustrated?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> To illustrate: All of Jehovah’s creatures might be likened to clay vessels in a potter’s workshop whom Jehovah God, as the Potter, can and does mold as he pleases. But it is up to the individual piece of clay as a free moral agent and an intelligent creature to choose how he wants to react to Jehovah’s patterns and pressures, either submitting to Jehovah and righteousness, or resisting Jehovah and hardening himself in wickedness. But once the creature has manifested his attitude, Jehovah may, can and does at times mold that one further and further, either toward honorable service or toward dishonorable use, as suits Jehovah’s sovereign will and purposes.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> 8, 9. What Scriptural examples show how the Great Potter deals with vessels made fit for destruction?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Thus we read that a “bad spirit” from Jehovah came upon King Saul, but this was only after Saul’s heart had gone bad, to the point of no return then, and after Jehovah had finally rejected Saul. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965442/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Sam. 18:10</a>) Likewise we read of a “deceptive spirit” as being sent from Jehovah upon the four hundred prophets of Israel who were false to begin with, so that their deceptive prophesying prevailed upon King Ahab and he went to his death. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965442/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Chron. 18:5-27</a>) Similarly Jesus told Judas: “What you are doing get done more quickly.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965442/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 13:27</a>) Jesus was not putting the idea of betraying him into the mind of Judas, but Judas had gone to the point of no return. Had not Jesus exposed Judas as the one that would betray his Master, and had not Judas failed to deny it or to protest his innocence? Judas did not repent or change his course of action, and so we read that then Satan the Devil entered him, and it was only after this that Jesus said to him: “What you are doing get done more quickly.” And so also with ancient Pharaoh of Egypt in Moses’ day. Jehovah God did not coerce him or arbitrarily harden Pharaoh’s heart or cause him to act against his better judgment, but God simply chose a method of dealing with Pharaoh that allowed him to seek his own further advantage and so harden his heart ever more.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Well did the apostle Paul refer to Jehovah’s molding the wicked proud Pharaoh of old, for, without a doubt, that is the most striking instance recorded in the Scriptures in which Jehovah God asserted his authority and power in dealing with his earthly creatures as a potter handles clay. The Great Potter had commanded his people, the Israelites, to go into the wilderness for three days with all their little ones and their flocks to worship him, and Pharaoh had refused to let God’s people go. Haughty Pharaoh taunted and sneered: “Who is Jehovah, so that I should obey <span id="page363" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="363" data-before-text="363"></span>his voice to send Israel away? I do not know Jehovah at all and, what is more, I am not going to send Israel away.” The means that Jehovah God used to make Pharaoh know who Jehovah really is and to make him let God’s people go were ten plagues, which plagues are full of prophetic significance for our time.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965442/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ex. 5:2</a>.</p>

Only lovers of Jehovah can do this. Let us learn a lesson from the mistake made by King Jehoshaphat of Judah. This king, upon whom Jehovah had bestowed his friendship, made the mistake of associating with one who was no friend of God, King Ahab of Israel. This wicked king asked Jehoshaphat to join him in an expedition for the recovery of Ramoth-gilead. Jehoshaphat agreed. Though the prophets of Baal predicted success for the expedition, Micaiah, the only prophet of Jehovah obtainable, <span id="page106" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="106" data-before-text="106"></span>foretold the death of Ahab. Going into battle, Ahab disguised himself; but he had proposed that the king of Judah should put on his royal robes, thus becoming a mark for every missile. In the thick of the battle royally attired Jehoshaphat found every warrior of Syria turned against him, thinking him to be the king of Israel. “Jehoshaphat began to cry for aid, and Jehovah himself helped him, and God at once allured them away from him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Chron. 18:31</a>) True to the words of Jehovah’s prophet, Ahab met his doom, a certain man bending his bow in his innocence and shooting an arrow into the king of Israel, so that he died. When the king of Judah returned to Jerusalem, Jehu the son of Hanani the visionary said to King Jehoshaphat: “Is it to the wicked that help is to be given, and is it for those hating Jehovah that you should have love? And for this there is indignation against you from the person of Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Chron. 19:2</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 8, 9.

In selecting friends, the Christian does well to keep those words of the prophet in mind: “Is it for those hating Jehovah that you should have love?” How the servant of God must guard against improper friendships! Whether we will receive God’s favor or his indignation against us depends to a large extent on the kind of friendships we form. It should not surprise us that the Most High God views any of his servants as guilty who associate with persons of whom he does not approve.

To have accepted the Devil’s offer would have made Jesus God’s enemy. It is asking for Jehovah’s enmity if we cultivate friendship with the world. The divine rule is inflexible: “Do you not know that the friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever, therefore, wants to be a friend of the world is constituting himself an enemy of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Jas. 4:4</a>) This wicked world is doomed to destruction at God’s war of Armageddon, and the friends of this world will pass away with it.

<strong>Hate Evil, Not People</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">In the above cases the sins do not really express the desire or inward yearnings of the person, but there are others that have become so degraded that they relish their sins and pursue them with deliberateness and in full knowledge of their evilness. They have so merged their personalities with these evils that a separation of the person from the sins is difficult or impossible. They go to an extreme that leaves them in an unforgivable position before Jehovah: “Every kind of sin and blasphemy <span id="page427" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="427" data-before-text="427"></span>will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven.” Deliberate and continued sin against the enlightening spirit of Jehovah is not forgivable; defiance of the spirit’s manifest operation is not pardonable. When persons persist in wrongdoing after it has been completely exposed to them, when it becomes so ingrained as to be an inseparable part of their make-up, then hatred for the person that lovingly clings to it as well as the sin must be one’s feeling. How else can it be, when the person and the sin become inseparably and permanently merged?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958525/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 12:31</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Such incorrigible ones reverse the injunction, “Hate the evil, and love the good,” becoming those “who hate the good, and love the evil.” No intercession is to be made for them. “Pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me; for I will not hear thee,” says Jehovah. God himself will be “repaying to his face the one who hates him by obliterating him. He will not hesitate toward the one who hates him. He will repay him to his face.” Some reach a point when even strong discipline will not pry loose the evil that has become a part of them.

The first part, about loving your neighbor, was a part of the Law. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953567/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Lev. 19:18</a>) But the second part, about hating your enemy, was not. It really was contrary to the Law, which said: “If you chance upon your enemy’s ox or ass going astray, you must be sure to take it home to him. If you see the ass of one who hates you lying prostrate under its load, you must refrain from deserting him; you must be sure to help him get it up.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953567/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ex. 23:4, 5</a>, <em>AT</em>) The Hebrew Scriptures forbade any feeling of malicious joy when an enemy met with disaster, and even commanded that he be assisted when in trouble: “If your enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat, and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953567/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 31:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953567/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Prov. 24:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953567/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 25:21</a>, <em>AT</em>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The part about hating your enemy was something added by the teachers of tradition, and it was this addition that made void God’s Word that Jesus condemned. Since they were told to love their neighbors, the Jewish teachers inferred that in contrast they were to hate their enemies. To them “friend” or “neighbor” meant one of the Jewish race, and all others they considered natural enemies. To rout this false idea from one of the learned scribes or lawyers of his day Jesus used an illustration. He told of a man that had been robbed, stripped, beaten and left half-dead. Both a Jewish priest and a Levite by-passed this sufferer, but a despised Samaritan came along, felt pity, tended to his wounds, and took him to an inn and paid for his further care. This non-Jewish Samaritan was then identified as the real neighbor of the injured man, and not the Jewish priest and Levite. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953567/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Luke 10:25-37</a>, <em>NW</em>) But in view of the traditional understanding of “neighbor” as being limited to a fellow Jew and in view of their known hatred and enmity relative to Gentiles, it is not difficult to see why they were led to add “and hate your enemy” to the divine law “You must love your neighbor”.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">So Jesus corrected them and showed that they were to love not only their neighbors but also their enemies. The word “love” (Greek, <em>agape</em>) here used means a moral or social love, a love based on the deliberate assent of the will as a matter of principle, duty and propriety. It is a matter of doing what is right, as reasoned from the head, rather than the love (Greek, <em>philéo</em>) that means a sentimental, personal attachment and affection, as is usually thought of as coming from the heart. As a matter of following right principles we will show this moral love to all men, even to those who may persecute us personally. We will allow no personal enmities to make us abandon love or conduct based on right principles, but will follow such with all men. We will even pray that those who persecute us in ignorance may have their eyes opened to see the truth concerning Jehovah’s new world.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">But we will not pray for those Jehovah has condemned, those he has passed final judgment against.

When good King Jehoshaphat came home safely, Jehovah sent the prophet Jehu to rebuke him for having allied himself with Ahab. Jehovah’s prophet said: “Is it <strong><em>the wicked</em></strong> you should be helping, and is it <strong><em>those who hate Jehovah</em></strong> you should love?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021600/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Chron. 19:1, 2</a>) Now consider: If Ahab’s repentance had been genuine, surely the prophet would not have described him as a wicked man who hated Jehovah. Clearly, although Ahab had shown a degree of regret, he never fully repented.</p>

<strong>Make Friends for Yourselves</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> The right kind of friend, then, should be one that encourages the Christian in being loyal to the Most High God. Only lovers of Jehovah can do this. Let us learn a lesson from the mistake made by King Jehoshaphat of Judah. This king, upon whom Jehovah had bestowed his friendship, made the mistake of associating with one who was no friend of God, King Ahab of Israel. This wicked king asked Jehoshaphat to join him in an expedition for the recovery of Ramoth-gilead. Jehoshaphat agreed. Though the prophets of Baal predicted success for the expedition, Micaiah, the only prophet of Jehovah obtainable, <span id="page106" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="106" data-before-text="106"></span>foretold the death of Ahab. Going into battle, Ahab disguised himself; but he had proposed that the king of Judah should put on his royal robes, thus becoming a mark for every missile. In the thick of the battle royally attired Jehoshaphat found every warrior of Syria turned against him, thinking him to be the king of Israel. “Jehoshaphat began to cry for aid, and Jehovah himself helped him, and God at once allured them away from him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Chron. 18:31</a>) True to the words of Jehovah’s prophet, Ahab met his doom, a certain man bending his bow in his innocence and shooting an arrow into the king of Israel, so that he died. When the king of Judah returned to Jerusalem, Jehu the son of Hanani the visionary said to King Jehoshaphat: “Is it to the wicked that help is to be given, and is it for those hating Jehovah that you should have love? And for this there is indignation against you from the person of Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Chron. 19:2</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 8, 9. How can the Christian benefit from Jehoshaphat’s mistake, and why should God’s disfavor toward a person arise out of wrong friendships?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Jehoshaphat made a bad mistake, cultivating a friendship with and giving aid to one who hated Jehovah God. In selecting friends, the Christian does well to keep those words of the prophet in mind: “Is it for those hating Jehovah that you should have love?” How the servant of God must guard against improper friendships! Whether we will receive God’s favor or his indignation against us depends to a large extent on the kind of friendships we form. It should not surprise us that the Most High God views any of his servants as guilty who associate with persons of whom he does not approve. We cannot associate with those whom God does not approve and gain his friendship.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> The corrupting influence of bad friends is something that removes one from the realm of dependability, for it is something that will inevitably produce adverse results: “He that is walking with wise persons will become wise, but he that is having dealings with the stupid ones will fare badly.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Prov. 13:20</a>) Had it not been for God’s intervention, Jehoshaphat’s dealings with stupid Ahab probably would have cost him his life.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu">10.

I have hated the congregation of evildoers, and with the wicked ones I do not sit. I shall wash my hands in innocency itself, and I will march around your altar, O Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 26:4-6</a>) David speaks as if he were on the witness stand, giving testimony as to his private life to show his innocence in regard to friendships. He declares his innocency as to associating with those who have no love for God and his righteous commandments. May every true worshiper of Almighty God Jehovah be able to affirm similar innocency as to his friendships!</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>SELECTING THE RIGHT SLAVE-MASTER AS FRIEND</strong></p>

<strong>Hate Evil, Not People</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">In the above cases the sins do not really express the desire or inward yearnings of the person, but there are others that have become so degraded that they relish their sins and pursue them with deliberateness and in full knowledge of their evilness. They have so merged their personalities with these evils that a separation of the person from the sins is difficult or impossible. They go to an extreme that leaves them in an unforgivable position before Jehovah: “Every kind of sin and blasphemy <span id="page427" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="427" data-before-text="427"></span>will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven.” Deliberate and continued sin against the enlightening spirit of Jehovah is not forgivable; defiance of the spirit’s manifest operation is not pardonable. When persons persist in wrongdoing after it has been completely exposed to them, when it becomes so ingrained as to be an inseparable part of their make-up, then hatred for the person that lovingly clings to it as well as the sin must be one’s feeling. How else can it be, when the person and the sin become inseparably and permanently merged?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958525/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 12:31</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Such incorrigible ones reverse the injunction, “Hate the evil, and love the good,” becoming those “who hate the good, and love the evil.” No intercession is to be made for them. “Pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me; for I will not hear thee,” says Jehovah. God himself will be “repaying to his face the one who hates him by obliterating him. He will not hesitate toward the one who hates him. He will repay him to his face.” Some reach a point when even strong discipline will not pry loose the evil that has become a part of them. It is no longer possible to destroy the evil and preserve the persons. Both must be destroyed together, since there is no separating them. The evil works truly express and reflect an incorrigibly evil heart. Such persons personify evil, just as God does love.

If you see the ass of one who hates you lying prostrate under its load, you must refrain from deserting him; you must be sure to help him get it up.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953567/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ex. 23:4, 5</a>, <em>AT</em>) The Hebrew Scriptures forbade any feeling of malicious joy when an enemy met with disaster, and even commanded that he be assisted when in trouble: “If your enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat, and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953567/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 31:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953567/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Prov. 24:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953567/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 25:21</a>, <em>AT</em>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The part about hating your enemy was something added by the teachers of tradition, and it was this addition that made void God’s Word that Jesus condemned. Since they were told to love their neighbors, the Jewish teachers inferred that in contrast they were to hate their enemies. To them “friend” or “neighbor” meant one of the Jewish race, and all others they considered natural enemies. To rout this false idea from one of the learned scribes or lawyers of his day Jesus used an illustration. He told of a man that had been robbed, stripped, beaten and left half-dead. Both a Jewish priest and a Levite by-passed this sufferer, but a despised Samaritan came along, felt pity, tended to his wounds, and took him to an inn and paid for his further care. This non-Jewish Samaritan was then identified as the real neighbor of the injured man, and not the Jewish priest and Levite. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953567/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Luke 10:25-37</a>, <em>NW</em>) But in view of the traditional understanding of “neighbor” as being limited to a fellow Jew and in view of their known hatred and enmity relative to Gentiles, it is not difficult to see why they were led to add “and hate your enemy” to the divine law “You must love your neighbor”.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">So Jesus corrected them and showed that they were to love not only their neighbors but also their enemies. The word “love” (Greek, <em>agape</em>) here used means a moral or social love, a love based on the deliberate assent of the will as a matter of principle, duty and propriety. It is a matter of doing what is right, as reasoned from the head, rather than the love (Greek, <em>philéo</em>) that means a sentimental, personal attachment and affection, as is usually thought of as coming from the heart. As a matter of following right principles we will show this moral love to all men, even to those who may persecute us personally. We will allow no personal enmities to make us abandon love or conduct based on right principles, but will follow such with all men. We will even pray that those who persecute us in ignorance may have their eyes opened to see the truth concerning Jehovah’s new world.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">But we will not pray for those Jehovah has condemned, those he has passed final judgment against. To do so would be a violation of Jehovah’s commands.

And am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?

For instance, if you should be disposed to criticize an appointed elder in the Christian congregation, would it not be profitable to consider his many good points​—his love for Jehovah and the congregation, his hard work in preparing meetings and his willingness to help? This will help to remove negative thoughts from your mind. And whenever you are confronted with seemingly negative situations, why not consider the good that will come from your reacting correctly in such situations? We have the sterling example of Jesus, who suffered at the hands of his enemies but “learned obedience from the things he suffered.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980405/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Heb. 5:8</a>.</p>

<strong>Beer-sheba</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Beer-sheba came to stand for the southernmost point in describing the length of the Promised Land, as expressed in the proverbial phrase “from Dan down to Beer-sheba” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000615/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jg 20:1</a>), or, in a converse direction, “from Beer-sheba to Dan.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000615/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Ch 21:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000615/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2Ch 30:5</a>) After the division of the nation into two kingdoms, Beer-sheba continued to be used to indicate the southern extremity of the kingdom of Judah in the expressions “from Geba as far as Beer-sheba” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000615/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2Ki 23:8</a>) and “from Beer-sheba to the mountainous region of Ephraim” (where the northern kingdom of Israel began). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000615/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2Ch 19:4</a>) In postexilic times the expression was used in a yet more limited form to refer to the area occupied by the repatriated men of Judah, extending from Beer-sheba “clear to the valley of Hinnom.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000615/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ne 11:27,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000615/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 30</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In reality, there were other towns of the Promised Land that lay to the S of Beer-sheba, even as there were Israelite towns N of Dan. However, both Dan and Beer-sheba were situated at natural frontiers of the land. In the case of Beer-sheba, its position was below the mountains of Judah on the edge of the desert. Additionally, it was one of the principal cities of Judah (along with Jerusalem and Hebron), and this was not only because it had an excellent supply of water as compared with the surrounding region, thus allowing for both farming and grazing of herds and flocks, but also because important roads converged on it from several directions. From Egypt an ancient route led up by the “Way of the Wells” through Kadesh-barnea to Beer-sheba, being joined by another road over which traveled the camel caravans from the “Spice Kingdoms” of the Arabian Peninsula, heading for Philistia or Judah. From Ezion-geber, at the head of the Gulf of ʽAqaba, another route led up through the Arabah and then turned W, climbing the Ascent of Akrabbim to Beer-sheba. At Gaza, in the Philistine Plain, a road branching from the highway led SE to Beer-sheba.

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">What is bribery, and what does the Bible say about it? <em>The World Book Encyclopedia</em> explains: “Bribery means giving or offering something of value to a person in a position of trust, who in return violates his or her duty or the law in order to benefit the giver.” Thus it is bribery to give money (or a gift) to a judge to influence his decision and pervert justice. It is also bribery to offer money so as to circumvent the law, such as asking a building or automobile inspector to ignore a violation.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">God condemns bribery, telling Israelite judges: “You must not pervert judgment. You must not be partial or accept a bribe, for the bribe blinds the eyes of wise ones and distorts the words of righteous ones.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986730/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986730/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986730/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Isaiah 1:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986730/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 5:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986730/1/3" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 1 Samuel 8:3-5</a>.)

<strong>Amalek, Amalekites</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Moses, therefore, in relating events of Abraham’s day before Amalek was born, spoke of “the whole field of the Amalekites,” evidently doing so proleptically, that is, he was describing the <em>region</em> as understood by people of Moses’ time, rather than implying that Amalekites predated Amalek. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010220/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 14:7</a>) The center of this Amalekite territory was <span id="page62" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="62" data-before-text="62"></span>north of Kadesh-barnea in the Negeb desert in the southern part of Palestine, with their tributary camps radiating out into the Sinai Peninsula and northern Arabia.

However, “Haman the son of . . . the Agagite” was probably a descendant, for “Agag” was the title or name of certain Amalekite kings.
