<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/961/0"><em>The Watchtower,</em></a> ]</strong></p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/961/0">5/15/1991, pp. 21-22</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Jehovah Hears Our Urgent Cries for Help</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>Plea for Prompt Deliverance</strong></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">David begins with the plea: <strong>“O God, to deliver me, O Jehovah, to my assistance do make haste.” (</strong><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991365/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 70:1</strong></a><strong>)</strong> When in distress, we can pray that God quickly come to our assistance. Jehovah does not try us with evil things, and he “knows how to deliver people of godly devotion out of trial.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991365/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Peter 2:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991365/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> James 1:13</a>) But what if he permits a trial to continue, perhaps to teach us something? Then we can ask him for wisdom to deal with it. If we ask in faith, he grants us wisdom. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991365/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">James 1:5-8</a>) God also gives us the strength needed to endure our trials. <span id="page22" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>For instance, he ‘sustains us upon a divan of illness.’​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991365/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 41:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991365/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Hebrews 10:36</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Our inherent sinfulness, as well as constant exposure to temptation and the Devil’s efforts to destroy our relationship with Jehovah, should move us to pray for God’s help each day. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991365/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 51:1-5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991365/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Romans 5:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991365/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 12:12</a>) Noteworthy are these words of Jesus’ model prayer: “Do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the wicked one.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991365/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 6:13</a>) Yes, we can ask God that he not allow us to succumb when tempted to disobey him and that he prevent Satan, “the wicked one,” from overreaching us. But let us couple our cries for deliverance with steps to avoid situations that would needlessly expose us to temptation and Satan’s snares.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991365/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 2:11</a>.</p>

<strong>How Shall We Escape?</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 70</a> vividly conveys a sense of urgency. It was when David felt in desperate need that he pleaded: “O God, to deliver me, O Jehovah, to my assistance do make haste. . . . I am afflicted and poor. O God, do act quickly for me. You are my help and the Provider of escape for me. O Jehovah, do not be too late.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 70:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 5</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 7. With what attitude can we fittingly pray to Jehovah when in urgent need of help?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Have you ever felt that way? It is both comforting and faith-strengthening to know that we, as servants of Jehovah, can have confidence that he will “act quickly” for us. He knows our needs and how to supply them. Our loving heavenly Father is indeed “the Provider of escape” just when we need it. Sometimes, like David, we realize that our own shortcomings have brought us into a bad situation. But, like David, we can approach Jehovah in sincerity, perhaps with “a broken spirit,” confident that He will hear and answer our prayer. We can plead, even as David did: “Create in me even a pure heart, O God, and put within me a new spirit, a steadfast one.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 51:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 17</a>.</p>

Instead of trying to retaliate, however, he exercised faith that God would put them to shame. David prayed that his foes might be “ashamed and abashed”​—embarrassed, baffled, disconcerted, frustrated in trying to carry out their wicked schemes. Yes, let those seeking his injury and finding delight in his calamity become confused and experience dishonor.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">If we had what might be called malicious joy when calamity befell a foe, we would have to render an account to Jehovah for our sin.

Instead of allowing himself to be so swallowed up by distress that he failed to magnify God, David said: <strong>“May those exult and rejoice in you, all of whom are seeking you, and may they say constantly: ‘God be magnified!’​—those loving your salvation.” (</strong><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991365/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 70:4</strong></a><strong>)</strong> Jehovah’s people continue to be very joyful because they “exult and rejoice” in him. As his dedicated, baptized Witnesses, they have the great joy resulting from an intimate relationship with him.

O God, do act quickly for me. You are my help and the Provider of escape for me. O Jehovah, do not be too late.” (</strong><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991365/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 70:5</strong></a><strong>)</strong> Afflicted with the trials that beset believers​—such tribulations as persecution, temptations, and assaults by Satan—​we may seem “poor.” Though we may not be destitute, we seem defenseless against unscrupulous enemies. However, we can be confident that Jehovah can and will rescue us as his faithful servants.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991365/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Psalm 9:17-20</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Jehovah is “the Provider of escape” when we need it. Our own shortcomings may have brought us into a trialsome situation. But if ‘our foolishness has distorted our way,’ let our heart not ‘become enraged against Jehovah.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991365/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Proverbs 19:3</a>) He is not to blame, and he is ready to help us if we pray to him in faith. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991365/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 37:5</a>) What if we are struggling to avoid sin? Then let us be specific about this in prayer, asking for divine help to continue pursuing a righteous course.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991365/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Mark 14:38</a>) So we may plead: “O Jehovah, do not be too late.” Especially if we are concerned about reproach upon God’s name, we may be moved to pray as did the prophet Daniel: “O Jehovah, do hear. O Jehovah, do forgive. O Jehovah, do pay attention and act. Do not delay, for your own sake, O my God, for your own name has been called . . . upon your people.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991365/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Daniel 9:19</a>) We can have faith that our heavenly Father will not be too late, for the apostle Paul gave this assurance: “Let us . . . approach with freeness of speech to the throne of undeserved kindness, that we may obtain mercy and find undeserved kindness for help at the right time.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991365/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:16</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Never forget that Jehovah is the Provider of escape.

At times we may need to pray repeatedly about a matter of deep concern. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991365/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>) There may seem to be no solution to a particular problem, no way out of our dilemma. But our loving heavenly Father will strengthen us and will not permit us to be tested beyond what we can bear. Therefore, never tire of going before the throne of the King Eternal in heartfelt prayer. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991365/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991365/36/1" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> Philippians 4:6, 7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991365/36/2" data-bid="37-3" class="b"> 13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991365/36/3" data-bid="37-4" class="b"> Revelation 15:3</a>) Pray in faith, and trust him implicitly, for Jehovah hears our urgent cries for help.</p>

It was when David felt in desperate need that he pleaded: “O God, to deliver me, O Jehovah, to my assistance do make haste. . . . I am afflicted and poor. O God, do act quickly for me. You are my help and the Provider of escape for me.

It is both comforting and faith-strengthening to know that we, as servants of Jehovah, can have confidence that he will “act quickly” for us. He knows our needs and how to supply them. Our loving heavenly Father is indeed “the Provider of escape” just when we need it. Sometimes, like David, we realize that our own shortcomings have brought us into a bad situation. But, like David, we can approach Jehovah in sincerity, perhaps with “a broken spirit,” confident that He will hear and answer our prayer. We can plead, even as David did: “Create in me even a pure heart, O God, and put within me a new spirit, a steadfast one.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 51:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 17</a>.</p>

<strong>Fortifications</strong><br/><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="ss"><span id="page605" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="605" data-before-text="605"></span><strong>ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCOVERIES OF NOTABLE FORTIFICATIONS</strong></p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">Following up the building operations of his father David, King Solomon was outstanding for his construction works. Besides building the magnificent temple of Jehovah at Jerusalem, he strengthened Jerusalem’s walls and built extensive fortifications at Hazor, Megiddo and Gezer. Archaeologists were guided in their excavation of these fortifications by the Bible’s statement at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Kings 9:15</a>: “Now this is the account of those conscripted for forced labor that King Solomon levied to build the house of Jehovah and his own house and the Mound and the wall of Jerusalem and Hazor and Megiddo and Gezer.” They found that the gates of these three last-named cities were all built to a single unique plan, each being fifty-six feet (17 meters) wide, with an entrance flanked on both sides by square towers and leading into a vestibule sixty-six feet (20 meters) long, with three chambers on each side. They were somewhat similar to the description of the gates of Ezekiel’s visionary temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ezek. 40:5-16</a>) Solomon’s son Rehoboam is also credited with much building. This included, besides reinforcing the fortified places, the storage of food supplies in them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">2 Chron. 11:5-10</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">Immediately above casemate walls built by Solomon at Megiddo and Hazor massive walls had been constructed, possibly built by Ahab. These were more thickly and strongly built, doubtless because of the heavy Assyrian battering rams in use during that later period. Other kings of Israel and Judah noted for their construction works are Jeroboam, who rebuilt Shechem and Penuel; Baasha, who began to build Ramah “to allow no one to go out or come in to Asa the king of Judah” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Ki. 15:17</a>); Asa, who used stones and timbers from Ramah in building operations in Geba and Mizpah; Omri the builder of Samaria, the capital of the northern kingdom; Uzziah (Azariah) the rebuilder of Elath (Eloth) and builder of towers in the wilderness; and Jotham, who built fortified places and towers.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Ki. 12:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 15:22, 23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/23/2" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> 16:23, 24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/23/3" data-bid="24-4" class="b"> 2 Ki. 14:21, 22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/23/4" data-bid="24-5" class="b"> 2 Chron. 26:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/23/5" data-bid="24-6" class="b"> 9, 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/23/6" data-bid="24-7" class="b"> 27:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/23/7" data-bid="24-8" class="b"> 4</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">Of Uzziah it is said: “He made in Jerusalem engines of war, the invention of engineers, that they might come to be upon the towers and upon the corners, to shoot arrows and great stones.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:15</a>) Just what these engines of war were is not understood. Archaeologists have discovered sculptured reliefs of Sennacherib’s assault on the city of Lachish depicting a defensive innovation that some would attribute to Uzziah. These reliefs show that upon the towers and on the corners of the walls of Lachish wooden structures holding round shields were built above the crenelated parapets. This was a great advantage for the defenders of a city in that they now could stand to full height, with both hands free to shoot arrows and to sling and throw stones at the besiegers, their bodies being much better protected than previously, when they had to expose themselves to shoot, and then dodge behind the merlons of the crenelated walls.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="ss"><strong>ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCOVERIES OF AQUEDUCTS</strong></p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb">The builders of the Megiddo fortifications used simple, yet ingenious way to get water into the city. The source of water for the city was a well in a natural cave at the western foot of the mound on which Megiddo was built. To get water into the city they sent a vertical shaft ninety-eight feet (30 meters) deep, seventy-two feet (22 meters) of this distance through solid rock, which brought them to the level of the well. From this level they cut a horizontal tunnel with a slight gradient for a distance of 220 feet (67 meters) to the well. The slight slope from the well to the bottom of the shaft allowed the water to flow into the city by gravity. The well was sealed from the outside by a thick wall.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">An amazing construction requiring superb engineering skill was accomplished by Hezekiah when he sealed up the course of the water flowing from Gihon and cut a channel or conduit about 1,750 feet (1,200 cubits or 533 meters) to bring water into Jerusalem, thereby enabling it to withstand a long siege.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:30</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb">Often cisterns, both public and individual, were built inside the city so as to have a water supply during times of siege. On the monument (now located in the Louvre of Paris) erected at Dibon, in Moab, by Mesha the king of Moab, we find the inscription “I also built its gates and I built its towers and I built the king’s house, and I made both of its reservoirs for water inside the town. And there was no cistern inside the town even at the acropolis, so I said to all the people, ‘Let each of you make a cistern for himself in his house.’”</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="ss"><strong>SYMBOLIC USES</strong></p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="sb">Since the tower or citadel of the fortified city was its last stronghold and the towers in the wilderness were the safest places of refuge for miles around, we can see the appropriateness of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Proverbs 18:10</a>: “The name of Jehovah is a strong tower. Into it the righteous runs and is given protection.” Also significant are the expressions of David: “Jehovah is my crag and my stronghold and the Provider of escape for me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">2 Sam. 22:2</a>) “Become to me a rock fortress into which to enter constantly. You must command to save me, for you are my crag and my stronghold.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ps. 71:3</a>) This would be especially meaningful to Jews who would look up at the great stronghold of Jerusalem situated on an elevation higher than nearly any other major capital city in human history, with its mighty walls of defense. It also gives meaning to God’s words through the prophet Zechariah, when Jehovah speaks of himself as “a wall of fire all around” Jerusalem. It gives his people encouraging assurance that, while walls of stone can be broken down, Jehovah himself is really the defense of his servants.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ps. 48:11-13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011514/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Zech. 2:4, 5</a>; see GATE, GATEWAY.</p>

Will the person of today who has been provided with escape “from the hand of the wicked one” and who has made the Sovereign Lord Jehovah his hope do otherwise than did the psalmist, namely, “come in grand mightiness” and “mention [God’s] righteousness”? Certainly he will not be ashamed of the Sovereign of his life. Jesus Christ, our greatest Exemplar, was not ashamed of his Sovereign, Jehovah God. Hence, he became a witness of Jehovah, and for this reason he is called “Jesus Christ, ‘the Faithful Witness.’” He speaks of himself as “the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation by God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975805/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Rev. 1:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975805/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 3:14</a>) Those who truly become his footstep followers must likewise become witnesses of his Father Jehovah. No honor could be greater for anyone on earth than being a witness of Jehovah.</p>

Why, at times you may find yourself at odds, not simply with your peers, but with the whole world. The psalmist David prayed: “You are my hope, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah, my confidence from my youth. O God, you have taught me from my youth on, and until now I keep telling about your wonderful works.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999643/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Psalm 71:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999643/40/1" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> 17</a>)<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1999643/2">c</a> David is known for his courage. But when did he develop it? As a youth! Even before his famed confrontation with Goliath, David had shown extraordinary courage in protecting his father’s flocks​—killing both a lion and a bear.

You too will find that if you lean upon Jehovah, he will give you the courage and strength to ‘conquer the world.’​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999643/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">1 John 5:4</a>.</p>

<strong>Will Being God’s Friend Help Me?</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Having Jehovah as a friend, however, involves more than just learning his standards. You can experience his personal interest in your life. The Bible tells of King David, who was taught by God from his youth. David became a friend of God, and though he experienced “many distresses,” he actually saw God at work in his life. David spoke about God’s “wonderful works” in his behalf and about Jehovah’s “arm,” or strength, exerted in his life. On the basis of such personal experiences, David wrote: “You are my hope, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah, <em>my confidence</em> from my youth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101995845/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 71:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101995845/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 17, 18,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101995845/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 20</a>) You can have this same confidence as you sense Jehovah’s blessing in your life.

<strong>The 1,290 and 1,335 Days of Daniel’s Prophecy</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[26]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> This means that since 1918, which had ended the 1,260-day period, two great wonders had happened. First, the Devil had set up his makeshift kingdom which was to take the place of God’s kingdom by Christ and was striving to make all people worship it. Secondly, he was successful for a time in causing God’s holy ones to cease offering the continual sacrifice of praise <span id="page433" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="433" data-before-text="433"></span>to Jehovah God. These events so clearly fulfill the angel’s prophecy to Daniel of the 1,290 days: “Many shall purify themselves, and make themselves white, and be refined; but the wicked shall do wickedly; and none of the wicked shall understand; but they that are wise shall understand. And from the time that the continual burnt-offering shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Dan. 12:10, 11</a>, <em>AS</em>) “From the time of the taking away of the continual ascending-sacrifice, and the placing of the horrid abomination that astoundeth shall be one thousand two hundred and ninety days.” (<em>Ro</em>) “And from the time of the removal of the perpetual sacrifice, when the abomination of desolation shall be set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.” (<em>LXX</em>) “Twelve hundred and ninety days shall pass, after the daily offering has been stopped and the appalling abomination has been set up.” (<em>Mo</em>) This sacrifice need not be a literal everyday offering, but rather continual. The Hebrew word “taw-meed” is the same thought as in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isaiah 21:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Isaiah 62:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Psalm 34:1 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/9/3" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> Psalm 71:6</a>. It pertains to the continual, faithful service of Jehovah’s people.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[26]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> These two things are in evidence together, namely, (1) placing of the horrid abomination that astounds, and (2) the taking away of the continual sacrifice. There is no Scriptural reason for concluding that the 1,290 days should run at the same time as the 1,260 days. The 1,290 days are therefore reckoned from the date of the setting up of the abomination, which was in the latter part of January, 1919. This period of 3 years and 7 months ends at September, 1922—the very time of the Cedar Point Convention mentioned above. Let it be kept in mind that this convention was not arranged for this date with a view to fulfilling any prophecy, for at that time it was not known that these dates were important. The “continual sacrifice” had been restored by 1922. The Isaiah class had been cleansed of lip and now they are wholly devoted to singing praises to Jehovah. “And in his temple everything saith, Glory.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 29:9</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="qu"> 6. What facts point to the accomplishment of the 1,290-day period in September, 1922?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[27]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> At the end of this 1,290-day period the whole world was to come to know that the League of Nations was not approved of God and would come to nought. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa. 8:9, 10</a>) Its doom was to be pronounced. Any build-up of the same system would be likewise doomed to failure. Three years and seven months passed from the time the abomination was set up until it was publicly pronounced as condemned, there at the Cedar Point Convention of September, 1922. There, too, another situation ceased, from the time the continual sacrifice of praise to Jehovah was interfered with and taken away until it was restored, and the sacrifice of praise was again being offered in God’s temple, and the obnoxious abomination exposed as a subterfuge, standing in the place where it never should be. So ended the 1,290 days.—See <em>The Watchtower,</em> Nov. 1, 1922.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>1,335 DAYS</strong></p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="qu"> 7. Is it reasonable to think that these three time periods mentioned in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Daniel 12</a> cover many centuries of time? Why do you so answer?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[28]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Daniel 12:12</a> (<em>AS</em>) announces: “Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.” From 1922 there was a forward movement, new truths were opening to the view of the faithful. No halting now, for, with the vision of the Lord at the temple, the work of advertising the King and his kingdom was on. There are those who may think it strange that these 2,500-year-old prophecies are now receiving fulfillment in a few short years. But we must realize that they must come to pass sometime, and <span id="page434" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="434" data-before-text="434"></span>why not now? Some may prefer to think of these 1,260, 1,290 and 1,335 “days” of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Daniel 12:7-12</a> as covering many centuries of time, just as though that would add to their importance. But is that reasonable? Why not question yourself: Why were these wonders given? It was certainly not just to record or set forth historical facts, so that Bible students could point with confidence to God’s Word as being true. Rather, these visions are for the comfort, edification and guidance of God’s people in these “last days”, so they would really know the sign of the times and when their deliverance from Babylonish captivity would come. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Rom. 15:4</a>, <em>NW</em>) How possibly could these wonders guide us today if we merely knew that certain prophecies had been fulfilled during the Middle Ages? It is true certain prophecies received a partial or miniature fulfillment at the first advent of Christ Jesus, and this was to identify God’s Son and to fulfill God’s purposes concerning him, so giving the church confidence and complete assurance in him as the Messiah.</p>

Stop and think. If you get in only two hours instead of three, due to helping three weak ones, think how much more praise this means to Jehovah. Four times two equals eight hours instead of your individual three. Maybe <em>you</em> will be praised more by men if you put in more hours working by yourself, but <em>Jehovah</em> is praised more when more praisers are in the field. Paul counsels: Keep “an eye, not in personal interest upon just your own matters, but also in personal interest upon those of the others.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Phil. 2:4</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="ss"><strong>PRAISING JEHOVAH WITH THE POWERS OF SPEECH</strong></p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">21.

For, says the apostle Peter, “maintain your conduct fine among the nations.” Why so?

You must show kindness and neighbor love. You must exercise self-control. You must prove your uncompromising integrity to Jehovah when facing the everyday issues. And there are so many issues presented by this materialistic, sex-crazed system of things, including such vital matters as blood transfusions, regimented servitude and saluting of images of the State, all of which must be met with the same intelligent determination as displayed by first-century Christians who boldly declared: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Acts 5:29</a>.</p>

But they too can implore Jehovah to continue to smile on them and take care of them. Such faithful older ones can be sure that God will answer their prayers.

The psalmist did not feel abandoned by Jehovah; rather, he recognized his own need to rely on his Maker even more as he grew older. Jehovah responds to such loyalty by providing support throughout one’s life. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102004730/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 18:25</a>) Often such support comes by means of fellow Christians.</p>

<strong>The Time for Choosing God as Sovereign</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> This provokes the question, ‘If I let God be the Sovereign of my life, does that mean my becoming a witness of Jehovah?’ In answer to that question, we can refer to the inspired psalmist, who let God be the Sovereign of his life. He wrote: “But as for me, the drawing near to God is good for me. In the Sovereign Lord Jehovah I have placed my refuge, to declare all your works.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975805/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ps. 73:28</a>) Also: “O my God, provide me with escape from the hand of the wicked one, from the palm of the one acting unjustly and oppressively. For you are my hope, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah, my confidence from my youth. I shall come in grand mightiness, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah; I shall mention your righteousness, yours alone.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975805/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ps. 71:4, 5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975805/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 16</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> So we ask, Will the person of today who places his refuge in the Sovereign <span id="page663" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="663" data-before-text="663"></span>Lord Jehovah do any differently from what the ancient psalmist did, namely, “declare all [God’s] works”? Will the person of today who has been provided with escape “from the hand of the wicked one” and who has made the Sovereign Lord Jehovah his hope do otherwise than did the psalmist, namely, “come in grand mightiness” and “mention [God’s] righteousness”? Certainly he will not be ashamed of the Sovereign of his life. Jesus Christ, our greatest Exemplar, was not ashamed of his Sovereign, Jehovah God. Hence, he became a witness of Jehovah, and for this reason he is called “Jesus Christ, ‘the Faithful Witness.’” He speaks of himself as “the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation by God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975805/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Rev. 1:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975805/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 3:14</a>) Those who truly become his footstep followers must likewise become witnesses of his Father Jehovah.

He wrote: “O God, you have taught me from my youth . . . Even when I am old and gray, O God, do not abandon me.

Others participated in broadcasts on the Watchtower radio station, WBBR. Many can tell about the time when cases involving the religious freedom of Jehovah’s Witnesses were fought in the highest courts. Still others stood firm for true worship while living under dictatorial regimes. Yes, older ones can relate how the understanding of truth has been progressively revealed.

It went on to say that the anointed happily “look forward in the light of Bible prophecy and see a new generation.” To whom particularly is this referring? <em>The Watchtower</em> said: “Jesus spoke of them as his ‘other sheep.’” ‘The generation to come’ refers to humans who will live under the new earthly administration governed by the Kingdom of the heavens.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">16.

<strong>Using Theocratic Assets</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Following the foolish pursuits of the world is a waster, not only of life force and energy, but of another asset—time. Paul, after mentioning the shameful conduct of the nations, gave good reason for guarding time and using the asset well. “So keep strict watch that how you walk is not as unwise but as wise persons, buying out the opportune time for yourselves, because the days are wicked. On this account cease becoming unreasonable, but go on perceiving what the will of Jehovah is.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963323/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Eph. 5:15-17</a>) Today the nations of the world squander time by ceaseless pursuits of pleasure, ignoring the beneficial continuous action of perceiving what the will of Jehovah is. By squandering their time they are also in line to lose life itself. Others squander time out of sheer laziness, not wanting to bear any responsibility. They are being robbed of a valuable asset whether they realize it or not. A wise man <span id="page272" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="272" data-before-text="272"></span>once wrote: “I passed along by the field of the lazy individual and by the vineyard of the man in need of heart. And, look! all of it produced weeds. Nettles covered its very surface, and its stone wall itself had been torn down. So I proceeded to behold, I myself; I began taking it to heart; I saw, I took the discipline: A little sleeping, a little slumbering, a little folding of the hands to lie down, and as a highwayman your poverty will certainly come and your neediness as an armed man.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963323/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Prov. 24:30-34</a>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu"> 7. To what profitable uses can valuable time be put?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> God’s Word emphasizes the need for discipline in using time profitably. “Keep getting filled with spirit, speaking to yourselves with psalms and praises to God and spiritual songs, singing and accompanying yourselves with music in your hearts to Jehovah, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ giving thanks always for all things to our God and Father.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963323/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Eph. 5:15-20</a>) Dedicated Christian time is devoted to God’s things, including taking in knowledge of God’s Word, speaking about it to others, being in regular association with those who are also dedicated to God and joining voices in organized praise and thanksgiving to God publicly. The workingman must give the employer his due, but there are other hours in the day. Youths do not spend all their day in school. So the dedicated servant of God uses his time in speaking wherever he may be, such as while traveling to work or to school, during a lunch hour or in a time of relaxation and diversion. This is in addition to definite periods of time set apart for regular theocratic activities at homes in the community. So on many occasions Christians employ another theocratic asset, the power of speech, a marvelous gift from God that is used to the praise of Jehovah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963323/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 71:24</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>INFLUENCE AND STRENGTH</strong></p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 8. How can influence prove to be a great asset in personal associations? in a congregation?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Among the resources of all men, rich or poor, is influence on the lives of others. One could hardly associate with a man like the apostle Paul and not benefit from his influence. His viewpoint was expressed to the Romans: “For I am longing to see you, that I may impart some spiritual gift to you in order for you to be made firm; or, rather, that there may be an interchange of encouragement among you, by each one through the other’s faith, both yours and mine.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963323/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Rom. 1:11, 12</a>) Today God expects men to be an influence for good wherever they go. A Christian may find himself in his secular work as a companion with men of foul speech or evil thoughts. The fact that he does not join in such evil, but keeps his position as a Christian and speaks of good things, is bound to be a good influence. Christian children in school and at play should also be a good influence. Wise fathers influence their families for good, taking a proper lead in observing God’s truth. Christian mothers support the fathers in using their influence on the lives of the children. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963323/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Prov. 22:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963323/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 2 Tim. 1:5</a>) In the congregation a Christian may also use his influence for good if he is zealous and ready in mind to apply the counsel and instructions, encouraging others to give full support to all congregation activities. He shows respect for the overseers who preside in a fine way and works harmoniously with them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963323/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Tim. 5:17</a>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 9, 10.

The so-called strong men of the world are usually dictators who use power and strength to oppress the people, but this is not what Almighty God expects to see in men. Jehovah, who is all-powerful, has set <span id="page273" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="273" data-before-text="273"></span>the right example for men in his patience and loving-kindness. Men do well to copy him and use their power in accord with God’s will, serving the Creator. Imperfect men are said to have strong points and weaknesses. God’s Word counsels on keeping a balanced use of strong points and controlling weaknesses: “Do not become righteous overmuch, nor show yourself excessively wise. Why should you cause desolation to yourself? Do not be wicked overmuch, nor become foolish. Why should you die when it is not your time? It is better that you should take hold of the one, but from the other also do not withdraw your hand; for he that fears God will go forth with them all.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963323/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Eccl. 7:16-18</a>.</p>

<strong>Comfort for the Oppressed</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">In the Bible, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996800/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 72</a> speaks of a grand comforter for all people. The psalm was written by Solomon’s father, King David. Its superscription reads: “Regarding Solomon.” Evidently, it was written by aged <span id="page6" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>King David respecting One who would inherit his throne. This One, according to the psalm, would bring permanent relief from oppression. “In his days the righteous one will sprout, and the abundance of peace until the moon is no more. And he will have subjects from sea to sea and . . . to the ends of the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996800/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 72:7, 8</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Likely, when David wrote these words, he was thinking of his son Solomon. But Solomon realized that it was beyond his power to serve mankind in the way described in the psalm. He could fulfill the words of the psalm only in a minor way and in behalf of the nation of Israel, not for the benefit of the whole earth. Evidently, this inspired prophetic psalm pointed to someone much greater than Solomon. Who was that? It could only be Jesus Christ.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">When an angel announced Jesus’ birth, he said: “Jehovah God will give him the throne of David his father.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996800/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 1:32</a>) Moreover, Jesus referred to himself as “something more than Solomon.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996800/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 11:31</a>) Since Jesus’ resurrection to God’s right hand, he has been in heaven, in the location from which he can fulfill the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996800/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 72</a>.

<strong>What Does Righteous Rule Mean to You?</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The opening verse reveals that righteous rule cannot exist apart from the eternal principles of divine justice.

Moreover, the righteousness that distinguishes the true God should also be an attribute of the king’s son.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The expression “son of the king” fits both Solomon and Jesus Christ. Solomon was the son of King David, whereas Jesus is the Son of the great King Jehovah God.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010608/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isa. 9:6, 7</a>) Under God’s direction, the Greater Solomon will ‘plead the cause of the afflicted ones and save the sons of the poor one.’ His rule will be one of peace and righteousness.

<strong>What Does Righteous Rule Mean to You?</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Such a righteous rule would bring great honor to Jehovah God.

This fear would last as long as the sun and moon continue, throughout all generations. When, for example, Solomon judged the case of two prostitutes, the people, seeing the evidence of divine wisdom in action, did ‘become fearful.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979602/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Ki. 3:28</a>) It may also be noted that the miracles performed by Jesus Christ while on earth filled many persons with a wholesome fear and moved them to praise Jehovah God.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979602/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 9:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979602/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Luke 7:16</a>.</p>

<strong>The Peace on Which World Unity Hinges</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Just as Isaiah’s prophecy foretells peace under the heavenly rule of Jesus Christ, the psalmist David compares the reign of Christ with the peaceful reign of King Solomon, when Solomon ruled over the Promised Land to its God-ordained borders. The psalmist describes the kind of peace God desires, stating: “Let him judge the afflicted ones of the people, let him save the sons of the poor one, and let him crush the defrauder. . . . In his days the righteous one will sprout, and the abundance of peace until the moon is no more [meaning indefinitely, or forever]. And he will have subjects from sea to sea. . . .

But his bad outcome demonstrates that knowledge, great ability, or power, riches and fame are not the most important things, and that turning away from Jehovah is to forsake wisdom. Solomon’s own counsel proved true: “More than all else that is to be guarded, safeguard your heart, for out of it are the sources of life.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014082/75/0" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Prov. 4:23</a>) His case illustrates the treacherousness and desperateness of the heart of sinful man, but more, it shows that the best of hearts can be enticed if constant vigilance is not kept. Loving what Jehovah loves and hating what he hates, constantly seeking his guidance and the doing of what pleases him, are a sure protection.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014082/76/0" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Jer. 17:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014082/76/1" data-bid="77-2" class="b"> Prov. 8:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014082/76/2" data-bid="77-3" class="b"> Heb. 1:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014082/76/3" data-bid="77-4" class="b"> John 8:29</a>.</p><p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="ss"><strong>SOLOMON’S RULE A BASIS FOR MESSIANIC PROPHECIES</strong></p><p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="sb">There are many similarities in the reign of Solomon with that of the great King Jesus Christ, as prophesied in the Scriptures. In many respects Solomon’s rule, as long as he was obedient to Jehovah, is a small-scale pattern of the administration of the Messianic Kingdom. Jesus Christ, “something more than Solomon,” came as a man of peace, and he builds up the congregation, the temple of God, by peaceful methods.

It determines the Messianic character of the whole composition.” And on verse 8, he remarks: “The kingdom was to be universal, extending to the ends of the earth.

<strong>Light on Life’s Roadway from the Psalms</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">To begin with, the Psalms eloquently and repeatedly call attention to the fact that Jehovah God created all things: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man?” (8:3, 4) “Before the mountains themselves were born, or you proceeded to bring forth as with labor pains the earth and the productive land, even from time indefinite to time indefinite you are God.” (90:2) “Know that Jehovah is God. It is he that has made us, and not we ourselves.” (100:3) <span id="page550" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="550" data-before-text="550"></span>“I shall laud you because in a fear-inspiring way I am wonderfully made.”—139:14.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Among the earliest instances of God’s dealings with his creatures that the book of Psalms records is that of Jehovah concluding a covenant with Abraham and his making sworn statements to Isaac and Jacob. In fulfillment of these promises Jehovah God “brought out his people with exultation” to the land promised.—105:9, 10, 42-44.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Bringing his people Israel into their Promised Land involved many mighty acts, and these the book of Psalms also features. It tells that Jehovah sent ten plagues upon Egypt, that he split the Red Sea so that they could pass over and that he miraculously sustained them in the wilderness, providing bread, meat and water. Noted also are the striking victories God gained for his people in the days of Barak and Gideon.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalms 78,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 83,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 105,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 106,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/4" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> 135</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Then too, the Psalms record that it was necessary for Jehovah God repeatedly to chastise his people, even to the point of bringing them into Babylonian captivity: “By the rivers of Babylon—there we sat down. We also wept when we remembered Zion.” (137:1-9) And they record also Israel’s return from captivity: “When Jehovah gathered back the captive ones of Zion, we became like those who were dreaming. . . . At that time they proceeded to say among the nations: ‘Jehovah has done a great thing in what he has done with them.’” (126:1, 2) Yes, by recording how Jehovah God dealt with his people in times past and why, the book of Psalms throws much light on life’s roadway, for thereby it acquaints us with God’s attributes and principles.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>THE LIGHT OF PROPHECY</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The book of Psalms also serves as a light on life’s roadway by reason of the prophecies it contains, many of which have already been fulfilled, giving confidence that the rest will also have fulfillment. Among the many prophecies of the Psalms regarding Jesus Christ that the Christian Greek Scriptures show had fulfillment were that he would come in dedication to do God’s will (40:8; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 10:7-9</a>); that zeal for God’s house would eat him up, as it were (69:9; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 2:17</a>); that he would be betrayed by an intimate (41:9; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 13:18</a>); that lots would be cast for his garments (22:18; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 19:24</a>); that not a bone of him would be broken (34:20; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 19:36</a>) and that God would not leave his soul in Sheol or Hades.—16:10; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 2:29-31</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Further, the book of Psalms foretold Jesus’ exaltation to the right hand of his Father, there to await God’s due time for him to go into action against God’s enemies and for God to subject all things under Christ’s feet.—110:1, 2; 8:6; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Heb. 1:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 2:8</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The fulfillment of such prophecies instills faith that the prophecies in the Psalms regarding the blessings of the Messianic reign of the King’s Son, Jesus Christ, will also have fulfillment: “Let him judge the afflicted ones of the people, let him save the sons of the poor one, and let him crush the defrauder. He will descend like the rain upon the mown grass, like copious showers that wet the earth. In his days the righteous one will sprout, and the abundance of peace until the moon is no more. There will come to be plenty of grain on the earth; on the top of the mountains there will be an overflow.”—72:4, 6, 7, 16.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>BIBLE TEACHINGS</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The book of Psalms also throws light on life’s roadway by the various Bible teachings it touches on. Fittingly it stresses the role of Jehovah God as the Universal <span id="page551" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="551" data-before-text="551"></span>Sovereign. Though ‘the rulers of earth mass together as one against Jehovah and his anointed one, Jehovah himself will laugh at them in derision, speak to them in his anger and disturb them in hot displeasure.’ (2:1, 2, 4, 5) He will put them in their place, answering the psalmists’ prayers: “Do arise, O Jehovah! Let not mortal man prove superior in strength. Let the nations be judged before your face. Do put fear into them, O Jehovah, that the nations may know that they are but mortal men.” “Fill their faces with dishonor, that people may search for your name, O Jehovah. That people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.”—9:19, 20; 83:16, 18.</p>

<strong>Solomon’s Reign</strong><br/><h1 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>Solomon’s Reign</strong></h1></header><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THE reign of King Solomon gives us a prophetic glimpse of the future. During his royal rule Israel reached its pinnacle of wealth and glory. Solomon was both a wise king and a master organizer. He built a magnificent temple to Jehovah, various government buildings, and a royal palace, as depicted below. He established administrative districts that, on a rotational basis, provided the royal household with a variety of food, regardless of the season.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Solomon’s rule was a time of genuine peace and security. This well foreshadows the peaceful reign of the Messiah, who “will have subjects from sea to sea and from the River [Euphrates] to the ends of the earth.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001396/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps 72:8</a>.</p>

<strong>What Does Righteous Rule Mean to You?</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The refreshing effect of righteous rule is described as follows: “He will descend like the rain upon the mown grass, like copious showers that wet the earth. In his days the righteous one will sprout, and the abundance of peace until the moon is no more. And he will have subjects from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979602/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 72:6-8</a>) The king’s righteous rule would be as refreshing as abundant showers that are needed to make the mown grass flourish. In view of the existing peace and security, the righteous person could “sprout,” that is, flourish or prosper. Sooner would the moon pass away than would peace end under this righteous rule.​—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979602/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 5:18</a>.</p>

The “middle” section of the Euphrates reaches from Carchemish down to the city of Hit, in the region of bitumen pits, its flow being strengthened by the waters of the Belikh and Khabur Rivers. Below Hit the river courses through the fertile Mesopotamian plain, and, some fifty miles (81 kilometers) below Hit, in the neighborhood of Baghdad, it draws within twenty-five miles (40 kilometers) of the Tigris River. In this lower section of the Euphrates, the river dissipates itself in the extensive marshes and in the ruined canals, and its flow becomes sluggish.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The Euphrates and the Tigris finally unite near Basra and from this junction to the Persian Gulf the stream is known as the Shatt-el-Arab. Pliny and other ancient historians stated that the Euphrates originally had its outlet into the sea separate from that of the Tigris. It is generally believed that the silt deposited by the two rivers has built up the delta region at the head of the Persian Gulf and that the original coastline extended much farther N, perhaps reaching as far as the ancient city of Ur of the Chaldeans, Abraham’s early home.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>COMMERCIAL THOROUGHFARE</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The Euphrates from ancient times has been a highway of commerce in the “Fertile Crescent.” Its waters are navigable for small vessels for some 1,200 miles (1,931 kilometers) from the sea. Inflated goatskins and little round basket-shaped boats formed of reeds and coated with bitumen are still employed by some today as they were in centuries past. The Euphrates’ waters reach their lowest point in September and then steadily rise until May, when their normal crest is reached. Due to the melting snows, spring floods occur. The annual overflowing of both the Euphrates and the Tigris doubtless is the basis of Isaiah’s description of Babylonia as “the wilderness of the sea.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011405/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa. 21:1, 2</a>) This flooding was controlled in ancient times by dikes and sluices that diverted the waters into irrigation canals and into catch basins. These canals formed an irrigation network between the Euphrates and the Tigris that ensured productiveness for most of lower Babylonia. Over the centuries the canals generally have become blocked up and clogged, with resultant agricultural deterioration; the accumulation of salts in the soil due to the irrigation waters also contributed to the gradual ruin of the once-fertile valley.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>MAJOR CITIES</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Along the Euphrates’ banks lay many ancient cities, including Ur, Erech, Kish and Babylon. The river’s course has apparently shifted somewhat to the W so that most of the ancient sites now lie several miles to the E.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The great city of Babylon was originally built so that it straddled the Euphrates, and the river’s waters were used to form a broad deep moat encircling the city and also to form a network of canals within the city walls. At the time of Babylon’s fall in 539 B.C.E., Cyrus diverted the waters of the Euphrates so that his troops could march through the riverbed into the unsuspecting city. Thus, in a figurative sense the waters of the Euphrates were ‘dried up.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011405/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isa. 44:27, 28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011405/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 45:1</a>) In symbol, the same thing is prophesied to result from the outpouring of the sixth angel’s “bowl” on “the great river Euphrates,” as described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011405/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Revelation 16:12</a>.

A translation by the Jewish Publication Society here simply transliterates the Hebrew word as “Perath,” and some suggest that the reference is <span id="page537" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="537" data-before-text="537"></span>not to the Euphrates but to the town of Parah (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011405/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Josh. 18:23</a>), near Anathoth, a few miles from Jerusalem. However, the repetition of the name <em>P<sup>e</sup>rathʹ</em> (Euphrates) four times in the account very evidently shows that the place named had a significant relation to the prophetic picture being enacted, whereas the obscure village of Parah would hardly seem to give particular significance to the event. Though some point out that the Hebrew word <em>na·harʹ</em> (river) is not used in connection with <em>P<sup>e</sup>rathʹ,</em> in this text, it may be noted that it is likewise lacking at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011405/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Jeremiah 51:63</a>, yet the reference there obviously is to the Euphrates River.

Solomon’s own counsel proved true: “More than all else that is to be guarded, safeguard your heart, for out of it are the sources of life.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014082/75/0" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Prov. 4:23</a>) His case illustrates the treacherousness and desperateness of the heart of sinful man, but more, it shows that the best of hearts can be enticed if constant vigilance is not kept.

In many respects Solomon’s rule, as long as he was obedient to Jehovah, is a small-scale pattern of the administration of the Messianic Kingdom. Jesus Christ, “something more than Solomon,” came as a man of peace, and he builds up the congregation, the temple of God, by peaceful methods.

It determines the Messianic character of the whole composition.” And on verse 8, he remarks: “The kingdom was to be universal, extending to the ends of the earth.

They will literally eat enjoyable earthly food to sustain that life forevermore in peace, health and happiness. Isaiah’s prophecy of a banquet has a literal aspect to it and not wholly a spiritual aspect.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● What is “the River” spoken of in</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965764/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 72:8</strong></a><strong>?—V.B., U.S.A.</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In this psalm regarding the extensive, peaceful rule of King Solomon we find the promise, “He will have subjects from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965764/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 72:8</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">We can appreciate what boundary is meant by the term “the River” when we recall Jehovah’s promise to Abraham. That man had once lived “on the other side” of the Euphrates River, and there his father had served other gods. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965764/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Josh. 24:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965764/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 15</a>) However, after he came to Canaan, God promised that his descendants would receive the land “from the river of Egypt,” south of Canaan, “to the great river, the river Euphrates.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965764/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 15:18</a>) Thus the Euphrates was understood to be one of the boundaries of the Promised Land. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965764/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Exodus 23:31 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965764/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Deuteronomy 11:24</a>.) During the reign of King Solomon the territory Israel controlled did extend to the Euphrates.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965764/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Chron. 9:26</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Interestingly, the Jewish Targums, paraphrases or interpretive translations of parts of the Hebrew Scriptures into Aramaic, read “Euphrates” in place of “River” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965764/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 72:8</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Having subjects from sea to sea and from the river Euphrates to the ends of the earth indicated an extensive rule in the case of Israel’s kings. The Greater Solomon, Jesus Christ, will enjoy an all-embracing or earthwide rule, in grand fulfillment of this prophetic psalm.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"></p>

<strong>The “Good News” Separates ‘A People for Jehovah’s Name’</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> In his final meeting with his disciples just before his death, Jesus, in prayer to his heavenly Father, made clear a principle concerning the Christian’s relationship to the world. “I have given your word to them, but the world has hated them, because they are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world. I request you, not to take them out of the world, but to watch over them because of the wicked one. They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world. Sanctify them by means of the truth; your word <span id="page49" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="49" data-before-text="49"></span>is truth. Just as you sent me forth into the world, I also sent them forth into the world.” The true followers of Jesus are, therefore, no part of this world, in that they separate themselves from its wicked ways and do not place their hope for the future in the schemes and organizations of men. Rather, their hope is in the new world ruled over by God’s kingdom and they have their interests centered on that new world. So it is proper to say that the modern Christian witnesses of Jehovah are a <em>New World</em> society. This New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses is united by their all having the same wholehearted love for God, by recognizing Jehovah as the Supreme Ruler of the universe and by their submission to God’s kingdom.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963044/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">John 17:14-18</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 9. What proof is there that God’s kingdom exists and is now ruling?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Because God’s kingdom is heavenly and hence invisible to humans on the earth, the worldly nations refuse to recognize it or take it into account. But because God is invisible to human eyes that does not mean that he does not exist. The evidence of his existence is seen in his creation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963044/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Rom. 1:20</a>) Proof of the existence of God’s kingdom is seen by the very existence of the New World society—hundreds of thousands of persons coming from all nations, united, at peace and accepting the Kingdom rule. This is in harmony with the inspired words at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963044/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 72:7, 8</a>: “In his days the righteous one will sprout, and the abundance of peace until the moon is no more. And he will have subjects from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth.” So it is that those making up the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses are found literally to the “ends of the earth.” They demonstrate that they are truly subjects of the kingdom of God by their being obedient and submissive to the divine will and by active support of God’s kingdom, preaching it throughout the earth.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu">10. Why do Jehovah’s witnesses not take sides in political issues or in wars between nations?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> In order to keep their unity the true servants of God must follow the principles, set out above, to be separate from the world. It is for this reason that Jehovah’s witnesses do not take sides in political issues. Just think what this would mean if they were to do so! The congregation of true Christians would be divided against itself if individual members supported different political organizations, joining in the ridiculing or opposing of some other group of which others in the congregation might be members. How could this possibly harmonize with Jesus’ further words in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963044/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Joh 17 verses 21 and 22</a> of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963044/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">John chapter 17</a>? Jesus there prayed concerning his followers, “That they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in union with me and I am in union with you, that they also may be in union with us, in order that the world may believe that you sent me forth. Also, I have given them the glory that you have given me, in order that they may be one just as we are one.” On an international scale also this unity is preserved by Jehovah’s witnesses not joining in wars and struggles between nations, which are divided by man-made barriers.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>PAYING BACK “CAESAR’S THINGS TO CAESAR”</strong></p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">11, 12. How does a Christian pay back “Caesar’s things to Caesar”?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> However, Jehovah’s witnesses continue to live in territories ruled over by earthly governments, which Jehovah has permitted to continue up till this time. In explaining the relationship of the Christian to such governments Jesus stated another very well-known principle: “Pay back, therefore, Caesar’s things to Caesar, but God’s things to God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963044/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 22:21</a>) <span id="page50" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="50" data-before-text="50"></span>These words show that earthly governments (or “Caesar”) may properly require certain duties from their Christian subjects. For example, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963044/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matthew chapter 22</a> Jesus was discussing the matter of paying taxes. The governments render many services to Christ’s followers, such as in the field of education, the building of roads, the control of law and order through the police and courts of justice, making available water, electricity and other supplies, all of which have to be paid for. So Christians “pay back” with a good conscience, by means of taxes, and so forth, for these various services.</p>

<strong>Who Should Rule Mankind?</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><span id="page72" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="72" data-before-text="72"></span><strong>THE RIGHTFUL RULER</strong></p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">The one “who has the legal right” and who has received the authority to rule from God is not a power-hungry atheistic dictator of the East, nor is he a democratically elected ruler of the West. The one empowered by God is his own Son Jesus Christ. Already he thrones as king in the heavens. To him God has given “rulership and dignity and kingdom, that the peoples, national groups and languages should all serve even him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962081/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Dan. 7:14</a>) Kings of the earth and high officials who continue to struggle for world control do so in defiance of the kingdom of God. They do not want to submit to God’s enthroned king; they want to be the ones in power. After commenting on their defiant attitude, the second Psalm goes on to say: “The very One sitting in the heavens will laugh; Jehovah himself will hold them in derision. At that time he will speak to them in his anger and in his hot displeasure he will disturb them, saying: ‘I, even I, have installed my king upon Zion, my holy mountain.’” To his king he says: “You will break them with an iron scepter, as though a potter’s vessel you will dash them to pieces.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962081/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 2:4-6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962081/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 9</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Yes, Christ the King will bring to an end all these men who turn the attention of mankind away from the kingdom of God, which is mankind’s only hope. The time is now near when Christ will go into action against the wicked elements both visible and invisible and destroy them in the “war of the great day of God the Almighty.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962081/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Rev. 16:14</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Under his Kingdom rule righteousness will prevail in every part of the earth. Greedy, self-seeking officials will be a thing of the past. Concerning this New World king it is said: “The scepter of your kingdom is the scepter of uprightness. You loved righteousness, and you hated lawlessness. That is why God, your God, anointed you with the oil of exultation more than your partners.” “In his days the righteous one will sprout, and the abundance of peace until the moon is no more. And he will have subjects from sea to sea and from the [Euphrates] River to the ends of the earth.” What a joy it will be to have as the one ruler for all mankind one who really loves righteousness! What a blessing to be ruled by one who is approved of God and whose rulership God will crown with sure success!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962081/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Heb. 1:8, 9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962081/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Ps 72:7, 8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962081/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> Isa. 9:7</a></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">By means of this rightful ruler for all mankind the earth will be brought to a state of paradisaic loveliness, free from war and calamity, even free from sickness and death. He is the ruler who will lead mankind in united worship and obedience to Jehovah God, to the glory of his Father and to the blessing of all his subjects.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962081/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962081/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Isa. 66:23</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">And what assurance is there that these things will come about? The assurance of God himself who has promised them. These are not the vain hopes of men, but the purposes of God set out in his Word the Bible. Jehovah God, the Creator of heaven and earth, is almighty; nothing can make his purposes return to him without fulfillment. The question of world rulership has already been decided by him. Soon all who fail to submit to Jehovah’s ruling King will be destroyed forever. Now, therefore, is the time to prove that we are his disciples by maintaining separateness from the world, its power-grabbing political systems and the God-dishonoring religions that set aside God’s Word. Now is the time to dedicate ourselves to God and to become public advocates of his kingdom in the hands of Jesus Christ. So doing, we will be numbered among those whom he will preserve alive through this world’s end to be his happy subjects in the enduring new world.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb"></p>

<strong>“Let Your Kingdom Come”</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[20]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> This earth is the place to which God’s kingdom comes or extends its power and dominion, for it is here that Satan has separated mankind from God. Now since he has been hurled down here, the earth is the center of rebellion, an island of rebellion in all the universe; and God is localizing the war of Armageddon to just this earth and vicinity. God’s covenant with King David for an everlasting kingdom was not for just a spiritual state of religiousness and morality but was also for possession of territory. God held down David’s dominion to just the land God designated in his covenant with David’s forefather Abraham, known as the Promised Land. But the territory that the prophecy assigns to God’s kingdom by Christ <span id="page495" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="495" data-before-text="495"></span>will be “from sea to sea, and from the River [Euphrates, Babylon’s one-time seat] unto the ends of the earth”. The stone symbolizing God’s kingdom crushes Satan’s political image and becomes a mountain that fills the whole earth. We read further: “Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951604/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 72:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951604/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Dan. 2:35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951604/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Isa. 9:6, 7</a>, AS; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951604/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Gen. 15:18-20</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>HIS WILL</strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="qu"> 9. How is it that God’s will comes to pass here as in heaven?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[21]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> From this standpoint we can appreciate more intelligently the petition that immediately follows the prayer for God’s kingdom: “Let your will come to pass, as in heaven, also upon earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951604/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 6:10</a>, <em>NW</em>) This is generally understood to mean that God’s will is to be done by human creatures on earth as it is done by spirit angels up in heaven. But does it mean just that? Or rather that God will do what he wants to do here on earth by means of his kingdom just the same as he does it up in heaven? Rather the latter, although it includes the former thought too. As it is written: “Our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he pleased.” “Whatsoever Jehovah pleased, that hath he done, in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps.” Says he: “I am God, and there is none like me; declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not yet done; saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure; . . . yea, I have spoken, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed, I will also do it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951604/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Pss. 115:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951604/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 135:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951604/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> Isa. 46:9-11</a>, AS; also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951604/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951604/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 8:3</a>) At his appointed year, 1914, he brought his kingdom to birth by enthroning Christ Jesus as King in the midst of his enemies. And Jesus, who taught us to pray for God’s will to be done here, is faithfully carrying out his will toward this earth just as he did toward heaven when he fought and cast Satan and his demons down from there. Jesus once came to earth as a man to do his Father’s will here. For so doing he was raised from the dead and ascended back to heaven to continue doing his Father’s will forevermore.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="qu">10. Who on earth are now doing God’s will, but how not Christendom?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[22]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Now the time for Satan to rage and do his will, bringing woe upon earth and sea and persecuting Jehovah’s people on earth, is very short indeed. That is why he is so angry and is now trying to do his worst, so as to destroy all mankind and especially the remnant of the heirs of God’s kingdom and all their crowd of goodwill companions and fellow witnesses. But the remnant are not terrified by Satan’s anger and his warfare, but “observe the commandments of God and have the work of bearing witness to Jesus”. They and their good-will companions are wholly committed to doing God’s will. Hence they are now obediently having part in fulfilling Jesus’ prophecy concerning the end of this world: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations, and then the accomplished end will come.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951604/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Rev. 12:12, 13,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951604/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951604/13/2" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> Matt. 24:14</a>, <em>NW</em>) But not so Christendom! She regularly says her “Pater Noster” (Latin meaning “Our Father”) but does not do God’s will. She fights the true interests of God’s kingdom and fights Jehovah’s witnesses who proclaim that the Kingdom has been set up. She is now divided within herself by hot and cold wars over international communism, and she is <span id="page496" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="496" data-before-text="496"></span>inconsistently serving both sides of the conflict.</p>

Even if the apostle had the latter meaning in mind, his evaluation of “all things” as “refuse” emphasizes the high value he placed on gaining and being found in union with Christ.—See DOVE’S DUNG.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"></p>

There will be none. Even with reference to the wild beasts we are assured: “They will not do any harm or cause any ruin in all my holy mountain; because the earth will certainly be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters are covering the very sea.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962240/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa. 11:9</a>) “For them I shall certainly conclude a covenant in that day in connection with the wild beast of the field and with the flying creature of the heavens and the creeping thing of the ground, and the bow and the sword and war I shall break out of the land, and I will make them lie down in security.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962240/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hos. 2:18</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Security will be man’s permanent lot in the paradise new world.

Our lives are dependent upon blood, and it makes up one tenth to one twelfth of our bodies. Naturally, we shudder at the threat of any increase in that uniformly fatal disease of the blood known as leukemia, as a result of the radioactive fallout from the exploding of atomic bombs above ground. In one month of intensive atomic testing during the autumn of 1958 the Soviet Union virtually doubled the amount of radioactive debris in our earth’s atmosphere. So said Dr. W. E. Libby, the scientist member of the American Atomic Energy Commission. This increases the world-wide threat to blood. How so? In the hazards to man from fallouts, the radioactive product of most importance from atomic bomb explosions above ground is the chemical known as strontium 90, a long-lived radioactive material that can cause bone cancer and leukemia. In the marrow of our bones our blood is manufactured. (New York <em>Times,</em> March 14, 1959) Surely the attitude of men who explode such threats to mankind’s blood is far different from the attitude of Christ, whom our Creator has appointed King of a new world. Of this King the sacred prophecy says: “The souls of the poor ones he will save. From oppression and from violence he will redeem their soul, and their blood will be precious in his eyes.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959801/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 72:13, 14</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 2.

As our Creator and Giver of life he long ago gave laws concerning blood. These laws showed that he attached a sacredness, a sanctity, to blood. Little do men in general appreciate today that they are under the Creator’s law concerning blood and that they will be punished for violating its sacredness. It is no light punishment, but it will call for their very life. Over 4,327 years have passed since the flood of Noah’s day, but the law that God then proclaimed regarding blood still applies. What is more, it applies to all mankind; for all of us, whether Jews or non-Jews, descended from non-Jews to whom this holy law was proclaimed, Noah and his sons Shem, Ham and Japheth. Our life hinges on our informing ourselves on this law and on keeping it. We shall be benefited and enlightened if we note the language of this law for all mankind alive today.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 3, 4.

Noah killed some of all the clean beasts and birds there at Mount Ararat. This proved to be no violation of the sacredness of blood.

The fruitage would be flourishing as Lebanon, yes, like the massive cedars of Lebanon that are luxurious in their growth. This may indicate that the stalks of grain would be tall and thick, able to support heavy ears of grain. Even the inhabitants of the city would flourish, becoming numerous as the vegetation. This proved to be true during Solomon’s reign, for we read: “Judah and Israel were many, like the grains of sand that are by the sea for multitude, eating and drinking and rejoicing.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979602/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">1 Ki. 4:20</a>) Even better conditions will exist in the “new earth” under the rule of Jesus Christ.</p>

<strong>Vegetation</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It was not until the fourth creative “day,” however, that the sun, moon and stars were “made” to be visible from within the earth’s atmosphere, “to shine upon the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014444/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 1:15</a>) And, on the fifth creative day, flying creatures, evidently including insects, were brought into existence. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014444/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 1:20-23</a>) Consequently questions arise as to how vegetation could have survived without light from the sun and without the aid of insect pollination. In this regard the operation of God’s spirit cannot be overlooked. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014444/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 1:2</a>) Also, there is no way of knowing just what conditions existed on the earth during the third creative “day” and what effect these conditions would have had on plant life. Experiments conducted in relatively recent years suggest the possibility that light is not an absolute necessity for photosynthesis to take place in plants. (<em>Science News Letter,</em> August 25, 1962, article <span id="page1631" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1631" data-before-text="1631"></span>on “Lightless Photosynthesis”) Noteworthy, too, is the fact that the process of photosynthesis is still only vaguely understood. As to pollination, even today this is not accomplished by insects alone. Many plants are self-fertilized or are pollinated by the wind. At times water serves as an agent in pollination. And, again, we must recognize our lack of knowledge as to the exact conditions prevailing on earth during the third creative “day” and the propagation of vegetation in that period.—See the book <em>Is the Bible Really the Word of God?,</em> pages 23-25.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">God gave green vegetation to man and the animals as part of their original food supply, later expanding mankind’s diet to include meat from which the blood had been drained.

<strong>Accepting the Invitation to the Banquet</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> In order to lift the condemnation of sin from mankind and remove its penalty death Jehovah God had his Son die sacrificially on earth as the perfect man Jesus Christ. He died childless, thus sacrificing even his right to become father to a perfect human race on earth. Long ago miraculous food sustained the life of his earthly nation for forty years when they traveled through a wilderness. Hence Jesus compared his <span id="page244" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="244" data-before-text="244"></span>perfect sacrifice to such food. He said: “I am the bread of life. . . . I am the living bread that came down from heaven; if anyone eats of this bread he will live forever; and, for a fact, the bread that I shall give is my flesh in behalf of the life of the world.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965283/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 6:48-51</a>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 5.

They have to accept God’s reigning Son, Jesus Christ, as their King, and they have to give him unwavering loyalty and obedience. They must do this by faith.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 6. (a) Why would feeding on the “bread of life” be, in itself, a banquet?

What banquet on earth today, no matter how rich in many dishes, gives the banqueters everlasting life? But those who bow to God’s kingdom in the hands of his Son will do more than eat by means of faith. They will literally eat enjoyable earthly food to sustain that life forevermore in peace, health and happiness. Isaiah’s prophecy of a banquet has a literal aspect to it and not wholly a spiritual aspect. The loyal and obedient peoples will literally eat dishes well-oiled, “filled with marrow,” as it were, to sustain the heart and make the face shine. They will drink wine, well aged on the dregs and filtered, to make their hearts glad. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965283/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 104:14, 15</a>) There will be no ill effects.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 7.

In the prophetic psalm regarding King Solomon it is written: “He will descend like the rain upon the mown grass, like copious showers that wet the earth. In his days the righteous one will sprout, and the abundance of peace until the moon is no more. And he will have subjects from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth. There will come to be plenty of grain on the earth; on the top of the mountains there will be an overflow. His fruit will be as in Lebanon, and those who are from the city will blossom like the vegetation of the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965283/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 72:6-8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965283/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 16</a>) Such a period of plenty marked the reign of King Solomon, but Jesus Christ, who was foreshadowed by Solomon, is greater than Solomon.

There was no want of food in the earthly Paradise in which God placed the first man and woman in their perfect, sinless condition. Under Christ’s kingdom, which reigns on the heavenly Mount Zion, that Paradise will be restored and extended to the limits of the earth. Thus it will not be too small for <em>all</em> mankind to live in. So there was a wonderful meaning to the words of the dying Jesus Christ, when he said to the sympathetic man who was impaled on a stake beside him on that darksome day of Nisan 14, 33 C.E.: “Truly I tell you today, You will be with me in Paradise.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965283/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 23:43</a>, <em>NW; Ro.</em></p>

But one day, after teaching the people, he fed the crowd of more than five thousand, and on another day his audience of more than four thousand, by miraculously multiplying a few bread loaves and fishes. Because Jesus Christ had this power to feed the people miraculously, many of them wanted to take him and make him their earthly king.

From oppression and from violence he will redeem their soul, and their blood will be precious in his eyes.

This will feed them and strengthen them to gain everlasting life in God’s new world; and never will they be corrupted by material abundance so as to make their bellies their god.

<strong>What Does Righteous Rule Mean to You?</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Truly, righteous rule and its accompanying blessings should give rise to deep gratitude, the kind of appreciation described in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979602/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Psalm 72:17</a>: “Let his name prove to be to time indefinite; before the sun let his name have increase, and by means of him let them bless themselves; let all nations pronounce him happy.” The name of a king who rules in righteousness deserves to continue for time indefinite. In the case of Solomon, the psalmist’s words express the wish that his dynasty continue and flourish. For the name to “have increase” would point to the king’s having offspring to continue the dynasty. And for the people to bless themselves by the name of the king would mean to mention him in wishing like blessings on others. That people of other nations must have pronounced Solomon happy is evident from the expression made by the queen of Sheba: “Happy are your men; happy are these servants of yours who are standing before you constantly, listening to your wisdom!”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979602/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">1 Ki. 10:8</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The words of the psalmist are grandly fulfilled in Jesus Christ to whom Jehovah God gave “the name that is above every other name.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979602/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Phil. 2:9</a>) Being the immortal Son of God, he needs no successors.

<strong>Amen</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In the Hebrew Scriptures the word is used as a solemn expression to obligate oneself legally to an oath or covenant and its consequences (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Nu 5:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> De 27:15-26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Ne 5:13</a>), also as a solemn expression to subscribe to an expressed prayer (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Ch 16:36</a>), to an expression of praise (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ne 8:6</a>), or to an expressed purpose (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1Ki 1:36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Jer 11:5</a>). Each of the first four books, or collections, of the Psalms concludes with this expression, perhaps indicating that it was customary for the congregation of Israel to join in at the end of the song or psalm with an “Amen.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps 41:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 72:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 89:52;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/4/3" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 106:48</a>.</p>

<strong>Ambassador</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Unlike modern-day ambassadors, ancient envoys or messengers, since they did not reside in foreign <span id="page64" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="64" data-before-text="64"></span>capitals, were dispatched only on special occasions for specific purposes. Often they were persons of rank (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:17, 18</a>) and their office was highly respected. Consequently, they were accorded inviolability of person when they visited other rulers.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The treatment accorded a ruler’s messengers or envoys was considered as done toward the ruler and his government. Thus, when Rahab showed favor to the messengers sent as spies to Jericho by Joshua, she really was acting as she did because she recognized that Jehovah was the God and King of Israel. Jehovah, through Joshua showed her favor accordingly. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Josh. 6:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Heb. 11:31</a>) A flagrant violation of the unwritten international custom of respect toward envoys was the action of Hanun the king of Ammon, to whom King David sent some servants in a gesture of friendship. The king of Ammon listened to his princes, who falsely called the messengers spies, and publicly humiliated them, demonstrating his disrespect for David and his government. This disgraceful action led to war.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Sam. 10:2–11:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 12:26-31</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Opposite to the modern-day practice of recalling an ambassador when diplomatic relations are broken with a government, the people of ancient times sent messengers or envoys as spokesmen to one another during times of strain in an effort to reestablish peaceful relations. Isaiah speaks of such “messengers of peace.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isa. 33:7</a>) Hezekiah sent a peace appeal to Sennacherib the king of Assyria. Although Sennacherib was threatening the fortified cities of Judah, the messengers were given freedom of passage by the Assyrians because they were acting as Hezekiah’s envoys. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:13-15</a>) Another example of this can be seen in the record about Jephthah, a judge in Israel. He dispatched messengers with a letter of remonstration against wrong action on the part of the king of the Ammonites and to clear up a dispute over territorial rights. If possible, Jephthah, through his envoys, would have settled the matter without war. These messengers were permitted to pass back and forth between the armies without hindrance.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Judg. 11:12-28</a>; see MESSENGER.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"></p>

<strong>What Does Righteous Rule Mean to You?</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the 72nd <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979602/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 72</a>, evidently written by David (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979602/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps 72 verse 20</a>), we find the description of a rulership that will accomplish this. It is the kingdom of God by Jesus Christ. A foregleam of this rulership was provided by the peaceful and prosperous reign of King Solomon during the period of his remaining a faithful servant of Jehovah God. Pointing forward to the initial fulfillment, the <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979602/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">superscription of Psalm 72</a> says, “Regarding Solomon.”</p>
