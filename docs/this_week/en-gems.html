<strong>Moab</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Unlike Mesha’s propagandistic inscription, the Scriptures report that the Moabites suffered humiliating defeat. Enlisting the aid of King Jehoshaphat of Judah and the king of Edom in putting down the Moabite revolt, Jehoram (who became king of Israel about two years after Ahab’s death) marched against Moab from the S, by way of the wilderness of Edom. But the allied armies and their animals almost perished for lack of water. The prophet Elisha’s aid was then sought and, in fulfillment of his prophecy that Jehovah would help on account of Jehoshaphat, the torrent valley became filled with water. The next morning the reflection of the sun upon the water made it look like blood to the Moabites. Wrongly concluding that the allied armies had slaughtered one another, the Moabites abandoned all caution and came to the Israelite camp, only to be put to flight. As the <span id="page1171" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1171" data-before-text="1171"></span>battle progressed Moabite cities were ruined, good tracts of land were filled with stones, trees were cut down and springs were stopped up. When King Mesha found himself penned up in the city of Kir-hareseth with the battle going against him, he, with seven hundred men, unsuccessfully tried to break through to the king of Edom. Finally he took his firstborn son and offered him up as a burnt sacrifice upon the wall. For this or some other reason there “came to be great indignation against Israel” and the siege was abandoned.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">2 Ki. 3:6-27</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">As this humiliating defeat did not take place on foreign soil but brought devastation to the land of Moab, reasonably a considerable period of time would have been required for recovery.

But at Ezra’s admonition they dismissed these wives and their children (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Ezra 9:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/59/1" data-bid="60-2" class="b"> 10:10, 11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/59/2" data-bid="60-3" class="b"> 44</a>) Nehemiah found a similar situation, many Israelites having taken Moabite wives.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/60/0" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Neh. 13:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/60/1" data-bid="61-2" class="b"> 23</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="ss"><strong>MOAB IN PROPHECY</strong></p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">In harmony with its long history of opposition to Israel, Moab is mentioned among the hard-set enemies of Jehovah’s people. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:14</a>.) Condemned for reproaching Israel and for pride and haughtiness, Moab was finally to become a desolation like Sodom. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/62/0" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Zeph. 2:8-11</a>; see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/63/0" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Jeremiah 48:29</a>.) Already at the close of the ninth century B.C.E. Amos wrote that Moab would suffer calamity for “burning the bones of the king of Edom for lime.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Amos 2:1-3</a>) While some take this to mean that <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/65/0" data-bid="66-1" class="b">2 Kings 3:26, 27</a> refers to King Mesha’s offering up, not his own son, but the firstborn of the king of Edom, this is an unlikely inference. One Jewish tradition, though, does link the event mentioned by Amos with the war waged against Mesha and claims that sometime after this conflict the Moabites dug up the bones of the king of Edom and then burned them for lime. But the Bible record provides no basis for determining the time involved.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/66/0" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Isaiah (chaps. 15 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/66/1" data-bid="67-2" class="b"> 16</a>), apparently around the time of King Ahaz’s death and while Assyria dominated in the eighth century B.C.E., referred to one Moabite city after another as being in line for calamity. He concluded with the words: “And now Jehovah has spoken, saying: ‘Within three years, according to the years of a hired laborer, the glory of Moab must also be disgraced with much commotion of every sort, and those who remain over will be a trifling few, not mighty.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/67/0" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Isa. 16:14</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">From historical records the fulfillment of the prophecies of Isaiah and Amos cannot be placed precisely in the stream of time. However, there is evidence that Moab did come under the Assyrian yoke. Assyrian King Tiglath-pileser III mentions Salamanu of Moab among those paying tribute to him. Sennacherib claims to have received tribute from Kammusunadbi the king of Moab. And Assyrian monarchs Esar-haddon and Ashurbanipal refer to Moabite Kings Musuri and Kamashaltu as being subject to them. There is also archaeological evidence that many places in Moab were depopulated about the eighth century B.C.E.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">Jeremiah’s prophecy of the seventh century B.C.E. pointed to the time when Jehovah would hold an accounting against Moab (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/68/0" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Jer. 9:25, 26</a>), doing so by means of the Babylonians under King Nebuchadnezzar. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/69/0" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Jer. 25:8, 9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/69/1" data-bid="70-2" class="b"> 17-21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/69/2" data-bid="70-3" class="b"> 27:1-7</a>) Numerous Moabite cities were to be reduced to a desolation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/70/0" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Jer. chap. 48</a>) Apparently when Judah experienced the execution of Jehovah’s judgment by means of the Babylonians, the Moabites said: “Look! The house of Judah is like all the other nations.” For thus failing to recognize that the judgment was really God’s and that the inhabitants of Judah were his people, the Moabites were to experience disaster and thereby ‘come to know Jehovah.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/71/0" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Ezek. 25:8-11</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/72/0" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Ezekiel 24:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">The Jewish historian Josephus writes that, in the fifth year after desolating Jerusalem, Nebuchadnezzar returned to war against Coelesyria, Ammon and Moab and thereafter attacked Egypt. (<em>Antiquities of the Jews,</em> Book X, chap. IX, par. 7) Regarding archaeological confirmation of the desolation of Moab, <em>The Interpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible</em> (Vol. 3, p. 418) observes: “Archaeological exploration has shown that Moab was largely depopulated from <em>ca.</em> the beginning of the sixth century, and in many sites from <em>ca.</em> the eighth century. From the sixth century on, nomads wandered through the land until political and economic factors made sedentary life possible again in the last centuries B.C.”—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/73/0" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Ezekiel 25:8-11</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">Later, in fulfillment of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/74/0" data-bid="75-1" class="b">Jeremiah 48:47</a>, Cyrus, the conqueror of Babylon, likely permitted Moabite exiles to return to their homeland.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">The accurate fulfillment of the prophecies concerning Moab cannot be denied. Centuries ago the Moabites ceased to exist as a people. Today what are considered to have been such Moabite cities as Nebo, Heshbon, Aroer, Beth-gamul and Baal-meon are represented by ruins. Many other places are now unknown.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">The sole explanation for the disappearance of the Moabites as a people is provided by the Bible. Noted the <em>Encyclopædia Britannica</em> (11th ed., Vol. XVIII, p. 632): “Israel remained a great power in religious history while Moab disappeared. It is true that Moab was continuously hard pressed by desert hordes; the exposed condition of the land is emphasized by the chains of ruined forts and castles which even the Romans were compelled to construct. The explanation of the comparative insignificance of Moab, however, is not to be found in purely topographical considerations. Nor can it be sought in political history, since Israel and Judah suffered as much from external movements as Moab itself. The explanation is to be found within Israel itself, in factors . . . to be found in the work of the prophets.”</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">In view of the disappearance of the Moabites as a people, the inclusion of Moab at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/75/0" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Daniel 11:41</a> among nations in the “time of the end” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/76/0" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Dan. 11:40</a>) is logically to be regarded in a figurative sense. Seemingly the Moabites represent hard-set enemies of spiritual Israel.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb"></p>

A confederation of tribes from the east, inhabiting Moab, Ammon and Seir, were reported to be heading for Judah “from the region of the sea, from Edom; and there they are in Hazazon-tamar, that is to say, En-gedi.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981766/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Chron. 20:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981766/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 10, 11</a>) When we look at our map, En-gedi already is familiar to us, and we can soon find Moab, Ammon and Edom.

Our map identifies <span id="page14" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>those of Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, Beth-zur, Hebron and Ziph as protecting the eastern flank of Judah.

They may have come around the southern end of the Dead Sea. Or they may have marched over the low Lisan peninsula, crossing the Dead Sea at its narrowest point (about two miles [3 km]), by an ancient and shallow ford that some scholars say existed. Then, passing the great rock of Masada, they reached En-gedi before they were spotted, perhaps by a scout from one of the forts above.</p>

Jehovah destroyed the organized forces of Moab, Ammon and Mount Seir with one blow, by causing these wicked opposers of God’s people to be instruments of destruction to one another.

Hezekiah was king. The record states: “He wrought that which was good and right and faithful before Jehovah his God. And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered. After these things, and this faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, and thought to win them for himself.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952726/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">2 Chron. 31:20, 21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952726/31/1" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 32:1</a>, <em>AS</em>) Hezekiah prepared the best he could to withstand this terrible enemy, but his trust was the name of Jehovah. He spoke to the captains, saying, “Be strong and of good courage, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him; for there is a greater with us than with him: with him is an arm of flesh; but with us is Jehovah our God to help us, and to fight our battles.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952726/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:7, 8</a>, <em>AS</em>) The believing, trusting confidence of Hezekiah had raised him above the enemy.

Hence, righteousness could not be counted to Abraham due to his being circumcised in the flesh; it was counted to him because of his faith in Jehovah, who was revealing part of his purpose to Abraham. So Abraham was counted righteous before God; he was thus justified to friendship with Jehovah God. Centuries later King Jehoshaphat of Jerusalem called Abraham the friend or “lover” of Jehovah. Still later, through the prophet Isaiah, Jehovah spoke of him as “Abraham my friend.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974037/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 20:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974037/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Isaiah 41:8</a>) This proves how valuable, how vital, faith in Jehovah in connection with his “seed” really is.</p>

Realizing that his army of five hundred and eighty thousand sanctified warriors was no physical match for the army of a million Ethiopians with three hundred chariots under Zerah the Ethiopian, Asa prayed fervently: “Jehovah, there is none besides thee to help, between the mighty and him that hath no strength: help us, O Jehovah our God; for we rely on thee, and in thy name are we come against this multitude. O Jehovah, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.” In answer to that supplication man did not prevail, not even a million men. As it is written: “So Jehovah smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled. And . . . there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before Jehovah, and before his host.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954847/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">2 Chron. 14:9-14</a>, <em>AS</em>) This record was written aforetime for our learning; and what a grand illustration it is of how prayer aids to victory!

We are facing the universal war of Armageddon. That will be the most violent and disastrous fight of all human experience. But we shall not need to take part in the violence of that time. From the ancient prophetic pictures of Armageddon come the words of Jehovah to us: “The battle is not yours, but God’s.” “Stand firm and see the salvation of Jehovah, which he will perform for you today. . . . Jehovah will himself fight for you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954847/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">2 Chron. 20:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954847/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Ex. 14:13, 14</a>, <em>NW</em>) Those words are a prohibition against our then dropping our spiritual armor and taking up carnal weapons and relying upon their use for or against anyone on earth at the battle of Armageddon.

Realizing that his army of five hundred and eighty thousand sanctified warriors was no physical match for the army of a million Ethiopians with three hundred chariots under Zerah the Ethiopian, Asa prayed fervently: “Jehovah, there is none besides thee to help, between the mighty and him that hath no strength: help us, O Jehovah our God; for we rely on thee, and in thy name are we come against this multitude.

What a climb, with many ups and downs as the route crossed smaller wadis and tributary streambeds! Hot and tired, the enemy probably hoped to rest unseen near the top. But not a chance! They were discovered and ambushed. What confusion set in as they wondered where the ambush came from, not realizing that Jehovah was assisting Judah! As the hills rang with Judean shouts of praise, the invaders thought their own allies were to blame. Disagreements broke out, and they started fighting one another until the entire army was routed and destroyed.

<strong>Jehovah Defends Jehoshaphat</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The nations nearby were afraid to attack Judah because they knew that Jehovah was with his people. They even brought gifts to King Jehoshaphat. But then the Moabites, the Ammonites, and those from the region of Seir came to fight Judah. Jehoshaphat knew that he needed Jehovah’s help. He had all the men, women, and children come together in Jerusalem. In front of them all, he prayed: ‘Jehovah, without you, we cannot win. Please tell us what to do.’</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jehovah answered the prayer: ‘Do not be afraid. I will help you. Take your position, stand still, and see how I will save you.’ How did Jehovah save them?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The next morning, Jehoshaphat selected singers and told them to march in front of the army. They marched from Jerusalem out to the battlefield in a place called Tekoa.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">As the singers were praising Jehovah joyfully with a loud voice, Jehovah fought for his people. He made the Ammonites and the Moabites so confused that they began to attack one another, and not one of them survived. But Jehovah protected the people of Judah, the soldiers, and the priests. All the people in the nearby countries heard about what Jehovah had done, and they knew that Jehovah was still defending his people. How does Jehovah save his people? In many ways. He doesn’t need help from humans to do so.</p>

They were to take the initiative in coping with the enemy’s challenge. The king and ‘all those of Judah, even their little ones, their wives and their sons,’ expressed strong faith as they obediently rose early in the morning and marched out to meet the invading hordes. On the way, the king continued to provide theocratic instruction and encouragement, urging them: “Put faith in Jehovah your God that you may prove yourselves of long duration. Put faith in his prophets and so prove successful.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998327/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 20:20</a>) Faith in Jehovah!

Obediently, the people “proceeded to rise early in the morning and go out to the wilderness of Tekoa.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984484/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 20:20</a>) They were keen to show their faith by works. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984484/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">James 2:14</a>.) Likewise, God’s ministers today often need to be early on the job. Housewife pioneers and others have to arise early to take care of household chores so that they can devote a full morning to Jehovah’s service. There are people out there in Satan’s world who are ‘sighing and crying,’ and who must be marked for salvation through the “great tribulation.” Jehovah’s Witnesses are determined to find them.​—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984484/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ezekiel 9:4</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>Forward to the Battle!</strong></p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">15.

Put faith in Jehovah your God that you may prove yourselves of long duration. Put faith in his prophets and so prove successful.’” Similarly, the head of the Christian congregation, our now-reigning King, has given his people much encouragement to faithfulness. We find it in passages such as the following: <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984484/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Matthew 10:27, 28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984484/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 24:9-13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984484/30/2" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> John 16:33</a>.

This is the way to sure success​—to be attained by all dedicated, baptized Witnesses who exercise faith in Jehovah and his arrangements.

<strong>Hold Fast Your Joy!</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> There are some who, after receiving <span id="page112" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="112" data-before-text="112"></span>the word with joy and entering upon the real life, will even permit the “pleasures of this life” to crowd out the superior joys of study, service and association in Jehovah’s New World society. After a hard day’s work it is very easy to be self-pitying, and to think, “I’m too tired for study, too tired for meetings, too tired for service.” So relaxation is sought elsewhere. A bad habit takes root and grows. In actual fact, spiritual refreshment is the best cure for all kinds of weariness. This refreshment is always to be found, with satisfying joy, in the study of God’s Word and the association of his people. Avoid the lazy ways of the old world. On days set apart for God’s service, be like the faithful Judeans under Jehoshaphat, who “proceeded to rise early in the morning and go out.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Chron. 20:20-22</a>) Never let pleasures crowd in on your life to the extent that they crowd out planned theocratic study, service and association. Remember that part of the sign of “the last days” is that men will be “lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 4</a>) Be a lover of God.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">11.

At such times we must keep close to Jehovah in prayer, confident that he will sustain us through our trials. Keep up association in the New World society and, above all, <em>regular weekly</em> service to Jehovah. God’s service is like strengthening food. As Jesus said: “My food is for me to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">John 4:34</a>) Be determined to finish Jehovah’s work in integrity! In field service it often happens that Jehovah provides just the comfort and encouragement we need, through some thrilling experience, or other outstanding blessing, and then with strengthened faith we can see the path to take. “Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding. In all your ways take notice of him, and he himself will make your paths straight.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Prov. 3:5, 6</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">12.

At such time the overseer or other mature minister in the congregation must be quick to help the new “sheep” rekindle his first joy in the truth. At the very first sign of difficulty make a friendly call and help to set the problem straight Scripturally. Continue this help, lovingly and with tender affection, so that the one receiving help “may finally stand complete and with firm conviction in all the will of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Col. 4:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 1 Thess. 2:7, 8</a>) Show determination to hold on to the sheep. Patiently tend the spiritually weak, for they will respond to loving shepherding. If they are sick physically, help them to take part in incidental witnessing, so that they may maintain a healthy disposition and be blessed by Jehovah. There are many who are strong and active today in Jehovah’s work, some of them pioneer ministers, but who would have been lost to the New World society had not prompt help been given in time of trial. There is great “joy in heaven” whenever a straying sheep is brought back to the fold!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Luke 15:4-7</a>.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">13.

<strong>Priests with the Theocratic Army</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[19]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Next morning they obediently did go out of the city’s protective walls and march to meet the oncoming foe. But how? The two silver trumpets in the priests’ hands did not go along to sound an alarm. There was to be no infantry charge with shouting against Moab, Ammon and Mount Seir. They did not need to fight in this battle; it was a holy battle; it was not their battle, but God’s. As they went out, King Jehoshʹaphat, as the chief officer of the army, <span id="page695" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="695" data-before-text="695"></span>stood up and exhorted the marchers in obedience to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954844/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 20:5-9</a>, saying: “Believe in Jehovah your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets [such as Jahaziʹel], so shall ye prosper.” At the same time, to strengthen their belief and confidence in Jehovah, King Jehoshʹaphat stationed Jahaziʹel and his fellow Levite singers in their holy array at the very head of the marching column. Instead of a shout following a trumpet alarm, these holy Levites marched forward, singing: “Give thanks unto Jehovah; for his loving-kindness endureth for ever.” King Jehoshʹaphat and the army followed, taking a secondary position. This emphasis on the holiness of the war was not misplaced, for we read: “And when they began to sing and to praise, Jehovah set liers-in-wait against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, that were come against Judah; and they were smitten. For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.” Arriving at the watchtower in the wilderness, the theocratic procession came in view of the slaughter that had occurred.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="qu"> 9.

After three days of this they assembled at the valley of Berʹacah and blessed Jehovah, and then to sacred music they returned to Jerusalem and its temple, rejoicing, “for Jehovah had made them to rejoice over their enemies.” What was the result of Jehovah’s holy battle against the ungodly aggressors? The Record answers: “And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the countries, when they heard that Jehovah fought against the enemies of Israel.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954844/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Chron. 20:1-29</a>, <em>AS</em>) The ancient world was given to know that Jehovah is no pacifist but is a fighter, a fighter who always wins and who is therefore to be feared. Woe to the fighters against God; they are in a losing fight! But not so those who are fighting Jehovah’s battles. These are the ones who give themselves wholly to the Christian theocratic warfare. Exclusively for this warfare they are sanctified, because it is holy, it being authorized by the Holy One of the universe and backed up by him with victory in view.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"></p>

Well, then, we need to watch all the time against forgetting his mighty acts and loving-kindness toward his nation and at last becoming complainers, selfishly ambitious, immorally unclean, desirous of the things of this world, fearful of world powers, idolizing our own wills and opinions, rebellious, neglectful of our responsibilities inside or under the theocratic organization. Having been delivered from this Babylonish world, we can never return to its sins and at the same time share the further prosperity of God’s instructed people. For us to remember it was written, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952885/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Job 36:10, 11</a> (<em>AS</em>): “He openeth also their ear to instruction, and commandeth that they return from iniquity. If they hearken and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.” Our own spiritual welfare dictates that we seek always the welfare of God’s organization, praying for its integrity: “Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee. Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces. For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee.

As we continue marching forth toward the final battle, singing Jehovah’s praises, we must display faith in his prophecies for our future. They are inspiring prophecies.

When the restored nation of Israel was rebuilding the house of Jehovah their God, they were greatly helped forward by his prophets whose writings we have today, and concerning which it is written: “The elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952885/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ezra 6:14</a>) We, too, are busy in a rebuilding work respecting the pure worship of the living and true God. It is wisdom on our part to hearken to God’s prophets speaking to us through his Word. It is necessary therefore for us to study the prophecies privately and go where we can hear them discussed, at meetings in our Kingdom Halls or in our circuit, district, national and international assemblies. If we take heed, then it assures our continuing to prosper in divine service.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">22.

It was “when the morning arose” that the angels hurried Lot and his wife and daughters out of Sodom to escape the deluge of fire and sulphur upon the corrupt city. When the Egyptian forces were driving through the Red sea after the fleeing Israelites, it was at the morning watch or watch of daybreak that Jehovah looked through the pillar of fire and the cloud and began troubling the pursuers.

When the Assyrian hordes under the Assyrian conqueror Sennacherib menaced the life and independence of Jerusalem, Jehovah’s angel stole through the night and killed 185,000 in the invading army. When King Hezekiah and his besieged people rose “early in the morning”, it was to learn that all those thousands of the enemy had been mowed down and the aggressor was in disgraceful retreat back to Assyria.

Actually it is against Jehovah’s kingdom and against his ambassadors on earth, Jehovah’s witnesses, that the nations are raging. They are now militarized as never before over the supreme issue of world domination. Their determination is either to divide domination between two national blocs of opposed ideologies or to have one bloc as victor hog the whole domination. There is no idea of letting God have it as the Creator and Universal Sovereign. They have their own charter of the United Nations; they have their own treaties of alliance within the framework of the United Nations. They have no regard for the unchangeable covenant which God made with his Son Jesus Christ for the absolute government of the righteous new world. So prayers by their religious clergy for His kingdom are sheer hypocrisy and are for God to adopt the political governments of selfish, ambitious men as his kingdom. By their own militarization and the emergency measures which they take the nations are pressed into opposing the good news of God’s kingdom which his witnesses proclaim world-wide.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Rev. 11:15-18</a>.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">16.

From a peacetime economy they change to a militant arrangement against God’s incoming kingdom. They are mobilized for defending their national sovereignty against him. They are being speeded by unseen demon influences to take their battle positions at Armageddon to preserve their own way of life, not God’s way. Challenging the divine power, they assault the organization, the neutral position, the missionary activities and the message of Jehovah’s witnesses, not believing that his organized people have a living God who sees, who cares and who can act.</p>

They were to take the initiative in coping with the enemy’s challenge. The king and ‘all those of Judah, even their little ones, their wives and their sons,’ expressed strong faith as they obediently rose early in the morning and marched out to meet the invading hordes. On the way, the king continued to provide theocratic instruction and encouragement, urging them: “Put faith in Jehovah your God that you may prove yourselves of long duration.

After a hard day’s work it is very easy to be self-pitying, and to think, “I’m too tired for study, too tired for meetings, too tired for service.” So relaxation is sought elsewhere. A bad habit takes root and grows. In actual fact, spiritual refreshment is the best cure for all kinds of weariness. This refreshment is always to be found, with satisfying joy, in the study of God’s Word and the association of his people. Avoid the lazy ways of the old world. On days set apart for God’s service, be like the faithful Judeans under Jehoshaphat, who “proceeded to rise early in the morning and go out.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Chron. 20:20-22</a>) Never let pleasures crowd in on your life to the extent that they crowd out planned theocratic study, service and association.

At such times we must keep close to Jehovah in prayer, confident that he will sustain us through our trials. Keep up association in the New World society and, above all, <em>regular weekly</em> service to Jehovah. God’s service is like strengthening food. As Jesus said: “My food is for me to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">John 4:34</a>) Be determined to finish Jehovah’s work in integrity! In field service it often happens that Jehovah provides just the comfort and encouragement we need, through some thrilling experience, or other outstanding blessing, and then with strengthened faith we can see the path to take. “Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding. In all your ways take notice of him, and he himself will make your paths straight.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Prov. 3:5, 6</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">12.

At such time the overseer or other mature minister in the congregation must be quick to help the new “sheep” rekindle his first joy in the truth. At the very first sign of difficulty make a friendly call and help to set the problem straight Scripturally. Continue this help, lovingly and with tender affection, so that the one receiving help “may finally stand complete and with firm conviction in all the will of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Col. 4:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 1 Thess. 2:7, 8</a>) Show determination to hold on to the sheep. Patiently tend the spiritually weak, for they will respond to loving shepherding. If they are sick physically, help them to take part in incidental witnessing, so that they may maintain a healthy disposition and be blessed by Jehovah. There are many who are strong and active today in Jehovah’s work, some of them pioneer ministers, but who would have been lost to the New World society had not prompt help been given in time of trial.

But how? The two silver trumpets in the priests’ hands did not go along to sound an alarm. There was to be no infantry charge with shouting against Moab, Ammon and Mount Seir. They did not need to fight in this battle; it was a holy battle; it was not their battle, but God’s. As they went out, King Jehoshʹaphat, as the chief officer of the army, <span id="page695" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="695" data-before-text="695"></span>stood up and exhorted the marchers in obedience to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954844/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 20:5-9</a>, saying: “Believe in Jehovah your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets [such as Jahaziʹel], so shall ye prosper.” At the same time, to strengthen their belief and confidence in Jehovah, King Jehoshʹaphat stationed Jahaziʹel and his fellow Levite singers in their holy array at the very head of the marching column. Instead of a shout following a trumpet alarm, these holy Levites marched forward, singing: “Give thanks unto Jehovah; for his loving-kindness endureth for ever.” King Jehoshʹaphat and the army followed, taking a secondary position. This emphasis on the holiness of the war was not misplaced, for we read: “And when they began to sing and to praise, Jehovah set liers-in-wait against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, that were come against Judah; and they were smitten. For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.” Arriving at the watchtower in the wilderness, the theocratic procession came in view of the slaughter that had occurred.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="qu"> 9.

After three days of this they assembled at the valley of Berʹacah and blessed Jehovah, and then to sacred music they returned to Jerusalem and its temple, rejoicing, “for Jehovah had made them to rejoice over their enemies.” What was the result of Jehovah’s holy battle against the ungodly aggressors? The Record answers: “And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the countries, when they heard that Jehovah fought against the enemies of Israel.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954844/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Chron. 20:1-29</a>, <em>AS</em>) The ancient world was given to know that Jehovah is no pacifist but is a fighter, a fighter who always wins and who is therefore to be feared. Woe to the fighters against God; they are in a losing fight! But not so those who are fighting Jehovah’s battles. These are the ones who give themselves wholly to the Christian theocratic warfare.

Well, then, we need to watch all the time against forgetting his mighty acts and loving-kindness toward his nation and at last becoming complainers, selfishly ambitious, immorally unclean, desirous of the things of this world, fearful of world powers, idolizing our own wills and opinions, rebellious, neglectful of our responsibilities inside or under the theocratic organization. Having been delivered from this Babylonish world, we can never return to its sins and at the same time share the further prosperity of God’s instructed people. For us to remember it was written, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952885/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Job 36:10, 11</a> (<em>AS</em>): “He openeth also their ear to instruction, and commandeth that they return from iniquity. If they hearken and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.” Our own spiritual welfare dictates that we seek always the welfare of God’s organization, praying for its integrity: “Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee. Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces. For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee. For the sake of the house of Jehovah our God I will seek thy good.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952885/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 122:6-9</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">21.

When we face conditions and developments that threaten our prosperity as God’s people, we simply have to rely upon Jehovah’s strength, while we encourage ourselves to do so by remembering his marvelous deeds recorded in his Word, also his deeds toward us in fulfillment of his prophecies.

When the restored nation of Israel was rebuilding the house of Jehovah their God, they were greatly helped forward by his prophets whose writings we have today, and concerning which it is written: “The elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952885/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ezra 6:14</a>) We, too, are busy in a rebuilding work respecting the pure worship of the living and true God. It is wisdom on our part to hearken to God’s prophets speaking to us through his Word.

It was “when the morning arose” that the angels hurried Lot and his wife and daughters out of Sodom to escape the deluge of fire and sulphur upon the corrupt city. When the Egyptian forces were driving through the Red sea after the fleeing Israelites, it was at the morning watch or watch of daybreak that Jehovah looked through the pillar of fire and the cloud and began troubling the pursuers. Finally he collapsed the walls of sea water in upon them, “when the morning appeared.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. <span id="page186" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="186" data-before-text="186"></span>19:15-28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Ex. 14:24-31</a>) It was “early in the morning” that the people of Jerusalem rose according to the arrangement of King Jehoshaphat and they marched forth singing Jehovah’s praises; and when this singing began Jehovah confused the united armies of Moab, Ammon and Mount Seir and caused them to annihilate one another. When the Assyrian hordes under the Assyrian conqueror Sennacherib menaced the life and independence of Jerusalem, Jehovah’s angel stole through the night and killed 185,000 in the invading army. When King Hezekiah and his besieged people rose “early in the morning”, it was to learn that all those thousands of the enemy had been mowed down and the aggressor was in disgraceful retreat back to Assyria. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Chron. 20:20-29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 19:35-37</a>) Also, it was “very early on the first day of the week”, or “when it was growing light”, that the great earthquake occurred and the stone was rolled away from the door of the tomb to indicate that the resurrection of Jesus Christ had taken place. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Mark 16:2 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Matt. 28:1</a>, <em>NW</em>) In every case deliverance was “right early”.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">14.

But his complete deliverance of them at the height of the battle of Armageddon will usher in a new day for them. It will be the early part or morning of eternal day for them. So shouts of joy are certain to come with this morning.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 30:5</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>THE HOSTILE FORCES DISSOLVED</strong></p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">15.

Actually it is against Jehovah’s kingdom and against his ambassadors on earth, Jehovah’s witnesses, that the nations are raging. They are now militarized as never before over the supreme issue of world domination. Their determination is either to divide domination between two national blocs of opposed ideologies or to have one bloc as victor hog the whole domination. There is no idea of letting God have it as the Creator and Universal Sovereign. They have their own charter of the United Nations; they have their own treaties of alliance within the framework of the United Nations. They have no regard for the unchangeable covenant which God made with his Son Jesus Christ for the absolute government of the righteous new world. So prayers by their religious clergy for His kingdom are sheer hypocrisy and are for God to adopt the political governments of selfish, ambitious men as his kingdom. By their own militarization and the emergency measures which they take the nations are pressed into opposing the good news of God’s kingdom which his witnesses proclaim world-wide.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Rev. 11:15-18</a>.</p>

<strong>Tarshish</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><strong>Trade Relations With Solomon.</strong> Phoenician trading with Tarshish is clearly borne out by the record of King Solomon’s time (some 13 centuries after the Flood), when maritime commerce also began to be engaged in by the nation of Israel. Solomon had a fleet of ships in the Red Sea area, manned in part by experienced seamen provided by Phoenician King Hiram of Tyre, and trafficking especially with the gold-rich land of Ophir. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004325/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1Ki 9:26-28</a>) Reference is thereafter made to “a fleet of ships of Tarshish” that Solomon had on the sea “along with Hiram’s fleet of ships,” and these ships are stated to have made voyages once every three years for the importation of gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004325/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1Ki 10:22</a>) It is generally <span id="page1067" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1067" data-before-text="1067"></span>believed that the term “ships of Tarshish” in course of time came to stand for a <em>type</em> of ship, as one lexicon puts it: “large, sea-going vessels, <em>fit</em> to ply to Tarshish.” (<em>A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament,</em> by Brown, Driver, and Briggs, 1980, p. 1077) In a similar way, the name Indiamen originally was derived from the name applied to large British ships engaged in trade with India and in time came to apply to ships of that type no matter what their origin or destination. Thus <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004325/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Kings 22:48</a> shows that King Jehoshaphat (936-911 B.C.E.) “made Tarshish ships to go <em>to Ophir</em> for gold.”</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The Chronicles account, however, states that Solomon’s ships used for the triannual voyages “were going to Tarshish” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004325/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2Ch 9:21</a>); also that Jehoshaphat’s ships were designed “to go to Tarshish” and, when wrecked, “did not retain strength to go to Tarshish.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004325/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2Ch 20:36, 37</a>) This would indicate that Ophir was not the only port of call of the Israelite “ships of Tarshish,” but that they also navigated Mediterranean waters. This, of course, poses a problem, since the launching site of at least some of these vessels is shown to have been Ezion-geber on the Gulf of ʽAqaba. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004325/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1Ki 9:26</a>) For the ships to reach the Mediterranean Sea, they would either have to traverse a canal from the Red Sea to the Nile River and then into the Mediterranean or else circumnavigate the continent of Africa. While it is by no means possible to determine now the details of navigational routes (including canals) available or employed in Solomon’s and in Jehoshaphat’s time, there is likewise no need to view the record of their maritime projects as unfeasible.</p>

<strong>Ezion-geber</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The next mention of Ezion-geber comes over four hundred years later, in the reign of Solomon (1037-997 B.C.E.). At this location on the gulf, Solomon had a fleet of ships constructed and launched, manned by a Phoenician-Judean crew. Phoenician King Hiram of Tyre, also very active in the shipping business, cooperated with Solomon in this enterprise. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011431/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Ki. 9:26-28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011431/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 10:11</a>) About a century later King Jehoshaphat (936-911 B.C.E.) endeavored to revive this shipping industry based at Ezion-geber, but failed, as <span id="page556" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="556" data-before-text="556"></span>Jehovah had foretold, his ships being wrecked.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011431/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Ki. 22:48, 49;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011431/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 20:36, 37</a>; see AQABAH, GULF OF.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">It may be noted that both in Solomon’s case and in that of Jehoshaphat some of the ships were intended to go, not only to Ophir, but also to Tarshish.

As to this, see the article on TARSHISH, where, as one possibility, historical testimony to the existence of a Nile-Red Sea canal is presented. Such a canal might also explain how King Hiram could send not only men but “ships” to Ezion-geber and Eloth (Elath) for Solomon’s use. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011431/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Chron. 8:17, 18</a>) On the other hand, the suggestion is also made that these ships may have been sent to a point on the Philistine coast, dismantled and transported overland to the Gulf of Aqabah, where they were reconstructed. Those holding this view point out that the Crusaders later used a similar method. Whether by some Nile-Red Sea canal or by an overland route, it seems likely that at least timber was supplied from forest lands elsewhere, since the region around Ezion-geber has palm groves but no trees suitable for ship construction.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>LOCATION</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Just where ancient Ezion-geber stood cannot be determined with certainty. Most current geographers accept Tell el-Kheleifeh, some 550 yards (c. 503 meters) from the Gulf of Aqabah and three miles (4.8 kilometers) NW of the modern village of Aqabah, as the most likely possibility. Excavations there have uncovered five major periods of occupation, the oldest conjectured to date back to Solomon’s time. However, the archaeologists found nothing that they would date beyond that period, hence nothing dating back to the time of the Exodus. For this reason some conclude that the Ezion-geber of Moses’ day was either at another point, or that, because the native buildings were simple structures of mud brick, the early settlement has dissolved into the earth, leaving no trace behind.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong><em>Storage depot</em></strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The excavators at Tell el-Kheleifeh found the remains of a massive city gate and also a structure that was confidently declared to be the center of a large copper-mining and smelting industry, attributing its operation to King Solomon. More recently it was acknowledged that this identification was incorrect and, while some copper smelting was evidently done in that area, archaeologists now hold that the building was undoubtedly a storage depot. Such a fortified depot would be convenient at this point where important sea and land trade routes intersected, to house the gold, precious stones, and almug wood from Ophir till their being transported by caravans to their point of destination.

Here were the ports of Eloth and Ezion-geber, through which gold and spices flowed into Palestine from Arabia, Africa and India, while land routes led back into the Sinai Peninsula, Palestine and Transjordan. Understandably, domination of the gulf and its straits in the S was of great economic importance. It, therefore, was a source of constant contention between the Israelites and the Edomites</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010323/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Kings 9:26</a> mention is made of a fleet of ships that Solomon made at Ezion-geber, located on the Gulf of Aqabah.

These and the sudden squalls that sweep down from the mountains on the sides of the gulf make navigation very hazardous. Yet, while Jehoshaphat’s ships could have been caught in the tricky winds of the gulf and swept upon the rocks that lie in the shallows, the Bible record shows that the disaster was actually due to Jehovah’s disapproval of the venture, so that ‘he broke down Jehoshaphat’s works.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010323/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Chron. 20:37</a>.</p>

They have imagined some wild and really gruesome things about it, such as widely scattered parts of human corpses whizzing through the air to join the other members to which they belonged in one body at death. The Bible presents no such frightful picture of the resurrection time, not even in the prophet Ezekiel’s vision of the valley of dry bones that Almighty God’s power brought together and clothed with living flesh again. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965041/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ezek. 37:1-10</a>) Far differently, by means of suitable symbols, the last book of the Bible gives us a picture of the earthly resurrection after the wicked powers in heaven and on earth have been chased away.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974362/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Chron. 21:12</a>) Later Elijah died, just as do all mankind. Neither he nor Moses was resurrected to everlasting life ahead of Christ, who is “the firstborn from the dead.” Jesus himself, while on earth, said: “No man has ascended into heaven.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974362/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Rev. 1:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974362/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> John 3:13</a>.</p>

<strong>Elijah</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">On being informed of the death of her Baal prophets, Queen Jezebel vows to have Elijah put to death. Elijah flees in fear some eighty-five miles (137 kilometers) southwestward to Beer-sheba, to the W of the lower Dead Sea. Leaving his attendant there, he goes still farther into the wilderness, praying to die. Here the angel of Jehovah appears to him, to prepare him for a long journey to the “mountain of the true God,” Horeb. Sustained for the forty-day journey by what he eats then, he makes the 200-mile (322-kilometer) journey. At Horeb Jehovah speaks to <span id="page508" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="508" data-before-text="508"></span>him after an awe-inspiring display of power in a wind, an earthquake and a fire. Unlike Baal, the false god of sky, storm, weather and vegetation, natural forces personalized and idolized, Jehovah is not in these manifestations, which are merely expressions of his active force, not Jehovah himself. Jehovah shows Elijah that he still has work to do as a prophet. He corrects Elijah’s thought that he is the lone worshiper of Jehovah in Israel by showing that he has seven thousand who have not bowed to Baal. He sends Elijah back to his assignment, naming three persons who are to be anointed or commissioned to do a work for Jehovah: Hazael as king over Syria, Jehu as king over Israel, and his own successor Elisha.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011275/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Ki. 19:1-18</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>APPOINTS ELISHA AS SUCCESSOR</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Elijah next travels toward the hometown of Elisha, Abel-meholah. Finding Elisha plowing a field, Elijah throws his official garment over him, indicating an appointing or anointing. Elisha follows Elijah closely from that time on as his attendant. He is doubtless with Elijah when another occasion arises to prophesy against Ahab. The greedy Baal-worshiping king has illegally seized a vineyard, the hereditary possession of Naboth the Jezreelite, by allowing his wife Jezebel to use false charges, false witnesses and unrighteous judges to have Naboth murdered. Elijah meets Ahab at the vineyard and tells Ahab that his blood will be licked up by the dogs at the same place where they had licked up the blood of Naboth. He also announces a similar fate for Jezebel.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011275/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Ki. 19:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011275/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 21:1-26</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">About three years later Ahab dies in battle. His war chariot is washed by the pool of Samaria and the dogs lick up his blood. Jezebel’s execution, however, awaits a time perhaps fourteen years later. Ahab was succeeded by his son Ahaziah. This king follows in his wicked father’s footsteps, for when he is injured in an accident he turns to the false god Baal-zebub the god of Ekron, to inquire regarding the outcome of his sickness. Elijah sends him Jehovah’s word that because of this he will positively die. When Ahaziah sends in succession three groups, each composed of a chief with fifty men to get Elijah, Elijah calls down fire from the heavens to annihilate the first two groups, but, on the plea of the third chief, goes back with him to pronounce the judgment against Ahaziah in person.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011275/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Ki. 22:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011275/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 37, 38;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011275/15/2" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 2 Ki. 1:1-17</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>ELISHA SUCCEEDS HIM</strong></p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">In harmony with Elijah’s action in appointing Elisha years earlier, the time comes when Elijah must transfer the mantle of this prophetic office to Elisha, who has been well trained. This takes place during the rule of Ahaziah’s successor, his brother Jehoram of Israel. At that time Elijah goes to Bethel, from there to Jericho and down to the Jordan, Elisha sticking close to him all the way. There Elisha is rewarded for his faithfulness by seeing a fiery war chariot and fiery horses and Elijah ascending toward the heavens in a windstorm. Elisha takes up Elijah’s official garment that had fallen off him, and “two parts” (like a firstborn son’s portion) in Elijah’s spirit, a spirit of courage and of being “absolutely jealous for Jehovah the God of armies,” come on him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011275/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Ki. 2:1-13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011275/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 1 Ki. 19:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011275/16/2" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 14</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011275/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Elijah does not die at this time, nor does he go into the invisible spiritual realm, but is transferred to another prophetic assignment. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011275/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">John 3:13</a>) This is shown by the fact that Elisha does not hold any period of mourning for his master. A number of years after his ascension in the windstorm Elijah is still alive and active as a prophet, this time to the king of Judah. Because of the wicked course taken by King Jehoram of Judah, Elijah writes him a letter expressing Jehovah’s condemnation, which is fulfilled shortly thereafter.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011275/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Chron. 21:12-15</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>MIRACLES</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Eight miracles are credited to Elijah in the Bible account. They are: (1) shutting heaven from rainfall, (2) keeping the flour and oil supply of the widow of Zarephath renewed, (3) resurrecting the widow’s son, (4) having fire fall from heaven in answer to prayer, (5) having rain break the drought in answer to prayer, (6) calling down fire on King Ahaziah’s captain and his fifty men, (7) calling down fire on a second captain and his fifty and (8) parting the Jordan River by smiting it with his official garment. His ascension to the heavens was also miraculous, but it was the direct act of God.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Elijah was a powerful advocate of the true worship of Jehovah. He did a tremendous destructive work against Baalism in Israel, the work begun by him being carried on by Elisha, and the execution of Jezebel and the destruction of unclean Sidonian Baalism being accomplished by Jehu. In Elijah’s day seven thousand, including Obadiah, Ahab’s household manager, were found to be faithful to Jehovah, some of whom he doubtless strengthened greatly. Elijah appointed Elisha as his successor, but the anointing of Hazael and that of Jehu were left for Elisha to fulfill.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The apostle Paul undoubtedly refers to Elijah when he speaks of “Samuel and the other prophets, who through faith . . . effected righteousness . . . Women received their dead by resurrection.” He is therefore among the “cloud” of faithful witnesses of old. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011275/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Heb. 11:32-35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011275/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 12:1</a>) The disciple James points to Elijah as proof of the efficacy of prayers of “a man with feelings like ours,” who righteously serves God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011275/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Jas. 5:16-18</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>WORK PROPHETIC OF THINGS TO COME</strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">About 450 years after Elijah’s time, Malachi prophesied that Elijah the prophet would appear “before the coming of the great and fear-inspiring day of Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011275/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Mal. 4:5, 6</a>) The Jews of Jesus’ day were in expectation of Elijah’s coming to fulfill this prophecy.

<strong>Festival of Unfermented Cakes</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Jesus Christ gave the interpretation as to the symbolic significance of ferment or leaven, as recorded <span id="page579" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="579" data-before-text="579"></span>at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011469/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 16:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011469/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 11</a>, when he warned his disciples: “Keep your eyes open and watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” When his disciples reasoned incorrectly among themselves as to what he meant, he spoke plainly: “‘How is it you do not discern that I did not talk to you about loaves? But watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.’ Then they grasped that he said to watch out . . . for the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” Also, Luke reports Jesus as stating specifically on another occasion: “Watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011469/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Luke 12:1</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The apostle Paul applies a similar significance to leaven in connection with the Festival of Unfermented Cakes when he describes the course that Christians should take. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011469/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 5:6-8</a>, he gives this counsel to his Christian brothers: “Do you not know that a little leaven ferments the whole lump? Clear away the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, according as you are free from ferment. For, indeed, Christ our passover has been sacrificed. Consequently let us keep the festival, not with old leaven, neither with leaven of injuriousness and wickedness, but with unfermented cakes of sincerity and truth.”</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">On Nisan 16, the second day of the Festival of Unfermented Cakes, the high priest waved the firstfruits of the barley harvest, which was the first crop of the year or what might be called the <em>first</em> of the firstfruits of the land. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011469/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Lev. 23:10, 11</a>) It is significant that Jesus Christ was resurrected on this very day, Nisan 16, in the year 33 C.E. The apostle compares Christ with others who are resurrected, saying: “However, now Christ has been raised up from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep in death. . . . But each one in his own rank: Christ the first fruits, afterward those who belong to the Christ during his presence.” Christ is also called “the first-born among many brothers.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011469/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:20-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011469/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Rom. 8:29</a>; see FIRSTFRUITS; PASSOVER; various festivals by name.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"></p>

But watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.’ Then they grasped that he said to watch out . . . for the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” Also, Luke reports Jesus as stating specifically on another occasion: “Watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011469/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Luke 12:1</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The apostle Paul applies a similar significance to leaven in connection with the Festival of Unfermented Cakes when he describes the course that Christians should take.

Consequently let us keep the festival, not with old leaven, neither with leaven of injuriousness and wickedness, but with unfermented cakes of sincerity and truth.”</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">On Nisan 16, the second day of the Festival of Unfermented Cakes, the high priest waved the firstfruits of the barley harvest, which was the first crop of the year or what might be called the <em>first</em> of the firstfruits of the land.

We are told: “His people did not make a burning for him” and he was not buried in the “burial places of the kings.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976489/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Chron. 21:18-20</a>) No fragrant spices were burned at his burial.</p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">But the Hebrews did use fragrant spices and ointments as part of burials. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976489/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 19:40</a>) Thus, after mentioning such sweet-smelling substances used at Asa’s burial, the account speaks of “an extraordinarily great funeral burning <em>for</em> him.” Note, the burning was “for” him, not “of” him. The verse itself, then, indicates that what was burned were the aromatic spices, giving a fragrant scent.</p>

<strong>Festival of Unfermented Cakes</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Jesus Christ gave the interpretation as to the symbolic significance of ferment or leaven, as recorded <span id="page579" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="579" data-before-text="579"></span>at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011469/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 16:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011469/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 11</a>, when he warned his disciples: “Keep your eyes open and watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” When his disciples reasoned incorrectly among themselves as to what he meant, he spoke plainly: “‘How is it you do not discern that I did not talk to you about loaves? But watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.’ Then they grasped that he said to watch out . . . for the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” Also, Luke reports Jesus as stating specifically on another occasion: “Watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011469/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Luke 12:1</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The apostle Paul applies a similar significance to leaven in connection with the Festival of Unfermented Cakes when he describes the course that Christians should take. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011469/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 5:6-8</a>, he gives this counsel to his Christian brothers: “Do you not know that a little leaven ferments the whole lump? Clear away the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, according as you are free from ferment. For, indeed, Christ our passover has been sacrificed. Consequently let us keep the festival, not with old leaven, neither with leaven of injuriousness and wickedness, but with unfermented cakes of sincerity and truth.”</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">On Nisan 16, the second day of the Festival of Unfermented Cakes, the high priest waved the firstfruits of the barley harvest, which was the first crop of the year or what might be called the <em>first</em> of the firstfruits of the land. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011469/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Lev. 23:10, 11</a>) It is significant that Jesus Christ was resurrected on this very day, Nisan 16, in the year 33 C.E. The apostle compares Christ with others who are resurrected, saying: “However, now Christ has been raised up from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep in death. . . . But each one in his own rank: Christ the first fruits, afterward those who belong to the Christ during his presence.” Christ is also called “the first-born among many brothers.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011469/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:20-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011469/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Rom. 8:29</a>; see FIRSTFRUITS; PASSOVER; various festivals by name.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"></p>
