<strong>Edom</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">David, as king, won a major victory over the Edomites in the Valley of Salt. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001258/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">2Sa 8:13</a>; see <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001258/2">SALT, VALLEY OF</a>.) While the action provoking the battle is not stated, Edomite aggression was doubtless responsible, perhaps because the Edomites’ thought that David’s campaigns into Syria had left the southern part of his kingdom vulnerable to invasion. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001258/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 18:12</a> and in the <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001258/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">superscription of Psalm 60</a>, Abishai and Joab respectively are described as effecting the conquest of the Edomites. Since David was commander in chief and Joab was his principal general, while Abishai was a divisional commander under Joab, it can be seen how the accounts could differ in crediting the victory, depending upon the viewpoint taken, even as is the case in modern times. Similarly the difference in figures in these texts is likely due to the narrator’s particular view of the different aspects or campaigns of the war. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001258/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">1Ki 11:15, 16</a>.) At any rate, David stationed garrisons of Israelite troops throughout Edom, and Edom’s remaining population became subject to Israel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001258/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">2Sa 8:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001258/52/1" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> 1Ch 18:13</a>) The “yoke” of Jacob now rested heavily on the neck of Edom (Esau).​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001258/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Ge 27:40</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001258/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Nu 24:18</a>.</p>

Why is this?</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The three accounts evidently present the defeat of the Edomites from different viewpoints. In 2 Samuel, the victory is ascribed to David because he was the king, the commander-in-chief of the Israelite army and the one who authorized the battle engagement. Since Joab was the principal general, he is credited with the triumph in the <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979450/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">superscription of Psalm 60</a>. Abishai served as a divisional commander under Joab and doubtless had a prominent share in the military campaign. This would explain why the victory is attributed to him in the Chronicles account. Thus there is no contradiction. Even today it is customary to ascribe a particular deed to the person who authorized it or to the one who had a prominent share in its being carried out successfully.</p>

<strong>Why Edom Is No More</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In the centuries that passed, the attitude of the Edomites did not change toward their brother nation. During the reign of Israel’s first king, Saul, warfare broke out with Edom.

From <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977528/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 60</a> and its superscription, it appears that at this time the Israelites had suffered reverses while warring in the north with the forces of Aram-naharaim and Aram-Zobah. Nevertheless, the Edomites were subdued, and David stationed garrisons of Israelite troops throughout Edom.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977528/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Sam. 8:14</a>.</p>

(147:5) He is “merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and trueness.” (86:15) His understanding is beyond recounting (147:5) and his creative works bespeak his wisdom. (104:24) He counts the number of stars and calls all of them by names. (147:4) He is able to see even the human embryo. (139:16) He can heal all maladies. (103:3) He can cause wars to cease by wrecking the war equipment of the enemy. (46:9) He has been actively involved in many events of history in furtherance of his righteous purpose.

(119:142) Lasting benefits result from observing his perfect law, trustworthy reminders, upright orders, clean commandments and righteous judicial decisions.

<strong>Moab</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Later, when David himself ruled as king, there also was warfare between Israel and Moab. The Moabites were completely subdued and were made to pay tribute to David. Apparently at the end of the conflict two thirds of Moab’s fighting men were put to death. It seems that David had them lie down on the ground in a row and then measured this row to determine the two thirds to be put to death and the one third to be preserved alive. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">2Sa 8:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/42/1" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 11, 12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/42/2" data-bid="43-3" class="b"> 1Ch 18:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/42/3" data-bid="43-4" class="b"> 11</a>) Possibly in the course of the same conflict, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada “struck down the two sons of Ariel of Moab.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">2Sa 23:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/43/1" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> 1Ch 11:22</a>) David’s decisive victory over the Moabites was a fulfillment of Balaam’s prophetic words uttered over 400 years earlier: “A star will certainly step forth out of Jacob, and a scepter will indeed rise out of Israel. And he will certainly break apart the temples of Moab’s head and the cranium of all the sons of tumult of war.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Nu 24:17</a>) Also apparently with reference to this victory, the psalmist spoke of God’s regarding Moab as his “washing pot.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Ps 60:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/45/1" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> 108:9</a>.</p>

<strong>Sandal</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">By the expression “over Edom I shall throw my sandal” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003830/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps 60:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003830/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 108:9</a>) Jehovah may have meant that Edom would be brought under subjection. It possibly had reference to the custom of indicating the taking of possession by throwing one’s sandal on a piece of land. Or, it could have indicated contempt for Edom, since Moab is called “my washing pot” in the same text. In the Middle East today, throwing the sandal is a gesture of contempt.</p>

Following their God-given victories over this ruler and also King Og of Bashan, the Israelites encamped on the desert plains of Moab.

Although making no claim to the former Moabite territory taken by the Israelites from the Amorites, Balak did fear for his realm. He therefore consulted with the older men of Midian and then sent messengers, older men of both Moab and Midian, to hire the prophet Balaam to come and curse Israel.

Israel’s subservience to Moab continued for eighteen years until Ehud, a left-handed Benjamite, killed King Eglon while having a private audience with him.

There Boaz, a kinsman of Elimelech, married Ruth, who had abandoned the polytheism of the Moabites and had become a worshiper of Jehovah.

Israel’s first king, Saul, victoriously warred against them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">1 Sam. 14:47</a>) Since the Moabites would therefore have regarded Saul as an enemy, understandably the king of Moab was agreeable to having the parents of David, a man whom Saul had outlawed, dwell at Mizpeh in Moab.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">1 Sam. 22:3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Later, when David himself ruled as king, there also was warfare between Israel and Moab. The Moabites were completely subdued and paid tribute to David. Apparently at the end of the conflict two-thirds of Moab’s fighting men were put to death. It seems that David had them lie down on the ground in a row and then measured this row to determine the two-thirds to be put to death and the one-third to be preserved alive. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">2 Sam. 8:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/41/1" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> 11, 12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/41/2" data-bid="42-3" class="b"> 1 Chron. 18:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/41/3" data-bid="42-4" class="b"> 11</a>) Possibly in the course of the same conflict, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada “struck down the two sons of Ariel of Moab.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">2 Sam. 23:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/42/1" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 11:22</a>) David’s decisive victory over the Moabites fulfilled Balaam’s prophetic words uttered over 400 years earlier: “A star will certainly step forth out of Jacob, and a scepter will indeed rise out of Israel. And he will certainly break apart the temples of Moab’s head and the cranium of all the sons of tumult of war.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Num. 24:17</a>) Also apparently with reference to this victory, the psalmist spoke of God’s regarding Moab as his “washing pot.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Ps. 60:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/44/1" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> 108:9</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">David’s son Solomon, however, disregarded God’s law and married Moabite women who had not become worshipers of Jehovah. To please them Solomon built a high place to their god Chemosh. Not until some three centuries later, during Josiah’s reign, was this high place made unfit for worship.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">1 Ki. 11:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/45/1" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> 7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/45/2" data-bid="46-3" class="b"> 2 Ki. 23:13</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong><em>After the division of the kingdom until the Judean exile</em></strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Sometime after the secession of Israel from Judah the Moabites appear to have regained territory N of the Arnon. On the black basalt stele known as the Moabite Stone, Moab’s King Mesha speaks of Israel’s King Omri as taking possession of the region of Medeba. Since the tableland of Medeba was in the territory of Reuben (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Josh. 13:15, 16</a>), Israel had apparently lost this area to the Moabites so that Omri later had to recapture it.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Evidently Moab remained under Israelite control during the reigns of Kings Omri and Ahab. But following the death of Ahab, Moab’s King Mesha, who “paid to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs and a hundred thousand unshorn male sheep,” revolted. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">2 Ki. 1:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/47/1" data-bid="48-2" class="b"> 3:4, 5</a>) The Moabite Stone memorializes this revolt. If correctly identified as being the same places mentioned in the Bible, eleven of the cities that King Mesha claims as subject to or captured or (re)built by him were definitely in Israelite territory N of the Arnon. These cities are Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, Kiriathaim, Nebo, Baal-meon (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Num. 32:34,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/48/1" data-bid="49-2" class="b"> 37, 38</a>), Medeba, Bamoth-baal, Beth-baal-meon, Jahaz (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Josh. 13:9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/49/1" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> 17-19</a>) and Bezer.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Josh. 20:8</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Unlike Mesha’s propagandistic inscription, the Scriptures report that the Moabites suffered humiliating defeat. Enlisting the aid of King Jehoshaphat of Judah and the king of Edom in putting down the Moabite revolt, Jehoram (who became king of Israel about two years after Ahab’s death) marched against Moab from the S, by way of the wilderness of Edom. But the allied armies and their animals almost perished for lack of water. The prophet Elisha’s aid was then sought and, in fulfillment of his prophecy that Jehovah would help on account of Jehoshaphat, the torrent valley became filled with water. The next morning the reflection of the sun upon the water made it look like blood to the Moabites. Wrongly concluding that the allied armies had slaughtered one another, the Moabites abandoned all caution and came to the Israelite camp, only to be put to flight. As the <span id="page1171" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1171" data-before-text="1171"></span>battle progressed Moabite cities were ruined, good tracts of land were filled with stones, trees were cut down and springs were stopped up. When King Mesha found himself penned up in the city of Kir-hareseth with the battle going against him, he, with seven hundred men, unsuccessfully tried to break through to the king of Edom. Finally he took his firstborn son and offered him up as a burnt sacrifice upon the wall. For this or some other reason there “came to be great indignation against Israel” and the siege was abandoned.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">2 Ki. 3:6-27</a>.</p>

<strong>Sanctuary</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The members of the Christian congregation, Christ’s body’ constitute a temple or sanctuary. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013739/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013739/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Eph. 2:21, 22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013739/17/2" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 1 Pet. 2:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013739/17/3" data-bid="18-4" class="b"> 9</a>) This provides a basis for understanding the words directed to the apostle John: “Get up and measure the temple sanctuary of God and the altar and those worshiping in it. But as for the courtyard that is outside the temple sanctuary, cast it clear out and do not measure it, because it has been given to the nations, and they will trample the holy city underfoot for forty-two months.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013739/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Rev. 11:1, 2</a>) The temple here referred to could not be the one at Jerusalem, for that structure had been <span id="page1446" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1446" data-before-text="1446"></span>destroyed nearly three decades earlier. Being earthly, the nations could only be “given” a courtyard that was likewise on earth. Since this courtyard is associated with God’s sanctuary, it could reasonably represent prospective members of the heavenly sanctuary, those still on earth. Whereas it would be impossible for the nations to trample upon a location in the heavens, they could trample upon persons who were in line to receive a heavenly inheritance as members of Christ’s body, persons who were due to become ‘pillars in the temple of God.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013739/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Rev. 3:12</a>) Similarly, Daniel’s prophecy regarding the throwing down of the established place of the sanctuary (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013739/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Dan. 8:11</a>) and the profaning of the sanctuary (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013739/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Dan. 11:31</a>) appears to point to events in connection with those in line for membership in God’s spiritual temple.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"></p>

<strong>The Source of All Dynamic Energy and Vigorous Power</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> Many people, however, seem to be blinded by the brilliance of such scientific progress and technological achievements. Losing sight of their proper place in the universe, some of these confessed physical weaklings suddenly view themselves and other men as great mental giants with overpowering intelligence. Especially is this perverted mental concept found among the more educated classes and prominent world leaders, many of whom are disgustingly obnoxious in their boastful arrogance and overbearing self-confidence. Bloated with pride, they wantonly brag of man’s accomplishments in this jet-powered, electronic, atom-smashing age. As men zoom to new heights of success in their rocket program they imagine and <span id="page425" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="425" data-before-text="425"></span>predict in great swelling words that humans are on the very threshold of becoming conquerors and masters of outer space, of establishing themselves in what they think is the “ultimate position” in the universe. As a consequence the general masses of mankind are constantly urged and pressured into putting their complete trust and confidence in the mental powers and thinking ability of these world leaders for guidance, protection and security.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 4. Are human creatures justified in boasting of their accomplishments?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> But is there any truth, in actual fact, that gives these human creatures the license and freedom to glory and boast in their accomplishments or in the security of human strength? It is granted, men through the fertility of their brains and the ingenuity of their hands have contrived not only simple oxcarts and water wheels but also giant turbines and intricate nuclear machines of great power. But certainly this gives no reason or excuse for praising and worshiping these mortal creatures as if they were gods. Really, man’s most complicated machines are based on simple fundamental laws and principles of mechanics, not one of which he has created or originated. Men of science and learning have merely discovered and applied principles and forces of energy that were in existence long before man made his comparatively recent debut on this planet.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 5. So how are we to view the physical and mental strength of creatures?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> The pounding hoofs and the snorting nostrils of a charging cavalry of horses may be rated by some people as a thrilling display of vigor and strength, sending shivers down the spine. Yet long ago the psalmist warned against trusting in such false strength. “The horse is a deception for salvation, and by the abundance of its vital energy it does not afford escape.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961523/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 33:17</a>) With like force of reasoning it is foolish and ridiculous to put trust and confidence in men, who are much weaker than horses. The bulging muscles of an athlete or the thunderous lung power of a political dictator are just as deceiving. To put trust and hope in the strength of earthly men, even though they elevate themselves to a princely status among their fellows because of their “brainy” accomplishments—this too was long ago described as futile. “Salvation by earthling man is worthless.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961523/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Pss. 60:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961523/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 146:3</a>) Of a truth both men and horses are deceptive sources of true strength.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 6. What questions make it obvious that dynamic energy does not originate with man?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Stop and think! Who gave the horse or the athlete his vitality and strength? Who generated the power of gravity by which the rivers flow and the waters fall? Or who set the ceaseless tides in motion to time indefinite? Who created the fabulous furnace of the sun with its internal temperature estimated at more than 40,000,000 degrees Fahrenheit? And who concentrated such incomprehensible energy as is bound up in minute atoms, the invisible particles of all physical matter? Surely no withered and dying weakling like a mere man, no, not even though he be honored and praised to the high <span id="page426" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="426" data-before-text="426"></span>heavens as an international Nobel prize winner bedecked with many college citations and degrees.</p>

This notified the nations that the “appointed times of the nations” had run out in 1914; that God’s kingdom by Christ had then been set up in heaven; that the League of Nations was a fraud and “must fail, because God has decreed it <span id="page252" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="252" data-before-text="252"></span>thus”; that the kingdom of Jehovah’s Messiah was the complete cure-all for the ills of humankind; and that by obeying the laws of that righteous kingdom men will continue to live and never die off the earth.<a id="footnotesource6" data-fnid="6" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1960284/5">f</a> This bold resolution was the first in a series of seven resolutions adopted at annual general assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses from 1922 to 1928.

It also makes for contentment and happiness. That is why we read: “There exists a friend sticking closer than a brother.” “A true companion is loving all the time, and is a brother that is born for when there is distress.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Prov. 18:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 17:17</a>.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1963329/0">a</a></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What better friendship could anyone cultivate than that with Jehovah God? Surely, all that can be said in praise of true friendship applies to friendship with him, and that to the superlative degree.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">How can we gain that much-prized friendship with God? To gain his friendship we must first take in knowledge of him and his purposes. Then we must exercise faith in that knowledge by dedicating ourselves to do his will. “Without faith it is impossible to please him well, for he that approaches God must believe that he is and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.” By devoting our all to God we will be heeding Jesus’ command: “Make friends for yourselves by means of the unrighteous riches.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Heb. 11:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Luke 16:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> John 17:3</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">How can we keep God’s friendship once we have gained it? King David, who himself was a friend of God, answers: “O Jehovah, who will be a guest in your tent? Who will reside in your holy mountain? He who is walking faultlessly and practicing righteousness and speaking the truth in his heart. He has not slandered with his tongue. To his companion he has done nothing bad, and no reproach has he taken up against his intimate acquaintance.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 15:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Walking faultlessly and practicing righteousness take in ever so many things. It means, first of all, that we remain loyal to Jehovah God. It means giving him “exclusive devotion.” It means to “love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind and with your whole strength.” To keep our friendship with Jehovah we must be constant, dependable, loyal, and keep walking with him as did Enoch and other faithful men of old.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ex. 20:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Mark 12:30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Gen. 5:24</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">This means that we must guard against all improper friendships, for will not such make us the enemies of God? Guarded against also must be the love of money, for we cannot serve two masters, and especially not when the two are opposed to each other as are God and Riches.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jas. 4:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Luke 16:13</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">We must also trust God implicitly and always submit to him if we would walk faultlessly before him, enjoying his friendship. That means consulting him in all our ways, letting him direct our paths. Never do we want to push ahead presumptuously with our own ideas or with the private opinions of others. Reading in God’s Word or law regularly will help us to keep proper perspective as to our relationship with our Maker and with our neighbor, for were not the kings of Israel commanded to do the same for the same reasons? Nor may we overlook talking with God in prayer. All such will help us to walk modestly with God and so keep from losing God’s friendship by acting presumptuously.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Prov. 3:5, 6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Deut. 17:18-20</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Walking faultlessly and practicing righteousness also mean keeping holy, for Jehovah our God is holy. We may not sully ourselves by unclean practices, however insignificant they may seem to be, but must keep strict watch that how we walk is as wise persons.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Eph. 5:15</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">For us to be keeping our friendship with God we must also be careful as to our dealings with others, especially as regards those in the Christian congregation. We want to go beyond mere justice, not only not doing anything bad to a companion, but lovingly refusing to take up a reproach against an intimate acquaintance who may try us at times. Love covers a multitude of sins.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:8</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Speaking the truth in our hearts is also required of us if we would keep our friendship with Jehovah, keep dwelling in his tent. And what does that include? It means that we must be honest with ourselves and others, and in particular that we cherish the truth of God’s Word, what it tells us about our incomparable God Jehovah, his attributes, works and purposes. We should delight to meditate or think about these things. If these things are truly in our hearts they will also be upon our lips, for out of the heart’s abundance the mouth speaks. By following such a course we will be able to exclaim with the psalmist David: “I will be a guest in your tent for times indefinite,” keeping our friendship with God forever.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963329/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 61:4</a>.</p>

<strong>Proving Ourselves God’s Friends</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> That the Almighty God takes into his <span id="page111" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="111" data-before-text="111"></span>tent as guests only certain ones is not surprising. Whoever has a home of his own does not receive into it as a guest just anybody; he does not entertain all persons. Many home owners would not have bad persons staying with them even for a short time. The same principle applies with Jehovah God. He does not receive everybody into his tent: “No one bad may reside for any time with you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 5:4</a>) This was true in David’s day, in regard to the tent of God. David had brought the ark of Jehovah from the house of Obed-edom to Jerusalem: “So they brought the ark of Jehovah in and set it in its place inside the tent that David had pitched for it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Sam. 6:17</a>) To enter this tent was to enter into the presence of the Most High. David selected certain ones to serve at this tent, Asaph being among those so privileged. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Chron. 16:4-6</a>) Only those who walked faultlessly and who were pure and upright could be in constant attendance in Jehovah’s tent on his holy mountain.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 4. What is said about the requirement for staying in God’s presence, and so what should be the Christian’s attitude?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Jehovah is very careful about those who stay in his holy presence. If the requirements in David’s day for being a guest in Jehovah’s tent there on his holy mountain were strict, then how much more so must be the requirements for abiding in Jehovah’s tent as a permanent guest, as a member of his holy family! That we may be accounted worthy of this incomparable privilege and be able to say with David, “I will be a guest in your tent for times indefinite,” we must prove ourselves God’s friends. Since “His intimacy is with the upright ones,” it is absolutely imperative that those who would enjoy his protection and hospitality forever learn what God requires for being upright in his eyes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 61:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Prov. 3:32</a>) Hence every Christian should ask himself these questions: “O Jehovah, who will be a guest in your tent? Who will reside in your holy mountain?” And every Christian should be thoroughly familiar with what the psalmist answered: “He who is walking faultlessly and practicing righteousness and speaking the truth in his heart.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 15:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>WALKING FAULTLESSLY</strong></p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 5. How did Adam fail to walk faultlessly, and so what did he lose?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> To walk faultlessly, in God’s eyes, the Christian must trust Jehovah God implicitly and prove that trust by being obedient to his commands. Adam, the first man, was God’s guest in the Paradise of Eden. Adam could have enjoyed that Paradise as an everlasting dwelling place, one blessed with God’s presence. But Adam failed to prove himself God’s friend. Because of Adam’s failure to obey his heavenly Father and Host, he lost his Paradise dwelling place and disqualified himself for being a guest in “the garden of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ezek. 28:13</a>) Adam failed to walk faultlessly, and so could not be God’s friend.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 6. Who was called “Jehovah’s friend,” and why?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> But the Bible abounds with examples of those who succeeded in proving themselves God’s friends. A list of those who proved themselves friends of God is found in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">the book of Hebrews, chapter eleven</a>. Mentioned in that chapter is Abraham, of whom James wrote: “The scripture was fulfilled which says: ‘Abraham put faith in Jehovah, and it was counted to him as righteousness,’ and he came to be called ‘Jehovah’s friend.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jas. 2:23</a>) What a privilege to be called “Jehovah’s friend”! Are we, like Abraham, willing to meet the requirements for being Jehovah’s friend? We cannot be God’s friends by merely wishing it to be so; we must prove ourselves friends of God. Abraham demonstrated his faith and trust in God by obeying Jehovah’s command to leave Ur of the Chaldees and later in attempting to offer up his only son by Sarah, his beloved Isaac. <span id="page112" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="112" data-before-text="112"></span>Thus the writer of Hebrews states: “By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed in going out into a place he was destined to receive as an inheritance; and he went out, although not knowing where he was going. By faith Abraham, when he was tested, as good as offered up Isaac, and the man that had gladly received the promises attempted to offer up his only-begotten son, although it had been said to him: ‘What will be called “your seed” will be through Isaac.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Heb. 11:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 17, 18</a>) Abraham walked faultlessly, proving his faith and trust in God by his obedience; “and he came to be called ‘Jehovah’s friend.’”</p>

<strong>Proving Ourselves God’s Friends</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> “Speaking the truth in his heart”—this is another requirement for one who would be God’s guest. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ps. 15:2</a>) The one speaking the truth in his heart is honest with others and with himself. If he speaks the truth in his heart, he will also speak the truth with his mouth. Not only will he avoid falsehood but he will be a preacher of truth, God’s truth. The truths that God requires Christians to speak are found in <span id="page116" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="116" data-before-text="116"></span>his Word and they include the commandments of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, especially those concerning the preaching of God’s kingdom. Said the Lord Jesus when on earth: “You are my friends if”—if what? “If you do what I am commanding you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">John 15:14</a>) And what is it that the Lord Jesus commanded his followers during this “time of the end” to do? Why, speak the truth concerning God’s kingdom and its establishment! “This good news of the kingdom,” foretold Jesus, “will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">20. What results from speaking Kingdom truths, and so what obligation rests upon every Christian?</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> This great work of speaking Kingdom truths, then, is something in which everyone who would be a friend of God and his Son will want to share. By means of the truths concerning God’s kingdom thousands of persons who were once enemies of God have now become his friends. Yes, converting many who are God’s enemies into his friends—this is the grand privilege and obligation of every true Christian. To do this he must be a preacher of truth. Everyone who is “speaking the truth in his heart” will speak the truth with his tongue, teaching others about God’s kingdom. Concerning the Christian obligation of turning God’s enemies into his friends by means of the truth, the apostle said: “We are therefore ambassadors substituting for Christ, as though God were making entreaty through us. As substitutes for Christ we beg: ‘Become reconciled to God.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">2 Cor. 5:20</a>.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">21. With the new world at hand, what should be our course of action, and with what blessed result?</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> The new world of righteousness is at hand, a world in which “the tent of God” will be with humankind. “O Jehovah, who will be a guest in your tent?” May we be diligent, then, in telling others of God’s Kingdom truths by which they may become reconciled to God. Let us speak from a heart filled with truth, all the while practicing righteousness in our dealings with all mankind. And may we in constancy ever walk faultlessly with our God, as did Enoch, Noah, Abraham and Daniel, seeking always divine direction in what we do. O may we prove ourselves, down through this world’s end and into the glorious new world, to be God’s loyal friends! Then we may exult with the psalmist: “I will be a guest in your tent for times indefinite,” for we will be guests of God, privileged to abide in Jehovah’s tent forever.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ps. 61:4</a>.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">No. What David wrote there was valid and realistic.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Consider what he penned in that verse and similar texts: “I will sing praises to your name forever as I pay my vows day after day.” “I praise you, O Jehovah my God, with all my heart, and I will glorify your name forever.” “I will praise your name forever and ever.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022685/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 61:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022685/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 86:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022685/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 145:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">David was not exaggerating, thinking that he would never die.

To do what? To subdue God’s enemies and “execute judgment against the nations” on earth. David was an ancestor of the Messiah, the one who would rule from heaven and who would be “a priest forever.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022685/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1-6</a>) Jesus confirmed that the prophecy found at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022685/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 110</a> was about him and that it would have a future fulfillment.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022685/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 22:41-45</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Yes, David was inspired to write about both his time and a future time when he would be resurrected and could enjoy praising Jehovah forever. That helps us to see that <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022685/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 37:10, 11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022685/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 29</a> can be understood as a description of the conditions that prevailed in ancient Israel as well as the conditions that will come about globally in the future when God fulfills his promises.​—See <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/2022685/0">paragraph 8</a> of the article “You Will Be With Me in Paradise” in this issue.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022685/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 61:8</a> and similar verses thus show that David wanted to glorify Jehovah in ancient Israel until he died. And they reflect realistically what David will be able to do in the future once Jehovah brings him back to life.</p>

<strong>Why Keep Your Promises?</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Sincere promises stem from the heart as well as the mind. Therefore, let us back up our promises to Jehovah by opening our hearts to him in prayer, honestly expressing our fears, desires, and weaknesses. Praying about a promise will strengthen our resolve to keep it. We could look on our promises to God as debts. When debts are large, payment has to be made gradually. Likewise, many promises we make to Jehovah will take time to fulfill. But by regularly giving him what we can, we show that we mean what we say, and he will bless us accordingly.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">We can demonstrate that we take our promises seriously by praying about them often, perhaps each day. This will show our heavenly Father that we are sincere. It will also serve as a regular reminder. David left us a fine example in this regard. In song, he beseeched Jehovah: “Do hear, O God, my entreating cry. Do pay attention to my prayer. . . . I will make melody to your name forever, that I may pay my vows day after day.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999682/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 61:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999682/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 8</a>.</p>

However, he also appreciated that if he made a vow, he was obligated to fulfill it. Even so, he praised Jehovah for the opportunity to fulfill his vows day after day.</p>

<strong>Jeduthun</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Three of the psalms mention Jeduthun in their superscriptions. Two of them (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002360/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps 39,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002360/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 62</a>) read “To the director <em>of</em> Jeduthun” (“after the manner of [the choir of] Jeduthun,” <em>Ro</em> ftn on <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002360/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">superscription of Ps 39</a>), while the third (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002360/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps 77</a>) reads “To the director <em>on</em> Jeduthun.” (<em>NW; Ro;</em> “upon,” <em>AT</em>) In each case the composition of the psalm is attributed to someone else, the first two to David and the third to Asaph; so there is no suggestion that Jeduthun composed them, though he is elsewhere called <span id="page1264" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1264" data-before-text="1264"></span>“the visionary of the king” and it is also said that he “was prophesying with the harp.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002360/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2Ch 35:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002360/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 1Ch 25:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002360/13/2" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 3</a>) Therefore, the superscriptions of these three psalms are evidently instructions for their performance, perhaps identifying a style or even a musical instrument that was somehow associated with Jeduthun, or that he or his sons may have invented, introduced, developed, or made common through usage.</p>

<strong>Draw Close to God Through Prayer</strong><br/><h1 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>Draw Close to God Through Prayer</strong></h1><p id="p3" data-pid="3">Do you ever feel that you need guidance in life? Do you have important questions that you want answered? Do you need comfort or reassurance? Would you like to feel closer to Jehovah? Prayer can help you fill all of those needs. But what is the right way to pray? Does God listen to all prayers? What can you do to make sure that he will hear <em>your</em> prayers? Let us see.</p><h3 class="du-color--gold-700 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>1.</strong> <strong>To whom should we pray, and what can we pray about?</strong></h3><p id="p5" data-pid="5">Jesus taught that we should pray only to our heavenly Father. Jesus himself prayed to Jehovah. He said: <strong>“You must pray, then, this way: ‘Our Father in the heavens . . .’”</strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021209/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9</a>) When we pray to Jehovah, we strengthen our friendship with him.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6">We can pray about practically any matter. Of course, for God to answer our prayers, they must be in harmony with his will. <strong>“No matter what we ask according to [God’s] will, he hears us.”</strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021209/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 John 5:14</a>) Jesus gave examples of appropriate things to pray for. (Read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021209/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9-13</a>.) In addition to praying about our personal concerns, we must not forget to thank God for what he has done for us and ask him to help others.</p><h3 class="du-color--gold-700 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>2. How should we pray?</strong></h3><p id="p8" data-pid="8">The Bible encourages us to <strong>“pour out [our] hearts before [God].”</strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021209/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 62:8</a>) So our prayers should be sincere and heartfelt. We can pray aloud or silently and in any respectful body position. We can pray at any time and in any location.</p><h3 class="du-color--gold-700 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>3.</strong> <strong>How does God answer our prayers?</strong></h3><p id="p10" data-pid="10">He does so in a variety of ways. Jehovah has provided his Word, the Bible, where we often find answers to our questions. Reading God’s Word can <strong>“[make] the inexperienced one wise.”</strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021209/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 19:7</a>; read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021209/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">James 1:5</a>.) He can give us peace of mind when we face challenges. And he can move his worshippers to help us when we really need it.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12">Examine how you can offer heartfelt prayers that are pleasing to God, and find out how prayer can benefit you.</p><h3 class="du-color--gold-800 du-margin-top--8" id="p13" data-pid="13"><strong>4.</strong> <strong>God has requirements for prayer</strong></h3><p id="p14" data-pid="14">What factors determine if our prayers are acceptable to God or not? <a href="https://www.jw.org/finder?lank=pub-lffv_91_VIDEO&amp;wtlocale=E" data-video="webpubvid://?pub=lffv&amp;track=91"><strong>Play the VIDEO</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><a href="https://www.jw.org/finder?lank=pub-lffv_91_VIDEO&amp;wtlocale=E" data-video="webpubvid://?pub=lffv&amp;track=91" class="dc-iconOverlay--play"><img src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/lff/2021/294" data-img-small-src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/lff/2021/293" alt="" width="150" height="84" class="suppressZoom" /></a><p id="p15" data-pid="15"><a href="https://www.jw.org/finder?lank=pub-lffv_91_VIDEO&amp;wtlocale=E" data-video="webpubvid://?pub=lffv&amp;track=91"><strong>VIDEO: <em>Does God Listen to All Prayers?​—Excerpt</em> (2:42)</strong></a></p><p id="p16" data-pid="16">Jehovah wants us to pray to him. <strong>Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021209/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 65:2</strong></a><strong>,</strong> and then discuss these questions:</p><ul><li><p id="p17" data-pid="17">  Do you think the “Hearer of prayer” wants <em>you</em> to pray to him?

<strong>What Do You Say to God?</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Prayer permits us to express our worship of and love for the Creator. We can pour out our feelings and desires.

Tell him what is in your heart as you express appreciation for the measure of health and life you enjoy.

Look! the eye of Jehovah is toward those fearing <em>him,</em> to those waiting for his loving-kindness, to deliver their soul from death itself, and to preserve them alive in famine.” Today Christendom has a symbolic “image of the wild beast.” Each member of the United Nations has joined in setting it up or in maintaining it for worship as an idol image for worship by the worldly nations. Concerning it we quote <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959162/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Jeremiah (10:14, 15</a>): “His molten image is a <em>falsehood,</em> and there is no spirit in them.

The Devil-inspired, man-made images symbolizing peace and security now worshiped by the nations will prove to be no gods. The alliance of Christendom’s religions with this political world is an unclean, ungodly deception. As a refuge and place of concealment the League of Nations proved to be a lie, even without the coming of the battle of Armageddon. Not less so now, when the actual “war of the great day of God the Almighty” is impending, the United Nations is a lie and a falsehood! Jehovah says so through his Word.</p>
