<strong>Hold Fast Your Joy!</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Long before modern telescopes peered out into that immensity of space, the <span id="page114" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="114" data-before-text="114"></span>psalmist declared: “O Jehovah our Lord, how majestic your name is in all the earth, you whose dignity is recounted above the heavens!” Far loftier and more glorious even than all the breath-taking expanse of the material heavens, is the spirit realm and heavens of Jehovah’s own presence. What marvelous undeserved kindness has Jehovah displayed through his Son, in purchasing a few of mankind from the earth, to serve forever with his Son and King in the exalted “new heavens”—no, not in ugly space suits, but in the glorious, spiritual bodies of their resurrection, provided for exalted service in the brightness of the glory of Jehovah’s presence. What marvelous love does Jehovah display, too, as he turns attention to this tiny speck, the earth, sweeping it clean of all sectarian religion and other wickedness, and establishing it as a sanctuary where men will live forever in peace and joy. Whether our destiny is incorruptibility in the “new heavens” or everlasting life with the “new earth,” all of us can humbly exclaim before Jehovah: “What is mortal man that you keep him in mind, and the son of earthling man that you take care of him?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ps. 8:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/28/2" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> 1 Cor. 15:42-45;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/28/3" data-bid="29-4" class="b"> Rev. 14:3</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">18. (a) Where only on earth can the real joy be found, and how did Peter indicate this? (b) Why can it be said that Jehovah’s witnesses are the only group that hold to the religion of life today?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Find your place in God’s arrangement and stick by it! Stay close by his organization, the New World society, for there is nowhere else on earth that the joys of the real life can be found. In Jesus’ day, when some became offended by the hard-hitting truths that he spoke and wandered back into the labyrinth of sectarianism, he said to his twelve apostles: “You do not want to go also, do you?” Peter answered: “Master, Whom shall we go away to? You have sayings of everlasting life, and we have believed and come to know that you are the Holy One of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">John 6:67-69</a>) At that time there was only the one group that had the sayings of life, and today there is still only the one group. It is the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses, working in unity world-wide under the direction of the same Master, the now-reigning King, Christ Jesus. It is the only group on earth that has separated from the greedy, corrupt politics, religion, commerce and militarism of the Devil’s world, and that has beaten ‘swords into plowshares’ so as to maintain a unity of love and brotherhood throughout the earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Isa. 2:4</a>) It is the only organization that magnifies Jehovah’s great name, and that advocates the religion of life, boldly proclaiming God’s kingdom by Christ Jesus as the instrument for mankind’s survival, as well as for administering the blessings of life in God’s new world.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ps. 34:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/31/1" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> John 17:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/31/2" data-bid="32-3" class="b"> Matt. 24:14</a>.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">19.

Then you should also humbly acknowledge your dependence on his earthly organization today. There is no place of real safety outside God’s New World society. All lovers of life must find their place, and hold their place, within that society, regularly attending the <em>Watchtower</em> study meeting, the service meeting and theocratic ministry school, listening attentively to the public Bible talks, and supporting the midweek congregation book study. Happy are all those that crowd all these meetings into a busy week, for in so doing they are crowding out the inconsequential things that the enemy would like to sow in their Christian lives. Happy, because they are conscious of their spiritual need! Happy, because they are pressing on to maturity with all of God’s people throughout the wide world! Happy, because they are building up strength to <span id="page115" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="115" data-before-text="115"></span>withstand the final assault from Satan’s world, which even now heaps scorn and persecutions on their heads! “Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you and lyingly say every kind of wicked thing against you for my [Jesus’] sake. Rejoice and leap for joy, since your reward is great in the heavens.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Matt. 5:11, 12</a>.</p>

<strong>Jesus Had Time for Children</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Some persons think that young children should not be instructed in matters of worship but should wait until they are older and can decide for themselves. Jesus did not hold to this view. Four days before he died, Jesus entered into the temple in Jerusalem and threw out the money changers and those selling sacrificial animals at enormous profits. This ruined the racket of the chief priests and scribes, and they determined to do away with Jesus. But they chose for complaint the fact that children were praising Jesus and hailing him as Messiah. Yet Jesus cited the children’s cries as a fulfillment of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101979933/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 8:2</a>. The account reads:</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">“Jesus entered into the temple and threw out all those selling and buying in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves. And he said to them: ‘It is written, “My house will be called a house of prayer,” but you are making it a cave of robbers.’ Also, blind and lame persons came up to him in the temple, and he cured them. When the chief priests and the scribes saw the marvelous things he did and the boys that were crying out in the temple and saying: ‘Save, we pray, the Son of David!’ they became indignant and said to him: ‘Do you hear what these are saying?’ Jesus said to them: ‘Yes. Did you never read this, “Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have furnished praise”?’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101979933/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 21:12-16</a>.</p>

But you have made it a cave of robbers.’ And the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and they began to seek how to destroy him; for they were in fear of him, for all the crowd was continually being astounded at his teaching.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966046/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Mark 11:15-18</a>) Thus with power and authority he cleansed the temple of the religious commercialism practiced there. What a foreboding for Babylonish religious commercialists of our day, when he returns in Kingdom power!</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">On Passover night Judas Iscariot led the enemies of Jesus and betrayed him in the garden of Gethsemane. Then Jesus was sentenced to death in a night session of. the Jewish Sanhedrin or Supreme Court in Jerusalem. In the morning, because the Jews themselves, due to Roman domination, could not execute the death penalty, the Sanhedrin turned him over to Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966046/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Matt. 26:47–27:14</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Upon examining Jesus, Pilate found no cause for death in him and offered to release him, as it was the custom for one person to be released from the death sentence at Passover time. Insistently the Jewish religious authorities cried out for the release, not of Jesus, but of a murderer and robber, Barabbas. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966046/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Acts 3:13-15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966046/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 13:28</a>) They demanded that Jesus be hung on a stake and, differently from Pilate, who wanted to be free of innocent blood, they cried: “His blood come upon us and upon our children.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966046/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matt. 27:15-26</a>) They made the charge against Jesus that he was seditious against the Roman emperor Tiberius Caesar. Pilate in a last attempt to save Jesus said, “See! Your king!” and, “Shall I impale your king?” thinking to appeal to their Jewish nationalism. “The chief priests answered: ‘We have no king but Caesar.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966046/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">John 19:14, 15</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">In taking this course of action these religious leaders of the Jews were certainly reprehensible. First, they deliberately refused to acknowledge the king Jehovah had sent and to help the Jewish people to see that their King was indeed at hand. Moreover, though they themselves claimed to be priests of God, they were seditious against God and degraded their priestly office by accepting as king the Pontifex Maximus of pagan religion. Even in Jesus’ <span id="page58" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="58" data-before-text="58"></span>death they did not want him to be acknowledged as King, for they objected to the sign that Governor Pilate insisted on posting over Jesus’ head on the torture stake, which read: “Jesus the Nazarene the King of the Jews.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966046/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">John 19:12-22</a>.</p>

<strong>Jehovah—The One Who Is Vigorous in Power</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> The apostle Paul explained that our Creator’s ‘eternal power can be clearly perceived in the things he has made.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000162/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Romans 1:20</a>) Centuries earlier, the psalmist David, who as a shepherd must frequently have looked up at the night sky, perceived the grandeur of the universe and the might of its Maker. He wrote: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind, and the son of earthling man that you take care of him?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000162/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 8:3, 4</a>) Despite his limited knowledge of celestial bodies, David understood that he was very insignificant in comparison with the Creator of our vast universe. Today, astronomers know much more about the immensity of the universe and the power that sustains it. For example, they tell us that our sun every second emits energy equivalent to the explosion of 100,000 million megatons of TNT.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2000162/1">b</a> A very small fraction of that energy reaches the earth; yet that is enough to sustain all life on our planet. Still, our sun is by no means the most powerful star in the heavens. Some stars radiate in only one second the <span id="page10" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>energy that the sun radiates in a whole day. Imagine, then, the power at the disposal of the One who created such heavenly bodies! Elihu rightfully exclaimed: “As for the Almighty, we have not found him out; he is exalted in power.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000162/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 37:23</a>.</p>

<strong>Do You Really Count With God?</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Three thousand years ago the Hebrew poet-king David of Judah expressed amazement in the following words: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind, and the son of earthling man that you take care of him?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983001/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 8:3, 4</a>) Yes, even though David did not realize it, with his naked eye he was peering into the universe a distance of some 600,000 light-years.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1983001/0">a</a>  He was impressed that the Creator of that vast expanse should also take man into account.</p>

<strong>Does God Care About You?</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Greatly impressed by the heavenly works of God, the inspired psalmist David asked: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind, and the son of earthling man that you take care of him?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978881/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 8:3, 4</a>) True, reflection on our place in the universe should properly humble us. Man, created lower than the angels, would seemingly not merit Jehovah God’s consideration. Yet the psalmist’s question shows that God does care about humans.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Consider: David asked, in essence: ‘What is man that God keeps him in mind, that Jehovah takes care of him?’ Clearly, then, God <em>does</em> keep man in mind. The Most High <em>does</em> take care of man. Rather than treating humans as insignificant <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>“specks,” God allows the sun to shine and the rain to fall on both the righteous and the unrighteous. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978881/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 5:45</a>) In fact, generation after generation of humans have reason to thank God that he has not forgotten them, for he has given them “rains from heaven and fruitful seasons.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978881/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 14:16, 17</a>.</p>

Anyone who has traveled by airplane knows that, even from a few thousand feet up, humans virtually disappear from sight and their homes and cars look like toys. From his far loftier position, then, as Jehovah looks down on the earth, how small and insignificant humans must appear to him! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975004/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Isa. 40:15</a>) Is it any wonder that the psalmist wrote: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind, and the son of earthling man that you take care of him?”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975004/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Ps. 8:3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> Yet, to us mortal humans this High and Lofty One, the Creator, the Sovereign Ruler of the universe, extends the opportunity to have a relationship with him.

That Son, Jesus Christ, himself explained: “God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.” He also told his apostles: “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975004/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">John 3:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975004/37/1" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> 14:6</a>) Following his own death and resurrection, Jesus commanded his disciples: “You will be witnesses of me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the most distant part of the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975004/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Acts 1:8</a>) Appreciating the grand privilege that it is to serve in this way, they did what he told them.</p>

He has time to meditate and to examine visually the creations of that almighty One. At night when he lies under a star-studded sky, he can marvel at the Creator’s wisdom and power in making the beautiful heavens. In comparison to them he is so small and insignificant that he has reason to rejoice that their Maker is aware of him and is interested in him. King David of Judah had this experience when, as a shepherd boy, he spent many nights out in the open fields caring for his father’s sheep.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> David was a man of keen perception, with a genuine love for his God, Jehovah. As might be expected, he was deeply impressed by Jehovah’s creations, especially the starry heavens, the beauty of which he had enjoyed so much as a shepherd boy. Expressing his feelings, he said: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind, and the son of earthling man that you take care of him?” Then speaking of man’s position as being lower than the angels, he said: “You also proceeded to make him a little less than godlike ones, and with glory and splendor you then crowned him. You make him dominate over the works of your hands; everything you have put under his feet: small cattle and oxen, all of them, and also the beasts of the open field, the birds of heaven and the fish of the sea, anything passing through the paths of the seas.

David’s inspired expression regarding man’s position has special significance because it prophetically pointed to the One who became the perfect man, Jesus Christ. This One was made lower than godlike ones, or angels, by giving up spirit life to become a man. Being a perfect man, he could <span id="page330" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="330" data-before-text="330"></span>properly dominate the earthly works of God’s hands.

So for the prominent position that God gave man on the earth and for the marvelous things of creation that man can gaze at in wonderment, David gave glory to Jehovah, saying: “How majestic your name is in all the earth!”</p>

<strong>The Bible and Creation in the Light of Modern Science</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> An astronaut comes back from orbiting the earth in a capsule of a few tons and is hailed as a hero. The scientists who devised the mechanism are lauded.

They would dismiss you as a joker or a mental incompetent. Yet, Jehovah put the earth, weighing an estimated six and a half sextillion tons, into perfect orbit with millions of living things on it, with no reentry problems, no worries over oxygen supplies, no need to squeeze food from a tube or to be concerned about how to get rid of body <span id="page588" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="588" data-before-text="588"></span>wastes.

At the same time, suns and planets of incredible size move through space with a speed and precision that stagger the imagination, and that grand system is supposed to have had no designer! Sensible persons appreciate the truth of the words written by Isaiah: “Raise your eyes high up and see. Who has created these things? It is the One who is bringing forth the army of them even by number, all of whom he calls even by name. Due to the abundance of dynamic energy, he [Jehovah] also being vigorous in power, not one of them is missing.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964722/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isa. 40:26</a>) David similarly exclaimed: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you [Jehovah] have prepared, what is mortal man?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964722/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 8:3, 4</a>) So, too, in our day, honest persons recognize that what modern scientific discoveries and inventions emphasize over and over again is the fundamental truth recorded in Genesis, that “in the beginning God created.” Of those who do not believe this, the psalmist states: “The senseless one has said in his heart: ‘There is no Jehovah.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964722/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 14:1</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong>SPECULATIONS DISPROVED</strong></p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">19, 20.

Some thought giraffes got their long necks by stretching higher and higher for the top leaves of trees, and so their offspring were born with long necks. It was thought that people living near the equator got tanned from the hot sun, and then passed the tan to their children, resulting in dark skin. But then an Austrian, Gregor Mendel, discovered the facts of heredity, which prove such things untrue. He found out about the definite, orderly laws that fixed things from parent to offspring “according to its kind,” just as Genesis had recorded. This made the slow change of one form of life into another impossible, for while it allowed for great variety in color, size and shape, it did not result in new forms of life.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> Evolutionists next said that things must have evolved, not by slow changes, but by fast changes in the genes, by mutations. However, of this a scientist recently said: “Whether the mutations are natural or induced by some artificial means such as radiation . . . the evidence today suggests that much more than 99 percent of mutations are undesirable.”<a id="footnotesource7" data-fnid="7" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1964722/6">g</a> Mutations distort, they do not create new kinds.</p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">21.

But no such fossils have been found of creatures whose fins were changing into arms or legs, or whose feet were changing into wings. In short, all the many gaps between family kinds have remained, simply because no connections ever existed! As an article in the London <em>Times</em> (May 19, 1963) on the subject said: “The fossil evidence is really of little help [for evolution] here . . . it is only by a stretch of the imagination that one can visualize a specific transformation of particular specimens . . . into their alleged modern descendants.”</p><p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu">22.

In <span id="page589" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="589" data-before-text="589"></span>the book <em>New Discoveries in Babylonia About Genesis</em> the author states: “It was expected that the more ancient the period, the more primitive would excavators find it to be, until traces of civilization ceased altogether and aboriginal man appeared. Neither in Babylonia nor Egypt, the lands of the oldest known habitations of man, has this been the case. When civilization appears it is already full grown. . . . In the face of these facts, the slow progress of early man is a disproved assumption, and the idea that an infinitely prolonged period elapsed before civilization appeared cannot be maintained.”</p>

This is even more true of what might be called spiritual light, light for the mind and the heart. Without this light men are blind, lost, do not know which way to go, for it simply is not in man himself to direct his own steps. Proof of this is seen in the sorry state of affairs in which men find themselves today. Look where we may, we find confusion, strife and wickedness due to selfishness and conflicting theories as to what is best for man in science and art, in religion and politics.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jer. 10:23</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Who is to blame for this sorry state of affairs? Not the Creator, for he has provided man with spiritual light, with an infallible guide, his Word, the Bible. Concerning it the one man whose life more greatly affected mankind for good than any other one that ever lived, Jesus Christ, once said, “Your word is truth.” It is, as a psalmist long ago expressed it, ‘a lamp for our feet, a light for our roadway.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 17:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ps. 119:105</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">This Word of God is known as The Book and itself consists of sixty-six books. The term “books” here is used in a special sense, since twenty-eight of these are less than six pages in length, and the five shortest average less than a page each of the ordinary Bible. The largest as well as perhaps the best known among the sixty-six books is the book of Psalms, it accounting for about 8 percent of the entire inspired Scriptures.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In the original Hebrew this book was known as <em>T<sup>e</sup>·hil·limʹ,</em> meaning “Praises.” There are 150 of these psalms, almost half of which are credited to David, the shepherd king. Written over a period of more than a thousand years, they do indeed have as their theme the praises of Jehovah God. In them their writers praise Jehovah God, call on others to praise him and give many, many reasons for doing so. Interwoven in among these many psalms is what might be termed an epitome of the Hebrew Scriptures, for in them much is found to throw light on life’s roadway in the way of Bible history, Bible prophecy, Bible doctrine and exhortation to right conduct.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>THE LIGHT OF BIBLE HISTORY</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Information concerning God’s mighty deeds and his dealings with human creatures in times past throws light on life’s roadway.

He wrote many psalms in the eleventh century before the Christian era. In one of such sacred songs contained in the Holy Bible David explained that he did not write under his own driving force. He said: “The utterance of David the son of Jesse, . . . The spirit of Jehovah it was that spoke by me, and his word was upon my tongue.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960722/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Sam. 23:1, 2</a>) Eleven centuries after David’s death, the Christian apostle named Peter wrote two letters that are contained in the Holy Bible. Peter reminded the Christians that the ancient prophets like David released prophecies that were not of their own private thinking or will but that were from a heavenly source. Peter said: “You know this first, that no prophecy of Scripture springs from any private release [or, comes out of private disclosure]. For prophecy was at no time brought by man’s will, but men spoke from God as they were borne along by holy spirit.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960722/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Pet. 1:20, 21</a>, <em>margin</em>) Peter also said: “It was necessary for the scripture [writing] to be fulfilled which the holy spirit spoke beforehand by David’s mouth . . . God spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets of old time.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960722/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 1:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960722/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 3:21</a>) Yes, indeed, the Bible writers wrote, but they wrote under the activating force of the one holy spirit of Jehovah God. They wrote as God’s earthly instruments and wrote in God’s holy name.</p><p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="qu">10. In curing a man, how did Jesus show that God’s spirit has enough driving force to drive a man to write a book?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> God’s holy spirit can move a prophet to write just as easily as it can drive out a demon from a possessed man. The Son of God, Jesus Christ, showed that. He preached the kingdom of God to the people and also did many wonderful miracles. Once he drove out the demon from a possessed man, so that the dumb man both spoke and saw. But Jesus’ religious foes blasphemed the means by which he had cast out the demon. According to the apostle Matthew, Jesus said to them: “If it is by means of God’s spirit that I expel the demons, the kingdom of God has really overtaken you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960722/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 12:28</a>) The disciple Luke quotes Jesus as saying at that time: “If it is by means of God’s finger I expel the demons, the kingdom of God has really overtaken you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960722/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Luke 11:20</a>.</p><p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="qu">11.

But when God used men to write the various books of the Holy Bible, God’s symbolic finger, his spirit, shoved the stylus or pen of these men. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960722/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Deut. 9:10</a>) In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960722/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 8:3</a> David says to God: “I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared.” Long before David, the prophet Moses was used by Jehovah God to bring the third of ten destructive plagues upon the land of Egypt. This was a plague that the magic-practicing priests of Egypt could not imitate. So they said to their ruler, Pharaoh: “It is the finger of God!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960722/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ex. 8:18, 19</a>) In harmony with those uses of the word “finger” we today can say that the Holy Bible is by the finger of God, since the Holy Bible was written under the operation of God’s holy spirit or invisible, active force. Thus his finger wrote it, from start to finish, from Genesis to Revelation. God’s holy spirit or active force is unseen, but it produces visible, tangible results. The Holy Bible is the visible, tangible result produced by God’s spirit, his finger in movement. He is therefore the heavenly Author of the Bible.</p>

Wherever it has been unspoiled by the hands of fallen men, nature breathes wisdom, beauty and harmony. The procession of the seasons with their changing colors, and the infinite variety and loveliness that pervades the human, the animal and plant creations—this all testifies concerning the loving Creator, who made everything “well-arranged in its time.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960042/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:11</a>) These wonders have been perpetuated according to the divine laws through millenniums of time, before ever modern man began to pollute earth and air with the by-products of his science, and human minds with his atheistic teachings. Men of nuclear science, bent on blasting one another off the face of the earth, would do well to pause and consider how the Creator, Jehovah, has used nuclear fission for peaceful purposes throughout billions of years. It was Jehovah, <span id="page46" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="46" data-before-text="46"></span>the perfect Organizer, who made the nuclear furnace called the sun, and placed the earth in orbit—not too far, not too close—so that earthly mortals might receive just the right amount of energy to sustain life. Like David of old, modern-day men of faith and humility are compelled to declare: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind, and the son of earthling man that you take care of him? . . .

A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousands of thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him.” Myriads of angels, serving in grand unison! And now Jehovah, the “ancient of days,” has given into the hands of Christ, yes, to “one like unto a son of man . . . dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960042/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Dan. 7:9-14</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 7.

Surely they are without excuse, for Jehovah’s “invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are understood by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship, so that they [of this “brainy” world] are inexcusable”.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950761/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rom. 1:20</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">But just because today’s so-called scientists and “wise men” are so nearsighted and self-centered that they fail to appreciate that Jehovah God is the great First Cause and Creator of the universe, this is no reason why the rest of mankind need follow their blind course and stupidly stumble into the same pitfall of willful ignorance. Let the well-known scientific facts and figures speak for themselves, and as they show forth and tell of God’s omnipotence, let us consider their testimony with an open, reasoning and logical mind. Consider this earth and our solar system, and, beyond this, the wonders of the universe, its glory, beauty, unity and unlimited expanse. Consider all of this, and a person with a reasonable mind must admit that there is a Creator, and that His wisdom, knowledge, power and eternity are far superior to anyone and anything else in cosmic space.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">First consider this globe upon which we live, man’s home among the stars and planets. To enumerate all the marvelous conditions that make life possible here would take many volumes. Hence, an epitome of some of these wonderful things must suffice. To quote a recent Watchtower publication, <em>Evolution versus The New World,</em> pages 35, 36:</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“The earth is the only planet on which life as we know it could exist. If the earth rotated on its axis much faster or much slower, making days and nights much shorter or longer, all life would die either by freezing at night or by burning during the day. The sun is the earth’s furnace, and our globe is just far enough away to be properly warmed for life to exist. But if the earth traveled much faster or much slower in its orbit around the sun it would be too far from or too close to the sun for life. The sun’s surface temperature of 12,000 degrees Fahrenheit is just right for heating the earth. If the yearly average of <span id="page374" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="374" data-before-text="374"></span>temperature on earth rose or fell fifty degrees, life would roast or freeze. Of all the stars and suns in the universe with their wide variations in size and radiation, it is our sun that is right for earth’s inhabitants. If our moon were much nearer, the tides it causes would overflow the lowlands, erode the mountains, and with continents leveled water would cover the entire earth to a depth of a mile and a half. If the earth were not tilted twenty-three degrees on its axis we would have no seasons, the poles would lie in eternal twilight, water vapor from oceans would move north and south and pile up huge continents of snow and ice in the polar regions, leaving desert in between, and eventually the oceans would disappear and rainfall cease, and the accumulated weight of ice at the poles would cause the equator to bulge, with fearful results. The mixture of gases in the atmosphere is right, and if much different, if much lighter or heavier, life would cease. The mathematical odds that all of these and other essential conditions happened by chance are astronomical, are one in billions.”</p>

<strong>Looking Deeper Into the Heavens</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">HOW long has it been since you took more than just a casual glance at the stars at night? If you do so occasionally, you realize that you do not need binoculars or a telescope to be mentally stunned at the vastness, complexity and grandeur of it all. Almost 3,000 years ago, King David of Israel expressed what many of us sometimes feel. He wrote: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind?”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101984205/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 8:3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">David was talking about the stars visible to his unaided eye. But since the days of Galileo, <span id="page16" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>man’s natural vision has been enhanced by the telescope, and he has learned how much more immense the heavens are than he suspected. He has learned that many of the twinkling stars he can see are in reality huge suns, some much bigger than our own sun. It is only distance that makes them look so small. He has learned also that throughout space there are billions of vast, rotating clusters of suns called galaxies.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The galaxy that our sun belongs to contains billions of other suns. Some galaxies are so huge that it takes light, travelling at nearly 300,000 kilometres (186,000 mi) each <em>second,</em> half a million <em>years</em> to travel from one end of a galaxy to the other. However, most other galaxies, despite their containing innumerable stars as bright or brighter than our sun, are too far away to be seen by the unaided eye.</p>

<strong>The Need for Meaning</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The unknown vast reaches of space are of no concern to the rabbit or the cockroach or the chimpanzee, or to any other animal. But man is awed by its immensity. Long ago King David of Israel saw only two or three thousand stars in the heavens, and just this tiny fraction of universal space caused him to cry out to Jehovah God: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind, and the son of earthling man that you take care of him?”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101980762/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 8:3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">David felt dwarfed by a few thousand stars. With our knowledge of untold millions of galaxies, we should feel microscopic! If the earth is a mere speck of dust in the universe, of what consequence are individuals living on this speck?</p>

<strong>When Day Turned to Night</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">A writer for the Winnipeg “Free Press,” Alice Krueger, said: “The solar eclipse was such a humbling experience, it should really happen more often. At a time when it’s all too easy to get caught up in one’s own self-importance, there’s nothing like the eclipse to put things back into proper perspective.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">“It forced one to contemplate the vastness of the universe and what a small part of it all our planet earth really is. It made one stop and think and it reminded us of how insignificant we, as individual human beings, are in the scheme of things.”</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The Bible psalmist was led to say something similar years ago: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind, and the son of earthling man that you take care of him?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101979565/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 8:3, 4</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101979565/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:26</a>.</p>

<strong>Our Mysterious Universe</strong><br/><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">The humble person knows that the question that Jehovah God asked Job is still proper: “Have you come to know the statutes of the heavens?” The answer is still, No!

Said the Bible writer David: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind, and the son of earthling man that you take care of him?”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101974003/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 8:3, 4</a>.</p>

He wrote: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind, and the son of earthling man that you take care of him?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000162/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 8:3, 4</a>) Despite his limited knowledge of celestial bodies, David understood that he was very insignificant in comparison with the Creator of our vast universe. Today, astronomers know much more about the immensity of the universe and the power that sustains it.

<strong>Do You Really Count With God?</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Three thousand years ago the Hebrew poet-king David of Judah expressed amazement in the following words: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind, and the son of earthling man that you take care of him?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983001/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 8:3, 4</a>) Yes, even though David did not realize it, with his naked eye he was peering into the universe a distance of some 600,000 light-years.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1983001/0">a</a>  He was impressed that the Creator of that vast expanse should also take man into account.</p>

Man, created lower than the angels, would seemingly not merit Jehovah God’s consideration. Yet the psalmist’s question shows that God does care about humans.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Consider: David asked, in essence: ‘What is man that God keeps him in mind, that Jehovah takes care of him?’ Clearly, then, God <em>does</em> keep man in mind.

At night when he lies under a star-studded sky, he can marvel at the Creator’s wisdom and power in making the beautiful heavens. In comparison to them he is so small and insignificant that he has reason to rejoice that their Maker is aware of him and is interested in him. King David of Judah had this experience when, as a shepherd boy, he spent many nights out in the open fields caring for his father’s sheep.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> David was a man of keen perception, with a genuine love for his God, Jehovah.

Expressing his feelings, he said: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind, and the son of earthling man that you take care of him?” Then speaking of man’s position as being lower than the angels, he said: “You also proceeded to make him a little less than godlike ones, and with glory and splendor you then crowned him.

David’s inspired expression regarding man’s position has special significance because it prophetically pointed to the One who became the perfect man, Jesus Christ. This One was made lower than godlike ones, or angels, by giving up spirit life to become a man. Being a perfect man, he could <span id="page330" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="330" data-before-text="330"></span>properly dominate the earthly works of God’s hands.

And how is that? By the different words used in the Hebrew Scriptures in referring to man.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In the English language “man” simply means man. But in Hebrew a number of different words are used, each viewing man from a certain standpoint. Of these, the four main ones are <em>ish,</em> meaning simply man; <em>adám,</em> meaning human or earthling; <em>enósh,</em> meaning weak or mortal; and <em>geber,</em> meaning a physically strong or able-bodied man.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Many translators ignore the different shades of meaning that these words have, but when we once become aware of them we are struck with the care that the Hebrew Scripture writers time and again exercised in choosing just the right word when they wanted to make a point. For example, most translations render <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 8:4</a> quite like the <em>Revised Standard Version</em> does: “What is man that thou art mindful of him, and the son of man that thou dost care for him?” Now the Hebrew word most logically translated “man” is <em>ish,</em> but in writing this psalm David did not use <em>ish</em> in either instance. He was making a contrast between Jehovah God the Creator and his creature, mere man, and so he wrote: “What is <em>enósh</em> . . . and <em>adám?”</em> Or, as rendered by the <em>New World Translation,</em> one of the few English translations doing justice to these fine shades of meaning: “What is <em>mortal</em> man that you keep him in mind, and the son of <em>earthling</em> man that you take care of him?” Yes, compared with the almighty, immortal, divine Spirit, what is this weak mortal creature made of earth, that He should take account of him?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>“ISH” AND “ISHSHÁH”</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><em>Ish,</em> together with its plural form <em>anashím</em> (which at times also serves as the plural of <em>enósh</em>), has primarily the thought of “man,” or a person, an individual. It has no such overtones as human, mortal or able-bodied, although inherent in it is the thought of strength as of a male. The word <em>ish</em> does not appear in the Scriptures until after the word for woman, <em>ishsháh</em>—a man with a womb—appears, for in the <span id="page57" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="57" data-before-text="57"></span>strictest sense of the word only then did an <em>ish</em> become apparent; before that he was called the human, <em>adám.</em> When in the Hebrew Scriptures man is mentioned in relation to woman or sexual intercourse, invariably <em>ish</em> is used, some seventy times in all, although the word for “male” is <em>zakhár</em> and occurs seventy-nine times from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 1:27</a> onward.

<strong>The Need for Meaning</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The unknown vast reaches of space are of no concern to the rabbit or the cockroach or the chimpanzee, or to any other animal. But man is awed by its immensity. Long ago King David of Israel saw only two or three thousand stars in the heavens, and just this tiny fraction of universal space caused him to cry out to Jehovah God: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind, and the son of earthling man that you take care of him?”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101980762/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 8:3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">David felt dwarfed by a few thousand stars.

<strong>When Day Turned to Night</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">A writer for the Winnipeg “Free Press,” Alice Krueger, said: “The solar eclipse was such a humbling experience, it should really happen more often. At a time when it’s all too easy to get caught up in one’s own self-importance, there’s nothing like the eclipse to put things back into proper perspective.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">“It forced one to contemplate the vastness of the universe and what a small part of it all our planet earth really is. It made one stop and think and it reminded us of how insignificant we, as individual human beings, are in the scheme of things.”</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The Bible psalmist was led to say something similar years ago: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind, and the son of earthling man that you take care of him?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101979565/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 8:3, 4</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101979565/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:26</a>.</p>

His Word tells us: “Look! The nations are as a drop from a bucket; and as the film of dust on the scales they have been accounted. . . . There is One who is dwelling above the circle of the earth, the dwellers in which are as grasshoppers.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 40:15,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 22</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Truly, when we consider the matchless Personality, the glorious Person, the exalted position, the eternal existence and the sovereign authority of Jehovah God, the Creator, we must marvel as did the psalmist that He takes note of us.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 144:3</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Scriptural expressions such as these, showing how God views man, might be multiplied, but our interest at this time is in a certain unique way by which he also reveals this truth to us. And how is that? By the different words used in the Hebrew Scriptures in referring to man.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In the English language “man” simply means man. But in Hebrew a number of different words are used, each viewing man from a certain standpoint. Of these, the four main ones are <em>ish,</em> meaning simply man; <em>adám,</em> meaning human or earthling; <em>enósh,</em> meaning weak or mortal; and <em>geber,</em> meaning a physically strong or able-bodied man.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Many translators ignore the different shades of meaning that these words have, but when we once become aware of them we are struck with the care that the Hebrew Scripture writers time and again exercised in choosing just the right word when they wanted to make a point. For example, most translations render <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 8:4</a> quite like the <em>Revised Standard Version</em> does: “What is man that thou art mindful of him, and the son of man that thou dost care for him?” Now the Hebrew word most logically translated “man” is <em>ish,</em> but in writing this psalm David did not use <em>ish</em> in either instance. He was making a contrast between Jehovah God the Creator and his creature, mere man, and so he wrote: “What is <em>enósh</em> . . . and <em>adám?”</em> Or, as rendered by the <em>New World Translation,</em> one of the few English translations doing justice to these fine shades of meaning: “What is <em>mortal</em> man that you keep him in mind, and the son of <em>earthling</em> man that you take care of him?” Yes, compared with the almighty, immortal, divine Spirit, what is this weak mortal creature made of earth, that He should take account of him?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>“ISH” AND “ISHSHÁH”</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><em>Ish,</em> together with its plural form <em>anashím</em> (which at times also serves as the plural of <em>enósh</em>), has primarily the thought of “man,” or a person, an individual. It has no such overtones as human, mortal or able-bodied, although inherent in it is the thought of strength as of a male. The word <em>ish</em> does not appear in the Scriptures until after the word for woman, <em>ishsháh</em>—a man with a womb—appears, for in the <span id="page57" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="57" data-before-text="57"></span>strictest sense of the word only then did an <em>ish</em> become apparent; before that he was called the human, <em>adám.</em> When in the Hebrew Scriptures man is mentioned in relation to woman or sexual intercourse, invariably <em>ish</em> is used, some seventy times in all, although the word for “male” is <em>zakhár</em> and occurs seventy-nine times from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 1:27</a> onward. Typical is <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Leviticus, chapter 20</a>, dealing with God’s law regarding sex relations.</p>

Thus Moses was told that no human could see God and live. Samuel was reminded that a human can see only the outside, but God can see the heart. David prayed that he might not fall into human hands but into God’s hands, for having numbered the fighting men of his nation presumptuously. The temple of Solomon, David said, was to be built, not for humans, but for God. Jehoshaphat counseled the judges to remember that they were judging, not for humans, but for God. Elihu refused to give flattering titles to mere humans.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ex. 33:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 1 Sam. 16:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 1 Chron. 21:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/3" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 29:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/4" data-bid="11-5" class="b"> 2 Chron. 19:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/5" data-bid="11-6" class="b"> Job 32:21</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The psalmist twice asked why the great Creator should take note of mere humans; also, he said that, though certain ones were “gods,” they would die like earthling man.

And to highlight the seriousness of the selfishness of the priests in Malachi’s day, God asked: “Will earthling man rob God?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 8:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 144:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 82:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/3" data-bid="12-4" class="b"> Prov. 29:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/4" data-bid="12-5" class="b"> Isa. 31:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/5" data-bid="12-6" class="b"> Mal. 3:8</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>“ENÓSH”</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The thought behind <em>enósh,</em> weak or mortal, shows, for one thing, that the Hebrew Scripture writers had no illusions about man’s being immortal. How could they, since they received their “theology,” not from pagan sources, but from God himself, who made plain man’s mortal nature both by warning him of death in the event he sinned and by sentencing him, after he had sinned, to return to the dust from which man had been taken.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. 2:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 3:19</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><em>Enósh</em> always has an unfavorable connotation and, therefore, is never used in a complimentary sense. Fittingly, it is frequently coupled with <em>adám,</em> human, when man is contrasted with his immortal Maker, Jehovah God. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalms 8:4 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Ps 144:3</a> are typical of this coupling of <em>enósh</em> with <em>adám</em> when contrasting man with God. Thus also Moses wrote: “You make mortal man [<em>enósh</em>] go back to crushed matter, and you say: ‘Go back, you sons of men [<em>adám</em>].’” Because of the wickedness of man God warned that he would make <em>‘enósh</em> scarcer than refined gold and <em>adám</em> scarcer than the gold of Ophir.’ Putting both <em>enósh</em> and <em>adám</em> in their places are the words of Jehovah to Isaiah: “I myself am the One that is comforting you people. Who are you that you should be afraid of a mortal man [<em>enósh</em>] that will die, and of a son of mankind [<em>adám</em>] that will be rendered as mere green grass? And that you should forget Jehovah your Maker, the One stretching out the heavens and laying the foundation of the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 90:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Isa. 13:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 51:12, 13</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Particularly in the book of Job, which features God’s sovereignty in contrast to man’s puniness, is <em>enósh</em> a favorite term when making this point: “How can mortal man be in the right in a case with God?” “What is mortal man that you should rear him, and that you should set your heart upon him?” “Do you [Jehovah] have eyes of flesh, or is it as a mortal man sees that you see?

King David of Judah had this experience when, as a shepherd boy, he spent many nights out in the open fields caring for his father’s sheep.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> David was a man of keen perception, with a genuine love for his God, Jehovah. As might be expected, he was deeply impressed by Jehovah’s creations, especially the starry heavens, the beauty of which he had enjoyed so much as a shepherd boy. Expressing his feelings, he said: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind, and the son of earthling man that you take care of him?” Then speaking of man’s position as being lower than the angels, he said: “You also proceeded to make him a little less than godlike ones, and with glory and splendor you then crowned him. You make him dominate over the works of your hands; everything you have put under his feet: small cattle and oxen, all of them, and also the beasts of the open field, the birds of heaven and the fish of the sea, anything passing through the paths of the seas. O Jehovah our Lord, how majestic your name is in all the earth!”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966402/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 8:3-9</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 3.

David’s inspired expression regarding man’s position has special significance because it prophetically pointed to the One who became the perfect man, Jesus Christ. This One was made lower than godlike ones, or angels, by giving up spirit life to become a man. Being a perfect man, he could <span id="page330" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="330" data-before-text="330"></span>properly dominate the earthly works of God’s hands. Due to his faithful service to God, he was crowned with honor and glory. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966402/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Heb. 2:9</a>) David did not foresee this prophetic significance of what he wrote, but he did see how man had been blessed by God. So for the prominent position that God gave man on the earth and for the marvelous things of creation that man can gaze at in wonderment, David gave glory to Jehovah, saying: “How majestic your name is in all the earth!”</p>

<strong>Elohim</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">When applying to Jehovah, <em>ʼElo·himʹ</em> is used in the sense of majesty, dignity or excellence, and takes the singular verb, adjective and pronoun. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 7:9</a> it is used with an adjective in the singular number: <em>ʼElo·himʹ tsad·diqʹ,</em> ‘righteous God.’ On this Gesenius-Kautzsch’s <em>Hebrew Grammar,</em> 1949 edition, pages 398, 399, paragraph “g,” says: “The <em>pluralis excellentiae</em> or <em>maiestatis,</em> as has been remarked above, is properly a variety of the abstract plural, since it sums up the several characteristics belonging to the idea, besides <span id="page514" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="514" data-before-text="514"></span>possessing the secondary sense of an <em>intensification</em> of the original idea. It is thus closely related to the plurals of amplification, . . . which are mostly found in poetry. So especially <em>El·o·himʹ Godhead, God</em> (to be distinguished from the numerical plural <em>gods,</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Exodus 12:12</a>, &amp;c.). The supposition that <em>El·o·himʹ</em> is to be regarded as merely a remnant of earlier polytheistic views (that is, as originally only a numerical plural) is at least highly improbable, and, moreover, would not explain the analogous plurals. . . . That the language has entirely rejected the idea of numerical plurality in <em>El·o·himʹ</em> (whenever it denotes <em>one</em> God), is proved especially by its being almost invariably joined with a singular attribute . . . , for example, <em>El·o·himʹ tsad·diqʹ,</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 7:10</a> [9, English], &amp;c. Hence <em>El·o·himʹ</em> may have been used originally not only as a numerical but also as an abstract plural (corresponding to the Latin <em>numen,</em> and our <em>Godhead</em>), and, like other abstracts of the same kind, have been transferred to the concrete single god (even of the heathen).”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><em>The International Standard Bible Encyclopaedia,</em> Volume II, page 1265, comments: “It is characteristic of Heb[rew] that extension, magnitude and dignity, as well as actual multiplicity, are expressed by the pl[ural]. It is not reasonable, therefore, to assume that plurality of form indicates primitive Sem[itic] polytheism. On the contrary, historic Heb[rew] is unquestionably and uniformly monotheistic.” Moses wrote at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>: “Jehovah our God is one Jehovah.”</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">As applied to Jehovah, the title <em>ʼElo·himʹ</em> draws attention to him as the Creator.

Furthermore, when trinitarians, who oppose polytheism, argue that <em>ʼElo·himʹ,</em> when referring to the true God, signifies the numerical plural “gods,” they make themselves polytheists, contrary to the definition of their trinity doctrine that there are three <em>persons</em> in <em>one God,</em> not three <em>gods.</em></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 82:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 6</a>, <em>ʼelo·himʹ</em> is used of men, human judges in Israel.

Accordingly, the <em>New World Translation</em> (1961 ed.) renders <em>ha-ʼElo·himʹ</em> as “the [true] God.”</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The singular form <em>ʼEloʹah</em> is also used with reference to Jehovah (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011300/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Deut. 32:15</a>) and other gods.

<strong>Flight to the True Kingdom Refuge</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[26]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> More than thirteen hundred years after the Deluge, when King David of Jerusalem wrote the eighth psalm <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975726/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps 8</a>, not all the lower earthly creatures were in subjection to man in the sense of being tame and harmless toward man. But in this psalm David prophetically pointed forward to a man who would yet have all of them in subjection. In that psalm David said: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind, and the son <span id="page607" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="607" data-before-text="607"></span>of earthling man that you take care of him?

You made him a little lower than angels; with glory and honor you crowned him, and appointed him over the works of your hands. All things you subjected under his feet.’ For in that he subjected all things to him God left nothing that is not subject to him. Now, though, we do not yet see all things in subjection to him; but we behold Jesus, who has been made a little lower than angels, crowned with glory and honor for having suffered death, that he by God’s undeserved kindness might taste death for every man.”</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="qu">12.

How? By making them subject to the “great crowd” of heirs of the future earthly paradise who will survive the “great tribulation” into God’s new order for our earth. Thus, the wild, ferocious, dangerous animals of today will be made harmless to the earthly worshipers of Jehovah God.

<strong>Settling the Issue of Ownership</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> The question arises, however, as to whether man received a considerable degree of ownership when he was created and given the commission: “Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth and subdue it, and have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and every living creature that is moving upon the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974726/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Gen. 1:28</a>) From this it might be argued that this was so. Did not man’s being created in God’s image include the ability to exercise ownership? Other scriptures might come to mind giving support to this. After the flood, regarding “every living creature,” God said to Noah: “Into your hand they are now given.” Then, too, we recall David’s words when he said to Jehovah: “You make him [mortal man] dominate over the works of your hands; everything you have put under his feet.” Again, the psalmist’s well-known expression will come to mind: “As regards the heavens, to Jehovah the heavens belong, but the earth he has given to the sons of men.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974726/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Gen. 9:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974726/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Ps. 8:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974726/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 115:16</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 6.

He has time to meditate and to examine visually the creations of that almighty One. At night when he lies under a star-studded sky, he can marvel at the Creator’s wisdom and power in making the beautiful heavens. In comparison to them he is so small and insignificant that he has reason to rejoice that their Maker is aware of him and is interested in him. King David of Judah had this experience when, as a shepherd boy, he spent many nights out in the open fields caring for his father’s sheep.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> David was a man of keen perception, with a genuine love for his God, Jehovah. As might be expected, he was deeply impressed by Jehovah’s creations, especially the starry heavens, the beauty of which he had enjoyed so much as a shepherd boy. Expressing his feelings, he said: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind, and the son of earthling man that you take care of him?” Then speaking of man’s position as being lower than the angels, he said: “You also proceeded to make him a little less than godlike ones, and with glory and splendor you then crowned him. You make him dominate over the works of your hands; everything you have put under his feet: small cattle and oxen, all of them, and also the beasts of the open field, the birds of heaven and the fish of the sea, anything passing through the paths of the seas.

David’s inspired expression regarding man’s position has special significance because it prophetically pointed to the One who became the perfect man, Jesus Christ. This One was made lower than godlike ones, or angels, by giving up spirit life to become a man. Being a perfect man, he could <span id="page330" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="330" data-before-text="330"></span>properly dominate the earthly works of God’s hands. Due to his faithful service to God, he was crowned with honor and glory. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966402/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Heb. 2:9</a>) David did not foresee this prophetic significance of what he wrote, but he did see how man had been blessed by God. So for the prominent position that God gave man on the earth and for the marvelous things of creation that man can gaze at in wonderment, David gave glory to Jehovah, saying: “How majestic your name is in all the earth!”</p>

<strong>Light on Life’s Roadway from the Psalms</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">To begin with, the Psalms eloquently and repeatedly call attention to the fact that Jehovah God created all things: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man?” (8:3, 4) “Before the mountains themselves were born, or you proceeded to bring forth as with labor pains the earth and the productive land, even from time indefinite to time indefinite you are God.” (90:2) “Know that Jehovah is God. It is he that has made us, and not we ourselves.” (100:3) <span id="page550" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="550" data-before-text="550"></span>“I shall laud you because in a fear-inspiring way I am wonderfully made.”—139:14.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Among the earliest instances of God’s dealings with his creatures that the book of Psalms records is that of Jehovah concluding a covenant with Abraham and his making sworn statements to Isaac and Jacob. In fulfillment of these promises Jehovah God “brought out his people with exultation” to the land promised.—105:9, 10, 42-44.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Bringing his people Israel into their Promised Land involved many mighty acts, and these the book of Psalms also features. It tells that Jehovah sent ten plagues upon Egypt, that he split the Red Sea so that they could pass over and that he miraculously sustained them in the wilderness, providing bread, meat and water. Noted also are the striking victories God gained for his people in the days of Barak and Gideon.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalms 78,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 83,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 105,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 106,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/4" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> 135</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Then too, the Psalms record that it was necessary for Jehovah God repeatedly to chastise his people, even to the point of bringing them into Babylonian captivity: “By the rivers of Babylon—there we sat down. We also wept when we remembered Zion.” (137:1-9) And they record also Israel’s return from captivity: “When Jehovah gathered back the captive ones of Zion, we became like those who were dreaming. . . . At that time they proceeded to say among the nations: ‘Jehovah has done a great thing in what he has done with them.’” (126:1, 2) Yes, by recording how Jehovah God dealt with his people in times past and why, the book of Psalms throws much light on life’s roadway, for thereby it acquaints us with God’s attributes and principles.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>THE LIGHT OF PROPHECY</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The book of Psalms also serves as a light on life’s roadway by reason of the prophecies it contains, many of which have already been fulfilled, giving confidence that the rest will also have fulfillment. Among the many prophecies of the Psalms regarding Jesus Christ that the Christian Greek Scriptures show had fulfillment were that he would come in dedication to do God’s will (40:8; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 10:7-9</a>); that zeal for God’s house would eat him up, as it were (69:9; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 2:17</a>); that he would be betrayed by an intimate (41:9; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 13:18</a>); that lots would be cast for his garments (22:18; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 19:24</a>); that not a bone of him would be broken (34:20; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 19:36</a>) and that God would not leave his soul in Sheol or Hades.—16:10; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 2:29-31</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Further, the book of Psalms foretold Jesus’ exaltation to the right hand of his Father, there to await God’s due time for him to go into action against God’s enemies and for God to subject all things under Christ’s feet.—110:1, 2; 8:6; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Heb. 1:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 2:8</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The fulfillment of such prophecies instills faith that the prophecies in the Psalms regarding the blessings of the Messianic reign of the King’s Son, Jesus Christ, will also have fulfillment: “Let him judge the afflicted ones of the people, let him save the sons of the poor one, and let him crush the defrauder. He will descend like the rain upon the mown grass, like copious showers that wet the earth. In his days the righteous one will sprout, and the abundance of peace until the moon is no more. There will come to be plenty of grain on the earth; on the top of the mountains there will be an overflow.”—72:4, 6, 7, 16.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>BIBLE TEACHINGS</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The book of Psalms also throws light on life’s roadway by the various Bible teachings it touches on. Fittingly it stresses the role of Jehovah God as the Universal <span id="page551" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="551" data-before-text="551"></span>Sovereign. Though ‘the rulers of earth mass together as one against Jehovah and his anointed one, Jehovah himself will laugh at them in derision, speak to them in his anger and disturb them in hot displeasure.’ (2:1, 2, 4, 5) He will put them in their place, answering the psalmists’ prayers: “Do arise, O Jehovah! Let not mortal man prove superior in strength. Let the nations be judged before your face. Do put fear into them, O Jehovah, that the nations may know that they are but mortal men.” “Fill their faces with dishonor, that people may search for your name, O Jehovah. That people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.”—9:19, 20; 83:16, 18.</p>

On every hand is testimony in his inanimate creation, a simple Bible statement being, “Jehovah God made earth and heaven.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953285/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Gen. 2:4</a>, <em>AS</em>) All of mankind are aware of the existence of the wonderful earth and heavens, but so many do not look beyond the creation to the Creator. In contrast is the sane attitude expressed in the Psalm: “O Jehovah, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth, who hast set thy glory upon the heavens! When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; what is man?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953285/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 8:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953285/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 3, 4</a>, <em>AS</em>) The inanimate creation of God never alters its praise of its Maker, and as men gain more information concerning this part of Jehovah’s creation they find that every proved fact of every science verifies and supports the Scriptural truth of Jehovah’s creatorship.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">11.

It is among the intelligent creation including the human creation that the issue of Jehovah’s supremacy is raised. This issue is not found among the lower animals, and certainly not in the inanimate creation of the earth and heavens, but it is found among humankind, because not all praise their great Benefactor. Men operate, not automatically along fixed lines, as does the inanimate creation, nor through instinct, as do the lower animals. Man is higher, as indicated by this prophecy concerning Jesus, who was made a man: “Thou makest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet: all sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field, the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.

In fact, Jehovah repudiates the claimed support of all who love unrighteousness. His own Proverb (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953285/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Pr 8:13</a>, <em>AS</em>) states: “The fear of Jehovah is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the perverse mouth, do I hate.” As men, we are each faced with the issue on the basis of our heart’s desire. “But each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn, sin, when it has been accomplished, brings forth death. Hence put away all filthiness and that superfluous thing, moral badness, and accept with mildness the implanting of the word which is able to save your souls.

<strong>Flight to the True Kingdom Refuge</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[26]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> More than thirteen hundred years after the Deluge, when King David of Jerusalem wrote the eighth psalm <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975726/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps 8</a>, not all the lower earthly creatures were in subjection to man in the sense of being tame and harmless toward man. But in this psalm David prophetically pointed forward to a man who would yet have all of them in subjection. In that psalm David said: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind, and the son <span id="page607" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="607" data-before-text="607"></span>of earthling man that you take care of him? You also proceeded to make him a little less than godlike ones, and with glory and splendor you then crowned him. You make him dominate over the works of your hands; everything you have put under his feet: small cattle and oxen, all of them, and also the beasts of the open field, the birds of heaven and the fish of the sea, anything passing through the paths of the seas.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975726/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 8:3-8</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="qu">11.

You made him a little lower than angels; with glory and honor you crowned him, and appointed him over the works of your hands. All things you subjected under his feet.’ For in that he subjected all things to him God left nothing that is not subject to him. Now, though, we do not yet see all things in subjection to him; but we behold Jesus, who has been made a little lower than angels, crowned with glory and honor for having suffered death, that he by God’s undeserved kindness might taste death for every man.”</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="qu">12.

On every hand is testimony in his inanimate creation, a simple Bible statement being, “Jehovah God made earth and heaven.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953285/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Gen. 2:4</a>, <em>AS</em>) All of mankind are aware of the existence of the wonderful earth and heavens, but so many do not look beyond the creation to the Creator. In contrast is the sane attitude expressed in the Psalm: “O Jehovah, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth, who hast set thy glory upon the heavens! When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; what is man?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953285/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 8:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953285/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 3, 4</a>, <em>AS</em>) The inanimate creation of God never alters its praise of its Maker, and as men gain more information concerning this part of Jehovah’s creation they find that every proved fact of every science verifies and supports the Scriptural truth of Jehovah’s creatorship.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">11.

It is among the intelligent creation including the human creation that the issue of Jehovah’s supremacy is raised. This issue is not found among the lower animals, and certainly not in the inanimate creation of the earth and heavens, but it is found among humankind, because not all praise their great Benefactor. Men operate, not automatically along fixed lines, as does the inanimate creation, nor through instinct, as do the lower animals. Man is higher, as indicated by this prophecy concerning Jesus, who was made a man: “Thou makest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet: all sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field, the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.

In fact, Jehovah repudiates the claimed support of all who love unrighteousness. His own Proverb (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953285/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Pr 8:13</a>, <em>AS</em>) states: “The fear of Jehovah is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the perverse mouth, do I hate.” As men, we are each faced with the issue on the basis of our heart’s desire. “But each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn, sin, when it has been accomplished, brings forth death. Hence put away all filthiness and that superfluous thing, moral badness, and accept with mildness the implanting of the word which is able to save your souls. However, become doers of the word, and <span id="page244" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="244" data-before-text="244"></span>not hearers only, deceiving yourselves with false reasoning.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953285/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Jas. 1:14, 15,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953285/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 21, 22</a>, <em>NW</em>) Serve the Maker!</p>

<strong>Flight to the True Kingdom Refuge</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[26]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> More than thirteen hundred years after the Deluge, when King David of Jerusalem wrote the eighth psalm <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975726/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps 8</a>, not all the lower earthly creatures were in subjection to man in the sense of being tame and harmless toward man. But in this psalm David prophetically pointed forward to a man who would yet have all of them in subjection. In that psalm David said: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind, and the son <span id="page607" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="607" data-before-text="607"></span>of earthling man that you take care of him? You also proceeded to make him a little less than godlike ones, and with glory and splendor you then crowned him. You make him dominate over the works of your hands; everything you have put under his feet: small cattle and oxen, all of them, and also the beasts of the open field, the birds of heaven and the fish of the sea, anything passing through the paths of the seas.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975726/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 8:3-8</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="qu">11.

But a certain witness has given proof somewhere, saying: ‘What is man that you keep him in mind, or the son of man that you take care of him? You made him a little lower than angels; with glory and honor you crowned him, and appointed him over the works of your hands. All things you subjected under his feet.’ For in that he subjected all things to him God left nothing that is not subject to him. Now, though, we do not yet see all things in subjection to him; but we behold Jesus, who has been made a little lower than angels, crowned with glory and honor for having suffered death, that he by God’s undeserved kindness might taste death for every man.”</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="qu">12.

How? By making them subject to the “great crowd” of heirs of the future earthly paradise who will survive the “great tribulation” into God’s new order for our earth. Thus, the wild, ferocious, dangerous animals of today will be made harmless to the earthly worshipers of Jehovah God. The harmless relationship between beast and man that will then prevail will correspond with the description of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975726/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:6-9</a>, which has already found its fulfillment in the spiritual paradise now enjoyed by Jehovah’s Christian witnesses.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu">14.

In the first instance, after the capital “L” small capital letters are used; but the second time that the same word appears it is printed with an initial capital letter and then the remainder is in lowercase letters.

In comparison to them he is so small and insignificant that he has reason to rejoice that their Maker is aware of him and is interested in him.

You make him dominate over the works of your hands; everything you have put under his feet: small cattle and oxen, all of them, and also the beasts of the open field, the birds of heaven and the fish of the sea, anything passing through the paths of the seas. O Jehovah our Lord, how majestic your name is in all the earth!”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966402/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 8:3-9</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 3.

David’s inspired expression regarding man’s position has special significance because it prophetically pointed to the One who became the perfect man, Jesus Christ. This One was made lower than godlike ones, or angels, by giving up spirit life to become a man. Being a perfect man, he could <span id="page330" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="330" data-before-text="330"></span>properly dominate the earthly works of God’s hands. Due to his faithful service to God, he was crowned with honor and glory. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966402/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Heb. 2:9</a>) David did not foresee this prophetic significance of what he wrote, but he did see how man had been blessed by God. So for the prominent position that God gave man on the earth and for the marvelous things of creation that man can gaze at in wonderment, David gave glory to Jehovah, saying: “How majestic your name is in all the earth!”</p>

<strong>The Happy Family of the Wonder-working God</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Look, for a moment, at some of these glories of God’s creation. Wherever it has been unspoiled by the hands of fallen men, nature breathes wisdom, beauty and harmony. The procession of the seasons with their changing colors, and the infinite variety and loveliness that pervades the human, the animal and plant creations—this all testifies concerning the loving Creator, who made everything “well-arranged in its time.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960042/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:11</a>) These wonders have been perpetuated according to the divine laws through millenniums of time, before ever modern man began to pollute earth and air with the by-products of his science, and human minds with his atheistic teachings. Men of nuclear science, bent on blasting one another off the face of the earth, would do well to pause and consider how the Creator, Jehovah, has used nuclear fission for peaceful purposes throughout billions of years. It was Jehovah, <span id="page46" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="46" data-before-text="46"></span>the perfect Organizer, who made the nuclear furnace called the sun, and placed the earth in orbit—not too far, not too close—so that earthly mortals might receive just the right amount of energy to sustain life. Like David of old, modern-day men of faith and humility are compelled to declare: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind, and the son of earthling man that you take care of him? . . . O Jehovah our Lord, how majestic your name is in all the earth!”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960042/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 8:3-9</a>.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 6.

But if the fullness of the earth is his glory, how much more so the fullness of his peerless spirit creation! Here again is wisdom and organization, but on a magnificent scale: “I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was ancient of days did sit: his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, and the wheels thereof burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousands of thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him.” Myriads of angels, serving in grand unison! And now Jehovah, the “ancient of days,” has given into the hands of Christ, yes, to “one like unto a son of man . . . dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960042/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Dan. 7:9-14</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 7.

Here Jehovah’s loyal organization of the heavens is pictured by “four living creatures,” foursquare in their completeness, and ever ready to zealously do Jehovah’s bidding, for they “ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.” Each of the heads of these living creatures is shown to have the face of a man, of a lion, of an ox and of an eagle, symbolizing the qualities emanating from Jehovah in perfect balance, and which characterize His entire family of the heavens and the earth: boundless love, courageous justice, irresistible power and far-seeing wisdom. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960042/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Revelation 4:1-8</a> gives a similar vision of Jehovah’s glorious organization of holy creatures, his devoted and wide-awake universal organization that ever exults in proclaiming: “Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is coming.”</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 8.

<strong>The Exclusive God</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Jehovah himself later said by his servant Moses: “For Jehovah your God, he is God of gods, and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty, and the terrible, who regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953285/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Deut. 10:17</a>, <em>AS</em>) Today other persons worship the true God and have concern with the honor of his name. Their appreciation of Jehovah’s exclusiveness is expressed in words such as these: “I will give thee thanks with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praises unto thee. Jehovah will perfect that which concerneth <span id="page243" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="243" data-before-text="243"></span>me: thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, endureth for ever; forsake not the works of thine own hands.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953285/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 138:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953285/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 8</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 9.

On every hand is testimony in his inanimate creation, a simple Bible statement being, “Jehovah God made earth and heaven.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953285/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Gen. 2:4</a>, <em>AS</em>) All of mankind are aware of the existence of the wonderful earth and heavens, but so many do not look beyond the creation to the Creator. In contrast is the sane attitude expressed in the Psalm: “O Jehovah, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth, who hast set thy glory upon the heavens! When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; what is man?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953285/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 8:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953285/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 3, 4</a>, <em>AS</em>) The inanimate creation of God never alters its praise of its Maker, and as men gain more information concerning this part of Jehovah’s creation they find that every proved fact of every science verifies and supports the Scriptural truth of Jehovah’s creatorship.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">11.

It is among the intelligent creation including the human creation that the issue of Jehovah’s supremacy is raised. This issue is not found among the lower animals, and certainly not in the inanimate creation of the earth and heavens, but it is found among humankind, because not all praise their great Benefactor. Men operate, not automatically along fixed lines, as does the inanimate creation, nor through instinct, as do the lower animals. Man is higher, as indicated by this prophecy concerning Jesus, who was made a man: “Thou makest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet: all sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field, the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas. O Jehovah, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953285/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ps. 8:6-9</a>, <em>AS;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953285/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Heb. 2:6-9</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">12.

In fact, Jehovah repudiates the claimed support of all who love unrighteousness. His own Proverb (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953285/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Pr 8:13</a>, <em>AS</em>) states: “The fear of Jehovah is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the perverse mouth, do I hate.” As men, we are each faced with the issue on the basis of our heart’s desire. “But each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn, sin, when it has been accomplished, brings forth death. Hence put away all filthiness and that superfluous thing, moral badness, and accept with mildness the implanting of the word which is able to save your souls. However, become doers of the word, and <span id="page244" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="244" data-before-text="244"></span>not hearers only, deceiving yourselves with false reasoning.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953285/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Jas. 1:14, 15,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953285/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 21, 22</a>, <em>NW</em>) Serve the Maker!</p>

Hardly. The ancient psalmist admitted the impossibility of comprehending and commenting on all God’s works. David wrote: “Many things you yourself have done, O Jehovah my God, even your wonderful works . . .

Even if they grew up in a society that dismissed the Creator, our positive, informative expressions may awaken them to recognize God. More than that, it may move them to want to learn of and serve the one who “created all things,” the Doer of wonderful works, Jehovah.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001280/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Revelation 4:11</a>.</p>

<strong>Why We Must Know God’s Name</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Second, exactly what is the implication of the word “name”? We have seen that God has a name, Jehovah, and that his name appears thousands of times in the Bible. We have discussed, too, the importance of restoring that name to its rightful place in the Bible text. If the name is not there, how can the psalmist’s words be fulfilled: “Those knowing your name will trust in you, for you will certainly not leave those looking for you, O Jehovah.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101984306/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 9:10</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">But does ‘knowing God’s name’ involve merely an intellectual knowledge that God’s name in Hebrew is YHWH, or in English, Jehovah? No, it means more than that. When Moses was in Mount Sinai, “Jehovah proceeded to come down in the cloud and station himself with [Moses] there and <em>declare the name of Jehovah.”</em> What did this declaring of the name of Jehovah entail? A description of his qualities: “Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and truth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101984306/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Exodus 34:5, 6</a>) Again, shortly before his death, Moses said to the Israelites: “I shall declare the name of Jehovah.” What followed? Mention of some of His grand attributes, and then a review of what God had accomplished toward Israel for the sake of His name. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101984306/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:3-43</a>) Hence, knowing God’s name means learning what that name represents and worshiping the God who possesses it.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/341/0"><em>United in Worship,</em> pp. 18-19</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Magnify Jehovah as the True God</strong><br/><p id="p38" data-pid="38" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Regarding the significance of God’s name, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101983082/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Psalm 9:10</a> states: “Those knowing your name will trust in you, . . . O Jehovah.” What does <span id="page19" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>that involve? It involves more than just knowing the name Jehovah, which does not automatically mean trusting in Jehovah. “Knowing” God’s name here means appreciating the kind of God that Jehovah is, respecting his authority, obeying his commands. Similarly, ‘walking in the name of Jehovah’ implies being dedicated to him and representing him as one of his worshipers, truly using one’s life in harmony with God’s will. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101983082/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Luke 10:27</a>) Are you doing that?</p>

<strong>Have You Really Come to Know God?</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> An accurate knowledge of God is characterized by complete confidence and trust in him. The psalmist David says: “And those knowing your name will trust in you, for you will certainly not leave those looking for you, O Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974525/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 9:10</a>) Those who know God’s “name,” that is, his characteristics and reputation, will not believe lies about their heavenly Father. If He does or says something they do not readily understand, they will not impute bad motives to him. They know there is a good reason for all that He does even if they do not understand it at the time. And if He seems a little slow to you, surely there is a good explanation. In the first century of the Common Era some felt this way, causing the apostle Peter to write: “Jehovah is not slow respecting his promise, as some people consider slowness, but he is patient with you because he does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974525/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:9</a>) God is just as patient now as then, and people are just as impetuous now as then.</p>

<strong>Hezron</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">According to the reading of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011965/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 2:24</a> in the Masoretic text, Hezron died at Caleb-ephrathah, and after this his widow Abijah bore Ashhur, the father of Tekoa. However, many scholars believe that the Masoretic text does not preserve the original reading, since the name “Caleb-ephrathah” is apparently of ungrammatical Hebrew construction and such a place is not referred to elsewhere in Scripture. Further, Hezron is listed among the seventy “souls of the house of Jacob who came into Egypt,” and therefore must have died in that land. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011965/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Gen. 46:12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011965/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 26, 27</a>) It seems unlikely that a place in Egypt bore the Hebrew name “Caleb-ephrathah.” Hence, numerous <span id="page765" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="765" data-before-text="765"></span>translators have emended <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011965/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 2:24</a> to correspond more to the readings of the <em>Septuagint</em> and the <em>Vulgate. The Jerusalem Bible</em> renders this text: “After Hezron’s death, Caleb married Ephrathah, wife of Hezron his father, who bore him Ashhur, father of Takoa.” The translation by J. B. Rotherham reads: “And after the death of Hezron Caleb entered Ephrathah, and the wife of Hezron was Abiah who bore him Ashhur father of Tekoa.” So, according to these alterations, “Ashhur” is either the “son” of Hezron by Abiah (Abijah) or the “son” of Caleb by Ephrathah.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">3.

<strong>Has God Forgotten Man?</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Not at all. God’s love has provided that men now living shall have an opportunity to know of the Kingdom’s establishment. Jehovah has raised up an international group of Christians who vigorously witness to the fact of the Kingdom’s establishment. They urge all to worship Jehovah, the true God, with hope of surviving <span id="page6" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>his war of Armageddon into God’s new world. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963000/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963000/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Rev. 16:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963000/17/2" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 16</a>) To the very doors of mankind God has sent these witnesses with assurance that he has not forgotten. Their message declares that soon Christ will crush the serpent, Satan, and “break up the works of the Devil.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963000/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Heb. 2:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963000/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 1 John 3:8</a>) Following that victorious Armageddon fight, the King of kings will subdue all enemies, including Adamic death, and bring in a paradise of peace and happiness to the extremity of the earth.

The question is, Who will remember God and survive Armageddon? Jehovah says: “Wicked people will turn back to Sheol, even all the nations forgetting God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963000/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ps. 9:17</a>) Therefore it is important to remember the words of the prophet Malachi and consider our own standing with God. Malachi wrote: “At that time those in fear of Jehovah spoke with one another, each one with his companion, and Jehovah kept paying attention and listening. And a book of remembrance began to be written up before him for those in fear of Jehovah and for those thinking upon his name. ‘And they will certainly become mine,’ Jehovah of armies has said, ‘at the day when I am producing a special property. And I will show compassion upon them, just as a man shows compassion upon his son who is serving him. And you people will again certainly see the distinction between a righteous one and a wicked one, between one serving God and one who has not served him.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963000/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Mal. 3:16-18</a>) Soon no one will ask the railroad man’s question, “How is it . . . bad people seem to have it good?”</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">When Armageddon’s fury breaks in this generation, God will remember those who have served him, just as he remembered to save righteous Noah and his family at the time of the Flood. We have the assurance recorded in his own Word: “God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963000/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Heb. 6:10</a>) We have every reason for confidence in that statement. The evidence shows that Jehovah made provision for man’s deliverance; that he gave believing men his laws to guide them and set a real hope before mankind. Moreover, in spite of the fact that most men have forgotten Him, the Bible shows that God will soon remove the oppressor, restore perfect life to obedient men and resurrect the dead. These are some of the blessings in store for those who remember Jehovah God now and honor his name.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Will you do so?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"></p>

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page131" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="131" data-before-text="131"></span><strong>What Is the Destiny of the Wicked?</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHAT is the destiny of the wicked? That is a question that doubtless many asked upon hearing of the capture of the Nazi criminal, one Eichmann, who had been responsible for the death of millions of Jews and who boasted that he felt no regrets. Will such a man, after his execution, suffer eternal torment in a burning hell? Or does death end all? What destiny does God’s justice decree for such men?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Of this we may be certain: justice will be done. Why? Because God exists, and of him it is written: “I, Jehovah, am loving justice.” Therefore the Scriptural principle holds good: “Whatever a man is sowing, this he will also reap.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961160/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 61:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961160/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Gal. 6:7</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Thus God’s Word assures us that “the righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it.” But “the wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961160/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 37:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961160/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 9:17</a>, <em>AV, Dy.</em></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">This, however, raises the question, Just what is this hell into which the wicked are turned? According to the late Pope Pius XII, hell is a real place of eternal torment. Elucidating his remarks for us, a popular Roman Catholic publication states: “There is nothing doubtful in the words of Christ, the Son of God, about the reality of hell. He plainly said that it is the place to which the unrepentant sinners will be condemned forever, that there ‘the worm dieth not, and the fire is never extinguished,’ and that ‘it is far better to go into heaven blind, maimed and lame, than with two eyes and two hands and with two feet to be cast into the depths of hell.’ . . . And he gave no comforting assurance that only a very few would be condemned to hell; rather he spoke of the throng to whom he would have to say: ‘Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire.”’ This view, it might be added, is also held by many Protestants.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961160/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mark 9:43-48;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961160/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Matt. 25:41</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">But can the torturing of multitudes throughout eternity be harmonized with what the Bible tells about our heavenly Father being just, merciful and loving? Even the laws of imperfect men forbid cruel and unusual punishment. Is God less just and loving than his imperfect and sinful creatures?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961160/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ex. 34:6, 7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961160/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 John 4:8</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Further, if Jesus’ words regarding the destiny of the wicked are to be taken literally, is it not passing strange that, while the Bible tells us of God creating heaven and earth, it says nothing about his creating <span id="page132" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="132" data-before-text="132"></span>a place of eternal torment, nor of a purgatory, for that matter? When was hell created? Before any of God’s creatures sinned, or only thereafter? And where is it?</p>

<strong>“Man” in the Hebrew Scriptures</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Even as <em>adám</em> sets man apart from the lower animals, so it also calls attention to <span id="page58" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="58" data-before-text="58"></span>man’s inferiority to the Creator, Jehovah God. Thus Moses was told that no human could see God and live. Samuel was reminded that a human can see only the outside, but God can see the heart. David prayed that he might not fall into human hands but into God’s hands, for having numbered the fighting men of his nation presumptuously. The temple of Solomon, David said, was to be built, not for humans, but for God. Jehoshaphat counseled the judges to remember that they were judging, not for humans, but for God. Elihu refused to give flattering titles to mere humans.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ex. 33:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 1 Sam. 16:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 1 Chron. 21:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/3" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 29:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/4" data-bid="11-5" class="b"> 2 Chron. 19:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/5" data-bid="11-6" class="b"> Job 32:21</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The psalmist twice asked why the great Creator should take note of mere humans; also, he said that, though certain ones were “gods,” they would die like earthling man. The fear of humans brings a snare, but he that trusts in Jehovah will be safe. Why go down to Egypt for help? The Egyptians are not spirits but mere humans, earthlings. And to highlight the seriousness of the selfishness of the priests in Malachi’s day, God asked: “Will earthling man rob God?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 8:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 144:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 82:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/3" data-bid="12-4" class="b"> Prov. 29:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/4" data-bid="12-5" class="b"> Isa. 31:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/5" data-bid="12-6" class="b"> Mal. 3:8</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>“ENÓSH”</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The thought behind <em>enósh,</em> weak or mortal, shows, for one thing, that the Hebrew Scripture writers had no illusions about man’s being immortal. How could they, since they received their “theology,” not from pagan sources, but from God himself, who made plain man’s mortal nature both by warning him of death in the event he sinned and by sentencing him, after he had sinned, to return to the dust from which man had been taken.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. 2:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 3:19</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><em>Enósh</em> always has an unfavorable connotation and, therefore, is never used in a complimentary sense. Fittingly, it is frequently coupled with <em>adám,</em> human, when man is contrasted with his immortal Maker, Jehovah God. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalms 8:4 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Ps 144:3</a> are typical of this coupling of <em>enósh</em> with <em>adám</em> when contrasting man with God. Thus also Moses wrote: “You make mortal man [<em>enósh</em>] go back to crushed matter, and you say: ‘Go back, you sons of men [<em>adám</em>].’” Because of the wickedness of man God warned that he would make <em>‘enósh</em> scarcer than refined gold and <em>adám</em> scarcer than the gold of Ophir.’ Putting both <em>enósh</em> and <em>adám</em> in their places are the words of Jehovah to Isaiah: “I myself am the One that is comforting you people. Who are you that you should be afraid of a mortal man [<em>enósh</em>] that will die, and of a son of mankind [<em>adám</em>] that will be rendered as mere green grass? And that you should forget Jehovah your Maker, the One stretching out the heavens and laying the foundation of the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 90:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Isa. 13:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 51:12, 13</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Particularly in the book of Job, which features God’s sovereignty in contrast to man’s puniness, is <em>enósh</em> a favorite term when making this point: “How can mortal man be in the right in a case with God?” “What is mortal man that you should rear him, and that you should set your heart upon him?” “Do you [Jehovah] have eyes of flesh, or is it as a mortal man sees that you see? Are your days like the days of mortal man, or your years just like the days of an able-bodied man?” “As one trifles with mortal man will you trifle with [God]? “ “God is much more than mortal man.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Job 9:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 7:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/2" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 10:4, 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/3" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> 13:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/4" data-bid="16-5" class="b"> 33:12</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">From his prayers we can see that David had a like keen appreciation: “Do arise, O Jehovah!

<strong>“Your Plans Will Be Firmly Established”</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">As we have already noted, the heart is treacherous and is capable of carrying out false reasoning. For example, a person may commit a sin, and his heart may resort to self-justification. Instead of abandoning his sinful course, the individual may reason that God is loving, kind, merciful, and forgiving. Such a man has said in his heart: “God has forgotten. He has concealed his face. He will certainly never see it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007365/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Psalm 10:11</a>) However, it is improper and dangerous to presume upon God’s mercy.</p>

What solution does the Bible offer?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">IN THE privacy of their modest home a serious-faced railroad man and his wife discussed life’s problems with a visiting minister. They had experienced their share of sickness, worry and the struggle to make a living, but they were not complaining. Yet the man of the house did have a question that had often puzzled him: “How is it that a man who tries to live right has such a hard time, while bad people seem to have it good?” This situation made him wonder if God had forgotten. How would you explain it?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The minister had been asked that question before. In fact, people were asking just about the same thing in the days of the prophet Malachi. Here is what the prophet told his countrymen: “You have said, ‘It is of no value to serve God. And what profit is there in that we have kept the obligation to him, and that we have walked dejectedly on account of Jehovah of armies? And at present we are pronouncing presumptuous people happy. Also, the doers of wickedness have been built up. Also, they have tested God out and keep getting away.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963000/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mal. 3:14, 15</a>) Even men who loved God and served him faithfully sometimes asked: “Has God forgotten to be favorable, or has he shut off his mercies in anger?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963000/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 77:9</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Today lawbreakers still echo the insolence of the wicked men who boasted: “God has forgotten.

Both good and bad people have imagined that God has forgotten man. In our day some arrive at that conclusion, not only because of personal problems, but due to the condition of the world in general.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">For example, they reflect on the fact that in spite of many prayers for peace, our century has seen two world wars. They hear of prayer campaigns to convert atheist Russia, but the dangerous cold war continues. Compounding the risk is the ever-present threat of nuclear war.

<strong>Recognizing the Power of Wrong Desire</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> Achan had entertained and fulfilled a wrong desire. But in spite of his self-confidence his actions did not go unnoticed. It is true that no human eyes perceived his disobedient act, but the eyes of God had. Since the God of Israel would not allow the presence of such a person to corrupt his chosen people, he let it be known to Joshua that Israel was defiled in his eyes by an act of willful disobedience and thievery. “In turn Jehovah said to Joshua: ‘Get up, you! Why is it that you are falling upon your face? Israel has sinned and they have also overstepped my covenant that I laid as a command upon them and they have also taken some of the thing devoted to destruction and have also stolen and also kept it secret and have also put it among their own articles. And the sons of Israel will not be able to rise up against their enemies. The back is what they will turn before their enemies, because they have become a thing devoted to destruction. I shall not prove to be with <span id="page398" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="398" data-before-text="398"></span>you again unless you annihilate the thing devoted to destruction out of your midst.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957487/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Josh. 7:10-12</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 4. How was he found and punished?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Joshua then had each tribe pass before him, and God indicated to him that the guilty man was in the tribe of Judah. Then from that tribe the family of the Zerahites was picked. Each man of that family passed by, and then Achan’s turn came. When he came before Joshua, God indicated that this was the guilty man. “Then Joshua said to Achan: ‘My son, render, please, glory to Jehovah the God of Israel and make confession to him, and tell me, please, What have you done? Do not conceal it from me.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957487/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Josh. 7:19</a>, <em>NW</em>) When Achan confessed his wicked act, men went to his tent and uncovered the loot and brought it to Joshua. Achan was then taken outside the camp and stoned to death. Thus the desire that led to his sin brought about his death.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 5. What can we learn from Achan’s experience?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Achan’s experience clearly illustrates the power of wrong desire and what it leads to. It shows that even though the fulfilling of a wrong desire may be in secret it does not go unnoticed. Jehovah God, the Universal Sovereign, sees it. But wicked men like Achan fail to recognize this fact. “He says to himself, ‘God has forgotten; he has hidden his face; he will never see it.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957487/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 10:11</a>, <em>AT</em>) But Jehovah does see it, and he will not forget. Thus a person must be very careful about the desires he cultivates, making sure they are not bad ones.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 6. What should be kept in mind?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> He should keep in mind what the Bible writer James said about wrong desires and what they lead to. “But each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn, sin, when it has been accomplished, brings forth death.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957487/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jas. 1:14, 15</a>, <em>NW</em>) And so it was with Achan. His desire for a gold bar, some silver and a garment led to sin and the sin to death. Thus when you feel desire’s magnetic attraction pulling you toward something that is Scripturally wrong, call to mind what the Bible says about desire. Remember what happened to Achan. Then exert your will power to resist the attraction. If you fail to put up a strong resistance the desire will grow steadily stronger until it becomes fertile by causing you to sin. That in turn warrants from God a judgment of destruction.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>MANY HAVE SUCCUMBED TO WRONG DESIRES</strong></p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 7. What mistake have some persons made?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Over the years past there have been dedicated Christians who thought they could toy with a wrong desire without injury to themselves. They were not wary of its power. So when they were enticed by it, they did not put it out of mind. They instead entertained the desire. They thought about it. As they did, their resistance grew weaker until the desire overpowered them, and they allowed it to become fertile. By such wrong action they became unclean in God’s eyes and were unfit to remain in his theocratic organization, just as Achan became unfit to remain in it. Hence God disfellowshiped them. He no longer accepted them as his servants. Over a period of time only a small number of these showed sincere repentance and by God’s undeserved kindness were forgiven their sin. They were then permitted to reenter the theocratic organization. But this return to God’s favor was a very, very difficult road. It would have been much better for them to have resisted the wrong desire in the first place.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 8. What did Peter have to say about those who fulfilled wrong desires without showing repentance?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Those who failed to show sincere repentance are faced with eternal destruction. They are the ones the apostle Peter speaks about when he says: “Furthermore, <span id="page399" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="399" data-before-text="399"></span>many will turn out of the way and follow their acts of loose conduct, and on account of these the way of the truth will be spoken of abusively. Also with covetousness they will exploit you with counterfeit words. But as for them, the judgment of ancient times is not moving slowly, and the destruction of them is not slumbering.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957487/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Pet. 2:2, 3</a>, <em>NW</em>) Thus wrong desires are not to be mentally toyed with but rather put completely out of mind. Do not let them get rooted.</p>

The exceptional quality of his love was demonstrated by providing this beautiful earth as their home and settling the first human pair in a gorgeously prepared section of it. Even when Adam and Eve rebelled against him, Jehovah continued to manifest his love by permitting them to live for a time so that we and the rest of mankind could come into existence and learn of his grand provisions. It is true that allowing sinful creatures to live has resulted in much trouble on earth, and even though wicked angels and evilly inclined <span id="page230" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="230" data-before-text="230"></span>men are the ones responsible, our loving Creator has often been the one unjustly blamed. Nevertheless, he has borne the reproach, and has continued to shower blessings on mankind.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Gen. 2:8, 9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/15/2" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 3:16-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/15/3" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> Deut. 32:4, 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/15/4" data-bid="16-5" class="b"> Rev. 12:9</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Jesus Christ drew attention to these blessings from our Father when he said: “He makes his sun rise upon wicked people and good and makes it rain upon righteous people and unrighteous.” An apostle of Jesus also pointed to this loving care for mankind, crediting God with giving “rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts to the full with food and good cheer.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 5:45;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Acts 14:17</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">But in addition to these loving provisions for man’s present needs, our God has mercifully provided for obedient humans to enjoy everlasting life. Think of it! God’s original purpose to have his earthly children enjoy a paradise home forever will be realized. Already he has made arrangements to relieve man of sin by sending his beloved heavenly Son to earth as a ransom. Concerning this provision the Bible explains: “By means of him we have the release by ransom through the blood of that one, yes, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his undeserved kindness.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Eph. 1:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Acts 13:38</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">What a wonderful demonstration of love for mankind! “God loved the world [of mankind] so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.” How grateful we are! Because of the intervention of God’s mercy the hope of everlasting life in happiness is opened to all mankind.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Do not these loving provisions of our God endear him to you? Indeed, “Jehovah is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness.” You can go to him in prayer, and “throw all your anxiety upon him, because he cares for you.” O how his love recommends him to us! Yet, at the same time, God’s love and mercy are perfectly balanced by his justice.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 103:8-14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 5:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/19/2" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> Ps. 55:22</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="ss"><strong>A LOVER OF JUSTICE</strong></p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">His dealings are in complete harmony with this inspired description of him: “Perfect is his activity, for all his ways are justice. A God of faithfulness, with whom there is no injustice; righteous and upright is he.” As we would expect of such a just ruler, his laws and commandments are not harsh or burdensome, nor does he exploit mankind. However, God does require obedience, and when persons become hardened in a course of evildoing, his justice requires due punishment. He himself tells us: “I, Jehovah, am loving justice, hating robbery along with unrighteousness. And I will give their wages in trueness.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Deut. 32:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Isa. 61:8</a>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">We can be confident that when God metes out wages his justice will be tempered with mercy. Jehovah takes no delight in killing anyone, but, in fact, pleads with evildoers: “Turn back, turn back from your bad ways, for why is it that you should die?” It is because of this patience and kindness of our God that many persons have wrongly concluded that he does not notice unrighteousness, and will never execute justice against evildoers. But his inspired Word shows how wrong they are.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ezek. 33:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Zeph. 1:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/21/2" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> Ps. 10:13</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">The Scriptures prove conclusively that God does observe. “The One planting the ear, can he not hear? Or the One forming the eye, can he not look?” Of course he can, and, in time, he will execute justice, as the Bible psalmist goes on to show: “Jehovah is knowing the thoughts of men . . . And he will turn back upon them their hurtfulness and will silence them with their own calamity. Jehovah our God will <span id="page231" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="231" data-before-text="231"></span>silence them.” Happily, we are fast approaching the day when Jehovah God will clean this earth of all unrighteousness. How grateful we can be that our God is a lover of justice!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ps. 94:6-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 37:9-11</a>.</p>

What can we learn from his exercise of patience?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">‘IF God is Almighty, why does he allow evildoing to continue without doing something about it?’ This question has become commonplace as a result of the constant increase of wickedness. But it is a question to which you should know the answer, because it directly affects your worship of God.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Just as many people today misunderstand why God allows evildoing, so also did persons in past generations. “Because sentence against a bad work has not been executed speedily,” wrote wise King Solomon, “the heart of the sons of men has become fully set in them to do bad.” Similarly, Solomon’s father David observed why the wicked one did not respect God: “He has said in his heart: ‘[God] will not require an accounting.’” Toward the end of the kingdom of Judah’s existence this had become the attitude of the people, for they were saying in their heart, “Jehovah will not do good, and he will not do bad.” Yes, they interpreted the existence of evildoing as evidence that God was weak, or that he was unconcerned. They came to believe he would not take any action whatsoever.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963321/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eccl. 8:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963321/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ps. 10:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963321/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Zeph. 1:12</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">But contrary to what people thought, God was interested, and he did take an accounting. Some forty years after the prophet Zephaniah recorded the above words God executed judgment by bringing Babylon’s armies against his irreformable people. But why did he wait so long before executing judgment? Because God is patient.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>EVIDENCE OF GOD’S PATIENCE</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">How desirable is the quality of patience, especially in a person of power! It is an evidence of genuine love, long-suffering and self-control. According to <em>Webster’s Third New International Dictionary,</em> “patience” is defined as “the capacity or habit of enduring evil, adversity or pain with fortitude.” And “patient” means: “Bearing pains or trials calmly or uncomplainingly; exhibiting power to endure hardship or physical or mental distress; manifesting forbearance under provocation or strain.” And another dictionary includes the thought of being “expectant with calmness or without discontent; also, undisturbed by obstacles, delays . . . persevering.”</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In what a wonderful way Almighty God exercises this quality! When the covering cherub in the garden of Eden turned the first human pair away from him, how it must have pained God! Yet he allowed the rebellion to continue and grow, even though he had the power to wipe it out immediately. But in what way has the enduring <span id="page262" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="262" data-before-text="262"></span>of this evil rebellion and the resulting history of wickedness been beneficial? Why show patience with rebellious persons?</p>

<strong>Arm</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A limb of the human body. The Hebrew and Greek terms for “arm” (<em>zerohʹaʽ; bra·khiʹon</em>) are often used figuratively in the Bible to represent the ability to exert strength or power.

<strong>What Is “the Kingdom of God?”</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the Bible “kingdom” sometimes denotes <em>sovereignty, royal power, dominion, the state of being a king,</em> that is to say, <em>kingship.</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101979052/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 145:11-13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101979052/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Dan. 1:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101979052/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 2:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101979052/2/3" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 8:1</a>) The Word of God makes it plain that the Creator has always held kingship in this sense. “Jehovah is King to time indefinite, even forever,” declared the psalmist. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101979052/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 10:16</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101979052/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Daniel 4:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101979052/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 34, 35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101979052/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 1 Timothy 1:17</a>.) The Bible uses the term “kingdom” also for the <em>means used to express a king’s sovereignty.</em> Consider how the Scriptures develop this matter.</p>

Nevertheless, the one who made speech possible can decipher the prayers of those who accept his invitation to approach him with their petitions. His hearing does not depend on sound waves nor does it pose a problem when the air waves are choked with meaningless chatter of godless ones.

Thus Moses was told that no human could see God and live. Samuel was reminded that a human can see only the outside, but God can see the heart. David prayed that he might not fall into human hands but into God’s hands, for having numbered the fighting men of his nation presumptuously. The temple of Solomon, David said, was to be built, not for humans, but for God. Jehoshaphat counseled the judges to remember that they were judging, not for humans, but for God. Elihu refused to give flattering titles to mere humans.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ex. 33:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 1 Sam. 16:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 1 Chron. 21:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/3" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 29:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/4" data-bid="11-5" class="b"> 2 Chron. 19:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/5" data-bid="11-6" class="b"> Job 32:21</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The psalmist twice asked why the great Creator should take note of mere humans; also, he said that, though certain ones were “gods,” they would die like earthling man. The fear of humans brings a snare, but he that trusts in Jehovah will be safe. Why go down to Egypt for help? The Egyptians are not spirits but mere humans, earthlings. And to highlight the seriousness of the selfishness of the priests in Malachi’s day, God asked: “Will earthling man rob God?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 8:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 144:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 82:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/3" data-bid="12-4" class="b"> Prov. 29:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/4" data-bid="12-5" class="b"> Isa. 31:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/5" data-bid="12-6" class="b"> Mal. 3:8</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>“ENÓSH”</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The thought behind <em>enósh,</em> weak or mortal, shows, for one thing, that the Hebrew Scripture writers had no illusions about man’s being immortal. How could they, since they received their “theology,” not from pagan sources, but from God himself, who made plain man’s mortal nature both by warning him of death in the event he sinned and by sentencing him, after he had sinned, to return to the dust from which man had been taken.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. 2:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 3:19</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><em>Enósh</em> always has an unfavorable connotation and, therefore, is never used in a complimentary sense. Fittingly, it is frequently coupled with <em>adám,</em> human, when man is contrasted with his immortal Maker, Jehovah God. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalms 8:4 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Ps 144:3</a> are typical of this coupling of <em>enósh</em> with <em>adám</em> when contrasting man with God. Thus also Moses wrote: “You make mortal man [<em>enósh</em>] go back to crushed matter, and you say: ‘Go back, you sons of men [<em>adám</em>].’” Because of the wickedness of man God warned that he would make <em>‘enósh</em> scarcer than refined gold and <em>adám</em> scarcer than the gold of Ophir.’ Putting both <em>enósh</em> and <em>adám</em> in their places are the words of Jehovah to Isaiah: “I myself am the One that is comforting you people. Who are you that you should be afraid of a mortal man [<em>enósh</em>] that will die, and of a son of mankind [<em>adám</em>] that will be rendered as mere green grass? And that you should forget Jehovah your Maker, the One stretching out the heavens and laying the foundation of the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 90:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Isa. 13:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 51:12, 13</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Particularly in the book of Job, which features God’s sovereignty in contrast to man’s puniness, is <em>enósh</em> a favorite term when making this point: “How can mortal man be in the right in a case with God?” “What is mortal man that you should rear him, and that you should set your heart upon him?” “Do you [Jehovah] have eyes of flesh, or is it as a mortal man sees that you see? Are your days like the days of mortal man, or your years just like the days of an able-bodied man?” “As one trifles with mortal man will you trifle with [God]? “ “God is much more than mortal man.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Job 9:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 7:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/2" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 10:4, 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/3" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> 13:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/4" data-bid="16-5" class="b"> 33:12</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">From his prayers we can see that David had a like keen appreciation: “Do arise, O Jehovah!
