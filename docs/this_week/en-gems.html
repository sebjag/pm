<strong>Salt</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Because salt prevented decay, it became a symbol of stability and permanence.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● What is the meaning of</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Mark 9:49, 50</strong></a> <strong>(<em>NW</em>): “For everyone must be salted with fire. Salt is fine; but if ever the salt loses its strength, with what will you mix it? Have salt in yourselves, and keep peace between one another”?—A. C., United States.</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Mosaic law required that sacrifices be seasoned with salt: “Every offering of your grain offering you will season with salt, and you must not allow the salt of the covenant of your God to be missing upon your grain offering. Along with every offering of yours you will present salt.” Why? Salt is a preservative and prevents putrefaction. Two verses earlier the offering of anything fermented was forbidden. Salt with the sacrifice was to avoid any fermentation. Preventing change by decay, salt assured permanence, and was used in conjunction with a covenant to indicate the unchangeableness and permanence of the agreement, that the parties involved in the covenant were to be steadfast and faithful to its terms, not corrupting them: “All the holy contributions, which the sons of Israel will contribute to Jehovah, I have given to you and your sons and your daughters with you, as an allowance to time indefinite. It is a covenant of salt before Jehovah for you and your offering with you.” Also, “Ought ye not to know that Jehovah, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?” So salt symbolizes permanence and incorruptibility, and was offered with grain and meat offerings.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Lev. 2:13,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Num. 18:19</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Chron. 13:5</a>, <em>AS;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezek. 43:24</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Among ancient peoples it was a sign of friendship to eat salt together, and denoted perpetual fidelity and loyalty. This ancient view is reflected at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezra 4:14</a> (<em>AT</em>): “Now because we eat the salt of the palace and it is not fitting for us to behold the king’s dishonor, therefore we have sent and informed the king.” The one sacrificing on Jehovah’s altar was considered as a partaker with Jehovah; so the use of salt with the sacrifices indicated partaking of salt with him, which symbolized perpetual loyalty.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">If the friendship was corrupted by disloyalty or impure conduct the symbolical salt was said to have lost its strength: “Salt, to be sure, is fine. But if even the salt loses its strength, with what will it be mixed? It is suitable neither for soil nor for manure. People throw it outside.” <em>The Westminster Dictionary of the Bible</em> says on page 525: “The impure salt of Syria, when exposed to the rain and sun or stored in damp houses, is apt to lose its taste and become useless. It cannot be used like much other refuse as a fertilizer, for it is good for nothing.” Because the true followers of Jesus, by example and by preaching, would be an influence to preserve from putrefaction and moral decay, Jesus called them “the salt of the earth.” He also called them “the light of the world.” Just as they were a light to dispel the darkness engulfing the world, so they were salt able to preserve the earth from corruption. But if they lost their spiritual strength they would be good for nothing and cast off: “If the salt loses its strength, how will its saltness be restored? It is no longer good for anything but to be thrown outside to be trampled on by men.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 14:34, 35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Matt. 5:13, 14</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Having established that salt is a symbol of purity and incorruptibility, of permanence and steadfastness and loyalty, we now consider the text quoted in the question. “For everyone must be salted with fire.” Because of their erroneous belief in a fiery hell of torment, and because of the preceding verses, many Bible commentators say this means the wicked are permanently preserved in the fires of hell, though at the same time acknowledging the difficulties of such a view. Let us get the setting. Jesus is talking, not to the wicked, not to the general public, but privately to his disciples: “And if ever your hand makes you stumble, cut it off; it is finer for you to enter into life maimed than with two hands to go off into Gehenna, into the fire that cannot be put out. And if your foot makes you stumble, cut it off; it is finer for you to enter into life crippled than with two feet to be pitched into Gehenna. And if your eye makes you stumble, throw it away; it is finer for you to enter one-eyed into the kingdom of God, than with two eyes to be pitched into Gehenna, where their maggot does not die and the fire is not put out. For everyone must be salted with fire. Salt is fine; but if ever the salt loses its strength, with what will you mix it? Have salt in yourselves, and keep peace between one another.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mark 9:43-50</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Obviously this is figurative speech, not to be applied literally. Who will be so absurd as to <span id="page191" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="191" data-before-text="191"></span>say Jesus meant for his followers to chop off hands or feet or pluck out eyes? No hell-fire believer today applies this literally, cutting off his hand when it does something wrong or a foot when it strays or gouging out an eye if it looks in lust. We know the salt is symbolical. To be consistent, the fire must be also. In this figurative language Jesus was saying that if anything as dear as a hand or a foot or an eye interfered with faithful service, cut loose from it! Better to be without this dear thing and be pure and faithful and steadfast to Jehovah and enter the kingdom of heaven than to hold on to the cherished person or possession or practice and be destroyed, as symbolized by Gehenna, the valley outside Jerusalem where garbage and even bodies of criminals considered unworthy of a resurrection were thrown to be consumed by the fires kept burning there day and night, or to be disposed of by the maggots if out of reach of the flames. The fire symbolized everlasting destruction.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● What is the meaning of</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Mark 9:49, 50</strong></a> <strong>(<em>NW</em>): “For everyone must be salted with fire. Salt is fine; but if ever the salt loses its strength, with what will you mix it? Have salt in yourselves, and keep peace between one another”?—A. C., United States.</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Mosaic law required that sacrifices be seasoned with salt: “Every offering of your grain offering you will season with salt, and you must not allow the salt of the covenant of your God to be missing upon your grain offering. Along with every offering of yours you will present salt.” Why? Salt is a preservative and prevents putrefaction. Two verses earlier the offering of anything fermented was forbidden. Salt with the sacrifice was to avoid any fermentation. Preventing change by decay, salt assured permanence, and was used in conjunction with a covenant to indicate the unchangeableness and permanence of the agreement, that the parties involved in the covenant were to be steadfast and faithful to its terms, not corrupting them: “All the holy contributions, which the sons of Israel will contribute to Jehovah, I have given to you and your sons and your daughters with you, as an allowance to time indefinite. It is a covenant of salt before Jehovah for you and your offering with you.” Also, “Ought ye not to know that Jehovah, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?” So salt symbolizes permanence and incorruptibility, and was offered with grain and meat offerings.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Lev. 2:13,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Num. 18:19</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Chron. 13:5</a>, <em>AS;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezek. 43:24</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Among ancient peoples it was a sign of friendship to eat salt together, and denoted perpetual fidelity and loyalty. This ancient view is reflected at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezra 4:14</a> (<em>AT</em>): “Now because we eat the salt of the palace and it is not fitting for us to behold the king’s dishonor, therefore we have sent and informed the king.” The one sacrificing on Jehovah’s altar was considered as a partaker with Jehovah; so the use of salt with the sacrifices indicated partaking of salt with him, which symbolized perpetual loyalty.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">If the friendship was corrupted by disloyalty or impure conduct the symbolical salt was said to have lost its strength: “Salt, to be sure, is fine. But if even the salt loses its strength, with what will it be mixed? It is suitable neither for soil nor for manure. People throw it outside.” <em>The Westminster Dictionary of the Bible</em> says on page 525: “The impure salt of Syria, when exposed to the rain and sun or stored in damp houses, is apt to lose its taste and become useless. It cannot be used like much other refuse as a fertilizer, for it is good for nothing.” Because the true followers of Jesus, by example and by preaching, would be an influence to preserve from putrefaction and moral decay, Jesus called them “the salt of the earth.” He also called them “the light of the world.” Just as they were a light to dispel the darkness engulfing the world, so they were salt able to preserve the earth from corruption. But if they lost their spiritual strength they would be good for nothing and cast off: “If the salt loses its strength, how will its saltness be restored? It is no longer good for anything but to be thrown outside to be trampled on by men.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 14:34, 35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Matt. 5:13, 14</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Having established that salt is a symbol of purity and incorruptibility, of permanence and steadfastness and loyalty, we now consider the text quoted in the question. “For everyone must be salted with fire.” Because of their erroneous belief in a fiery hell of torment, and because of the preceding verses, many Bible commentators say this means the wicked are permanently preserved in the fires of hell, though at the same time acknowledging the difficulties of such a view. Let us get the setting. Jesus is talking, not to the wicked, not to the general public, but privately to his disciples: “And if ever your hand makes you stumble, cut it off; it is finer for you to enter into life maimed than with two hands to go off into Gehenna, into the fire that cannot be put out. And if your foot makes you stumble, cut it off; it is finer for you to enter into life crippled than with two feet to be pitched into Gehenna. And if your eye makes you stumble, throw it away; it is finer for you to enter one-eyed into the kingdom of God, than with two eyes to be pitched into Gehenna, where their maggot does not die and the fire is not put out. For everyone must be salted with fire. Salt is fine; but if ever the salt loses its strength, with what will you mix it? Have salt in yourselves, and keep peace between one another.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955211/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mark 9:43-50</a>, <em>NW.</em></p>

These three men were obedient to law, and the law of obedience and loyalty to it was the first law. They had done nothing in defiance of the king, only refusing (and that not ostentatiously) compliance with a command that violated the right of conscience. Surely their abstinence because of conscience was not to the injury of others. They were not persuading others to do the same, though other Israelites were strengthened by their loyal adherence to God’s law. Their minds were decisive in the test and the ready answer was, “Be it known unto thee, O king.” These men were ‘rendering to Caesar what belonged to him’, and making sure Jehovah received what belonged to him. When Caesar arrogates to himself the things which are Jehovah’s, then his authority is to be resisted. God does not want Caesar’s things. With these men the issue was turn or burn, but true devotion and loyalty to Jehovah calms the spirit in critical times, and with exemplary calmness they gave their answer. In calmer days they had sworn to be faithful and loyal to God’s will, and now the test was on.

If in our sacrifice to Jehovah God we do not have fidelity, trustworthiness and loyalty then we are good for nothing. It is very necessary that we have confidence in our brothers that they will care for and be dependable in service. We must be at peace, but this is impossible unless we have loyalty, dependability and integrity ourselves. We must have ‘salt in ourselves’. It keeps us in the service, vigorous, quick, acceptable, thorough and with brotherly love.</p>

<strong>Priests with the Theocratic Army</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[16]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Centuries after that theocratic war against Jehovah’s enemies, the twelve-tribe kingdom of Israel in the Promised Land was divided into two kingdoms, the kingdom of Judah and the kingdom of Israel. On one occasion the armies of their two kings faced each other on the battlefield. King Abijah of the kingdom of Judah, faithful to God, had four hundred thousand men in the field against twice as many, eight hundred thousand idol worshipers, under King Jeroboam of the kingdom <span id="page694" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="694" data-before-text="694"></span>of Israel. But King Abijah of Judah had more than four hundred thousand warriors with him, and of this extra vital help he made mention in his appeal to the opposing army, saying: “But as for us, Jehovah is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and we have priests ministering unto Jehovah, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work: . . . And, behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against Jehovah, the God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.”</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="qu"> 6.

The battle was joined, and King Abijah’s army found themselves ambushed. The situation was dangerous. But divine help came in response to the trumpets. The Record says: “And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried unto Jehovah, and the priests sounded with the trumpets. Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. And the children of Israel fled before Judah; and God delivered them into their hand.” Why, then, did this holy victory come? Jehovah answers in the Record, saying: “Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon Jehovah, the God of their fathers.” The priestly blast upon the holy silver trumpets pealed forth as a memorial, a reminder to trust in Jehovah. A united shout of confidence in Him, a Hallelujah! thundered from the mouths of his battlers, and, infused with divine courage, the army of Judah charged against the foe to the front and rear, and Jehovah vindicated their reliance on him with victory!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954844/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Chron. 13:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954844/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 10-18</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="qu"> 7.

Instead of a shout following a trumpet alarm, these holy Levites marched forward, singing: “Give thanks unto Jehovah; for his loving-kindness endureth for ever.” King Jehoshʹaphat and the army followed, taking a secondary position. This emphasis on the holiness of the war was not misplaced, for we read: “And when they began to sing and to praise, Jehovah set liers-in-wait against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, that were come against Judah; and they were smitten. For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.” Arriving at the watchtower in the wilderness, the theocratic procession came in view of the slaughter that had occurred.</p>

<strong>“God Is My Copilot”—Is He Yours?</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">To apply the expression “second in command” to Almighty God is to distort the facts.

When faced by the military forces of Israel’s King Jeroboam, and outnumbered two to one, he told his opponents: “Look! with us there is at the head the true God . . . do not fight against Jehovah the God of your forefathers, for you will not prove successful.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101980571/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Chron. 13:12</a>) It was because Abijah recognized that Jehovah was “at the head,” serving as their heavenly “captain,” that the Jews under Abijah, as his earthly representative, were successful in achieving a victory despite overwhelming odds.</p>

As they went out, King Jehoshʹaphat, as the chief officer of the army, <span id="page695" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="695" data-before-text="695"></span>stood up and exhorted the marchers in obedience to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954844/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 20:5-9</a>, saying: “Believe in Jehovah your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets [such as Jahaziʹel], so shall ye prosper.” At the same time, to strengthen their belief and confidence in Jehovah, King Jehoshʹaphat stationed Jahaziʹel and his fellow Levite singers in their holy array at the very head of the marching column. Instead of a shout following a trumpet alarm, these holy Levites marched forward, singing: “Give thanks unto Jehovah; for his loving-kindness endureth for ever.” King Jehoshʹaphat and the army followed, taking a secondary position. This emphasis on the holiness of the war was not misplaced, for we read: “And when they began to sing and to praise, Jehovah set liers-in-wait against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, that were come against Judah; and they were smitten. For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.” Arriving at the watchtower in the wilderness, the theocratic procession came in view of the slaughter that had occurred.</p>

Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.

And the children of Israel fled before Judah; and God delivered them into their hand.” Why, then, did this holy victory come? Jehovah answers in the Record, saying: “Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon Jehovah, the God of their fathers.” The priestly blast upon the holy silver trumpets pealed forth as a memorial, a reminder to trust in Jehovah. A united shout of confidence in Him, a Hallelujah! thundered from the mouths of his battlers, and, infused with divine courage, the army of Judah charged against the foe to the front and rear, and Jehovah vindicated their reliance on him with victory!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954844/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Chron. 13:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954844/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 10-18</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="qu"> 7.

The allied armies of demon worshipers, the Moabites, the Ammonites and the men of Mount Seir, were on their way through the Judean wilderness for an assault on the holy city of Jerusalem. King Jehoshʹaphat proclaimed a fast throughout the kingdom and had all the people gather at the temple in Jerusalem. In solemn appeal for all the men, women and children about him, King Jehoshʹaphat lifted a prayer to Jehovah. Then Jehovah chose his instrument by which to give consolation and instructions for meeting the crisis. He chose a holy man, a Levite singer named Jahaziʹel. He put his holy spirit upon him, moving him to say: “Thus saith Jehovah unto you, Fear not ye, neither be dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God’s. Tomorrow go ye down against them: . . . Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of Jehovah with you, O Judah and Jerusalem; fear not, nor be dismayed: tomorrow go out against them; for Jehovah is with you.”</p>

<strong>Artemis</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span id="page138" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="138" data-before-text="138"></span>The Artemis worshiped at Ephesus has been closely connected with prominent goddesses of other peoples, and it is suggested that they have a common origin. <em>A Dictionary of the Bible,</em> edited by James Hastings, Volume I, page 605, observes: “Artemis presents such close analogies with the Phrygian Cybele, and with other feminine envisagements of the divine power in Asiatic countries, like the Cappadocian Ma, the Phoenician Astarte or Ashtaroth, the Syrian Atargatis and Mylitta, as to suggest that these are all mere varieties of one ultimate religious conception, presenting in different countries certain differences, due to varying development according to local circumstances and national character.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The ancients ranked the temple of Artemis at Ephesus as one of the seven wonders of the world. It was an imposing structure made of cedar, cypress, white marble and gold. So sacred was it believed to be that treasures could be deposited in it without any fear of thievery, and criminals could find asylum within an area extending around the temple for a distance of about 600 feet (c. 183 meters), although this varied considerably at different periods A great number of virgin priestesses and eunuch priests served at this temple, married women not even being permitted to enter it under penalty of death.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">For the great festivals held in the month of Artemision (March-April) visitors numbering up to 700,000 arrived at Ephesus from all of Asia Minor. One feature of the celebration was the religious procession, with the image of Artemis being paraded about the city in a most jubilant manner.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The making of silver shrines of Artemis proved to be a profitable enterprise for Demetrius and other Ephesian silversmiths. Therefore, when the apostle Paul’s preaching in Ephesus caused a considerable number of persons to forsake the unclean worship of this goddess, Demetrius stirred up the other craftsmen, telling them that Paul’s preaching not only posed a threat to their financial security, but also the danger existed that the worship of the great goddess Artemis would come to nothing. This culminated in a riot that was finally dispersed by the city recorder.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010391/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 19:23-41</a>; see EPHESUS.</p>

<strong>Asa</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The record at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000397/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 14:2-5</a> states that Asa “removed the foreign altars and the high places and broke up the sacred pillars and cut down the sacred poles.” However, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000397/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Kings 15:14</a> and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000397/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 15:17</a> indicate that “the high places he did not remove.” It may be, therefore, that the high places referred to in the earlier Chronicles account were those of the adopted pagan worship that infected Judah, while the Kings account refers to high places at which the people engaged in worship of Jehovah. Even after the setting up of the tabernacle and the later establishment of the temple, occasional sacrificing was done to Jehovah on high places, which was acceptable to him under special circumstances, as in the cases of Samuel, David, and Elijah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000397/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1Sa 9:11-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000397/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 1Ch 21:26-30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000397/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 1Ki 18:30-39</a>) Nevertheless, the regular approved place for sacrifice was that authorized by Jehovah.

<strong>Artemis</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span id="page138" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="138" data-before-text="138"></span>The Artemis worshiped at Ephesus has been closely connected with prominent goddesses of other peoples, and it is suggested that they have a common origin. <em>A Dictionary of the Bible,</em> edited by James Hastings, Volume I, page 605, observes: “Artemis presents such close analogies with the Phrygian Cybele, and with other feminine envisagements of the divine power in Asiatic countries, like the Cappadocian Ma, the Phoenician Astarte or Ashtaroth, the Syrian Atargatis and Mylitta, as to suggest that these are all mere varieties of one ultimate religious conception, presenting in different countries certain differences, due to varying development according to local circumstances and national character.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The ancients ranked the temple of Artemis at Ephesus as one of the seven wonders of the world. It was an imposing structure made of cedar, cypress, white marble and gold. So sacred was it believed to be that treasures could be deposited in it without any fear of thievery, and criminals could find asylum within an area extending around the temple for a distance of about 600 feet (c. 183 meters), although this varied considerably at different periods A great number of virgin priestesses and eunuch priests served at this temple, married women not even being permitted to enter it under penalty of death.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">For the great festivals held in the month of Artemision (March-April) visitors numbering up to 700,000 arrived at Ephesus from all of Asia Minor. One feature of the celebration was the religious procession, with the image of Artemis being paraded about the city in a most jubilant manner.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The making of silver shrines of Artemis proved to be a profitable enterprise for Demetrius and other Ephesian silversmiths. Therefore, when the apostle Paul’s preaching in Ephesus caused a considerable number of persons to forsake the unclean worship of this goddess, Demetrius stirred up the other craftsmen, telling them that Paul’s preaching not only posed a threat to their financial security, but also the danger existed that the worship of the great goddess Artemis would come to nothing. This culminated in a riot that was finally dispersed by the city recorder.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010391/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 19:23-41</a>; see EPHESUS.</p>

<strong>Preach Release to Babylon’s Captives</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">However, let us never forget that for release from Babylon to mean safety, protection and life, more is required than merely to sever one’s connections with Babylon the Great.

However, this usage does not appear even in post-exilic Hebrew Bible manuscripts. (See, for examples, ʼAʹLEPH; BEHTH; DAʹLETH.) One of the oldest extant specimens of Hebrew writing is the inscription taken from the Siloam water tunnel (probably from the time of Hezekiah’s reign [745-716 B.C.E.]), in which the measurements are written out in full. Spelling out the numbers provides an added measure of accuracy and dependability in the manuscripts of the Hebrew Scriptures, which have been copied many times, for, in copying, a numeral is usually easier to mistake than a word.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In Hebrew, numbers above ten are a combination of words, such as twelve (two and ten) (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013206/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 14:4</a>), except that twenty is the plural of ten; thirty a plural word derived from three; forty a plural word derived from four, and so on. One hundred is a separate word; two hundred is the dual form. Other “hundreds” are composed of two words, as, three hundred. The highest number expressed by one Hebrew word is twenty thousand, the dual form of ten thousand (myriad). Larger numbers are a combination of words. For example, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013206/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 5:18</a> the number 44,760 is, literally, forty and four thousand, seven hundreds and sixty. A million is written as a thousand thousands.

The context usually reveals in which sense a number is used. Certain numbers appear often in the Bible in an illustrative, figurative or symbolic sense, and in such cases an understanding of their significance is vital to an understanding of the text. However, this Bible usage of numbers should not be confused with numerology, in which occult mysticism is attached to figures, their combinations and numerical totals. Numerology apparently had its origin in ancient Babylon and, along with other forms of divination, comes under divine condemnation.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013206/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Deut. 18:10-12</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In the following we will discuss a few of the figurative uses of certain numbers that are used prominently in the Bible.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>ONE</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">This number, when used figuratively, conveys the thought of singleness, uniqueness, as well as unity and agreement in purpose and action. “Jehovah our God is one Jehovah,” said Moses.

<strong>“There Exists a Reward for Your Activity”</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In view of Asa’s record, we should not be surprised that he prayed when confronted with the largest human army mentioned in the Scriptures. Asa knew that God rewards acts of faith. In his prayer, the king pleaded for Jehovah’s help. Asa recognized that if he relied on God and had his backing, it did not matter how numerous or powerful the enemy was. Jehovah’s name was involved in this conflict, and Asa therefore appealed to God on that basis. The king prayed: “Help us, O Jehovah our God, for upon you we do lean, and in your name we have come against this crowd. O Jehovah, you are our God. Do not let mortal man retain strength against you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012607/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Chron. 14:11</a>) That was like saying: ‘The Ethiopian <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>invasion is an attack on you, Jehovah. Do not allow your name to be dishonored by permitting weak humans to overthrow those who bear your name.’ So it was that “Jehovah defeated the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah, and the Ethiopians took to flight.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012607/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Chron. 14:12</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Today, Jehovah’s people face many powerful opponents. We will not fight them with material weapons on a literal battlefield. Yet, we can be sure that Jehovah will reward with victory all faithful ones who wage spiritual warfare in his name. Our personal battles may include exertion to resist the pervading spirit of moral laxity, to fight our own weaknesses, or to protect our family from defiling influences. Whatever adversity we face, however, we can find encouragement in Asa’s prayer. His victory was Jehovah’s victory. It showed what can be expected by all who rely upon God. No human power can withstand Jehovah.</p>

Realizing that his army of five hundred and eighty thousand sanctified warriors was no physical match for the army of a million Ethiopians with three hundred chariots under Zerah the Ethiopian, Asa prayed fervently: “Jehovah, there is none besides thee to help, between the mighty and him that hath no strength: help us, O Jehovah our God; for we rely on thee, and in thy name are we come against this multitude. O Jehovah, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.” In answer to that supplication man did not prevail, not even a million men.

<strong>“There Exists a Reward for Your Activity”</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In view of Asa’s record, we should not be surprised that he prayed when confronted with the largest human army mentioned in the Scriptures. Asa knew that God rewards acts of faith. In his prayer, the king pleaded for Jehovah’s help. Asa recognized that if he relied on God and had his backing, it did not matter how numerous or powerful the enemy was. Jehovah’s name was involved in this conflict, and Asa therefore appealed to God on that basis. The king prayed: “Help us, O Jehovah our God, for upon you we do lean, and in your name we have come against this crowd. O Jehovah, you are our God. Do not let mortal man retain strength against you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012607/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Chron. 14:11</a>) That was like saying: ‘The Ethiopian <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>invasion is an attack on you, Jehovah. Do not allow your name to be dishonored by permitting weak humans to overthrow those who bear your name.’ So it was that “Jehovah defeated the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah, and the Ethiopians took to flight.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012607/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Chron. 14:12</a>.</p>

Long ago it brought victory to <span id="page702" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="702" data-before-text="702"></span>King Asa of Judah. Realizing that his army of five hundred and eighty thousand sanctified warriors was no physical match for the army of a million Ethiopians with three hundred chariots under Zerah the Ethiopian, Asa prayed fervently: “Jehovah, there is none besides thee to help, between the mighty and him that hath no strength: help us, O Jehovah our God; for we rely on thee, and in thy name are we come against this multitude. O Jehovah, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.” In answer to that supplication man did not prevail, not even a million men. As it is written: “So Jehovah smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled. And . . . there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before Jehovah, and before his host.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954847/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">2 Chron. 14:9-14</a>, <em>AS</em>) This record was written aforetime for our learning; and what a grand illustration it is of how prayer aids to victory!

We are facing the universal war of Armageddon. That will be the most violent and disastrous fight of all human experience. But we shall not need to take part in the violence of that time. From the ancient prophetic pictures of Armageddon come the words of Jehovah to us: “The battle is not yours, but God’s.” “Stand firm and see the salvation of Jehovah, which he will perform for you today. . . . Jehovah will himself fight for you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954847/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">2 Chron. 20:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954847/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Ex. 14:13, 14</a>, <em>NW</em>) Those words are a prohibition against our then dropping our spiritual armor and taking up carnal weapons and relying upon their use for or against anyone on earth at the battle of Armageddon. We must keep our sanctification for our sacred warfare down to the all-out attack upon our New World society by Gog the sovereign prince of Magog and the outbreak of Armageddon by Jehovah’s countermove against him in our defense. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954847/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ezek. 38:1 to 39:22</a>, <em>AS,</em> margin) Our High Priest Christ Jesus has offered his human sacrifice for us by which we gain a sanctified condition before God for our spiritual conflict.

<strong>“There Exists a Reward for Your Activity”</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">On his return from battle, Asa was met by Azariah. This prophet gave both encouragement and a warning: “Hear me, O Asa and all Judah and Benjamin! Jehovah is with you as long as you prove to be with him; and if you search for him, he will let himself be found by you, but if you leave him he will leave you. . . . Be courageous and do not let your hands drop down, because there exists a reward for your activity.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012607/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Chron. 15:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012607/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 7</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">These words can strengthen our faith. They show that Jehovah will be with us as long as we serve him faithfully. When we cry out to him for help, we can be confident that he hears us. “Be courageous,” said Azariah. It often takes great courage to do what is right, but we know that we can do so with Jehovah’s help.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Because Asa’s grandmother Maacah had made “a horrible idol to the sacred pole,” Asa faced the difficult task of removing her from her royal position as “lady.” He met the challenge and also burned her idol. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012607/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Ki. 15:13</a>) Asa was blessed for his resolve and courage. We too must stick unflinchingly to Jehovah and his righteous standards whether our relatives are loyal to God or not. If we do, Jehovah will reward us for our faithful conduct.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Part of Asa’s reward was to see many Israelites from the apostate northern kingdom flow into Judah when they observed that Jehovah was with him. They appreciated pure worship so much that they chose to leave their homes in order to live among servants of Jehovah. Asa and all Judah then joyfully entered into ‘a covenant to search for Jehovah with all their heart and soul.’ The result? God “let himself be found by them; and Jehovah continued to give them rest all around.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012607/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Chron. 15:9-15</a>) How we rejoice when lovers of righteousness embrace the pure worship of Jehovah!</p>

<strong>The Hand in the Scriptures</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In the Christian Greek Scriptures we read of the hands being used when performing miraculous <span id="page510" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="510" data-before-text="510"></span>cures: “When the sun was setting, all those who had people sick with various diseases brought them to him. By laying his hands upon each one of them he would cure them.” There was also a laying on of hands when the holy spirit was imparted: “They went laying their hands upon them, and they began to receive holy spirit.” And when the holy spirit made it known to the congregation at Antioch that it was God’s will that Paul and Barnabas be set apart for special work, “they fasted and prayed and laid their hands upon them and let them go.” Incidentally, because of this commissioning Barnabas was termed an apostle, not one of the twelve sent by Jesus, but one of the two sent forth by the congregation at Antioch.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962608/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 4:40;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962608/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Acts 8:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962608/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 13:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962608/4/3" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 14:14</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In a figurative sense the hand is often used in the Scriptures to refer to applied power, both to that of Jehovah God and of man. “The hand [applied power] of Jehovah came to be heavy upon the Ashdodites.” Judah was promised: “Your hand will be on the back of the neck of your enemies.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962608/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Sam. 5:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962608/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Gen. 49:8</a>.

Thus faithful King Asa was told by the prophet Oded: “You, be courageous and do not let your hands drop down, because there exists a reward for your activity.” On the other hand, King Saul slew certain priests because they had cooperated with David, “because their hand also [had been] with David.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962608/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Chron. 15:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962608/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 1 Sam. 22:17</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Since a murderer takes the life of another with his hands, they are said to be ‘filled with bloodshed.’ Pilate tried in vain to relieve himself of this responsibility by literally washing his hands.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962608/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isa. 1:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962608/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Matt. 27:24</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">All who appreciate God’s gifts, including their hands, will heed the counsel: “All that your hand finds to do, do with your very power.” Yes, any activity in which we engage is to be done with our very power, that is, whole-souled.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962608/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Eccl. 9:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962608/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Col. 3:23</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"></p>

<strong>The Hand in the Scriptures</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In the Christian Greek Scriptures we read of the hands being used when performing miraculous <span id="page510" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="510" data-before-text="510"></span>cures: “When the sun was setting, all those who had people sick with various diseases brought them to him. By laying his hands upon each one of them he would cure them.” There was also a laying on of hands when the holy spirit was imparted: “They went laying their hands upon them, and they began to receive holy spirit.” And when the holy spirit made it known to the congregation at Antioch that it was God’s will that Paul and Barnabas be set apart for special work, “they fasted and prayed and laid their hands upon them and let them go.” Incidentally, because of this commissioning Barnabas was termed an apostle, not one of the twelve sent by Jesus, but one of the two sent forth by the congregation at Antioch.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962608/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 4:40;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962608/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Acts 8:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962608/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 13:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962608/4/3" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 14:14</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In a figurative sense the hand is often used in the Scriptures to refer to applied power, both to that of Jehovah God and of man. “The hand [applied power] of Jehovah came to be heavy upon the Ashdodites.” Judah was promised: “Your hand will be on the back of the neck of your enemies.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962608/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Sam. 5:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962608/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Gen. 49:8</a>.

We today thank God that they had the courage to press on, because many more thousands of people in many lands learned the way of eternal life. At one time Paul hoped to go to Spain, but Paul in his aggressive ministry would not be welcome in Spain today. The truths that he taught would not coincide with the false doctrines, the ceremonies and the dictatorial attitude of the Catholic Church in Spain now. However, thousands of Spanish <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>people are grateful that Jehovah’s witnesses have persisted in preaching from house to house and that they come to their homes and study the Bible with them and that they are obeying God as ruler rather than the Catholic bishops of Spain. Why so? Because many individuals in Spain have learned the truth, have withdrawn from the Catholic Church and now have the joy of proclaiming the message as other faithful witnesses of Jehovah have been doing for years.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">13.

Later the literature was carefully examined and they were questioned. However, little was said until the police found an article in <em>¡Despertad!</em> (<em>Awake!</em>) about Franco and conditions in Spain. That roused the anger of the police and the two brothers had to stand the fire of abuse and threat. However, after filing a complete police record of them and warning them of the consequences if they continued in their work of preaching the good news, the authorities let the brothers go.”</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">14.

<strong>Obeisance</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The Greek <em>pro·sky·neʹo</em> corresponds closely with the Hebrew <em>sha·hhahʹ</em> as to conveying the thought of both obeisance to creatures and worship to God or a deity. While the <em>manner</em> of expressing the obeisance is perhaps not so prominent in <em>pro·sky·neʹo</em> as in <em>sha·hhahʹ,</em> where the Hebrew term graphically conveys the thought of prostration or bowing down, some lexicographers suggest that originally the Greek term did emphatically portray this idea. Some scholars would derive the term from the Greek <em>ky·neʹo,</em> “to <span id="page1242" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1242" data-before-text="1242"></span>kiss,” while others would derive it from the Greek word for “dog” <em>kyʹon,</em> and give it the basic meaning of “to crouch, crawl, fawn,” as a dog would at his master’s feet. The derivation thus remains in dispute; however, the usage of the word in the Christian Greek Scriptures (as also in the Greek <em>Septuagint Version</em> of the Hebrew Scriptures) shows that persons to whose actions the term is applied, did, in fact, prostrate themselves or bow down. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Matt. 2:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 18:26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/20/2" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> 28:9</a>) So the latter derivation may fit better than that relating to kissing.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">As with the Hebrew term, the context must be considered to determine whether <em>pro·sky·neʹo</em> refers to obeisance solely in the form of deep respect or obeisance in the form of religious worship. Where reference is directly to God (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">John 4:20-24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 14:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/21/2" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> Rev. 4:10</a>) or to false gods and their idols (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Acts 7:43;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Rev. 9:20</a>), it is evident that the obeisance goes beyond that acceptably or customarily rendered to men and enters the field of worship. So, too, where the object of the obeisance is left unstated, its being directed to God being understood. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">John 12:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Acts 8:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/23/2" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> 24:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/23/3" data-bid="24-4" class="b"> Heb. 11:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/23/4" data-bid="24-5" class="b"> Rev. 11:1</a>) On the other hand, the action of those of the “synagogue of Satan” who are made to “come and do obeisance” before the feet of Christians is clearly not worship.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Rev. 3:9</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Obeisance to a human king is found in Jesus’ illustration at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Matthew 18:26</a>. It is also evident that this was the kind of obeisance the astrologers rendered to the child Jesus, “born king of the Jews,” and also that Herod professed interest in expressing, and that the soldiers mockingly rendered to Jesus before his impalement. They clearly did not view Jesus as God or as a deity.

The very expressions of those involved often reveal that, while they clearly recognized Jesus as God’s representative, they rendered obeisance to him, not as to God or a deity, but as “God’s Son,” the foretold “Son of man,” the Messiah with divine authority. On many occasions their obeisance expressed a gratitude for divine revelation or evidence of favor like that expressed in earlier times.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matt. 14:32, 33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 28:5-10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/29/2" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> 16-18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/29/3" data-bid="30-4" class="b"> Luke 24:50-52;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/29/4" data-bid="30-5" class="b"> John 9:35,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/29/5" data-bid="30-6" class="b"> 38</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">While earlier prophets and also angels had accepted obeisance, Peter stopped Cornelius from rendering such to him and the angel (or angels) of John’s vision twice stopped John from doing so, referring to himself as a “fellow slave” and concluding with the exhortation to “worship God [<em>toi The·oiʹ pro·skyʹ’ne·son</em>].” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Acts 10:25, 26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> Rev. 19:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/30/2" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> 22:8, 9</a>) Evidently Christ’s coming had brought in new relationships affecting standards of conduct toward others of God’s servants.

Many translations of this text here render <em>pro·sky·neʹo</em> as “worship,” while some render it by such expressions as “bow before” (<em>AT; Yg</em>) and ‘pay homage’ (<em>NE</em>). No matter what English term is used, the original Greek remains the same and the understanding of what it is that the angels render to Christ must accord with the rest of the Scriptures. If the rendering “worship” is preferred, then it must be understood that such “worship” is only of a relative kind, for Jesus himself emphatically stated to Satan that “it is Jehovah your God you must worship [form of <em>pro·sky·neʹo</em>], and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Matt. 4:8-10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/38/1" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> Luke 4:7, 8</a>) Similarly, the angel(s) told John to “worship God” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Rev. 19:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/39/1" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> 22:9</a>), and this injunction came after Jesus’ resurrection and exaltation, showing that matters had not changed in this regard.

At one time Paul hoped to go to Spain, but Paul in his aggressive ministry would not be welcome in Spain today. The truths that he taught would not coincide with the false doctrines, the ceremonies and the dictatorial attitude of the Catholic Church in Spain now. However, thousands of Spanish <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>people are grateful that Jehovah’s witnesses have persisted in preaching from house to house and that they come to their homes and study the Bible with them and that they are obeying God as ruler rather than the Catholic bishops of Spain.

Later the literature was carefully examined and they were questioned. However, little was said until the police found an article in <em>¡Despertad!</em> (<em>Awake!</em>) about Franco and conditions in Spain. That roused the anger of the police and the two brothers had to stand the fire of abuse and threat.

He gnashes or grinds his teeth at the sight he is obliged to behold, but that is all he can do in his rage. He cannot truly harm the righteous or destroy the New World society. He suffers torment now, not only from the preaching of the good news of God’s established kingdom but also at the prosperity of Jehovah’s witnesses. In 1955 he will keep on grinding his teeth in his rage and prepare to join the great Gog of Magog in his world-wide pre-Armageddon assault on the New World society. When Jehovah stops that furious, malicious assault by the “war of the great day of God the Almighty,” the wicked crowd will still not see the desire of their eyes but will have one last look at a sight grievous to their eyes, the enduring prosperity of Jehovah’s witnesses and the triumph of the New World society on earth.

In glorious contrast, the righteous Kingdom publishers will see their desire fulfilled as they gaze upon their adversaries, for they will be on Jehovah’s winning side and will survive into the triumphant new world where Jehovah’s vindication will forever be celebrated. Oh, the unhappiness of the man that does not fear Jehovah and that does not delight greatly in His commandments!

<strong>Artemis</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span id="page138" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="138" data-before-text="138"></span>The Artemis worshiped at Ephesus has been closely connected with prominent goddesses of other peoples, and it is suggested that they have a common origin. <em>A Dictionary of the Bible,</em> edited by James Hastings, Volume I, page 605, observes: “Artemis presents such close analogies with the Phrygian Cybele, and with other feminine envisagements of the divine power in Asiatic countries, like the Cappadocian Ma, the Phoenician Astarte or Ashtaroth, the Syrian Atargatis and Mylitta, as to suggest that these are all mere varieties of one ultimate religious conception, presenting in different countries certain differences, due to varying development according to local circumstances and national character.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The ancients ranked the temple of Artemis at Ephesus as one of the seven wonders of the world. It was an imposing structure made of cedar, cypress, white marble and gold. So sacred was it believed to be that treasures could be deposited in it without any fear of thievery, and criminals could find asylum within an area extending around the temple for a distance of about 600 feet (c. 183 meters), although this varied considerably at different periods A great number of virgin priestesses and eunuch priests served at this temple, married women not even being permitted to enter it under penalty of death.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">For the great festivals held in the month of Artemision (March-April) visitors numbering up to 700,000 arrived at Ephesus from all of Asia Minor. One feature of the celebration was the religious procession, with the image of Artemis being paraded about the city in a most jubilant manner.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The making of silver shrines of Artemis proved to be a profitable enterprise for Demetrius and other Ephesian silversmiths. Therefore, when the apostle Paul’s preaching in Ephesus caused a considerable number of persons to forsake the unclean worship of this goddess, Demetrius stirred up the other craftsmen, telling them that Paul’s preaching not only posed a threat to their financial security, but also the danger existed that the worship of the great goddess Artemis would come to nothing. This culminated in a riot that was finally dispersed by the city recorder.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010391/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 19:23-41</a>; see EPHESUS.</p>

The dining hall there accommodated about thirty men, if not more. Even the girls in the city were familiar with the sacrificial procedure there.

This contributed to the Israelites’ abandoning the true worship of Jehovah and serving false gods. Therefore, Jehovah, by means of his prophet Ahijah, indicated that ten tribes would be ripped away from the son of Solomon and Jeroboam would rule over these.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011973/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Ki. 11:7, 8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011973/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 30-35</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Although Jeroboam had Jehovah’s assurance that his kingship would be secure if he continued serving God in faithfulness, as soon as he became king he feared that the Israelites would revolt if they continued going up to Jerusalem for worship. For this reason he instituted calf worship at Dan and Bethel and there built high places. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011973/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Ki. 11:38;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011973/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 12:26-33</a>) As long as the ten-tribe kingdom existed, idolatrous worship continued at high places. “The sons of Israel went searching into the things that were not right toward Jehovah their God and kept building themselves high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen clear to the fortified city.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011973/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">2 Ki. 17:9</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Under inspiration, the prophet Amos foretold that the “high places of Isaac” would become desolated. The “high places of Isaac” evidently refer to the sacred high places where the Israelites of the ten-tribe kingdom, descendants of Isaac through Jacob or Israel, practiced apostate worship. This is also indicated by the fact that the expression “high places of Isaac” runs parallel with ‘sanctuaries of Israel.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011973/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Amos 7:9</a>; see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011973/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Hosea 10:2-10</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">After the king of Assyria took the ten-tribe kingdom into exile, the high places continued to exist for a time, since the foreign peoples who were moved into the territory of Samaria by the king of Assyria continued employing the high places in their worship. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011973/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">2 Ki. 17:24,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011973/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 29-32</a>) About one hundred years after this, faithful King Josiah of Judah pulled down the altar and the high place at Bethel and desecrated the altar by burning human bones upon it. He also removed all the houses of the high places in the cities of Samaria, sacrificed (killed) all the priests of the high places and burned human bones upon the altars.

Hence, it may be that, although Asa removed the high places, their use persisted secretly or they cropped up again toward the end of his reign and were thereby present for his successor Jehoshaphat to destroy. (See, however, ASA No. 1.) But even during Jehoshaphat’s reign the high places did not fully disappear.

He suffers torment now, not only from the preaching of the good news of God’s established kingdom but also at the prosperity of Jehovah’s witnesses. In 1955 he will keep on grinding his teeth in his rage and prepare to join the great Gog of Magog in his world-wide pre-Armageddon assault on the New World society. When Jehovah stops that furious, malicious assault by the “war of the great day of God the Almighty,” the wicked crowd will still not see the desire of their eyes but will have one last look at a sight grievous to their eyes, the enduring prosperity of Jehovah’s witnesses and the triumph of the New World society on earth.

<strong>Asa</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The statement at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000397/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 16:1</a> that Baasha came up against Judah “in the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa” has caused some question, since Baasha’s rule, beginning in the third year of Asa and lasting only 24 years, had terminated about 10 years prior to Asa’s 36th year of rule.

<strong>Asa</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The record at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 14:2-5</a> states that Asa “removed the foreign altars and the high places and broke up the sacred pillars and cut down the sacred poles.” However, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 15:17 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 Kings 15:14</a> say that ‘the high places he did not remove.’ It therefore appears that the high places referred to in the earlier Chronicles account were those of the adopted pagan worship that infected Judah, while the Kings account refers to high places at which the people engaged in worship of Jehovah. Even after the setting up of the tabernacle and the later establishment of the temple, occasional sacrificing was done to Jehovah on high places, which was acceptable to him under special circumstances, as in the cases of Samuel, David and Elijah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Sam. 9:11-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 21:26-30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 1 Ki. 18:30-39</a>) Nevertheless, the regular approved place for sacrifice was that authorized by Jehovah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Num. 33:52;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Deut. 12:2-14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Josh. 22:29</a>) Improper modes of high-place worship were also carried on in Jehovah’s name (compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Exodus 32:5</a>), and such may have continued in spite of the removal of the pagan high places, perhaps because the king did not pursue their elimination with the same vigor as the removal of the pagan sites. Or it is possible that Asa did effect a complete removal of all high places but that such cropped up again in due time and were <span id="page139" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="139" data-before-text="139"></span>not removed at the time of the conclusion of his reign, allowing for their being smashed by his successor Jehoshaphat.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Asa’s zeal for right worship brought blessings of peace from Jehovah during the first ten years of his reign. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Chron. 14:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 6</a>) Later Judah was subjected to attack by a force of a million warriors under Zerah the Ethiopian. Though greatly outnumbered, Asa went out to meet the invasion at Mareshah to the SW of Jerusalem in the Judean lowlands. His fervent prayer before the battle was joined acknowledged God’s power to deliver and pleaded for Jehovah’s help, saying: “Upon you we do lean, and in your name we have come against this crowd. O Jehovah, you are our God. Do not let mortal man retain strength against you.” Total victory resulted.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Chron. 14:8-15</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Asa is thereafter met by the prophet Azariah, who reminds him that “Jehovah is with you as long as you prove to be with him,” and that “if you leave him he will leave you.” He calls to mind the internecine strife the nation experienced when alienated from Jehovah and urges Asa to continue his activity courageously on behalf of pure worship. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Chron. 15:1-7</a>) Asa’s ready response and strengthening of the nation in true service to Jehovah results in a great number of persons from the northern kingdom abandoning that region to join in a grand assembly at Jerusalem in Asa’s fifteenth year of rule (963 B.C.E.), at which assembly a covenant is made declaring their determination to seek Jehovah and providing the death penalty for those not keeping this covenant.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Chron. 15:8-15</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>INTRIGUE AND WARFARE AGAINST BAASHA</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">King Bassha of Israel set out to block the path of any inclining toward a return to Judah by fortifying the frontier city of Ramah, located on the main road to Jerusalem and only a short distance N of that city. Asa, by some process of human reasoning or due to heeding bad counsel, now failed to rely solely on Jehovah and resorted to diplomacy and conspiratorial maneuvering to remove this threat. He took the temple treasures and those from the royal house and sent them as a bribe to King Ben-hadad of Syria to induce him to divert Baasha’s attention through an attack on Israel’s northern frontier. Ben-hadad accepted, and his raid on Israelite cities in the N disrupted Baasha’s building work and brought a withdrawal of his forces from Ramah. Asa now conscripted all the available manpower from the entire kingdom of Judah and carried off all Baasha’s supplies of building materials, using them to build up the cities of Geba and Mizpah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Ki. 15:16-22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 16:1-6</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">For this, Asa was confronted by Hanani the seer, who pointed out Asa’s inconsistency in not leaning upon the God who had delivered him from the vast Ethiopian force, reminding Asa that “as regards Jehovah, his eyes are roving about through all the earth to show his strength in behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him.” For his foolishness, Asa would now face continued warfare. Resenting correction, Asa unjustly jailed Hanani and showed himself oppressive others of the people.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Chron. 16:7-11</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The statement at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 16:1</a> that Baasha came up against Judah “in the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa” has caused some question, since Baash’s rule, beginning in the third year of Asa and lasting only twenty-four years, had terminated ten years prior to Asa’s thirty-sixth year of rule.

Jewish commentators quote the <em>Seder Olam,</em> which suggests that the thirty-sixth year was reckoned from the existence of the separate kingdom of Judah (997 B.C.E.) and corresponded to the sixteenth year of Asa (Rehoboam ruling seventeen years, Abijah three years and Asa now in his sixteenth year).

<strong>Asa</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The record at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 14:2-5</a> states that Asa “removed the foreign altars and the high places and broke up the sacred pillars and cut down the sacred poles.” However, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 15:17 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 Kings 15:14</a> say that ‘the high places he did not remove.’ It therefore appears that the high places referred to in the earlier Chronicles account were those of the adopted pagan worship that infected Judah, while the Kings account refers to high places at which the people engaged in worship of Jehovah. Even after the setting up of the tabernacle and the later establishment of the temple, occasional sacrificing was done to Jehovah on high places, which was acceptable to him under special circumstances, as in the cases of Samuel, David and Elijah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Sam. 9:11-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 21:26-30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 1 Ki. 18:30-39</a>) Nevertheless, the regular approved place for sacrifice was that authorized by Jehovah.

Or it is possible that Asa did effect a complete removal of all high places but that such cropped up again in due time and were <span id="page139" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="139" data-before-text="139"></span>not removed at the time of the conclusion of his reign, allowing for their being smashed by his successor Jehoshaphat.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Asa’s zeal for right worship brought blessings of peace from Jehovah during the first ten years of his reign.

Though greatly outnumbered, Asa went out to meet the invasion at Mareshah to the SW of Jerusalem in the Judean lowlands. His fervent prayer before the battle was joined acknowledged God’s power to deliver and pleaded for Jehovah’s help, saying: “Upon you we do lean, and in your name we have come against this crowd. O Jehovah, you are our God. Do not let mortal man retain strength against you.” Total victory resulted.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Chron. 14:8-15</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Asa is thereafter met by the prophet Azariah, who reminds him that “Jehovah is with you as long as you prove to be with him,” and that “if you leave him he will leave you.” He calls to mind the internecine strife the nation experienced when alienated from Jehovah and urges Asa to continue his activity courageously on behalf of pure worship.

Asa, by some process of human reasoning or due to heeding bad counsel, now failed to rely solely on Jehovah and resorted to diplomacy and conspiratorial maneuvering to remove this threat. He took the temple treasures and those from the royal house and sent them as a bribe to King Ben-hadad of Syria to induce him to divert Baasha’s attention through an attack on Israel’s northern frontier. Ben-hadad accepted, and his raid on Israelite cities in the N disrupted Baasha’s building work and brought a withdrawal of his forces from Ramah. Asa now conscripted all the available manpower from the entire kingdom of Judah and carried off all Baasha’s supplies of building materials, using them to build up the cities of Geba and Mizpah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Ki. 15:16-22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 16:1-6</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">For this, Asa was confronted by Hanani the seer, who pointed out Asa’s inconsistency in not leaning upon the God who had delivered him from the vast Ethiopian force, reminding Asa that “as regards Jehovah, his eyes are roving about through all the earth to show his strength in behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him.” For his foolishness, Asa would now face continued warfare. Resenting correction, Asa unjustly jailed Hanani and showed himself oppressive others of the people.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Chron. 16:7-11</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The statement at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 16:1</a> that Baasha came up against Judah “in the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa” has caused some question, since Baash’s rule, beginning in the third year of Asa and lasting only twenty-four years, had terminated ten years prior to Asa’s thirty-sixth year of rule.

Jewish commentators quote the <em>Seder Olam,</em> which suggests that the thirty-sixth year was reckoned from the existence of the separate kingdom of Judah (997 B.C.E.) and corresponded to the sixteenth year of Asa (Rehoboam ruling seventeen years, Abijah three years and Asa now in his sixteenth year).

Hadad was the storm god worshiped throughout Syria and other surrounding regions.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">1. The first king of Syria named Ben-hadad in the Biblical account was the son of Tabrimmon and grandson of Hezion. He had entered into a covenant with King Baasha of Israel, but King Asa of Judah, alarmed when Baasha began fortifying Ramah just a few miles N of Jerusalem, bribed Ben-hadad to break his covenant and attack the northern kingdom, thereby forcing Baasha to withdraw. In exchange for the royal treasures of Judah and those from the temple sanctuary, Ben-hadad invaded Israel, overrunning various cities in the territory of Naphtali and in the region of the Sea of Galilee. As expected, Baasha withdrew to his capital in Tirzah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010635/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Ki. 15:16-21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010635/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 16:1-6</a>) This action took place about 962-961 B.C.E. (the “thirty-sixth year” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010635/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 16:1</a> evidently refers to the thirty-sixth year from the division of the kingdom in 997 B.C.E.).—See ASA No. 1.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">A stele, known as the Melqart Stele, was found in 1939 about four miles (6.4 kilometers) N of Aleppo in northern Syria and, although the inscription is not entirely legible, it is translated by W. F. Albright as saying. “The stele which Bir-Hadad, son of Tab-Ramman son of Hadyan, king of Aram, set up for his lord Milqart, (the stele) which he vowed to him when (lit., and) he hearkened to his voice.” Bir-Hadad is the Aramaic form of Ben-hadad and, if the rest of the translation is correct, this would identify Ben-hadad I very much as the Bible presents him.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">2. The next mention of a Syrian king named Ben-hadad occurs during the reign of King Ahab of Israel (c. 940-919 B.C.E.). Evidently about the fifth year before Ahab’s death (c. 923 B.C.E.) “Ben-hadad the king of Syria” led the combined forces of thirty-two kings, evidently vassals, against Samaria, besieging the city and calling on King Ahab to surrender unconditionally. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010635/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Ki. 20:1-6</a>) Ahab called a council of the older men of the land, who advised him to resist. Then, while the Syrian forces were preparing for an assault on the city and Ben-hadad and the other kings were drinking themselves drunk in the booths they had erected, Ahab, following divine counsel, used strategy to initiate a surprise attack on the Syrian camp and successfully routed them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010635/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Ki. 20:7-21</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Accepting his counselors’ theory that Jehovah was “a God of mountains” and that therefore the Israelites could be defeated on level land, the following year Ben-hadad led his army to Aphek in the Valley of Esdraelon. The Syrian forces had been reorganized, the thirty-two kings being replaced by governors as heads of the troops, evidently due to considering that the governors would fight more unitedly and obediently, and perhaps also have stronger incentive for winning promotion to higher rank than the more independent kings. Ben-hadad’s religious and military theories, however, proved worthless against the Israelite forces who, though vastly outnumbered, were forewarned by a prophet of the attack and had the backing of the King of the universe, Jehovah God. The Syrian forces were cut to pieces and Ben-hadad fled into Aphek. Ahab, however, let this dangerous enemy go free, with this promise from Ben-hadad: “The cities that my father took from your father I shall return; and streets you will assign to yourself in Damascus the same as my father assigned in Samaria.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010635/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Ki. 20:22-34</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">There is considerable difference of opinion as to whether this Ben-hadad is the same Syrian king of Baasha and Asa’s day or whether he is instead a son or grandson of that king. For Ben-hadad I (of Asa’s time) to be the Ben-hadad of Ahab’s and even of Jehoram’s time (c. 917-905) would require a reign of some forty-five years or more. This, of course, is not impossible.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">However, those who hold that the Syrian king of Ahab’s day should be called Ben-hadad II, point to the promise made by Ben-hadad to Ahab, quoted above. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010635/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Ki. 20:34</a>) On the face of it, it appears to say that Ben-hadad’s father had taken cities from Omri, Ahab’s father, although no conflict between Syria and Israel is recorded during Omri’s reign. The only recorded Syrian seizure of Israelite cities was earlier, during Baasha’s rule, and it was effected by Ben-hadad I, as described under No. 1 above. If this is the seizure referred to, then that would make Ben-hadad I the father (or, in view of the frequently broad use of the term, possibly the grandfather) of the Ben-hadad (II) of Ahab’s reign. On the other hand, Baasha was not Ahab’s “father” nor even his forefather. Some commentators would explain this by saying that “father” in this case may refer to a royal predecessor on the throne even though not related by blood as a lineal ancestor.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Nevertheless, the fact that Ben-hadad’s promise to Ahab made reference to “Samaria” would appear to limit the Syrian capture of the Israelite cities to the reign of Omri, since Samaria was built by him and thereafter made Israel’s capital. The “streets” assigned apparently relate particularly to trade and commercial relations between the two kingdoms.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Whatever the circumstances and time of the capture of the Israelite cities, the Scriptural evidence would seem to point to a different Ben-hadad as ruling by Ahab’s time and hence he may be referred to as Ben-hadad II. It appears that the promise of Ben-hadad II to return the cities taken from Israel by his father was not completely fulfilled, for in Ahab’s final year of rule this Israelite king formed an alliance with Jehoshaphat in a vain attempt to recover Ramoth-gilead (E of the Jordan) from the Syrians. Ben-hadad II is evidently the anonymous “king of Syria” who ordered his “thirty-two chiefs of the chariots” to concentrate their attack on Ahab in that battle. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010635/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Ki. 22:31-37</a>) He must also be the king who sent his leprous army chief Naaman to be cured by Elisha during Jehoram’s reign. The Syrian king worshiped the god Rimmon (whose name forms part of that of Tabrimmon, the father of Ben-hadad I), considered by many to be the same as the god Hadad.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010635/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Ki. 5:1-19</a>; see RIMMON No. 5.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Despite the healing service rendered his general, Ben-hadad maintained his animosity toward Israel and sent invading parties into Israel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010635/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Ki. 6:8</a>; compare verse 23.) However, Elisha consistently warned the king of Israel in advance as to the route of the invading parties so that Ben-hadad began to suspect the presence of a traitor among his own servants. Learning that Elisha was the one informing the king of Israel about ‘the things that Ben-hadad spoke in his inner bedroom,’ the Syrian king sent a heavy military force to capture Elisha at Dothan. Elisha, however, caused the troops to be miraculously stricken with a form of blindness, and led them right into the middle of the Israelite capital, Samaria. This experience, perhaps along with the merciful treatment and release granted the Syrians there, brought a halt to the marauding activity, though it did not eliminate Ben-hadad’s aggressive attitude.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010635/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Ki. 6:9-23</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Still bent on overthrowing the Israelite kingdom, Ben-hadad later massed his forces and besieged Samaria, provoking famine conditions of the gravest kind. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010635/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Ki. 6:24-29</a>) Yet, when Jehovah one evening caused the Syrian camp to hear the sound of a large approaching army, they hastily concluded that Jehoram had hired the Hittites and Egyptians to rescue him and thereupon they fled back to Syria in the darkness, leaving behind all their equipment and provisions.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010635/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Ki. 7:6, 7</a>.</p>

<strong>Chronology</strong><br/><p id="p240" data-pid="240" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/84/0" data-bid="85-1" class="b">Acts chapter 13</a> the apostle Paul reviewed God’s dealings with Israel from the ‘choosing of the forefathers’ on through the period in Egypt, the Exodus, the wilderness wandering, the conquest of Canaan, and the distribution of the land, and then stated: “All that during about four hundred and fifty years. And after these things he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/85/0" data-bid="86-1" class="b">Acts 13:20</a>) Considerable misunderstanding has resulted from the <em>Authorized Version</em> rendering of this text, which reads: “And after that <span id="page338" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="338" data-before-text="338"></span>he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.” However, the most ancient manuscripts (including the Sinaitic, Vatican MS. No. 1209, and the Alexandrine), as well as most modern translations (such as <em>AS, RS, AT, Kx, JB</em> and others), all favor the previous translation, which shows the period of the judges coming <em>after</em> the 450 years. Since the period of “about 450 years” had its start with God’s ‘choosing the forefathers’ of Israel, it would seem to have begun in the year 1918 B.C.E. with the birth of Isaac, the original “seed” promised to Abraham. It would therefore end about 1467 B.C.E., when the initial conquest of Canaan reached its conclusion, allowing for the distribution to proceed. Inasmuch as the figure is stated to be approximate, a difference of a year or so would not be of consequence.</p><p id="p241" data-pid="241" class="sb">(The chronological framework for events down to the year 997 B.C.E. is constructed on basically the same line of evidence as is set out in the book <em>“All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial,”</em> published in 1963.)</p><p id="p242" data-pid="242" class="ss"><strong><em>From the division of the kingdom to the desolation of Jerusalem and Judah</em> (<em>997 to 607 B.C.E.</em>)</strong></p><p id="p243" data-pid="243" class="sb">This period of the northern and southern kingdoms (Israel and Judah) is one of the more complex periods when viewed from the standpoint of modern reckoning. It must therefore be recalled that the Biblical chronologers of the kings’ reigns were not viewing time periods in the same way as is generally done today, that is, as fitting into a standardized calendar system of counting years from a certain fixed starting point or beginning of an era. Their starting point could vary according to the point of view adopted by the chronologer when considering a particular reign or certain features of that reign.</p><p id="p244" data-pid="244" class="sb">Thus, when <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/86/0" data-bid="87-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 16:1</a> states that, “in the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa, Baasha the king of Israel came up against Judah,” the thirty-six years do not count from Asa’s first year of rule. This is made obvious by Biblical statements showing that Baasha began to reign in Asa’s third year and ruled only twenty-four years, hence dying in Asa’s <em>twenty-sixth</em> year. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/87/0" data-bid="88-1" class="b">1 Ki. 15:27, 28,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/87/1" data-bid="88-2" class="b"> 33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/87/2" data-bid="88-3" class="b"> 16:8</a>) It therefore appears that the thirty-six years start counting from the beginning of the divided kingdom in 997 B.C.E., Asa’s reign being viewed by the chronologer as a continuation of the rule of the kingdom of Judah in its reduced state that began in that year.</p><p id="p245" data-pid="245" class="sb">A king’s reign might also be viewed as if continuing on in that of his successor, as is evidently the case with the reference to the “twentieth year of Jotham,” since Jotham is shown to have actually ruled only sixteen years, his “twentieth year” thus being represented by the fourth year of his son and successor, Ahaz.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/88/0" data-bid="89-1" class="b">2 Ki. 15:30-33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/88/1" data-bid="89-2" class="b"> 16:1</a>.</p><p id="p246" data-pid="246" class="sb">The point in a king’s reign in which he became a tributary or vassal to some foreign monarch might also serve as the starting point used by the chronologer. Thus, Jehoiakim’s “third year” mentioned by <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/89/0" data-bid="90-1" class="b">Daniel (1:1</a>) is shown to refer to his third year as vassal of the king of Babylon, whereas, counting from the actual start of Jehoiakim’s rule, it was his eleventh year.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/90/0" data-bid="91-1" class="b">2 Ki. 24:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/90/1" data-bid="91-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 36:5-7</a>.</p><p id="p247" data-pid="247" class="sb">These methods are not without their approximate counterpart in the chronological records of other ancient nations, and they may, indeed, cast light on some of the apparent difficulties in some of those secular records.</p><p id="p248" data-pid="248" class="sb">A helpful guide as to the overall length of this period of the kings is found at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/91/0" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Ezekiel 4:1-7</a> in the mimic siege of Jerusalem that the prophet Ezekiel carried out at God’s direction. Ezekiel was to lie on his left side for 390 days to “carry the error of the house of Israel,” and on his right side for forty days to “carry the error of the house of Judah,” and each day was shown to stand for a year. The two periods (of 390 years and of 40 years) thus symbolized evidently stood for the length of Jehovah’s forbearance with the two kingdoms in their idolatrous course. The Jewish understanding of this prophecy, as presented in <em>The Soncino Books of the Bible</em> (Commentary on Ezekiel, pp. 20, 21) is: “The guilt of the Northern Kingdom extended over a period of 390 years ([according to the] Seder Olam [the earliest postexilic chronicle preserved in the Hebrew language], [and Rabbis] Rashi and Ibn Ezra). Abarbanel, quoted by Malbim, reckons the period of Samaria’s guilt from the time when the schism took place under Rehoboam . . . until the fall of Jerusalem. . . . The <em>right</em> [side, on which Ezekiel lay] indicates the south, i.e. the Kingdom of Judah which lay to the south or right. . . . Judah’s corruption lasted forty years beginning soon after Samaria’s fall. According to Malbim, the time is reckoned from the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah . . . when Jeremiah began his ministry. (Jer.i.2).”</p><p id="p249" data-pid="249" class="sb">From the division of the kingdom in 997 B.C.E. to the fall of Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E. was 390 years. While it is true that Samaria, the capital of the northern kingdom, had already fallen to Assyria in 740 B.C.E. in Hezekiah’s sixth year (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/92/0" data-bid="93-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:9, 10</a>), it is probable that some of the population fled into the southern kingdom before the Assyrians’ advance. (Note also the situation in Judah following the division of the kingdom as described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/93/0" data-bid="94-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 10:16, 17</a>.) But, more importantly, the fact that Jehovah God continued to keep the Israelites of the exiled northern kingdom in view, and that the messages of his prophets continued to include them long beyond the fall of Samaria, shows that their interests were still represented in the capital city of Jerusalem and that its fall in 607 B.C.E. was an expression of Jehovah’s judgment, not alone against Judah, but against the nation of Israel as a whole. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/94/0" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Jer. 3:11-22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/94/1" data-bid="95-2" class="b"> 11:10-12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/94/2" data-bid="95-3" class="b"> 17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/94/3" data-bid="95-4" class="b"> Ezek. 9:9, 10</a>) When the city fell, the hopes of the nation as a whole (with the exception of the few who maintained true faith) suffered collapse.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/95/0" data-bid="96-1" class="b">Ezek. 37:11-14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/95/1" data-bid="96-2" class="b"> 21, 22</a>.</p><p id="p250" data-pid="250" class="sb">In the chart that follows, this 390-year period is adhered to as a sound chronological guide. A summation of the years listed for all the reigns of the kings of Judah from Rehoboam to Zedekiah gives a total of 393 years. Whereas some Biblical chronologers endeavor to synchronize the data concerning the kings by means of numerous coregencies and “interregnums” on the Judean side, it appears necessary to show only one coregency. This is in the case of Jehoram, who is stated (at least in the Masoretic text and some of the oldest MSS. of the Bible) to have become king “while Jehoshaphat was king of Judah,” thus giving some basis for assuming a coregency. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010959/96/0" data-bid="97-1" class="b">2 Ki. 8:16</a>) In this manner the overall period comes within the 390-year limit.</p><p id="p251" data-pid="251" class="sb">The reigns of the kings of Judah, as representing the official Davidic line, were allowed to govern in the chart, and the data given concerning the kings of Israel was conformed to this reckoning. In view of the preeminence given to the reigns of the Judean kings in the books of Chronicles, it would appear that such assigning of primary value to them is justified.</p><p id="p252" data-pid="252" class="sb">The years of reign assigned to the Judean kings in the books of Kings and Chronicles were therefore considered to be full regnal years running from Nisan to Nisan (basically, spring to spring). This means that any particular year of the reign would include approximately nine months of one of our calendar years and three months of the next.

<strong>Asa</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The record at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 14:2-5</a> states that Asa “removed the foreign altars and the high places and broke up the sacred pillars and cut down the sacred poles.” However, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 15:17 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 Kings 15:14</a> say that ‘the high places he did not remove.’ It therefore appears that the high places referred to in the earlier Chronicles account were those of the adopted pagan worship that infected Judah, while the Kings account refers to high places at which the people engaged in worship of Jehovah. Even after the setting up of the tabernacle and the later establishment of the temple, occasional sacrificing was done to Jehovah on high places, which was acceptable to him under special circumstances, as in the cases of Samuel, David and Elijah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Sam. 9:11-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 21:26-30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 1 Ki. 18:30-39</a>) Nevertheless, the regular approved place for sacrifice was that authorized by Jehovah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Num. 33:52;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Deut. 12:2-14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Josh. 22:29</a>) Improper modes of high-place worship were also carried on in Jehovah’s name (compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Exodus 32:5</a>), and such may have continued in spite of the removal of the pagan high places, perhaps because the king did not pursue their elimination with the same vigor as the removal of the pagan sites. Or it is possible that Asa did effect a complete removal of all high places but that such cropped up again in due time and were <span id="page139" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="139" data-before-text="139"></span>not removed at the time of the conclusion of his reign, allowing for their being smashed by his successor Jehoshaphat.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Asa’s zeal for right worship brought blessings of peace from Jehovah during the first ten years of his reign. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Chron. 14:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 6</a>) Later Judah was subjected to attack by a force of a million warriors under Zerah the Ethiopian. Though greatly outnumbered, Asa went out to meet the invasion at Mareshah to the SW of Jerusalem in the Judean lowlands. His fervent prayer before the battle was joined acknowledged God’s power to deliver and pleaded for Jehovah’s help, saying: “Upon you we do lean, and in your name we have come against this crowd. O Jehovah, you are our God. Do not let mortal man retain strength against you.” Total victory resulted.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Chron. 14:8-15</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Asa is thereafter met by the prophet Azariah, who reminds him that “Jehovah is with you as long as you prove to be with him,” and that “if you leave him he will leave you.” He calls to mind the internecine strife the nation experienced when alienated from Jehovah and urges Asa to continue his activity courageously on behalf of pure worship. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Chron. 15:1-7</a>) Asa’s ready response and strengthening of the nation in true service to Jehovah results in a great number of persons from the northern kingdom abandoning that region to join in a grand assembly at Jerusalem in Asa’s fifteenth year of rule (963 B.C.E.), at which assembly a covenant is made declaring their determination to seek Jehovah and providing the death penalty for those not keeping this covenant.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Chron. 15:8-15</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>INTRIGUE AND WARFARE AGAINST BAASHA</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">King Bassha of Israel set out to block the path of any inclining toward a return to Judah by fortifying the frontier city of Ramah, located on the main road to Jerusalem and only a short distance N of that city. Asa, by some process of human reasoning or due to heeding bad counsel, now failed to rely solely on Jehovah and resorted to diplomacy and conspiratorial maneuvering to remove this threat. He took the temple treasures and those from the royal house and sent them as a bribe to King Ben-hadad of Syria to induce him to divert Baasha’s attention through an attack on Israel’s northern frontier. Ben-hadad accepted, and his raid on Israelite cities in the N disrupted Baasha’s building work and brought a withdrawal of his forces from Ramah. Asa now conscripted all the available manpower from the entire kingdom of Judah and carried off all Baasha’s supplies of building materials, using them to build up the cities of Geba and Mizpah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Ki. 15:16-22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 16:1-6</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">For this, Asa was confronted by Hanani the seer, who pointed out Asa’s inconsistency in not leaning upon the God who had delivered him from the vast Ethiopian force, reminding Asa that “as regards Jehovah, his eyes are roving about through all the earth to show his strength in behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him.” For his foolishness, Asa would now face continued warfare. Resenting correction, Asa unjustly jailed Hanani and showed himself oppressive others of the people.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Chron. 16:7-11</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The statement at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 16:1</a> that Baasha came up against Judah “in the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa” has caused some question, since Baash’s rule, beginning in the third year of Asa and lasting only twenty-four years, had terminated ten years prior to Asa’s thirty-sixth year of rule. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Ki. 15:33</a>) While some suggest a scribal error and believe the reference is to the sixteenth or the twenty-sixth year of Asa’s reign, the assumption of such error is not required to harmonize the account. Jewish commentators quote the <em>Seder Olam,</em> which suggests that the thirty-sixth year was reckoned from the existence of the separate kingdom of Judah (997 B.C.E.) and corresponded to the sixteenth year of Asa (Rehoboam ruling seventeen years, Abijah three years and Asa now in his sixteenth year). (<em>Soncino Books of the Bible,</em> footnote on <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 16:1</a>) This was also the view of Archbishop Ussher. So, too, the apparent difference between the statement at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 15:19</a> to the effect that, as for “war, it did not occur down to the thirty-fifth [actually, the fifteenth] year of Asa’s reign,” and the statement at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Kings 15:16</a> to the effect that “warfare itself took place between Asa and Baasha the king of Israel all their days,” may be explained in that once conflicts began between the two kings they were thereafter continuous, even as Hanani had foretold.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Chron. 16:9</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>ILLNESS AND DEATH</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Asa’s last three years brought suffering due to an illness of the feet (perhaps gout), and he unwisely sought physical healing over spiritual healing.

Jewish commentators quote the <em>Seder Olam,</em> which suggests that the 36th year was reckoned from the existence of the separate kingdom of Judah (997 B.C.E.) and corresponded to the 16th year of Asa (Rehoboam ruling 17 years, Abijah 3 years, and Asa now in his 16th year).

<strong>Jehovah’s Requirements for Life Seekers</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> But how many of the more than two and a half billion people now living on earth know God’s requirements and are meeting those requirements? It has been said many times that there are only two things in this life that man has to do. One is to pay taxes and the other is to die. The majority of people do not mind paying taxes because of the benefits received; but when it comes to dying, every sane person on earth will fight against it, because death pays no benefits, and man’s greatest desire is to live. Those interested in living and gaining life everlasting must do this one thing— <span id="page42" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="42" data-before-text="42"></span>gain knowledge of the Creator. “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961043/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 17:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961043/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Matt. 17:25-27</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 4.

This knowledge will enable one to know that Jehovah is the most high God, the supreme Ruler of the universe, the Creator of all things and the one who gave life in the beginning. This knowledge will enable one to understand that God is justly entitled to require things of those who are indebted to him. The psalmist David recognized this when he wrote: “Know that Jehovah is God. It is he that has made us, and not we ourselves. We are his people and the sheep of his pasturage.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961043/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 100:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961043/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Isa. 45:12</a>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu">5, 6.

To help us understand we might ask, “Why is it so important to know and obey the laws of the government under which we live?” What would happen if we should refuse to pay our taxes or if we should steal? If we got caught we would have to pay a fine or go to jail. We could not say to the judge, “Judge, you cannot fine me; you cannot put me in jail. I did not know what the laws were.” The judge would say, “Ignorance of the law is no excuse.” The laws have been recorded in writing for all to know, to understand and to obey.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> The same is true with God’s laws. Jehovah has laid down certain requirements for man to meet. If he fails to meet them or breaks them, he surely will get caught and be punished, because Jehovah’s “eyes are roving about through all the earth,” and no lawbreaker can escape his notice. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961043/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Chron. 16:9</a>) Nor can any plead ignorance of God’s laws or requirements, because at least portions of the Bible have been published in 1,151 languages and dialects. Jehovah is also sending forth his ministers by the hundreds of thousands to help all people who will listen to understand his book of laws. There have been more copies of the Bible sold throughout the world than any other book, yet for it to be the best seller means nothing. One statement from it will tell why: “All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961043/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:16, 17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961043/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Matt. 28:19, 20</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>WHY GOD’S REQUIREMENTS NOT UNDERSTOOD</strong></p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu">7, 8.

People wonder how this could be possible with so many different religious organizations supposedly teaching and instructing from God’s Word. Many people feel that if God’s requirements are not known or understood, it is because people are not attending and supporting the churches. Yet when we consider the facts we find that Christendom, with its hundreds of sects and cults, is partly responsible for the prevailing misconceptions concerning God’s requirements.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Consider some of the requirements of the religions of this world and see if they are helping the people gain a knowledge and understanding of God.

When asked which one of the many different religious sects and cults you should choose, many have answered, “It does not make any difference. All will take you to the same place, only over different roads.” This is not the understanding we get from God’s Word. Did God say there are hundreds of faiths to choose from and whichever one we select or whichever one suits our fancy will be all right with him? Read the following words of Paul: “One Lord, one faith, one baptism.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961043/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Eph. 4:5</a>) Since that narrows it down to one true form of worship and we desire to find that true faith, it will take seeking.</p>

The wind, the earthquake, and the fire showed that the most powerful Being in the universe was there with Elijah.

<strong>Asa</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The record at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 14:2-5</a> states that Asa “removed the foreign altars and the high places and broke up the sacred pillars and cut down the sacred poles.” However, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 15:17 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 Kings 15:14</a> say that ‘the high places he did not remove.’ It therefore appears that the high places referred to in the earlier Chronicles account were those of the adopted pagan worship that infected Judah, while the Kings account refers to high places at which the people engaged in worship of Jehovah. Even after the setting up of the tabernacle and the later establishment of the temple, occasional sacrificing was done to Jehovah on high places, which was acceptable to him under special circumstances, as in the cases of Samuel, David and Elijah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Sam. 9:11-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 21:26-30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 1 Ki. 18:30-39</a>) Nevertheless, the regular approved place for sacrifice was that authorized by Jehovah.

Or it is possible that Asa did effect a complete removal of all high places but that such cropped up again in due time and were <span id="page139" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="139" data-before-text="139"></span>not removed at the time of the conclusion of his reign, allowing for their being smashed by his successor Jehoshaphat.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Asa’s zeal for right worship brought blessings of peace from Jehovah during the first ten years of his reign.

Though greatly outnumbered, Asa went out to meet the invasion at Mareshah to the SW of Jerusalem in the Judean lowlands. His fervent prayer before the battle was joined acknowledged God’s power to deliver and pleaded for Jehovah’s help, saying: “Upon you we do lean, and in your name we have come against this crowd. O Jehovah, you are our God. Do not let mortal man retain strength against you.” Total victory resulted.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Chron. 14:8-15</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Asa is thereafter met by the prophet Azariah, who reminds him that “Jehovah is with you as long as you prove to be with him,” and that “if you leave him he will leave you.” He calls to mind the internecine strife the nation experienced when alienated from Jehovah and urges Asa to continue his activity courageously on behalf of pure worship.

Asa, by some process of human reasoning or due to heeding bad counsel, now failed to rely solely on Jehovah and resorted to diplomacy and conspiratorial maneuvering to remove this threat. He took the temple treasures and those from the royal house and sent them as a bribe to King Ben-hadad of Syria to induce him to divert Baasha’s attention through an attack on Israel’s northern frontier. Ben-hadad accepted, and his raid on Israelite cities in the N disrupted Baasha’s building work and brought a withdrawal of his forces from Ramah. Asa now conscripted all the available manpower from the entire kingdom of Judah and carried off all Baasha’s supplies of building materials, using them to build up the cities of Geba and Mizpah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Ki. 15:16-22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 16:1-6</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">For this, Asa was confronted by Hanani the seer, who pointed out Asa’s inconsistency in not leaning upon the God who had delivered him from the vast Ethiopian force, reminding Asa that “as regards Jehovah, his eyes are roving about through all the earth to show his strength in behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him.” For his foolishness, Asa would now face continued warfare. Resenting correction, Asa unjustly jailed Hanani and showed himself oppressive others of the people.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Chron. 16:7-11</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The statement at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 16:1</a> that Baasha came up against Judah “in the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa” has caused some question, since Baash’s rule, beginning in the third year of Asa and lasting only twenty-four years, had terminated ten years prior to Asa’s thirty-sixth year of rule.

<strong>Jehovah’s Requirements for Life Seekers</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> But how many of the more than two and a half billion people now living on earth know God’s requirements and are meeting those requirements? It has been said many times that there are only two things in this life that man has to do. One is to pay taxes and the other is to die. The majority of people do not mind paying taxes because of the benefits received; but when it comes to dying, every sane person on earth will fight against it, because death pays no benefits, and man’s greatest desire is to live. Those interested in living and gaining life everlasting must do this one thing— <span id="page42" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="42" data-before-text="42"></span>gain knowledge of the Creator. “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961043/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 17:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961043/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Matt. 17:25-27</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 4.

This knowledge will enable one to know that Jehovah is the most high God, the supreme Ruler of the universe, the Creator of all things and the one who gave life in the beginning. This knowledge will enable one to understand that God is justly entitled to require things of those who are indebted to him. The psalmist David recognized this when he wrote: “Know that Jehovah is God. It is he that has made us, and not we ourselves. We are his people and the sheep of his pasturage.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961043/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 100:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961043/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Isa. 45:12</a>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu">5, 6.

To help us understand we might ask, “Why is it so important to know and obey the laws of the government under which we live?” What would happen if we should refuse to pay our taxes or if we should steal? If we got caught we would have to pay a fine or go to jail. We could not say to the judge, “Judge, you cannot fine me; you cannot put me in jail. I did not know what the laws were.” The judge would say, “Ignorance of the law is no excuse.” The laws have been recorded in writing for all to know, to understand and to obey.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> The same is true with God’s laws. Jehovah has laid down certain requirements for man to meet. If he fails to meet them or breaks them, he surely will get caught and be punished, because Jehovah’s “eyes are roving about through all the earth,” and no lawbreaker can escape his notice. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961043/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Chron. 16:9</a>) Nor can any plead ignorance of God’s laws or requirements, because at least portions of the Bible have been published in 1,151 languages and dialects. Jehovah is also sending forth his ministers by the hundreds of thousands to help all people who will listen to understand his book of laws. There have been more copies of the Bible sold throughout the world than any other book, yet for it to be the best seller means nothing. One statement from it will tell why: “All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961043/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:16, 17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961043/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Matt. 28:19, 20</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>WHY GOD’S REQUIREMENTS NOT UNDERSTOOD</strong></p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu">7, 8.

<strong>“Let Anger Alone”</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Take the case of a person who is corrected because of being guilty of some neglect or wrong. If he lets pride get in the way, he may become very angry about this. That is what happened to Judean King Asa. When corrected by the prophet Hanani for having shown a lack of faith, Asa became very angry. He put Hanani in “the house of the stocks” and also began oppressing others of his subjects. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975801/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Chron. 16:7-10</a>) Instead of giving vent to anger, Asa should have taken the reasonable view of the situation. He should have kept in mind that Hanani was speaking, not of his <span id="page648" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="648" data-before-text="648"></span>own originality, but as Jehovah’s messenger. It was a time for Asa to acknowledge his wrong and to express sincere repentance. Humility could have helped Asa to keep anger in check. So if we are going to heed the Bible’s counsel to “let anger alone,” we, too, need to cultivate humility.</p>

If he lets pride get in the way, he may become very angry about this. That is what happened to Judean King Asa. When corrected by the prophet Hanani for having shown a lack of faith, Asa became very angry. He put Hanani in “the house of the stocks” and also began oppressing others of his subjects. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975801/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Chron. 16:7-10</a>) Instead of giving vent to anger, Asa should have taken the reasonable view of the situation. He should have kept in mind that Hanani was speaking, not of his <span id="page648" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="648" data-before-text="648"></span>own originality, but as Jehovah’s messenger. It was a time for Asa to acknowledge his wrong and to express sincere repentance. Humility could have helped Asa to keep anger in check. So if we are going to heed the Bible’s counsel to “let anger alone,” we, too, need to cultivate humility.</p>

<strong>The More Important Healing</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> But aside from that, look at Christendom’s worse condition socially, politically, economically, judicially, morally, and religiously. Her condition is well described by Isaiah when telling of her ancient prototype, Israel: “Ah! sinful nation, guiltladen people; brood of evildoers, children who deal corruptly; who have forsaken the <span id="page305" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="305" data-before-text="305"></span>LORD, and spurned the Holy One of Israel, and gone back in estrangement from him! Where will you still be smitten, that you continue in your defection? The whole head is ailing, and the whole heart sick; from the sole of the foot to the head there is no health in it—nought but blows and bruises and bleeding wounds, that have not been pressed nor bound up nor softened with oil.” Which, then, is it that Christendom needs more, the healing of her people’s physical organisms or their spiritual healing?</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">17. Why is this the more important healing? How does Isaiah prescribe it?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Admittedly there is serious need of physical healing. Yet this physical well-being would never spare her from the woes and destruction of the impending war of Armageddon. It is the spiritual healing that is the more urgent, the more important, the really vital healing. For it is only those who seek and gain the spiritual recovery who will survive the terrible desolations and destructions of the “war of the great day of God the Almighty” and enter the healthy new world.

<strong>“There Exists a Reward for Your Activity”</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">In the 39th year of his reign, Asa became very ill with an ailment in his feet. “Even in his sickness he searched not for Jehovah but for the healers,” says the account. At that time, Asa seems to have been neglecting his spiritual health. Evidently in that condition and frame of mind, he died in the 41st year of his rule.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012607/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Chron. 16:12-14</a>.</p>

<strong>Asa</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The record at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 14:2-5</a> states that Asa “removed the foreign altars and the high places and broke up the sacred pillars and cut down the sacred poles.” However, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 15:17 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 Kings 15:14</a> say that ‘the high places he did not remove.’ It therefore appears that the high places referred to in the earlier Chronicles account were those of the adopted pagan worship that infected Judah, while the Kings account refers to high places at which the people engaged in worship of Jehovah. Even after the setting up of the tabernacle and the later establishment of the temple, occasional sacrificing was done to Jehovah on high places, which was acceptable to him under special circumstances, as in the cases of Samuel, David and Elijah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Sam. 9:11-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 21:26-30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 1 Ki. 18:30-39</a>) Nevertheless, the regular approved place for sacrifice was that authorized by Jehovah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Num. 33:52;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Deut. 12:2-14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Josh. 22:29</a>) Improper modes of high-place worship were also carried on in Jehovah’s name (compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Exodus 32:5</a>), and such may have continued in spite of the removal of the pagan high places, perhaps because the king did not pursue their elimination with the same vigor as the removal of the pagan sites. Or it is possible that Asa did effect a complete removal of all high places but that such cropped up again in due time and were <span id="page139" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="139" data-before-text="139"></span>not removed at the time of the conclusion of his reign, allowing for their being smashed by his successor Jehoshaphat.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Asa’s zeal for right worship brought blessings of peace from Jehovah during the first ten years of his reign.

Though greatly outnumbered, Asa went out to meet the invasion at Mareshah to the SW of Jerusalem in the Judean lowlands. His fervent prayer before the battle was joined acknowledged God’s power to deliver and pleaded for Jehovah’s help, saying: “Upon you we do lean, and in your name we have come against this crowd. O Jehovah, you are our God. Do not let mortal man retain strength against you.” Total victory resulted.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Chron. 14:8-15</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Asa is thereafter met by the prophet Azariah, who reminds him that “Jehovah is with you as long as you prove to be with him,” and that “if you leave him he will leave you.” He calls to mind the internecine strife the nation experienced when alienated from Jehovah and urges Asa to continue his activity courageously on behalf of pure worship. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Chron. 15:1-7</a>) Asa’s ready response and strengthening of the nation in true service to Jehovah results in a great number of persons from the northern kingdom abandoning that region to join in a grand assembly at Jerusalem in Asa’s fifteenth year of rule (963 B.C.E.), at which assembly a covenant is made declaring their determination to seek Jehovah and providing the death penalty for those not keeping this covenant.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Chron. 15:8-15</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>INTRIGUE AND WARFARE AGAINST BAASHA</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">King Bassha of Israel set out to block the path of any inclining toward a return to Judah by fortifying the frontier city of Ramah, located on the main road to Jerusalem and only a short distance N of that city. Asa, by some process of human reasoning or due to heeding bad counsel, now failed to rely solely on Jehovah and resorted to diplomacy and conspiratorial maneuvering to remove this threat. He took the temple treasures and those from the royal house and sent them as a bribe to King Ben-hadad of Syria to induce him to divert Baasha’s attention through an attack on Israel’s northern frontier. Ben-hadad accepted, and his raid on Israelite cities in the N disrupted Baasha’s building work and brought a withdrawal of his forces from Ramah. Asa now conscripted all the available manpower from the entire kingdom of Judah and carried off all Baasha’s supplies of building materials, using them to build up the cities of Geba and Mizpah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Ki. 15:16-22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 16:1-6</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">For this, Asa was confronted by Hanani the seer, who pointed out Asa’s inconsistency in not leaning upon the God who had delivered him from the vast Ethiopian force, reminding Asa that “as regards Jehovah, his eyes are roving about through all the earth to show his strength in behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him.” For his foolishness, Asa would now face continued warfare. Resenting correction, Asa unjustly jailed Hanani and showed himself oppressive others of the people.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Chron. 16:7-11</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The statement at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 16:1</a> that Baasha came up against Judah “in the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa” has caused some question, since Baash’s rule, beginning in the third year of Asa and lasting only twenty-four years, had terminated ten years prior to Asa’s thirty-sixth year of rule. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Ki. 15:33</a>) While some suggest a scribal error and believe the reference is to the sixteenth or the twenty-sixth year of Asa’s reign, the assumption of such error is not required to harmonize the account. Jewish commentators quote the <em>Seder Olam,</em> which suggests that the thirty-sixth year was reckoned from the existence of the separate kingdom of Judah (997 B.C.E.) and corresponded to the sixteenth year of Asa (Rehoboam ruling seventeen years, Abijah three years and Asa now in his sixteenth year). (<em>Soncino Books of the Bible,</em> footnote on <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010397/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 16:1</a>) This was also the view of Archbishop Ussher.

<strong>Burial, Burial Places</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Archaeological investigations give an idea of the type of burial places used in ancient times. Aside from simple earthen graves, in Palestine these were often vaults or chambers cut in the rock, often on hillsides. Elevated places seem to have been preferred. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Josh. 24:33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/33/1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 23:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/33/2" data-bid="34-3" class="b"> 2 Chron. 32:33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/33/3" data-bid="34-4" class="b"> Isa. 22:16</a>) The chamber might be for a single burial, the body being laid in an excavated place in the floor. Or it might be arranged for multiple burials, with long slots, large enough to accommodate one body each, cut into the sides of the chamber at right angles to the walls. The narrow opening through which the body was inserted was then covered with a stone cut to fit. In other cases a benchlike niche or shelf was cut into the rear and side walls (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Mark 16:5</a>) or there might be a double row of such shelves, thus increasing the capacity of the burial place. The tomb might even consist of more than one chamber, although the single chamber seems to have been the common type among the Jews. Where the body lay exposed on a shelf, it was, of course, necessary to seal off the entrance against the depredations of wild animals. Thus, the main entrance to the chamber was closed off with a large stone, at times hinged as a door, and occasionally with a circular one set in a track and rolled in front of the <span id="page269" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="269" data-before-text="269"></span>entrance. Such circular stones, not frequently found, might weigh as much as a ton or more.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Matt. 27:60;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/35/1" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> Mark 16:3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Simplicity marks the earlier Jewish burial places. They thus contrasted greatly with the pagan tombs, which often had paintings on the walls and other ornamentation. <em>The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge</em> (Vol. II, p. 308) comments: “Wherever in Jewish tombs rich ornamentation is found, foreign influence (generally Greek) is recognized . . . the stern opposition . . . to ancestor-worship discouraged adornment of burial-places, which thus differed widely from Egyptian and Phenician tombs. This and the lack of inscriptions make it difficult to determine the date of Jewish graves.” Although Jacob erected a pillar over Rachel’s grave, perhaps a single stone (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Gen. 35:20</a>), this seems to have simply been a marker, not a monument.

J. G. Duncan in the book <em>Digging Up Biblical History</em> (1931, Vol. II, p. 186) writes: “As a rule the Hebrews, though they sometimes buried within the city walls, excavated their rock-tombs on a hill-slope near to their city. The presence of rock-tombs on one hill-slope is often a sure indication that the hill opposite or near had had a settlement on it, and, on the other hand, the absence of any indication of burials near a site is a sure proof that the site had not been occupied.” The cliffs surrounding Jerusalem abound with burial places. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Isaiah 22:16</a>.) The reference to the ”graveyard of the sons of the people” (“burial place of the common people,” <em>RS</em>) in the valley of Kidron is believed to refer to a graveyard for the poorer class.

The Great Pyramid covers an area of some thirteen acres (5.3 hectares) and is composed of 2,300,000 blocks of stone, each block weighing about two and a half tons (2.3 metric tons) on the average. The Egyptian belief in immortality of the soul was the prime reason for mummification, and they also made elaborate provisions of food, furniture and equipment for use by the deceased royalty in the “afterlife.”</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Also notable as burial places were the catacombs of Rome, used for both Jewish and Christian burials. The catacombs consisted of a network of subterranean passages with burial niches excavated in the walls of the passages. While the greater part of Rome remains unexcavated, it is believed that there are over five hundred miles (805 kilometers) of such passages or galleries, containing as many as two million graves. During times of intense persecution these Roman catacombs served as meeting places for the Christians.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">In the Hebrew Scriptures the words <em>qeʹver</em> and <em>q<sup>e</sup>vu·rah</em>ʹ are used to refer to burial places and are distinct in meaning from the Hebrew <em>sh<sup>e</sup>ʼohl</em>ʹ<em>,</em> which refers, not to an individual grave or graves but to the common grave of all mankind, gravedom. Likewise, in the Christian Greek Scriptures the Greek word <em>taʹphos,</em> the common word for burial place or grave, and the words <em>mneʹma</em> and <em>mne·meiʹon,</em> meaning “tomb” and “memorial tomb,” are distinct from the word <em>haiʹdes,</em> the Greek equivalent of <em>sh<sup>e</sup>ʼohl</em>ʹ.—See HADES; MEMORIAL TOMB; SHEOL.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Embalming</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Egyptian embalming methods varied according to the importance of the individual or his wealth, and the procedure followed may have differed somewhat during various time periods. Herodotus (Greek historian of the fifth century B.C.E.) describes three methods of embalming practiced by the Egyptians of his day. The first and most expensive consisted of such steps as using an iron hook to remove part of <span id="page516" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="516" data-before-text="516"></span>the dead person’s brain through his nostrils and then destroying the rest of it by an infusion of drugs. Succeeding steps included making an incision in his side, removing his intestines and filling the abdominal cavity with pounded myrrh, cassia and other perfumes. The opening was then sewed up and the body steeped in natron (sodium carbonate) for seventy days, after which it was swathed in linen bandages, smeared with gum and given to the relatives. They, in turn, put it in a wooden case shaped like a person (a mummy case), which was placed upright against the wall of a sepulcher. The second and less expensive method was to make no incision but to inject cedar oil into the body at the rectum, prevent the oil’s escape, steep the body in natron and at the end of the prescribed period withdraw the oil, which carried away with it the intestines and stomach in a fluid state. The flesh was dissolved by the natron, so that only skin and bones remained, and the body was returned to thefamily in that condition. The third and cheapest method described by Herodotus, that used for the poor, was to rinse out the abdomen by means of an infusion of “syrmaea” (probably cassia and senna) and then steep the corpse in natron for seventy days.—<em>The History of Herodotus,</em> Book II, pars. 86-89.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Different embalming processes were used in other lands of antiquity. The Assyrians employed honey and the Persians used wax. It is reported that the body of Alexander the Great was preserved in both honey and wax.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">In Egypt bandages used to wrap the body have been found to be saturated with asphalt, gum, natron or resin. Sometimes amulets and other ornaments are found in these wrappings or upon the mummies, the Egyptians evidently believing that the amulets would be useful to the wandering soul. Certain mummy cases were made of sycamore and sometimes of cedarwood. In some instances the mummy was placed in one case, which was set within another. Stone cases have been used for mummies of royalty and rich persons, and within these there have been one or two wooden cases, the innermost containing the mummy itself.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Among the numerous mummies discovered was that of Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses II, found in 1881, which proved to be in exceptionally good condition despite the fact that well over 3,000 years had passed since his death and embalming. When the sarcophagus of Egyptian Pharaoh Tutankhamen (who is said to have lived during the 14th century B.C.E.) was opened in the 1920’s, three coffins, one within the other, were found inside, the innermost being of human form and made of gold, with the young pharaoh’s likeness painted on it. However, the mummy itself was in poor condition, having been considerably eaten away because of the excessive use of resins and oils during the embalming process.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">According to Herodotus, Egyptian embalming methods included soaking the corpse in natron for <em>seventy</em> days. Yet, when Jacob was embalmed by Egyptian physicians at a much earlier time, the Bible says “they took fully <em>forty</em> days for him, for this many days they customarily take for the embalming, and the Egyptians continued to shed tears for him seventy days.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011316/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Gen. 50:3</a>) Scholars have made various efforts to reconcile <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011316/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 50:3</a> with the words of Herodotus. For one thing, the forty days may not have included the time of the body’s immersion in natron. However, it is quite possible that Herodotus simply erred in saying the dead body was placed in natron for <em>seventy</em> days. The later Greek historian Diodorus Siculus (of the first century B.C.E.) said (I, 91) that the Egyptian embalming process lasted above thirty or forty days, and he gave the time of mourning for a deceased king as seventy-two days, perhaps including the day of burial. Of course, there may have been Egyptian embalming procedures that neither of these historians discussed, and it is possible that different time periods were involved in the embalming processes at various points in history.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>BURIAL OF HEBREWS AND CHRISTIANS</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The Scriptures, in telling about the burial of King Asa, state: “They laid him in the bed that had been filled with balsam oil and different sorts of ointment mixed in an ointment of special make. Further, they made an extraordinarily great funeral burning for him.” This was not cremation of the king, but a burning of spices. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011316/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Chron. 16:13, 14</a>) And, if this use of an ointment may be considered a form of embalming at all, it was not the type practiced by the Egyptians.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">When Jesus Christ died, Nicodemus brought “a roll of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds of it,” and it is stated: “So they took the body of Jesus and bound it up with bandages with the spices, just the way the Jews have the custom of preparing for burial.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011316/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 19:39, 40</a>) However, this was not specifically called embalming and it was not like embalming processes practiced by the Egyptians. It was the customary manner of preparing a body for burial, doubtless being similar to the way that Lazarus was prepared for interment. His case shows that the Jewish custom did not involve an elaborate embalming process designed to preserve the body for a long time, for when Jesus said, “Take the stone away,” Martha said: “Lord, by now he must smell, for he has been dead four days.” She would not have expected that condition to exist if Lazarus had actually been embalmed. Lazarus’ feet and hands were bound with wrappings and “his countenance was bound about with a cloth,” but the intention evidently had not been that of preserving his body from putrefaction—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011316/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 11:39,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011316/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 44</a>; see BURIAL, BURIAL PLACES.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"></p>

Thus he died and was buried in the graveyard of his forefathers; and all Judah and Jerusalem were mourning over Josiah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">2 Chron. 35:22-24</a>) Not all the kings of Jerusalem who preceded Josiah were buried in the same place at Jerusalem, in the “burial places of the kings of Israel.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">2 Chron. 28:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/41/1" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> 21:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/41/2" data-bid="42-3" class="b"> 24:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/41/3" data-bid="42-4" class="b"> 32:33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/41/4" data-bid="42-5" class="b"> 16:14</a>.</p><p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">31, 32.

Certainly when the patriarch Abraham died and was “gathered to his people,” he was not buried in the same grave with his father Terah, who died up north in Haran in the Mesopotamian valley, nor in the same graveyard or cemetery with Noah and Shem.</p>
