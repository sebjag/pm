<strong>Ahasuerus</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>3.</strong> The Ahasuerus of the book of Esther is believed to be Xerxes I, the son of the Persian king Darius the Great (Darius Hystaspis). Ahasuerus (Xerxes I) is shown as ruling over 127 jurisdictional districts, from India to Ethiopia. The city of Shushan was his capital during major portions of his rule.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000142/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Es 1:1, 2</a>.</p>

<strong>Cush</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Persian King Cambyses II (529-522 B.C.E.) conquered Egypt during the days of Pharaoh Psamtik III, and this opened the way for bringing Ethiopia under Persian control; thus, Ahasuerus (Xerxes I) could be spoken of as ruling “from India to Ethiopia [Cush].” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001089/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Es 1:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001089/32/1" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> 8:9</a>) Confirming this, Xerxes states in an inscription: “These are the countries​—in addition to Persia—​over which I am king . . . India . . . (and) Kush.”​—<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts,</em> p. 316.</p>

<strong>Esther, Book of</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Historical Circumstances.</strong> The account sets the time for its events during the reign of the Ahasuerus who ruled while the Persian Empire extended from India to Ethiopia and included <span id="page763" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="763" data-before-text="763"></span>127 provinces or jurisdictional districts. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001431/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Es 1:1</a>) These facts and its inclusion in the canon by Ezra confine its coverage to the period of the reign of one of the following three kings known to secular history: Darius I the Persian, Xerxes I, and Artaxerxes Longimanus. However, both Darius I and Artaxerxes Longimanus are known to have favored the Jews before the 12th year of their respective reigns, which does not fit the Ahasuerus of the book, as he apparently was not well acquainted with the Jews and their religion, nor was he inclined to favor them. Therefore, the Ahasuerus of the book of Esther is believed to be Xerxes I, son of the Persian king Darius the Great. Some translations (<em>AT, Mo</em>) even substitute “Xerxes” for “Ahasuerus” in the text.</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002168/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Es 8:9</a>) Scholars generally suggest that it denotes the area drained by the Indus River and its tributaries, that is, the Punjab region and perhaps also Sind. The testimony of the historian Herodotus (III, 88, 94; IV, 44) indicates that “India” first became a part of the Persian Empire during the rule of Darius Hystaspis (521-486 B.C.E.). In the time of Ahasuerus (considered to be Xerxes I, son of Darius Hystaspis), India was the eastern limit of the empire.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002168/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Es 1:1</a>.</p>

<strong>Satrap</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A viceroy, or governor of a province, in the Babylonian and Persian empires appointed by the king as a chief ruler of a jurisdictional district. Daniel mentioned satraps as serving under Nebuchadnezzar in the Babylonian Empire. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003846/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Da 3:1-3</a>) After the Medes and Persians conquered Babylon, Darius the Mede set up 120 satraps over his entire kingdom. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003846/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Da 6:1</a>) Ezra had dealings with satraps in the time of King Artaxerxes of Persia. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003846/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezr 8:36</a>) In the days of Esther and Mordecai, the satraps supervised 127 jurisdictional districts under the Persian king Ahasuerus. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003846/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Es 1:1</a>) Being the king’s official representatives, they were responsible to him and had quite free access to his presence. Consequently, they wielded considerable influence and power as civil and political chiefs. They collected taxes and remitted to the royal court the stipulated tribute.</p>

<strong>Part 4—Medo-Persia—The Fourth Great World Power in Bible History</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Darius was succeeded by his son Xerxes, who apparently was the “Ahasuerus” of the Bible book of Esther. It says that Ahasuerus “was ruling as king from India to Ethiopia, over a hundred and twenty-seven jurisdictional districts” as he sat upon “his royal throne, which was in Shushan the castle.” It was there that Ahasuerus made the beautiful young Esther his queen. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988208/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Esther 1:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988208/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 2:17</a>) In the museum of the Louvre in Paris, you can see an ornate bull capital that stood atop a towering column in this palace, as well as wall decorations representing proud Persian archers and splendid animals. Alabaster flacons, jewelry, and other items that were found there fit well the Bible’s statements about the extensive beauty treatments given to Esther, as well as the luxury that existed in Shushan.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988208/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Esther 1:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988208/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 2:9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988208/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 12, 13</a>.</p>

We can relive the dramatic events of a decade (from about 484 to 474 B.C.E.) when God’s people faced probable genocide throughout the Persian Empire. Those were the days of Ahasuerus (evidently Xerxes I). Our venture into the distant past will be very rewarding, for such Biblical accounts were written for the instruction of godly persons, that ‘through our endurance and <span id="page13" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope.’​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979204/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 15:4</a>.</p>

<strong>Persecution by Permission of Jehovah—Why?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> The story begins in the court of King Ahasuerus, who was ruling over the vast empire of Persia and Media from India to Ethiopia. “Now it came about . . . in the third year of his reigning he held a banquet for all his princes and his servants.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Esther 1:1-9</a>) What does this suggest in modern times? At the end of the “times of the Gentiles” for world domination in 1914, the time had arrived for the Heir of King David, Jesus Christ, to assume his heavenly authority as King, to rule over all his subjects with royal power and authority, subjecting his enemies and exalting those whom he approves. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 21:20-24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Ps. 110:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 1 Cor. 15:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/11/3" data-bid="12-4" class="b"> Matt. 24:45-47</a>, <em>Authorized Version</em>) And in a remarkable preview given to the apostle John as recorded in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Revelation 12:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 12</a>, a time for great gladness came shortly <span id="page173" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="173" data-before-text="173"></span>thereafter to those who understood Bible prophecy. “And I heard a loud voice in heaven say: ‘Now have come to pass the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ [Messiah], because the accuser of our brothers has been hurled down, who accuses them day and night before our God! On this account be glad, you heavens and you who reside in them!’” So there was, at least, great rejoicing in the heavenly courts. Thus, King Ahasuerus, seated on his royal throne in splendor and wielding unlimited authority as to his vast empire, would well picture royal power in the hands of Jesus Christ in this “time of the end.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Dan. 12:1-4</a>.</p>

<strong>Part 19—“Your Will Be Done on Earth”</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> The ‘king’ symbolized by the bear was the line of Medo-Persian rulers from Darius the Mede to Darius III the Persian, from 539 B.C. to 331 B.C. This line of <span id="page474" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="474" data-before-text="474"></span>world rulers was symbolized by the silver breast and arms of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream image. This symbolic bear was “raised up on one side,” either to attack in order to seize, spread and maintain world power or else to show that the Persian line of rulers would take the ascendancy over the Median king, Darius, who was the first and only Mede in the Medo-Persian world rulership. The symbolic bear had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. These may denote the three directions in which the Persian world power pushed its conquests, to the north to humble Babylon in 539 B.C.; to the west through Asia Minor and across into Thrace; and to the south to conquer Egypt. The number three being also a symbol of intensity or emphasis, the three ribs may also emphasize the greed of this symbolic bear for territorial conquests.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 9.

Like a bear, this world power became fat with “a hundred and twenty-seven jurisdictional districts,” so that Ahasuerus or Xerxes I, the husband of the Jewish Queen Esther, was “king from India to Ethiopia.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959566/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Esther 1:1</a>.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu">10.

The ‘king’ that it symbolized was the Macedonian or Grecian line of world rulers, beginning with Alexander the Great. The speed with which Alexander conquered the Persian world power, moving through Asia Minor, then down into Egypt and finally eastward to the western borders of India, can well be likened to the speed of a leopard, what with four wings to increase its bounding agility and speed.

It included not only the domains of the Persian Empire but also Macedonia and Greece as well as Thrace. Alexander set out to conquer the Persian Empire in 334 B.C. He still had ambitious plans when he died June 13, 323 B.C., at Babylon. Daniel’s prophecy was correct in saying of this symbolic leopard, “Dominion was given to it”; it “shall rule over all the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959566/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Dan. 7:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959566/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 2:39</a>, <em>RS.</em></p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">11.

<strong>Part 4—Medo-Persia—The Fourth Great World Power in Bible History</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Darius was succeeded by his son Xerxes, who apparently was the “Ahasuerus” of the Bible book of Esther. It says that Ahasuerus “was ruling as king from India to Ethiopia, over a hundred and twenty-seven jurisdictional districts” as he sat upon “his royal throne, which was in Shushan the castle.” It was there that Ahasuerus made the beautiful young Esther his queen.

<strong>Cush</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Though Cushites were to be found in Arabia, the name “Cush” as used in the Bible in most cases clearly refers to a region in Africa and, where the relationship is obvious, translators simply render “Cush” as “Ethiopia.” It is regularly associated with Egypt (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isa. 20:3-5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 43:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/15/2" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> Jer. 46:7-9</a>) and also with Libya.

Cush thus embraced a more extensive and generally more southern area than that included in present-day <span id="page404" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="404" data-before-text="404"></span>Ethiopia. The “rivers of Ethiopia [Cush]” are suggested to have been the Blue and White Nile Rivers, which have their junction at Khartoum, and also the Atbara River, which joins the Nile S of the fifth cataract.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Zeph. 3:10</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The “Arabs that were by the side of the Ethiopians [<em>Ku·shim</em>ʹ]” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Chron. 21:16</a>) likely were those Arab tribes occupying the SW coast of the Arabian Peninsula and thus facing Africa across the Red Sea.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Much of the land of Cush was evidently arid desert country.

Ivory, ebony, gold, precious stones, iron and aromatics were products of the land, and Biblical mention is made of the “merchants of Ethiopia” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Isa. 45:14</a>) and the “topaz of Cush.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Job 28:19</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>LATER HISTORY</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">At about the time of the exodus of Israel from Egypt, Cush or Ethiopia had come under Egyptian domination and continued thus for some five hundred years. A viceroy administering this domain under the Egyptian Pharaoh was known by the title “King’s Son of Kush.” Evidently toward the close of the second millennium B.C.E. Ethiopia freed itself from Egypt’s control. The Ethiopian capital was thereafter located first at Napata, near the fourth cataract, and later at Meroe, about 130 miles (209 kilometers) N-NE of Khartoum.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Ethiopian warriors formed part of Pharaoh Shishak’s forces that attacked Judah in the fifth year of Rehoboam (993-992 B.C.E.).

This king came up against the forces of Sennacherib during their invasion of Judah (c. 732 B.C.E.), but, according to the Assyrian inscriptions, was defeated at Elteke.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">2 Ki. 19:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Isa. 37:8, 9</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Assyrian Emperors Esar-haddon and Ashurbanipal invaded Egypt during their respective reigns, and the destruction of Thebes in Upper Egypt (called No-amon at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Nahum 3:8-10</a>) by Ashurbanipal (c. 684 B.C.E.) completely subjugated Egypt and also ended Ethiopian dominance of the Nile valley.

<strong>Incorruption</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">United with Jesus in the likeness of his resurrection, his joint heirs also are resurrected, not merely to everlasting life as spirit creatures but to immortality and incorruption.

It therefore appears that God grants them the power to be self-sustaining, not dependent upon outside sources of energy as are his other creatures, fleshly and spirit. This is a stirring evidence of God’s confidence in them. Such independent and indestructible existence, however, does not remove them from God’s control and they, like their Head Christ Jesus, continue subject to their Father’s will and directions.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012118/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:23-28</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Part 4—Medo-Persia—The Fourth Great World Power in Bible History</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Darius was succeeded by his son Xerxes, who apparently was the “Ahasuerus” of the Bible book of Esther. It says that Ahasuerus “was ruling as king from India to Ethiopia, over a hundred and twenty-seven jurisdictional districts” as he sat upon “his royal throne, which was in Shushan the castle.” It was there that Ahasuerus made the beautiful young Esther his queen.

<strong>How to Read the Bible</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">What are some aids to productive reading of the Holy Bible? First, there is the matter of personal application. The reader of the Bible must be open to new insights into himself even though they are painful; and, above all, he has to be ready to revise or change his attitudes and actions in the direction of those insights. So as you read be on the lookout for any principles that apply to your life. Ask yourself: How does this affect my life? Does this call on me to make any adjustments to bring my attitude or actions into harmony with this expression of the divine will? For example, when reading Paul’s counsel, “Keep doing all things free from murmurings and arguments,” the true servant of God searches his heart to see if he is really conforming <span id="page474" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="474" data-before-text="474"></span>in this regard to the divine will.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961568/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Phil. 2:14</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">So as the Christian reads the Bible he is continually alert to find and apply principles that are a guide to his daily living, and not only that: He also considers how texts in the material he is reading support Bible truths that he discusses in his Kingdom ministry. So that he can use these texts in the future he makes note of them. A minister may find that he often refers to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961568/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 21:4</a> to show others that death inherited from Adam will be destroyed; so in reading <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961568/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">the fifteenth chapter of First Corinthians</a>, he will make a note of the text, “For he must rule as king until God has put all enemies under his feet. As the last enemy, death is to be destroyed.” Thus the minister of God plans to use this text in teaching others the divine purposes.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961568/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:25, 26</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Then there is the reading aid of asking questions, such as, ‘Why is this so?’ and, ‘Why did this happen?’ Such questions stir up thinking. Thus one may be reading <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961568/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 4:1, 2</a>: “Then Jesus was led by the spirit up into the wilderness to be tempted by the Devil. After he had fasted forty days and forty nights, then he felt hungry.” One might ask himself, “Why were forty days and forty nights necessary?” One might reason that Jesus used that time well, by meditating on God’s Word. But still why that length of time? As you reflect on the matter, by association your mind may think on other similar periods, how both Moses and Elijah experienced them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961568/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ex. 24:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961568/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 34:28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961568/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Deut. 9:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961568/7/3" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> 1 Ki. 19:8</a>) Further thinking brings to mind the transfiguration scene, wherein Jesus was transfigured with Moses and Elijah, and such thinking has given you insight into the matter: That Jesus went into the wilderness for that specific length of time to conform to these types and that the transfiguration scene required this conformity. So by asking questions to yourself and then reflecting on the matter, your understanding may be greatly enhanced.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>PROPHETIC IMPORT AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">As you read, then, be on the lookout for prophetic fulfillment, both in a minor and major way. If you are reading <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961568/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke, chapter nine</a>, about the transfiguration of Jesus, you may ask, being alert to prophetic import, “What does this mean?” If, after thinking about the matter, you do not arrive at a satisfactory answer, then do some research. Go to a Scripture index in one of the Watch Tower publications. Look under <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961568/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 9:29, 30</a> (or the corresponding verses in Matthew and Mark) or in a subject index under the word “transfiguration.” By doing this you will be referred to publications that show the transfiguration scene represented Jesus’ presence in Kingdom power and that he would do a work like that of both Moses and Elijah. You will also learn that the transfiguration was to Peter the fulfillment of Jesus’ promise that some of his disciples would not taste death until they had first seen the Son of man in his kingly power.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Sometimes as you read you will find it desirable to dig out background material to enhance your understanding. Suppose you are reading the book of Esther and you notice that much of the action takes place at “Shushan the castle,” or “the city of Shushan.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961568/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Esther 1:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961568/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 3:15</a>) You wonder, Where is this city? What was it like? Going to a Bible dictionary, you find that Shushan was really the Persian royal treasure city of Susa and that it was the royal winter residence. In one dictionary the reader will see a picture of an air view of the ruins of Susa, and you will see it was located on the Karkheh River, and that it is located in what is today southwest Iran. The name “Shushan” now means <span id="page475" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="475" data-before-text="475"></span>much more to you as you read this account in which the word so frequently occurs.</p>

Actually, the text does not say the banquet lasted that long, but that the king showed them the riches and glory of his kingdom for 180 days.

Perhaps the king used this lengthy event to show off the glory of his kingdom in order to impress the nobles and convince them of his ability to carry out his plans.

It is now the third year of his reign and he has called a conference of his princes, servants, military men and nobles.

<strong>A Powerful Identification of the Messiah</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Daniel 11:1</a> he mentions Darius the Mede and in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Da 11 verse 2</a> he prophesies that there will yet be three kings standing up for Persia and a fourth one who will amass greater riches than all the others and who “will rouse up everything against the kingdom <span id="page629" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="629" data-before-text="629"></span>of Greece.” The third king was Darius I, who began ruling the Persian Empire in 522 B.C.E. He had been preceded since Darius the Mede by two kings, Cyrus the Persian and Cambyses, Cyrus’ son. In 490 B.C.E. King Darius ordered a second Persian invasion of Greece. The Persian forces far outnumbered the Athenians, but at Marathon, Greece, the Persians were defeated. King Darius intended to invade Greece a third time but died in 486 B.C.E. before he could finish preparations.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Then the fourth king mentioned by Daniel rose up to make further attempts to conquer Greece. In some modern Bible translations his name is mentioned as Xerxes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Esther 1:1-3</a>, <em>AT, Mo</em>) In other Bible translations he is called Ahasuerus, as rendered according to the Hebrew. If Ahasuerus is Xerxes, he began to reign in December, 486 B.C.E. The reason that King Xerxes I figures in a discussion of the seventy weeks of Daniel’s prophecy is that he was the father of King Artaxerxes, who issued the decree to rebuild Jerusalem. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Neh. 1:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 2:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 7, 8</a>) King Xerxes I was the ruler who gave legal sanction to the Jews to defend themselves against being massacred by their enemies. Mordecai, the cousin of Xerxes’ Jewish wife Esther, was then acting as prime minister for Xerxes and he established for the Jews the memorial festival of Purim or Lots on the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the twelfth lunar month, Adar (February/ March). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Esther 9:20, 21</a>) Xerxes was then ruling in his twelfth year (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Esther 3:7</a>) and his rule must have extended over into his thirteenth year, to some time in 474 B.C.E., for after the decree of Xerxes other things took place, as stated at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Esther 9:32 to 10:3</a>:</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="si">“The command of Esther also confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in a book. Now King Xerxes laid a tribute on the land and the coast-lands of the sea. All the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai to which the king advanced him, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia? For Mordecai, the Jew, was next in rank to King Xerxes, and great among the Jews, and a favorite with the mass of his fellow-countrymen; for he sought the good of his people and voiced the welfare of his entire race.”—<em>AT.</em></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The third invasion of Greece had taken place before Xerxes’ twelfth year. Crossing the Hellespont in 480 B.C.E., Xerxes’ invasion forces, greatly outnumbering the Greeks, were defeated through the tactics of the Athenian general Themistocles. There was a Greek delaying action at Thermopylae that inflicted great losses on the Persians and that was followed by the destruction of more than half of Xerxes’ fleet. The following year the Greeks defeated the Persian army that had been left behind under the command of one of its ablest generals. On the same day the remains of the Persian fleet were destroyed near the promontory of Mycale in Asia Minor. The Persians never invaded Greece again.

<strong>Esther, Book of</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The account sets the time for its events during the reign of the Ahasuerus who ruled while the Persian Empire extended from India to Ethiopia and included 127 provinces or jurisdictional districts. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Esther 1:1</a>) These facts and its inclusion in the canon by Ezra confine its coverage to the period of the reign of one of the following three kings known to secular history: Darius I the Persian, Xerxes I and Artaxerxes Longimanus. However, both Darius I and Artaxerxes Longimanus are known to have favored the Jews before the twelfth year of their respective reigns, which does not fit the Ahasuerus of the book, as he apparently was not well acquainted with the Jews and their religion, nor inclined to favor them. Also, the fact that Xerxes I is known to have held a great feast and council of war in the third year of his reign before setting out against Greece tends to confirm the conclusion that the King Ahasuerus of the book of Esther must have been Xerxes I. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Esther 1:3</a>) <em>An American Translation</em> and Dr. James Moffatt’s translation even substitute Xerxes for Ahasuerus in the text. Xerxes I began to reign in 486 B.C.E., and according to the writings of Thucydides (of the fifth century B.C.E.), considered in conjunction with a table of chronology by Diodorus (of the first century B.C.E.), his reign terminated about 474 B.C.E. So he ruled about twelve years, probably into his thirteenth year, as indicated by <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Esther 3:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 9:1</a> and the events described in 9:15 to 10:3. Because the first events related in the book of Esther occurred in the third year of his reign, and the rest of the account covers the remainder of his reign, the book covers the <span id="page532" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="532" data-before-text="532"></span>period from about 484 to 474 B.C.E., approximately ten years.—See AHASUERUS No. 3.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Undoubtedly the book of Esther was committed to writing about 474 B.C.E., shortly after the events occurred. The book’s vivid style of writing suggests that the writer was an eyewitness. Moreover, the strong inference that the writer had access to governmental documents (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Esther 10:2</a>) makes it most likely that the book was written in Shushan in the province of Elam, which was then part of Persia. Its Persian and Chaldean words mixed in with Hebrew fit the above-mentioned time of writing as well as the land of Persia for the place of writing.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Ezra could have brought the book from Babylon to Jerusalem in 468 B.C.E., for the Great Synagogue of Jerusalem had it in the canon before its period ended about 300 B.C.E.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>AUTHENTICITY AND CANONICITY</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Canonical authority for the book of Esther is doubted by some, because it is not quoted or alluded to in the Christian Greek Scriptures. But this is no conclusive objection, for the same circumstance exists with other books of well-established canonicity, such as Ezra and Ecclesiastes. Melito of Sardis, Gregory of Nazianzus and Athanasius are among those who omitted it from their lists of canonical books. However, Jerome, Augustine and Origen refer to the book by name. It is in the Chester Beatty collection, the books of Ezekiel, Daniel and Esther being found in one codex, which was likely compiled in the first half of the third century C.E. It does not appear that its authority was ever doubted by the Jews or early Christians as a whole. In their Bibles the Jews place it after the Pentateuch and between the books of Joshua and Ecclesiastes, and sometimes among the Hagiographa (the Writings) between Ecclesiastes and Daniel.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Apocryphal additions were later inserted into the book. Some scholars date their origin at approximately 100 B.C.E., about 300 years after the canon of the Hebrew Scriptures was fixed, according to the traditional view.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The book of Esther is accused of exaggeration in its mention of a banquet lasting 180 days in the third year of the reign of Ahasuerus. (1:3, 4) However, it has been expressed that such a long feast may have been held to accommodate the numerous officials from the many provinces who could not, because of their duties, have been there for all of it and all at the same time. Actually, the text does not say the banquet lasted that long, but that the king showed them the riches and glory of his kingdom for 180 days. A banquet is mentioned at 1:3 and 1:5. It may be that two banquets are not meant, but that the seven-day banquet for all in the castle at the end of the great assembly is the one referred to in verse 3. (Keil and Delitzsch, <em>Commentaries on the Old Testament,</em> “Esther”) That such a great assembly and festival were held agrees with a statement of Herodotus about Xerxes beginning to make preparations for his expedition to Greece.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">In view of the book’s absence of any direct mention of God, it is charged with being irreligious. Nevertheless, it tells of fasting and a “cry for aid” on the part of the Jews, implying prayer. (4:3, 16; 9:31) Also, there is indication of God’s maneuvering of events in the sleeplessness of the king at the opportune time (6:1) and possible allusion to divine purpose in Esther’s attaining to the queenship. (4:14) Furthermore, the fact that Mordecai strictly refused to bow before God’s enemy Haman, who as an Agagite may have been a royal Amalekite, is evidence that Jehovah was worshiped by Mordecai.—3:1-6; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex. 17:14</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong><em>Evidence of history and archaeology</em></strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Historical and archaeological findings have added their voice in confirming the authenticity of the book of Esther. A few examples will suffice. The way Persians honored a man is described authentically. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Esther 6:8</a>) White and blue (or violet) were the royal Persian colors. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Esther 8:15</a> we read that Mordecai wore “royal apparel of blue and linen,” and a cloak of reddish purple.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Esther “took her stand in the inner courtyard of the king’s house opposite the king’s house, while the king was sitting on his royal throne in the royal house opposite the entrance of the house. And it came about that, as soon as the king saw Esther the queen standing in the courtyard, she gained favor in his eyes.” (5:1, 2) Excavations have revealed that the detail of the description is exact. A corridor led from the House of the Women to the inner court, and at the side of the court opposite to the corridor was the hall or throne room of the palace. The throne was placed in the center of the farther wall, and from this vantage point the king could look over the screen that intervened and could see the queen waiting for an audience. Further details in the book show an intimate knowledge on the part of the writer with the palace. It is evident that objections to the book on the grounds of being unhistorical and inaccurate as to Persian manners and customs are unfounded.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Very strong evidence for the book’s authenticity is the Festival of Purim, or “Lots,” commemorated by the Jews down to this day and on which anniversary the entire book is read in their synagogues. A cuneiform inscription found at Borsippa is said to refer to a Persian official by the name of <em>Mardukâ</em> (Mordecai?) who was at Susa (Shushan) at the end of the reign of Darius I or the beginning of the reign of Xerxes I.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>CONTENTS</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The book of Esther is a very moving drama that could be divided into three acts. However, it should be remembered that, far from being fictional, these acts are part of a real-life drama. After a brief description of the setting, chapter 1 presents a scene in the courtyard of the garden of the king’s palace, where a great banquet is being held for all the people of Shushan the castle. At the height of the merrymaking King Ahasuerus orders Vashti the queen to appear and show the people and princes her loveliness. At her persistent refusal, and on recommendation of his princes, he deposes her and makes announcement of this to all the peoples of the empire.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Scene 2 of the first act, described in chapter 2, takes us into the king’s house, where arrangements are being made to gather to the castle all the beautiful virgins of the empire and give them beauty treatments before presenting them to the king. From these the king is to select his new queen. The selection turns out to be Esther, a Jewish girl, the cousin of Mordecai her caretaker and a servant in the king’s gate.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">In the third scene, chapter 3 tells of the promotion of Haman and his success in obtaining authority from the king to issue a decree ordering the destruction of all the Jews in the empire.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Act 2 opens with a scene in front of the king’s gate, in which Mordecai counsels and exhorts Esther to intercede for her people even though she would be jeopardizing her life thereby.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Esther 4:2-17</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Scene 2 of this act is in the throne room of the palace. Esther appears uninvited before the king with the request that he and Haman be her guests at a banquet that day. After the banquet the scene shifts to Haman’s house, where Haman and a group of his friends are gathered. They decide on the erection of a fifty-cubit stake on which to hang Mordecai.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Esther 5:1-14</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">The king’s house is the setting for scene 4 of this act. Haman is approaching the king to ask for the hanging of Mordecai. The king, instead, has Haman honor Mordecai for his service in revealing a plot to take the king’s life. He is obliged to clothe Mordecai in royal apparel and lead him around the city square on horseback, calling out: “This is how it is done to <span id="page533" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="533" data-before-text="533"></span>the man in whose honor the king himself has taken a delight.” The act ends back in the house of Haman, to which Haman had rushed after this humiliating experience.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Esther 6:4-14</a>.</p>

<strong>Esther, Book of</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The account sets the time for its events during the reign of the Ahasuerus who ruled while the Persian Empire extended from India to Ethiopia and included 127 provinces or jurisdictional districts. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Esther 1:1</a>) These facts and its inclusion in the canon by Ezra confine its coverage to the period of the reign of one of the following three kings known to secular history: Darius I the Persian, Xerxes I and Artaxerxes Longimanus. However, both Darius I and Artaxerxes Longimanus are known to have favored the Jews before the twelfth year of their respective reigns, which does not fit the Ahasuerus of the book, as he apparently was not well acquainted with the Jews and their religion, nor inclined to favor them. Also, the fact that Xerxes I is known to have held a great feast and council of war in the third year of his reign before setting out against Greece tends to confirm the conclusion that the King Ahasuerus of the book of Esther must have been Xerxes I. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Esther 1:3</a>) <em>An American Translation</em> and Dr. James Moffatt’s translation even substitute Xerxes for Ahasuerus in the text. Xerxes I began to reign in 486 B.C.E., and according to the writings of Thucydides (of the fifth century B.C.E.), considered in conjunction with a table of chronology by Diodorus (of the first century B.C.E.), his reign terminated about 474 B.C.E. So he ruled about twelve years, probably into his thirteenth year, as indicated by <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Esther 3:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 9:1</a> and the events described in 9:15 to 10:3. Because the first events related in the book of Esther occurred in the third year of his reign, and the rest of the account covers the remainder of his reign, the book covers the <span id="page532" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="532" data-before-text="532"></span>period from about 484 to 474 B.C.E., approximately ten years.—See AHASUERUS No. 3.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Undoubtedly the book of Esther was committed to writing about 474 B.C.E., shortly after the events occurred. The book’s vivid style of writing suggests that the writer was an eyewitness. Moreover, the strong inference that the writer had access to governmental documents (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Esther 10:2</a>) makes it most likely that the book was written in Shushan in the province of Elam, which was then part of Persia. Its Persian and Chaldean words mixed in with Hebrew fit the above-mentioned time of writing as well as the land of Persia for the place of writing.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Ezra could have brought the book from Babylon to Jerusalem in 468 B.C.E., for the Great Synagogue of Jerusalem had it in the canon before its period ended about 300 B.C.E.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>AUTHENTICITY AND CANONICITY</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Canonical authority for the book of Esther is doubted by some, because it is not quoted or alluded to in the Christian Greek Scriptures. But this is no conclusive objection, for the same circumstance exists with other books of well-established canonicity, such as Ezra and Ecclesiastes. Melito of Sardis, Gregory of Nazianzus and Athanasius are among those who omitted it from their lists of canonical books. However, Jerome, Augustine and Origen refer to the book by name. It is in the Chester Beatty collection, the books of Ezekiel, Daniel and Esther being found in one codex, which was likely compiled in the first half of the third century C.E. It does not appear that its authority was ever doubted by the Jews or early Christians as a whole. In their Bibles the Jews place it after the Pentateuch and between the books of Joshua and Ecclesiastes, and sometimes among the Hagiographa (the Writings) between Ecclesiastes and Daniel.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Apocryphal additions were later inserted into the book. Some scholars date their origin at approximately 100 B.C.E., about 300 years after the canon of the Hebrew Scriptures was fixed, according to the traditional view.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The book of Esther is accused of exaggeration in its mention of a banquet lasting 180 days in the third year of the reign of Ahasuerus. (1:3, 4) However, it has been expressed that such a long feast may have been held to accommodate the numerous officials from the many provinces who could not, because of their duties, have been there for all of it and all at the same time. Actually, the text does not say the banquet lasted that long, but that the king showed them the riches and glory of his kingdom for 180 days. A banquet is mentioned at 1:3 and 1:5. It may be that two banquets are not meant, but that the seven-day banquet for all in the castle at the end of the great assembly is the one referred to in verse 3. (Keil and Delitzsch, <em>Commentaries on the Old Testament,</em> “Esther”) That such a great assembly and festival were held agrees with a statement of Herodotus about Xerxes beginning to make preparations for his expedition to Greece.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">In view of the book’s absence of any direct mention of God, it is charged with being irreligious. Nevertheless, it tells of fasting and a “cry for aid” on the part of the Jews, implying prayer. (4:3, 16; 9:31) Also, there is indication of God’s maneuvering of events in the sleeplessness of the king at the opportune time (6:1) and possible allusion to divine purpose in Esther’s attaining to the queenship. (4:14) Furthermore, the fact that Mordecai strictly refused to bow before God’s enemy Haman, who as an Agagite may have been a royal Amalekite, is evidence that Jehovah was worshiped by Mordecai.—3:1-6; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex. 17:14</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong><em>Evidence of history and archaeology</em></strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Historical and archaeological findings have added their voice in confirming the authenticity of the book of Esther. A few examples will suffice. The way Persians honored a man is described authentically. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Esther 6:8</a>) White and blue (or violet) were the royal Persian colors. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Esther 8:15</a> we read that Mordecai wore “royal apparel of blue and linen,” and a cloak of reddish purple.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Esther “took her stand in the inner courtyard of the king’s house opposite the king’s house, while the king was sitting on his royal throne in the royal house opposite the entrance of the house. And it came about that, as soon as the king saw Esther the queen standing in the courtyard, she gained favor in his eyes.” (5:1, 2) Excavations have revealed that the detail of the description is exact. A corridor led from the House of the Women to the inner court, and at the side of the court opposite to the corridor was the hall or throne room of the palace. The throne was placed in the center of the farther wall, and from this vantage point the king could look over the screen that intervened and could see the queen waiting for an audience. Further details in the book show an intimate knowledge on the part of the writer with the palace. It is evident that objections to the book on the grounds of being unhistorical and inaccurate as to Persian manners and customs are unfounded.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Very strong evidence for the book’s authenticity is the Festival of Purim, or “Lots,” commemorated by the Jews down to this day and on which anniversary the entire book is read in their synagogues. A cuneiform inscription found at Borsippa is said to refer to a Persian official by the name of <em>Mardukâ</em> (Mordecai?) who was at Susa (Shushan) at the end of the reign of Darius I or the beginning of the reign of Xerxes I.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>CONTENTS</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The book of Esther is a very moving drama that could be divided into three acts. However, it should be remembered that, far from being fictional, these acts are part of a real-life drama. After a brief description of the setting, chapter 1 presents a scene in the courtyard of the garden of the king’s palace, where a great banquet is being held for all the people of Shushan the castle. At the height of the merrymaking King Ahasuerus orders Vashti the queen to appear and show the people and princes her loveliness. At her persistent refusal, and on recommendation of his princes, he deposes her and makes announcement of this to all the peoples of the empire.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Scene 2 of the first act, described in chapter 2, takes us into the king’s house, where arrangements are being made to gather to the castle all the beautiful virgins of the empire and give them beauty treatments before presenting them to the king. From these the king is to select his new queen. The selection turns out to be Esther, a Jewish girl, the cousin of Mordecai her caretaker and a servant in the king’s gate.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">In the third scene, chapter 3 tells of the promotion of Haman and his success in obtaining authority from the king to issue a decree ordering the destruction of all the Jews in the empire.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Act 2 opens with a scene in front of the king’s gate, in which Mordecai counsels and exhorts Esther to intercede for her people even though she would be jeopardizing her life thereby.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Esther 4:2-17</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Scene 2 of this act is in the throne room of the palace. Esther appears uninvited before the king with the request that he and Haman be her guests at a banquet that day. After the banquet the scene shifts to Haman’s house, where Haman and a group of his friends are gathered. They decide on the erection of a fifty-cubit stake on which to hang Mordecai.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Esther 5:1-14</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">The king’s house is the setting for scene 4 of this act. Haman is approaching the king to ask for the hanging of Mordecai. The king, instead, has Haman honor Mordecai for his service in revealing a plot to take the king’s life. He is obliged to clothe Mordecai in royal apparel and lead him around the city square on horseback, calling out: “This is how it is done to <span id="page533" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="533" data-before-text="533"></span>the man in whose honor the king himself has taken a delight.” The act ends back in the house of Haman, to which Haman had rushed after this humiliating experience.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Esther 6:4-14</a>.</p>

The Hebrew word <em>kar·pasʹ,</em> which may refer to either fine cotton or fine linen, is similar to the Sanskrit word <em>karpasa</em> and the Greek <em>karʹpa·sos.</em> Many modern translations favor the rendering “cotton” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001047/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Esther 1:6</a>. It is there mentioned as among the materials used for decorating the palace courtyard during King Ahasuerus’ seven-day banquet at Shushan. The growing of cotton in Persia and in India extends far back into ancient times. While linen seems to have been more widely used in Egypt and Palestine, evidence for the use of cotton there also exists from the first millennium B.C.E. on.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The cotton plant of the Bible account is thought to have been the type classified as <em>Gossypium herbaceum.</em> The bush grows to a height of about 1.5 m (5 ft), blossoms with yellow or sometimes pink flowers, and following the drying up of the flowers, produces the cotton bolls or seed capsules. When ripe, the bolls split open, allowing the fluffy cotton to push out. After the cotton has been collected, the seeds must be picked out, or combed out, by passing the cotton through a gin. The cotton fibers are then ready for final processing and for weaving. Some scholars suggest that the “white fabrics” of the loom workers of Egypt mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001047/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 19:9</a> were probably of cotton.​—See <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001047/0">CLOTH</a>.</p>

Additionally, the effect of these powerful works of Jehovah was against magic, causing those who practiced magical arts to burn their books publicly.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010981/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Acts 19:13-20</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">God’s law to Israel commanded: “You must not wear mixed stuff of wool and linen together.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010981/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Deut. 22:11</a>) This likely meant two kinds of yarn fibers spun together.

At the end of the “times of the Gentiles” for world domination in 1914, the time had arrived for the Heir of King David, Jesus Christ, to assume his heavenly authority as King, to rule over all his subjects with royal power and authority, subjecting his enemies and exalting those whom he approves.

<strong>Vashti</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The queen of Ahasuerus (Xerxes I) the king of Persia. In the third year of his reign, Ahasuerus called in all the nobles, princes, and servants from the jurisdictional districts. At the end of the conference, he held a seven-day banquet. Similarly, Vashti held a banquet for the women at the royal house. On the seventh day, Ahasuerus ordered his court officials to bring in Vashti in royal headdress, that all might see her loveliness. (It seems that the queen would ordinarily eat meals at the king’s table, but history does not give proof of this as being the case at great banquets. Besides, at the time, Vashti was holding a banquet with the women.) For some unstated reason, Vashti persistently refused. Ahasuerus turned to his wise men who knew the law, and he was advised by Memucan, a prince, that it was not the king alone that Vashti had wronged but also all the princes and people in the jurisdictional districts. He said that when the princesses should hear what the queen had done (which news would quickly be spread in the castle), they would follow Vashti’s action as a precedent for contemptuous action on their own part. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004546/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Es 1:1-22</a>) Vashti was deposed, and about four years later, Esther the Jewess was selected to become the wife of Ahasuerus and to take the royal office of Vashti.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004546/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Es 2:1-17</a>.</p>

At the end of the “times of the Gentiles” for world domination in 1914, the time had arrived for the Heir of King David, Jesus Christ, to assume his heavenly authority as King, to rule over all his subjects with royal power and authority, subjecting his enemies and exalting those whom he approves. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 21:20-24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Ps. 110:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 1 Cor. 15:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/11/3" data-bid="12-4" class="b"> Matt. 24:45-47</a>, <em>Authorized Version</em>) And in a remarkable preview given to the apostle John as recorded in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Revelation 12:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 12</a>, a time for great gladness came shortly <span id="page173" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="173" data-before-text="173"></span>thereafter to those who understood Bible prophecy. “And I heard a loud voice in heaven say: ‘Now have come to pass the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ [Messiah], because the accuser of our brothers has been hurled down, who accuses them day and night before our God! On this account be glad, you heavens and you who reside in them!’” So there was, at least, great rejoicing in the heavenly courts.

Or perhaps this outwardly beautiful queen really was not submissive. While the Bible does not state her motive, the wise men of the day thought that obedience to the husband was definitely an issue and that Vashti’s bad example would influence all the wives in the provinces of Persia.</p>

<strong>Abagtha</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the <em>King James Version,</em> Abagtha is said to be one of seven “chamberlains,” and the marginal reading says “eunuchs.” While eunuchs were frequently used as trusted servants within royal households in Middle Eastern countries, the original Hebrew word <em>sa·risʹ</em> primarily has the meaning of “court official” and only secondarily has reference to a castrated person. Since these seven court officials were attendants of the king and apparently not assigned as guardians of the women (as was Hegai, the king’s eunuch mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000008/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Esther 2:3</a>), they may not have been eunuchs in the physical sense.</p>

This is supported by certain details given in the account. “The house of the women,” where the virgins were prepared for presentation to Ahasuerus, was located there.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003111/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Es 2:7</a>) Mordecai is portrayed solely in the Bible book of Esther. The book recounts his prominent part in the affairs of the Persian Empire early in the fifth century B.C.E. Evidence points to him as the writer of the book of Esther.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Some doubt the authenticity of the book or that Mordecai was a real person. Their objection, that he would have had to have been at least 120 years old with a beautiful cousin 100 years younger, is based on the erroneous assumption that <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003111/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Esther 2:5, 6</a> denotes that Mordecai went into Babylonian exile along with King Jeconiah. However, the Bible’s purpose in this text is, not to recount Mordecai’s history, but to give his lineage. Kish may have been Mordecai’s great-grandfather, or even an earlier ancestor who was “taken into exile.” Another view, harmonious with Biblical expression, is that Mordecai, though born in exile, was considered to have been taken into exile in 617 B.C.E., since he was in the loins of his ancestors, as yet unborn.​—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003111/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Heb 7:9, 10</a>.</p>

Why? Because out of Judah was to come the “Lion of the tribe of Judah,” the promised Shiloh.

Jacob said:</p><p id="p84" data-pid="84" class="si"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="62"></span>“Benjamin will keep on tearing like a wolf.

This was to say that Benjamin or his tribe would be like a wolf, not among the people of Jehovah God, but among the enemies of God’s people. This meant that the Benjaminites would be fighters for the worship and government established by Jehovah God. But toward the enemies of God they would be as fierce as evening wolves, tearing them to pieces like a wolf.

These two Benjaminites were used to bring about the destruction of the last of the enemy Amalekites who tried to have all the Israelites destroyed throughout the empire.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962482/94/0" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Esther 2:5-7</a>.</p><p id="p151" data-pid="151" class="qu">66.

<strong>Moon</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">While guided by the moon as a time indicator in determining their months and festival seasons, the Israelites were to remain free from the practice of moon worship that was prominent in the nations around them. The moon-god Sin was the city god of Ur, the capital of Sumer, from whence Abraham and his family departed for the Promised Land. Though the inhabitants of Ur were polytheistic, the moon-god Sin, a male deity, was the supreme god to whom their temple and altars were primarily devoted. Abraham <span id="page1177" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1177" data-before-text="1177"></span>and his party traveled from Ur to Haran, which was another major center of moon worship. Abraham’s father, Terah, who died in Haran, apparently practiced such idolatrous worship. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Gen. 11:31, 32</a>) In any case these circumstances add weight to the significance of Joshua’s warning to Israel prior to their entry into the Promised Land, as recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Joshua 24:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 14</a>: “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said, ‘It was on the other side of the River [Euphrates] that your forefathers dwelt a long time ago, Terah the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor, and they used to serve other gods.’ And now fear Jehovah and serve him in faultlessness and in truth, and remove the gods that your forefathers served on the other side of the River and in Egypt, and serve Jehovah.”</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Job also lived among moon worshipers and he faithfully rejected their practice of kissing the hand to the moon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 31:26-28</a>) The neighboring Midianites used moon-shaped ornaments, even placing them on their camels. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Judg. 8:21,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 26</a>) In Egypt, where both Abraham and later the people of Israel resided, moon worship was prominently practiced in honor of the moon-god Thoth, the Egyptian god of measures. Every full moon the Egyptians sacrificed a pig to him. He came to be worshiped in Greece under the title of Hermes Trismegistus (Hermes Thrice Greatest). Moon worship, in fact, extended all the way to the western hemisphere, where ancient ziggurat temples dedicated to the moon have been found in Mexico and Central America. Note, too, that in English the second day of the week still derives its name from the Anglo-Saxon worship of the moon, Monday originally meaning “moon-day.”</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The moon worshipers attributed powers of fertility to the moon and looked to it to make their crops and even their animals grow. In Canaan, where the Israelites finally settled, the worship of the moon was carried on by the Canaanite tribes with the accompaniment of immoral rites and ceremonies. There the moon was sometimes worshiped under the symbol of the goddess Ashtoreth (Astarte). Ashtoreth was said to be the female consort of the male god Baal, and the worship of these two frequently ensnared the Israelites during the period of the Judges. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Judg. 2:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 10:6</a>) King Solomon’s foreign wives brought the contamination of moon worship into Judah. Foreign-god priests directed the people of Judah and Jerusalem in making sacrificial smoke to the sun, moon and stars, a practice that continued until King Josiah’s time. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Ki. 11:3-5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/20/2" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> 2 Ki. 23:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/20/3" data-bid="21-4" class="b"> 13, 14</a>) When Jezebel, the daughter of the pagan king Ethbaal who ruled the Sidonians, married King Ahab of Israel she also brought with her the worship of Baal and, apparently, of the moon-goddess Ashtoreth.

It showed the moon to be simply a luminary and a convenient time indicator, but devoid of personality. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Gen. 1:14-18</a>) At the time of their approaching Canaan Jehovah specifically warned the nation of Israel that they should not worship him as being represented by his heavenly creations. Anyone practicing such worship was to be stoned to death. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Deut. 4:15-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 17:2-5</a>) By his prophet Jeremiah, God later declared that whether they were kings, priests, prophets or of the common people, such ones should become as “manure upon the face of the ground.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Jer. 8:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Some have tried to read into the text at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 33:14</a> an evidence of pagan influence or a superstitious attitude toward the moon. In the <em>Authorized Version</em> this text speaks of the “precious things put forth by the moon.” However, as more modern translations show, the sense of the word “moon” here is actually “months” or “lunar months” and basically refers to the monthly periods in which the fruits ripen.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Similarly, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Psalm 121:6</a> has been held by some to indicate a belief in the idea of illness caused by exposure to the moonlight. By reading the entire Psalm, however, it becomes evident that such assumption is unfounded, since the Psalm rather expresses in poetical form the assurance of God’s protection against adversity’s stroke under all circumstances and at all times, whether in the sunlit day or the moonlit night.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Still others have taken exception to the term “lunatick” found in the <em>Authorized Version</em> at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Matthew 4:24 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> Matthew 17:15</a>. This expression comes from the Greek word <em>se·le·ni·aʹzo·mai</em> and literally means “stricken by the moon.” In modern translations it is rendered by the word “epileptic.” Matthew’s use of this common Greek term for an epileptic on these two occasions does not mean that he attributed such illness to the moon nor that the Bible so teaches, but simply indicates that he used the word that was evidently, among Greek-speaking people of that time, the currently understood name for an epileptic. In this regard, we might note that the term “lunacy” is today primarily a legal term used by the courts to designate a degree of insanity, even though they do not attribute such insanity to the effects of the moon. Christians today similarly continue to use the name Monday for the second day of the week even though they do not view it as a day sacred to the moon.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>IN THE COMMON ERA</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">In the days of Christ Jesus and the apostles, moon worship was not in practice among the Jewish people. They did, of course, observe the new moons in accord with the Law covenant. The new moon of each month is still observed by Orthodox Jews as a minor day of atonement for sins committed during the month just ended.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Nisan 14, when the moon was approaching fullness, marked the time of the celebration of the Passover and also the time of the initiation by Jesus of the memorial supper or the Lord’s Evening Meal in memory of his death.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matt. 26:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 20,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/29/2" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> 26-30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/29/3" data-bid="30-4" class="b"> 1 Cor. 11:20-26</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">With the entrance of the new covenant, replacing the Law covenant, some of the Jewish Christians, as well as others, tended to hold to the practice of the celebration of the new moons as well as of the sabbath days, as shown by Paul’s corrective counsel at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Colossians 2:16, 17 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> Galatians 4:9-11</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Mordecai</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>2.</strong> “The son of Jair the son of Shimei the son of Kish a Benjaminite” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003111/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Es 2:5</a>), an older cousin and guardian of Esther. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003111/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Es 2:7</a>) Mordecai is portrayed solely in the Bible book of Esther. The book recounts his prominent part in the affairs of the Persian Empire early in the fifth century B.C.E. Evidence points to him as the writer of the book of Esther.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Some doubt the authenticity of the book or that Mordecai was a real person. Their objection, that he would have had to have been at least 120 years old with a beautiful cousin 100 years younger, is based on the erroneous assumption that <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003111/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Esther 2:5, 6</a> denotes that Mordecai went into Babylonian exile along with King Jeconiah. However, the Bible’s purpose in this text is, not to recount Mordecai’s history, but to give his lineage. Kish may have been Mordecai’s great-grandfather, or even an earlier ancestor who was “taken into exile.” Another view, harmonious with Biblical expression, is that Mordecai, though born in exile, was considered to have been taken into exile in 617 B.C.E., since he was in the loins of his ancestors, as yet unborn.​—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003111/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Heb 7:9, 10</a>.</p>

This expression comes from the Greek word <em>se·le·ni·aʹzo·mai</em> and literally means “stricken by the moon.” In modern translations it is rendered by the word “epileptic.” Matthew’s use of this common Greek term for an epileptic on these two occasions does not mean that he attributed such illness to the moon nor that the Bible so teaches, but simply indicates that he used the word that was evidently, among Greek-speaking people of that time, the currently understood name for an epileptic. In this regard, we might note that the term “lunacy” is today primarily a legal term used by the courts to designate a degree of insanity, even though they do not attribute such insanity to the effects of the moon. Christians today similarly continue to use the name Monday for the second day of the week even though they do not view it as a day sacred to the moon.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>IN THE COMMON ERA</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">In the days of Christ Jesus and the apostles, moon worship was not in practice among the Jewish people. They did, of course, observe the new moons in accord with the Law covenant. The new moon of each month is still observed by Orthodox Jews as a minor day of atonement for sins committed during the month just ended.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Nisan 14, when the moon was approaching fullness, marked the time of the celebration of the Passover and also the time of the initiation by Jesus of the memorial supper or the Lord’s Evening Meal in memory of his death.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matt. 26:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 20,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/29/2" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> 26-30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/29/3" data-bid="30-4" class="b"> 1 Cor. 11:20-26</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">With the entrance of the new covenant, replacing the Law covenant, some of the Jewish Christians, as well as others, tended to hold to the practice of the celebration of the new moons as well as of the sabbath days, as shown by Paul’s corrective counsel at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Colossians 2:16, 17 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> Galatians 4:9-11</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Persecution by Permission of Jehovah—Why?</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> First, however, King Ahasuerus found it necessary to replace the queen who had been deposed. It was recommended to him by his counselors that they gather together all the young virgins, the most beautiful ones of the entire realm, that he might select from their number the one who would please him most as a successor to Vashti. Before any of the young women could be brought in to the king, they must be properly prepared to meet him. This involved a year’s beauty treatment including massages with various kinds of oils under the strict supervision of Hegai, a trusted eunuch in the service of the king. Esther, whose name means “myrtle,” was included among these young women and she immediately found favor with Hegai so that “he made haste to give her her massages and her appropriate food, and to give her seven selected young women from the king’s house.” Esther had not told about her people or about her relatives, for her cousin Mordecai himself had laid the command upon her that she should not tell. Mordecai knew that Esther was going to be subjected to many environmental changes and pressures that might cause her to turn away from the law of her own people in which she had been instructed by her caretaker, Mordecai. He was determined that this not be the final outcome for her. So he continued to maintain a close supervision of her spiritual welfare. “And day after day Mordecai was walking before the courtyard of the house of the women to know of Esther’s welfare and what was being done with her.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Esther 2:1-11</a>.</p>

Why? Because out of Judah was to come the “Lion of the tribe of Judah,” the promised Shiloh. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962482/85/0" data-bid="86-1" class="b">Gen. 49:9, 10</a>) Hence in Ezekiel’s vision of the division of the land under God’s kingdom it was only in harmony with Benjamin’s loyal course that the tribe of Benjamin should be located right on the southern border of the Holy Contribution with its temple and city of Jehovah-shammah, whereas the tribe of Judah was just opposite, on the northern <span id="page407" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="407" data-before-text="407"></span>border of the Holy Contribution.

Just so, down to Jacob’s deathbed prophecy Benjamin was a much-loved son. Till then there was nothing in the record against Benjamin. Hence it was not to be expected that Jacob would prophesy anything against Benjamin, to lower him in our estimation. Jacob said:</p><p id="p84" data-pid="84" class="si"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="62"></span>“Benjamin will keep on tearing like a wolf.

This was to say that Benjamin or his tribe would be like a wolf, not among the people of Jehovah God, but among the enemies of God’s people. This meant that the Benjaminites would be fighters for the worship and government established by Jehovah God. But toward the enemies of God they would be as fierce as evening wolves, tearing them to pieces like a wolf.

It was recommended to him by his counselors that they gather together all the young virgins, the most beautiful ones of the entire realm, that he might select from their number the one who would please him most as a successor to Vashti. Before any of the young women could be brought in to the king, they must be properly prepared to meet him. This involved a year’s beauty treatment including massages with various kinds of oils under the strict supervision of Hegai, a trusted eunuch in the service of the king. Esther, whose name means “myrtle,” was included among these young women and she immediately found favor with Hegai so that “he made haste to give her her massages and her appropriate food, and to give her seven selected young women from the king’s house.” Esther had not told about her people or about her relatives, for her cousin Mordecai himself had laid the command upon her that she should not tell. Mordecai knew that Esther was going to be subjected to many environmental changes and pressures that might cause her to turn away from the law of her own people in which she had been instructed by her caretaker, Mordecai. He was determined that this not be the final outcome for her. So he continued to maintain a close supervision of her spiritual welfare. “And day after day Mordecai was walking before the courtyard of the house of the women to know of Esther’s welfare and what was being done with her.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Esther 2:1-11</a>.</p>

<strong>The Balsam of Gilead</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span id="page382" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="382" data-before-text="382"></span>From the Scriptures as well as from profane history it appears that the three outstanding characteristics of the balsam of Gilead were its costliness, its scent and its healing properties.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The balsam trees were considered so valuable that they repeatedly aroused the greed of invaders, and it is recorded that Pompey exhibited a balsam tree among his spoils of conquest of the land of Israel. The costliness of balsam is further implied by its being included by the patriarch Jacob among “the finest products of the land” as gifts to the premier of Egypt. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966446/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 43:11</a>) It is also to be seen in the fact that the queen of Sheba and other rulers included balsam oil in their gifts to King Solomon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966446/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Ki. 10:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966446/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966446/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 25</a>) When King Hezekiah wanted to show off the treasures of the kingdom of Judah to the emissary of the king of Babylon he showed him, among other things, his treasures of balsam oil.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966446/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 39:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">As for the scent of balsam oil, this caused it to be used for embalming and cosmetics. It is, therefore, not surprising to find it to be one of the ingredients of the holy oil used to anoint the high priest of Israel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966446/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ex. 25:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966446/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 35:8</a>) Its fine aromatic qualities are further indicated in that the final treatment of the candidates for queen for King Ahasuerus consisted of their being perfumed with balsam oil for six months.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966446/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Esther 2:12</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">References to the healing virtues of the balsam of Gilead are common in ancient literature, chiefly as a cure for wounds, although the Egyptians considered it as a preventive of the plague. In the Scriptures the references to its healing properties are all made by the prophet Jeremiah. Thus in connection with the spiritual plight of his people he asked: “Is there no balsam in Gilead? Or is there no healer there? Why is it, then, that the recuperation of the daughter of my people has not come up?” Yes, there was literal balsam in Gilead, but no spiritual balsam, no spiritual healing, because, as Jeremiah himself observed, “the prophets themselves actually prophesy in falsehood; and as for the priests, they go subduing according to their powers. And my own people have loved it that way; and what will you men do in the finale of it?” No wonder there was no spiritual healing!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966446/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jer. 8:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966446/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 5:30, 31</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Jeremiah makes a similar reference to Egypt: “Go up to Gilead and get some balsam, O virgin daughter of Egypt. In vain you have multiplied the means of healing. There is no mending for you.” And in much the same vein he speaks to the daughter of Babylon: “Howl over her, you people. Take balsam for her pain. Perhaps she may be healed. We would have healed Babylon, but she has not been healed.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966446/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Jer. 46:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966446/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 51:8, 9</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The balsam of Gilead, being a precious, perfumed medicinal oil, well pictures the comfort that Christians can receive when they are spiritually discouraged or depressed, by resorting to prayer, to association with fellow Christians, to study of God’s Word and also as they themselves seek to bring the spiritual balsam of Gilead to others who may be depressed and spiritually ill. It is with this thought in mind that the new songbook of Jehovah’s witnesses, <em>“Singing and Accompanying Yourselves with Music in Your Hearts,”</em> has a song in it entitled “Balsam in Gilead.”</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Highlights From the Book of Esther</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006162/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>2:14-17</strong></a>​<strong>—Did Esther have immoral sexual relations with the king?</strong> The answer is no. The account says that in the morning the other women brought to the king were returned to the second house under the charge of the king’s eunuch, “the guardian of the concubines.” The women who spent the night with the king thus became his concubines, or secondary wives. However, Esther was not taken to the house of concubines after seeing the king. When Esther was brought before Ahasuerus, “the king came to love Esther more than all the other women, so that she gained more favor and loving-kindness before him than all the other virgins.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006162/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Esther 2:17</a>) How did she gain Ahasuerus’ “favor and loving-kindness”? The same way she had won the favor of others. “The young woman was pleasing in [Hegai’s] eyes, so that she gained loving-kindness before him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006162/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Esther 2:8, 9</a>) Hegai favored her strictly on the basis of what he observed​—her appearance and good qualities. In fact, “Esther was continually gaining favor in the eyes of everyone seeing her.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006162/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Esther 2:15</a>) Similarly, the king was impressed with what he saw in Esther and therefore came to love her.</p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">After describing the beauty treatments, the Bible says: “Then on these conditions [each] young woman herself came in to the king. . . . In the evening she herself came in, and in the morning she herself returned to the second house of the women in charge of Shaashgaz the king’s eunuch, the guardian of the concubines. She would not come in anymore to the king unless the king had taken delight in her and she had been called by name.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991008/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Esther 2:13, 14</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The Scriptures say that Esther “was taken” to “the house of the women” for the lengthy, prescribed beauty regimen: “Then Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus . . . And the king came to love Esther more than all the other women, so that she gained more favor and loving-kindness before him than all the other virgins. And he proceeded to put the royal headdress upon her head and make her queen instead of Vashti.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991008/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Esther 2:8, 9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991008/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 16, 17</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Did you note from the Bible account where the women were taken after they had spent the night with the king? ‘To the second house of the women, under the guardian of the concubines.’ So they had become concubines. Mordecai, the writer of the Bible book of Esther, was a Hebrew, and among his people back then, a concubine had the social status of a secondary wife. The divine law provided that an Israelite man could take a foreign girl who was captured during war, and she would become his concubine, or secondary wife, with rights and legal protection. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991008/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 21:10-17</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991008/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Exodus 21:7-11</a>.) Children born to such a legal concubine were legitimate and could gain inheritance. Jacob’s 12 sons, forefathers of the 12 tribes of Israel, were the offspring of his wives and legal concubines.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991008/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 30:3-13</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The procedure was that after the virgins were with the Persian king, they went to the house of concubines. This indicates that they became his secondary wives.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">What about Esther? The Bible does not say that she slept with the king and thus gained his favor. It does not tell of her being taken to the house of concubines, but simply says: “Then Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus at his royal house . . . And the king came to love Esther more than all the other women.” Recall that earlier, without any sexual compromise of her virtuous and virgin state, she won the “loving-kindness” of “Hegai the guardian of the women.” Further: “All the while Esther was continually gaining favor in the eyes of everyone seeing her.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991008/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Esther 2:8, 9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991008/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 15-17</a>) So Esther clearly impressed the king and won his respect, even as she had won the respect of others.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">How thankful we can be to have the facts and insight that the Bible provides for us! Though we are thousands of years removed from the events, we thus have reason for confidence that Esther acted with true virtue and in accord with godly principles.</p>

This devout Jew of the tribe of Benjamin is a descendant of a certain Kish, whom the Babylonian monarch Nebuchadnezzar took into exile from Jerusalem along with King Jehoiachin (Jeconiah) and others (in 617 B.C.E.). Some time ago, Mordecai became the guardian of the Jewish orphan girl Hadassah, whose name means “myrtle.” Otherwise known as Esther (meaning “fresh myrtle”), she is the daughter of Mordecai’s deceased uncle Abihail. And what a lovely young woman she has become! Why, she is “pretty in form and beautiful in appearance.” It is not surprising that, as a replacement for Vashti is sought, Esther should be among the young women collected together at Shushan the <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>castle and placed in the charge of Hegai.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979204/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Esther 2:5-8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979204/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 15</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">11.

In fact, seven young women are chosen to attend her in the best area of the house of the women.

For six months, the selected virgins receive massages with oil of myrrh, followed by six months of massaging with balsam oil.

Tension runs high as Esther is taken before the king. Is he pleased with her? Indeed he is! The Persian ruler comes to love Esther more than all the other women and makes her queen instead of Vashti. For all his princes and servants the happy king holds a great feast, “the banquet of Esther.” Moreover, he grants an amnesty for the jurisdictional districts (perhaps remission of tribute, a release from military service or prison, or a combination of these). Ahasuerus keeps giving presents that only a monarch’s wealth would make possible.

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page174" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="174" data-before-text="174"></span><strong>Esther Manifests Divine Wisdom</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“EVERYTHING has its appointed hour, there is a time for all things under heaven: a time to kill, a time to heal, . . . a time to cry, a time to laugh, . . . a time for silence and a time for speech.” Appreciation of the wisdom of these words, recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950403/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 3:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950403/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 3, 4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950403/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 7</a> (<em>Moffatt</em>), will help all servants of Jehovah who would frustrate the designs of the enemies of truth and righteousness and make the most of their opportunities to serve him. Such will therefore peruse with interest and profit the record of one Esther, a Jewish maiden who followed this wise course.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Esther lived in the royal city of Shushan, capital of Persia, in the early part of the fifth century B.C., at the time when Xerxes (Ahasuerus) ruled the 127 provinces of the empire which extended from Ethiopia to India. Orphaned at a tender age, she had been reared by her cousin, Mordecai, a Benjamite. Her name “Esther” was the Persian equivalent for the Jewish “Hadassah”, meaning “myrtle”.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Esther first appears in the book by her name after Xerxes had deposed his queen Vashti for a serious act of insubordination and when the most beautiful virgins of the empire were being brought to the capital as likely candidates to replace the deposed queen. Esther was among those so chosen, for she was “fair and beautiful”, and from the record that follows it is quite apparent that she had a lovely disposition. It is not surprising, therefore, to learn that she immediately received preferment above all other virgins by the keeper of the king’s women, Hegai, when her time came to prepare her visit to the king.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Esther manifested wisdom by obeying Mordecai’s instructions not to reveal her identity as a Jewess; for why should racial prejudice disqualify her? Here was a time for silence. And after the prescribed beauty course, which lasted for twelve months, when it came her turn to visit the king and she was permitted to ask for anything she wished so as to appear before him in the most attractive manner possible, again she showed wisdom and contentment by keeping silent; trusting the maturer judgment of Hegai and asking for nothing save what he prescribed. Some girlish notion might easily have spoiled things.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Regarding her visit to the king we read: “The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she won favor and kindness in his presence more than all the maidens; so that he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.” Following this the king made a great feast, declared a national holiday and gave lavish gifts, all in honor of Esther his new queen.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950403/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Esther 2:16-18</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Not long thereafter Esther’s cousin Mordecai revealed to her a plot to kill the king, which she made known to the king and which upon investigation was found to be so. Here again she showed wisdom, for, while making sure to advise the king that it was Mordecai that had uncovered the plot, she ‘did not make known her kindred and people’. Though now a queen she still heeded the wise instructions of this wise and devoted servant of Jehovah the same as before.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Vashti had been deposed in the third year of Xerxes’ reign; four years had passed by the time Esther succeeded her. Now it was the twelfth year of his reign, about 475 B.C., as one day her maidens brought her the report that all the Jews in Shushan, including Mordecai, were in great distress, weeping, wailing and fasting and covering themselves with sackcloth and ashes. Perplexed, Esther sends clothes to Mordecai so that he could discard his garments of sackcloth, but he refuses to accept them. Troubled Esther then sends one of the king’s chamberlains, Hatach, who was at her service, to “learn what this was and why it was”.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Mordecai advises him of all that had happened to him and regarding the exact sum of money ($18,000,000) that Haman had promised to pay to the king’s treasuries for the destruction of the Jews. He also gives Hatach a copy of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy all the Jews on the 13th day of the twelfth month (Adar), which date had been determined by the casting of lots, that he might show it to Esther, and charges her to go in to the king and implore him on behalf of her people.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950403/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Esther 4:1-9</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">But Esther hesitates, and not without seemingly good reason: “All the king’s servants . . . know,” she tells Mordecai, “that whoever, whether man or woman, comes to the king into the inner court who is not summoned, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter that he may live; but I have not been summoned to come to the king these thirty days.” Was the king angry with her? Had she displeased him in some way and so was no longer, or at least not for the time being, in his favor? Thirty days seemed like a long time to ignore his lovely queen.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950403/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Esther 4:11</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">But Mordecai firmly stands his ground: “Think not,” he sends word to Esther, “to yourself that you will escape inside the royal palace any more than all the rest of the Jews. For if you remain altogether silent at this time, then relief and deliverance will rise up for the Jews from another quarter, . . . and who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?” Appreciating his line of reasoning, Esther, with her trust in Jehovah, replies: “Go, assemble all the Jews that are to be found in Shushan and fast for me . . . three days. . . . I also and my maidens will likewise fast, and then I will go to the king, which is not according to the law; and if I perish, I perish.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950403/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Esther 4:13-16</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em>) Without doubt, with the fasting went prayers to Jehovah for guidance and help.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">At the end of the three days Esther put on her royal robes—she was going to appear at her best—and then ventured into the king’s presence. When the king saw her she met with his favor and so he extended his scepter to her and inquired: “What is your wish, Queen Esther, and what is your request? It shall be given you even to the half of the kingdom.” Did Esther immediately blurt out all the facts regarding the dire straits she and all the Jews were in because of Haman’s foul conspiracy? No; urgent though the matter was, she showed tact, self-control and wisdom, appreciating that there was a time for everything, and so simply requested that the king and his grand vizier Haman come to a banquet she had prepared. First she would put the king in the best possible frame of mind, and by inviting Haman she not only would throw him off guard but would have him present at the time of his exposure.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950403/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Esther 5:1-4</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The king and Haman attend the banquet. At this she requests their presence at another banquet the following <span id="page175" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="175" data-before-text="175"></span>day, at which she would make known her petition. At the end of the second banquet she answers the king’s third request for her petition with the well-chosen words: “If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition and my people at my request; for we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold as male and female slaves, I would have held my peace, since the distress would not have been worth disturbing the king.” Coming at just this particular occasion, what a shock this news must have been to the king! No wonder he exclaimed in amazement: “Who is he, and where is he who dares presume in his heart to do so?” Where is he? Note here the wisdom of having Haman present at the banquet as she replies: “An adversary and an enemy, this wicked Haman.” Before the day was over Haman was hanging on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai, and Haman’s estate was given to the queen, who placed Mordecai in charge of it. Esther was well rewarded for her patience, courage, wisdom, and, above all, her trust in Jehovah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950403/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Esther 7:1-10</a>, <em>An Amer.

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">After describing the beauty treatments, the Bible says: “Then on these conditions [each] young woman herself came in to the king. . . . In the evening she herself came in, and in the morning she herself returned to the second house of the women in charge of Shaashgaz the king’s eunuch, the guardian of the concubines. She would not come in anymore to the king unless the king had taken delight in her and she had been called by name.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991008/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Esther 2:13, 14</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The Scriptures say that Esther “was taken” to “the house of the women” for the lengthy, prescribed beauty regimen: “Then Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus . . . And the king came to love Esther more than all the other women, so that she gained more favor and loving-kindness before him than all the other virgins. And he proceeded to put the royal headdress upon her head and make her queen instead of Vashti.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991008/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Esther 2:8, 9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991008/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 16, 17</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Did you note from the Bible account where the women were taken after they had spent the night with the king? ‘To the second house of the women, under the guardian of the concubines.’ So they had become concubines. Mordecai, the writer of the Bible book of Esther, was a Hebrew, and among his people back then, a concubine had the social status of a secondary wife. The divine law provided that an Israelite man could take a foreign girl who was captured during war, and she would become his concubine, or secondary wife, with rights and legal protection. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991008/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 21:10-17</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991008/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Exodus 21:7-11</a>.) Children born to such a legal concubine were legitimate and could gain inheritance. Jacob’s 12 sons, forefathers of the 12 tribes of Israel, were the offspring of his wives and legal concubines.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991008/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 30:3-13</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The procedure was that after the virgins were with the Persian king, they went to the house of concubines. This indicates that they became his secondary wives.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">What about Esther? The Bible does not say that she slept with the king and thus gained his favor. It does not tell of her being taken to the house of concubines, but simply says: “Then Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus at his royal house . . . And the king came to love Esther more than all the other women.” Recall that earlier, without any sexual compromise of her virtuous and virgin state, she won the “loving-kindness” of “Hegai the guardian of the women.” Further: “All the while Esther was continually gaining favor in the eyes of everyone seeing her.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991008/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Esther 2:8, 9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991008/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 15-17</a>) So Esther clearly impressed the king and won his respect, even as she had won the respect of others.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">How thankful we can be to have the facts and insight that the Bible provides for us! Though we are thousands of years removed from the events, we thus have reason for confidence that Esther acted with true virtue and in accord with godly principles.</p>

<strong>Ahab</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Convinced that Jehovah was a ‘mountain god’ only, Ben-hadad returned the following year with a military force of equal size, but drew up for battle at Aphek in the valley of Esdraelon rather than advancing into the mountainous region of Samaria. (See also APHEK 4.) Aphek lay near Jezreel, where Ahab had his preferred residence and a palace. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010141/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Ki. 21:1</a>) The Israelite forces advanced to the battle site but looked like “two tiny flocks of goats” compared to the massive Syrian encampment. Reassured by Jehovah’s promise to demonstrate that his power was not controlled by geography, Ahab’s forces dealt a crushing defeat to the enemy. (20:26-30) However, much like King Saul with Agag the Amalekite, Ahab let Benhadad survive and concluded a covenant with him by which captured cities would be returned to Israel <span id="page43" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="43" data-before-text="43"></span>and streets in Damascus would be assigned to Ahab, evidently for the establishment of resident Israelite commissioners who would look out for the commercial and political interests of Ahab’s kingdom in that Syrian capital. (20:31-34) Similar to Saul, Ahab was condemned by Jehovah for this, with future calamity foretold for him and his people.—20:35-43.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>MURDER OF NABOTH, AND CONSEQUENCES</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">During a three-year interval of peace, Ahab turned his attention to the acquisition of the vineyard of Naboth of Jezreel, a piece of land much desired by Ahab because it bordered his residential palace grounds there. When Naboth refused the request on the basis of God’s law regarding the inviolability of hereditary possessions, Ahab petulantly withdrew to his house, where he lay on his couch with his face to the wall, refusing to eat. Learning the cause of his dejection, pagan Jezebel arranged the murder of Naboth under guise of a trial for blasphemy, using letters written in Ahab’s name. When Ahab went to take possession of the coveted plot of ground he was met by Elijah, who scathingly denounced him as a murderer and as one who sold himself to do wickedness at the constant prodding of his pagan wife. As the dogs licked up Naboth’s blood so dogs would lick up Ahab’s blood, and Jezebel herself and Ahab’s descendants would become food for dogs and scavenger birds. These words hit home, and in deep grief Ahab fasted in sackcloth, alternately sitting and pacing the floor in despondence. On this basis a measure of mercy was extended to him as regards the time when the calamity would come on his house.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010141/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Ki. 21:1-29</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Ahab’s relations with Judah to the S were strengthened through a marriage alliance in which Ahab’s daughter Athaliah was married to King Jehoshaphat’s son Jehoram.

While a body of false prophets chorused their assurances of success, at Jehoshaphat’s insistence the prophet Micaiah, hated by Ahab, was called and predicted certain calamity. Ordering Micaiah’s arrest, Ahab stubbornly went ahead with the attack, though taking the precaution to disguise himself, but he was hit by a Syrian archer so that he slowly died. His body was brought to Samaria for burial and when “they began to wash off the war chariot by the pool of Samaria . . . the dogs went licking up his blood.” A large artificial basin has been excavated on the N side of the spacious palace courtyard in Samaria, and this may be the location of this fulfillment of prophecy.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010141/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Ki. 22:1-38</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>MOABITE AND ASSYRIAN INSCRIPTIONS</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Mention is made of the rebuilding of Jericho during Ahab’s reign, perhaps as part of a program for strengthening Israel’s control over Moab.

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">After describing the beauty treatments, the Bible says: “Then on these conditions [each] young woman herself came in to the king. . . . In the evening she herself came in, and in the morning she herself returned to the second house of the women in charge of Shaashgaz the king’s eunuch, the guardian of the concubines. She would not come in anymore to the king unless the king had taken delight in her and she had been called by name.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991008/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Esther 2:13, 14</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The Scriptures say that Esther “was taken” to “the house of the women” for the lengthy, prescribed beauty regimen: “Then Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus . . . And the king came to love Esther more than all the other women, so that she gained more favor and loving-kindness before him than all the other virgins. And he proceeded to put the royal headdress upon her head and make her queen instead of Vashti.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991008/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Esther 2:8, 9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991008/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 16, 17</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Did you note from the Bible account where the women were taken after they had spent the night with the king? ‘To the second house of the women, under the guardian of the concubines.’ So they had become concubines. Mordecai, the writer of the Bible book of Esther, was a Hebrew, and among his people back then, a concubine had the social status of a secondary wife. The divine law provided that an Israelite man could take a foreign girl who was captured during war, and she would become his concubine, or secondary wife, with rights and legal protection. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991008/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 21:10-17</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991008/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Exodus 21:7-11</a>.) Children born to such a legal concubine were legitimate and could gain inheritance. Jacob’s 12 sons, forefathers of the 12 tribes of Israel, were the offspring of his wives and legal concubines.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991008/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 30:3-13</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The procedure was that after the virgins were with the Persian king, they went to the house of concubines. This indicates that they became his secondary wives.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">What about Esther? The Bible does not say that she slept with the king and thus gained his favor. It does not tell of her being taken to the house of concubines, but simply says: “Then Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus at his royal house . . . And the king came to love Esther more than all the other women.” Recall that earlier, without any sexual compromise of her virtuous and virgin state, she won the “loving-kindness” of “Hegai the guardian of the women.” Further: “All the while Esther was continually gaining favor in the eyes of everyone seeing her.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991008/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Esther 2:8, 9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991008/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 15-17</a>) So Esther clearly impressed the king and won his respect, even as she had won the respect of others.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">How thankful we can be to have the facts and insight that the Bible provides for us! Though we are thousands of years removed from the events, we thus have reason for confidence that Esther acted with true virtue and in accord with godly principles.</p>

<strong>Persecution by Permission of Jehovah—Why?</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Finally the day came for Esther to appear before the king. Unlike Vashti, who had leaned on her own understanding in her response to the king’s commands, <span id="page176" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="176" data-before-text="176"></span>Esther chose to take nothing with her when she went in before the king except what Hegai himself recommended. Today, too, those of the Esther class show themselves to be modest in appraisal of themselves and willing to follow the arrangement that is laid out for them in their service of the King. “And the king came to love Esther more than all the other women, so that she gained more favor and loving-kindness before him than all the other virgins. And he proceeded to put the royal headdress upon her head and make her queen instead of Vashti.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Esther 2:12-18</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> It must have been a joyful day indeed for the king to have before him on his throne a woman not only of great beauty but also of modesty and appreciation for her relationship to him. Today, too, there is great rejoicing to see those who since World War I ended became new believers, newly dedicated ones who symbolized their dedication to Jehovah God through Jesus Christ by water immersion from the year 1919 onward, especially down to 1931. Those coming in were anointed by God’s spirit as younger members of the “bride” class because the door was not yet closed to the high calling to reign with the heavenly Messiah. They were replacements that were being made for those who had been set aside because of their unsubmissive attitude. But these, like Esther, did not presume upon their new position. They continued to follow the arrangement of God just as Esther did that of Mordecai. “And the saying of Mordecai Esther was performing, just as when she happened to be under care by him.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Esther 2:19, 20</a>.</p>

<strong>Ahab</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Convinced that Jehovah was a ‘mountain god’ only, Ben-hadad returned the following year with a military force of equal size, but drew up for battle at Aphek in the valley of Esdraelon rather than advancing into the mountainous region of Samaria. (See also APHEK 4.) Aphek lay near Jezreel, where Ahab had his preferred residence and a palace. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010141/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Ki. 21:1</a>) The Israelite forces advanced to the battle site but looked like “two tiny flocks of goats” compared to the massive Syrian encampment. Reassured by Jehovah’s promise to demonstrate that his power was not controlled by geography, Ahab’s forces dealt a crushing defeat to the enemy. (20:26-30) However, much like King Saul with Agag the Amalekite, Ahab let Benhadad survive and concluded a covenant with him by which captured cities would be returned to Israel <span id="page43" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="43" data-before-text="43"></span>and streets in Damascus would be assigned to Ahab, evidently for the establishment of resident Israelite commissioners who would look out for the commercial and political interests of Ahab’s kingdom in that Syrian capital. (20:31-34) Similar to Saul, Ahab was condemned by Jehovah for this, with future calamity foretold for him and his people.—20:35-43.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>MURDER OF NABOTH, AND CONSEQUENCES</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">During a three-year interval of peace, Ahab turned his attention to the acquisition of the vineyard of Naboth of Jezreel, a piece of land much desired by Ahab because it bordered his residential palace grounds there. When Naboth refused the request on the basis of God’s law regarding the inviolability of hereditary possessions, Ahab petulantly withdrew to his house, where he lay on his couch with his face to the wall, refusing to eat. Learning the cause of his dejection, pagan Jezebel arranged the murder of Naboth under guise of a trial for blasphemy, using letters written in Ahab’s name. When Ahab went to take possession of the coveted plot of ground he was met by Elijah, who scathingly denounced him as a murderer and as one who sold himself to do wickedness at the constant prodding of his pagan wife. As the dogs licked up Naboth’s blood so dogs would lick up Ahab’s blood, and Jezebel herself and Ahab’s descendants would become food for dogs and scavenger birds. These words hit home, and in deep grief Ahab fasted in sackcloth, alternately sitting and pacing the floor in despondence. On this basis a measure of mercy was extended to him as regards the time when the calamity would come on his house.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010141/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Ki. 21:1-29</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Ahab’s relations with Judah to the S were strengthened through a marriage alliance in which Ahab’s daughter Athaliah was married to King Jehoshaphat’s son Jehoram. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010141/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Ki. 22:44;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010141/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 8:18,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010141/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010141/9/3" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> 2 Chron. 18:1</a>) During a friendly visit by Jehoshaphat to Samaria, Ahab induced him to support him in an effort to retake Ramoth-gilead from the Syrians, who evidently had not carried out to the the full the terms of the covenant made by Ben-hadad. While a body of false prophets chorused their assurances of success, at Jehoshaphat’s insistence the prophet Micaiah, hated by Ahab, was called and predicted certain calamity. Ordering Micaiah’s arrest, Ahab stubbornly went ahead with the attack, though taking the precaution to disguise himself, but he was hit by a Syrian archer so that he slowly died. His body was brought to Samaria for burial and when “they began to wash off the war chariot by the pool of Samaria . . . the dogs went licking up his blood.” A large artificial basin has been excavated on the N side of the spacious palace courtyard in Samaria, and this may be the location of this fulfillment of prophecy.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010141/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Ki. 22:1-38</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>MOABITE AND ASSYRIAN INSCRIPTIONS</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Mention is made of the rebuilding of Jericho during Ahab’s reign, perhaps as part of a program for strengthening Israel’s control over Moab.

<strong>Persia, Persians</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The Persian rulers, while as capable of cruelty as the Semitic kings of Assyria and Babylonia, initially at least seem to have endeavored to manifest a degree of fairness and legality in their dealings with the conquered peoples. Their religion apparently contained some concept of ethics. Following their chief god <span id="page1294" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1294" data-before-text="1294"></span>Ahura Mazda, a principal deity was Mithra, who became known, not only as a god of war, but also as the god of contracts, the one whose eyes and ears were ever alert to spy out any violator of an agreement. (See GODS AND GODDESSES.) Greek historian Herodotus wrote of the Persians: “Beginning from the age of five years to twenty, they instruct their sons in three things only—to ride, to use the bow, and to speak truth. . . . To tell a lie is considered by them the greatest disgrace.” (Book I, pars. 136-138) While the history of the Persian rulers shows them to be not above duplicity and intrigue, yet a basic adherence to some tribal creed of ‘keeping one’s word’ may be reflected in their insistence on the inviolability of the “law of the Medes and the Persians.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Dan. 6:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Esther 1:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/8/3" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> 8:8</a>) Thus, when Cyrus’ decree was found some seventeen years after its date of issuance, King Darius recognized the legality of the Jews’ position as regards the building of the temple and gave orders that full cooperation be extended to them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ezra 6:1-12</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Considerable administrative ability is evidenced in the Persian imperial organization. In addition to the king’s own privy council or advisory board, composed of “seven princes of Persia and Media” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Esther 1:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Ezra 7:14</a>), there were satraps appointed over major regions or countries, such as Media, Elam, Parthia, Babylonia, Assyria, Arabia, Armenia, Cappadocia, Sardis, Ionia, and, as the empire expanded, Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya, and others. These satraps were granted a measure of autonomy in the government of the satrapy, including the administration of judicial and financial affairs within their territory. (See SATRAP.) Within the satrapy there appear to have been subordinate governors of jurisdictional districts (numbering 127 in King Ahasuerus’ day), and within the jurisdictional districts there were princes of the particular peoples composing the district’s population. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ezra 8:36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Esther 3:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 8:9</a>) Likely to overcome the disadvantage of the imperial capital’s being somewhat in a corner of the far-flung domain, a speedy system of communication was developed by means of a royal mail service employing couriers riding post horses, thereby connecting the throne with all the jurisdictional districts. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Esther 8:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 14</a>) Royal highways were maintained; one ran from Shushan all the way to Sardis in Asia Minor.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>FROM CYRUS’ DEATH TO NEHEMIAH’S GOVERNORSHIP</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The reign of Cyrus the Great ended in 530 B.C.E. due to his death while on a warring campaign. His son Cambyses II succeeded him to the throne and was successful in conquering Egypt. Though not referred to by the name Cambyses in the Bible, he is evidently the “Ahasuerus” to whom the opposers of the temple work sent accusations against the Jews, as stated at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ezra 4:6</a>. Daniel, who had prospered “in the kingdom of Darius [the Mede] and in the kingdom of Cyrus the Persian,” was likely dead by this time, having been taken captive to Babylon in 617 B.C.E.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Dan. 6:28</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The circumstances involving the end of Cambyses’ rule are confused. One account, set forth by Darius the Great in his Behistun Inscription, and recounted by Herodotus and others with certain variations, is that Cambyses had his brother Bardiya (called Smerdis by Herodotus) secretly put to death. Then, during Cambyses’ absence in Egypt, a Magian named Gaumata, posing as Bardiya (Smerdis), usurped the throne and was able to gain recognition as king. Cambyses, while returning from Egypt, either became sick and died or committed suicide, thereby leaving the usurper secure on the throne. The other version, favored by some historians, is that Bardiya had not been killed and that he, not some impostor, usurped the throne during Cambyses’ absence.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Whatever the case, the reign of Cambyses is considered as having ended in 522 B.C.E. and the rule that followed is believed to have lasted less than one year, ending also in 522 B.C.E. with the assassination of the usurper (either Bardiya or Gaumata the pseudo-Smerdis). Yet, during this brief rule it appears that a second charge against the Jews was directed to the Persian throne, the king then being designated in the Bible as “Artaxerxes” (perhaps a throne name or title), and this time the accusations were successful in producing a royal ban against further construction on the temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ezra 4:7-23</a>) The temple work then lay idle “until the second year of the reign of Darius the king of Persia.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ezra 4:24</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong><em>Darius the Great</em></strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Darius I (called Darius Hystaspis, or, Darius the Great) evidently engineered or instigated the slaying of the one occupying the Persian throne. His father Hystaspes appears to have held the position of a satrap in the empire and was of the same Achaemenian family as Cyrus, though of a different branch. Darius does not seem to have gained recognition as king until 521 B.C.E., the first part of his rule being marked by violent revolt throughout the empire, requiring several military campaigns to effect submission. Typical of the treatment dispensed to the rebel leaders was that given to Fravartish (Phraortes), who headed the revolt in Media. When finally captured, his nose, ears and tongue were cut off, his eyes put out and he was then put on public exhibition before being impaled.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">During Darius’ rule the temple work at Jerusalem was again renewed with royal approval and the temple was completed during his sixth year of rule (probably early in 515 B.C.E.). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ezra 6:1-15</a>) Darius’ reign was one of imperial reorganization and expansion. He reconquered rebellious Egypt, subdued Libya, and extended Persian dominion as far E as India and as far W as Thrace and Macedonia. At least by this time the Persian rulers had fulfilled the prophetic symbolisms of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Daniel 7:5 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 8:4</a>, where, under the symbols of a bear and also a ram, the Medo-Persian Empire is represented as seizing territories in three principal directions: to the N (as Assyria and Babylon), the W (Asia Minor and Thrace) and the S (Egypt). In a punitive campaign against Greece, however, Darius’ forces suffered defeat at Marathon in 490 B.C.E. Darius died a few years later (486 B.C.E.) before being able to avenge this defeat.—See DARIUS No. 2.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong><em>Xerxes</em></strong></p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Xerxes, Darius’ son, succeeded to the throne. He is evidently the king called “Ahasuerus” in the book of Esther. His actions also fit the description of the fourth Persian king who would “rouse up everything against the kingdom of Greece.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Dan. 11:2</a>) Endeavoring to retaliate for the Persian defeat at Marathon, Xerxes launched massive forces against the Greek mainland in 480 B.C.E. but suffered crushing defeats in both naval and land battles at Salamis, Thermopylae, and Plataea. While Xerxes is represented by some modern historians as a “weakling,” it appears that their judgment is based on the writings of the Greeks, who may well have been strongly prejudiced against Xerxes due to his military activity against their homeland. His reign was marked by certain administrative reforms and the completion of much of the construction work his father had initiated at Persepolis.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Esther 10:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The Greek stories of the end of Xerxes’ reign revolve around marital difficulties, disorders in the harem, and a supposed dominance of Xerxes by certain of his courtiers. These traditional accounts may reflect, though in a very confused and twisted way, some of the basic facts of the book of Esther, including the deposing of Queen Vashti and her replacement by Esther, and also the ascension of Mordecai to a position of great authority in the realm. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Esther 2:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 10:3</a>) According to the secular accounts, Xerxes was assassinated by one of his courtiers. While most secular authorities present 466/465 B.C.E. <span id="page1295" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1295" data-before-text="1295"></span>as the date of his death, thereby giving him a rule of some twenty-one years, an earlier date of 475/474 B.C.E. accords with the Bible record and has creditable testimony in its favor from certain of the ancient secular historians.—See ARTAXERXES No. 3.</p>

Though similarly faced with the threat of various calamities, David was secure in the knowledge that Jehovah was his Shepherd. Therefore, he could declare: “Even though I walk in the valley of deep shadow, I fear nothing bad.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014434/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 23:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014434/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 4</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“The pronouncement of the valley of the vision” evidently relates to ancient Jerusalem.

The Hebrew word <em>hana·chahʹ</em> here used occurs but once in the Scriptures. It is variously rendered as “release” (<em>LXX, KJ</em>), “remission of taxes” (one Targum and <em>RS</em>), “rest” (<em>Vg</em>), “holiday” (<em>AT</em>); and commentators suggest <span id="page96" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="96" data-before-text="96"></span>that the release, or amnesty, may have involved a remission of tribute, a remission of military service, release from prison, or a combination of these. A different Hebrew word (<em>shemit·tahʹ</em>) is used elsewhere in the Scriptures to describe a releasing from debt or suspension of labor.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000241/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">De 15:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000241/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000241/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 31:10</a>; see <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000241/0">SABBATH YEAR</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">As to a release of prisoners, it may be noted that during the reign of Xerxes I, believed to be the Ahasuerus of the book of Esther, a number of revolts occurred. An inscription from Persepolis attributed to Xerxes states: “After I became king, there were (some) among these countries . . . which revolted (but) I crushed (lit.: killed) these countries, . . . and I put them (again) into their (former political) status.” (<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts,</em> edited by J. B. Pritchard, 1974, p. 317) Political prisoners doubtless resulted from such suppression of uprisings, and the festive time of Esther’s being made queen may have been the occasion for Ahasuerus to efface the charges against such ones and grant them amnesty, or release. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000241/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mt 27:15</a>.) The precise nature of the amnesty, however, remains undetermined.</p>

Sennacherib’s prism, recounting his invasion of Judah in Hezekiah’s time, likewise shows Ammon as bringing gifts to the Assyrian invader, while Sennacherib’s son Esar-haddon, a contemporary of Manasseh, includes “Puduil, king of Beth-Ammon,” among those providing materials for building the city of Nineveh.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">It appears likely that, following the deporting of the people of the northern kingdom of Israel by Tiglath-pileser and subsequent Assyrian rulers (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010244/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">2 Ki. 15:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010244/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 17:6</a>), the Ammonites began occupying the territory of the tribe of Gad, for which they had unsuccessfully fought against Jephthah.

It does not mean, of necessity, that Ammonite and Moabite individuals could not associate themselves with or reside among the Israelites and thereby benefit from the divine blessings upon God’s people, and this is evident from the inclusion of Zelek, mentioned earlier, among David’s chief warriors, as well as from the record concerning Ruth the Moabitess.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010244/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Ruth 1:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010244/48/1" data-bid="49-2" class="b"> 16-18</a>.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">As to this latter case, Ruth’s marriage to Boaz shows that females of these races, upon turning to the worship of the true God, could be acceptable for marriage by Jewish males. Because the terms “Ammonite” and “Moabite” in the Hebrew text of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010244/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 23:3-6</a> are in the masculine gender the Jewish Talmud argues that only male Ammonites and Moabites were excluded from Israel. Nevertheless, Ezra’s insistence that the Jewish men send away their foreign wives and Nehemiah’s similar attitude, previously mentioned, indicate that the admission of Ammonite and Moabite females into association with Israel was dependent upon their acceptance of true worship.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Though historical evidence, including the apocryphal book of 1 Maccabees (5:6), shows that Ammon continued to be a distinct territory down till the second century B.C.E., by the first century B.C.E. the region appears to have become part of the Nabataean kingdom and by the third century C.E. the Ammonites as a race disappear from history, doubtless absorbed by the Arabic tribes. As Zephaniah had prophesied, the sons of Ammon had become “like Gomorrah, . . . a desolate waste.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010244/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Zeph. 2:8-10</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">In view of the disappearance of the Ammonites early in the Common Era, Daniel’s mention of Ammon in his prophecy of the “time of the end” must apply in a spiritual sense and would logically refer to those who are among the hard-set enemies of the spiritual Israel of God, the Christian congregation.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010244/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Dan. 11:40, 41</a>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb"></p>

Otherwise, Haman could likely have dismissed him immediately. Mordecai was thus in a position to learn of and to foil a plot to assassinate the king.</p>

Those coming in were anointed by God’s spirit as younger members of the “bride” class because the door was not yet closed to the high calling to reign with the heavenly Messiah. They were replacements that were being made for those who had been set aside because of their unsubmissive attitude. But these, like Esther, did not presume upon their new position.

While he sits in the king’s gate, court officials Bigthan and Teresh (who seemingly guard the door of the king’s private apartment) become indignant and keep seeking to lay hand on Ahasuerus.
