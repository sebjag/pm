<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>Why did Jesus just before his death quote David’s words found at</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021363/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 22:1</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Among the last words Jesus spoke before his death were those recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021363/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 27:46</a>: “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” By saying this, Jesus fulfilled the words of the psalmist David recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021363/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 22:1</a>. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021363/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mark 15:34</a>) It would be wrong to conclude that Jesus quoted these words because he was disappointed or because he had a momentary lack of faith. Jesus fully understood the reason why he needed to die, and he was willing to do so. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021363/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 16:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021363/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 20:28</a>) He also knew that at the time of his death, Jehovah would need to remove any “protective hedge” from around him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021363/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 1:10</a>) Jehovah thus allowed Jesus to prove beyond any doubt that he would remain faithful no matter what the circumstances of his death.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021363/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mark 14:35, 36</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">So why did Jesus utter the words of this psalm? Although we cannot be dogmatic, let us consider some possibilities.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2021363/0">a</a></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong><em>By uttering these words, was Jesus emphasizing that Jehovah would not intervene in his death?</em></strong> Jesus needed to pay the ransom without Jehovah’s help. He was fully human and needed to die so as to “taste death for everyone.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021363/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Heb. 2:9</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong><em>By quoting a few words from that psalm, was Jesus drawing attention to the whole psalm?</em></strong> It was common in those <span id="page31" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="31" data-before-text="31"></span>days for Jewish people to commit many of the psalms to memory. By being reminded of one verse of a psalm, they would naturally be prompted to think about the entire psalm. If this is what Jesus had in mind, then he would have helped his Jewish followers to remember the many prophecies contained in this psalm about the events surrounding his death. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021363/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 22:7, 8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021363/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 15, 16,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021363/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 18,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021363/8/3" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> 24</a>) Also, toward the end of the psalm, the triumph of Jehovah’s kingship is described as extending to the ends of the earth.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021363/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 22:27-31</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong><em>By quoting these words of David, was Jesus highlighting his own innocence?</em></strong> Prior to his death, Jesus had to endure an illegal trial that found him guilty of blasphemy. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021363/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 26:65, 66</a>) That trial was hastily convened late at night and was completely out of harmony with accepted legal standards. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021363/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 26:59;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021363/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Mark 14:56-59</a>) By quoting these words as a rhetorical question, Jesus may have been drawing attention to the fact that he had done nothing that deserved this type of punishment.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong><em>Was Jesus also reminding others that even though David, the writer of this psalm, was allowed to suffer, this did not mean that David had lost Jehovah’s approval?</em></strong> David’s question did not reveal a lack of faith. After raising the question, he went on to express confidence in Jehovah’s saving power, and Jehovah continued to bless him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021363/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 22:23, 24,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021363/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 27</a>) Similarly, even though Jesus, “the Son of David,” was suffering on the torture stake, this did not mean that Jehovah no longer approved of Jesus.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021363/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 21:9</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><strong><em>Was Jesus expressing his intense grief over the fact that Jehovah had to withdraw His protection from him so that he could fully prove his integrity?</em></strong> Jehovah did not originally purpose for his Son to suffer and die. That became necessary only after the first rebellion. Jesus had done nothing wrong, but he needed to suffer and die in order to answer the issues that Satan had raised and to provide the ransom price necessary to buy back what man had lost. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021363/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Mark 8:31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021363/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 2:21-24</a>) This could be accomplished only if Jehovah momentarily removed his protection from Jesus for the first time in his life.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong><em>Was Jesus trying to help his followers to focus on the reason why Jehovah allowed him to die in this manner?</em></strong><a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2021363/1">b</a> Jesus knew that this type of death as a criminal on a torture stake would stumble many. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021363/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Cor. 1:23</a>) If his followers focused on the real reason for his death, they would understand its true significance. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021363/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Gal. 3:13, 14</a>) They would then view him as a Savior and not as a criminal.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">No matter what reason Jesus had for quoting these words, he realized that what he was experiencing was part of Jehovah’s will for him. Shortly after quoting this psalm, Jesus said: “It has been accomplished!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021363/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">John 19:30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021363/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Luke 22:37</a>) Yes, the momentary withdrawal of Jehovah’s protection allowed Jesus to accomplish fully all that he was sent to earth to do. It also allowed him to fulfill all the things written about him “in the Law of Moses and in the Prophets and Psalms.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021363/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Luke 24:44</a>.</p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Connected to the foregoing is a likely second reason for Jesus’ utterance while on the stake, that by using these words he could fulfill a prophetic indication about the Messiah.

<strong>Abuse Endured Results in Glory</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">When suffering personally or hearing about the tribulation of others, one may naturally ask, ‘Why must this be?’ That was the experience of God’s servant David in ancient times. Surrounded by enemies, he felt as if God had abandoned him. Unaware of any guilt on his part, he asked: “My God, my God, why have you left me?

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Why, while hanging on the stake, did Jesus Christ cry out, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”​—U.S.A.</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jesus’ question was a quotation from a psalm of David. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972288/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 22:1</a>) In David’s case the question related to a momentary condition of abandonment. Surrounded by enemies, David found himself in a situation that made it appear that he was completely forsaken by Jehovah. The tremendous strain resulting therefrom moved David to ask why it had happened despite his being unaware of any guilt. But David had not lost faith, for in the same psalm he prayed: “Do make haste to my assistance.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972288/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 22:16-19</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Similarly, when uttering the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972288/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 22:1</a>, Jesus keenly sensed that his Father had momentarily withdrawn his protection and “forsaken” or released him into the hands of his enemies, to die as an accursed criminal on a stake. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972288/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gal. 3:13</a>) In asking “why,” Jesus did not imply that he did not know the reason for this abandonment nor was he expecting an answer from his Father. The situation is comparable to that of a Christian who knows the reason for human suffering but is moved, under the weight of intense difficulties, to ask “why” either silently or audibly. The questioner thereby reveals that he has no reason to think that the suffering is due to his transgressions. Thus, besides fulfilling <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972288/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 22:1</a>, Jesus’ outcry evidently served to confirm his innocence and focused on the real purpose for his suffering.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972288/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 27:46</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972288/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 12:27, 28,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972288/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 33</a>.</p>

<strong>Finding Answers to Your Bible Questions</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><span id="page126" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="126" data-before-text="126"></span>So Bible dictionaries can be helpful, especially in regard to information on people of the Bible, Bible history, names, geography, daily life of peoples, occupations, and so forth. However, they should be used cautiously, especially when they touch upon matters of Biblical doctrine.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>CROSS-REFERENCES</strong></p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">An aid that is of special value is that of Biblical cross-references. A number of Bibles have cross-references, but the one that is most helpful is the large-print edition of the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.</em> In the margin are scriptures, and reference is drawn to them by symbols, such as *, ▫, *, *, *, *, x, #, <sup>k</sup> to <sup>n</sup>, <sup>r</sup> to <sup>z</sup>. The foreword of the Bible, on page 24, says that these symbols “will lead you to helpful information, such as parallel passages, geographical and biographical points, passages quoted from, etc.”</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">So by making use of these cross-references in that edition of the <em>New World Translation,</em> you will often find helpful information. In fact, with that very question about Joseph, you would find a cross-reference after the words “Midianite merchants” that refers the reader to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965127/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Genesis 25:2</a>. There one learns that Midian was one of Abraham’s sons by Keturah. This is helpful because you can learn that the Ishmaelites and Midianites had a common forefather, namely, Abraham; thus it is more understandable that they would be closely associated and that the names might even be used interchangeably.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">By using such cross-references a vast amount of information may be obtained. One may ask why Jesus at the time just before his death said: “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965127/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 27:46</a>) If the inquirer uses the cross-reference Bible, he will note a reference to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965127/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 22:1</a>, and by reading that he will note that this was foretold in the psalm; and Jesus, in fulfillment of prophecy, uttered those words at the time when it appeared outwardly that he was forsaken by God.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>CONCORDANCES</strong></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Another help in finding answers to your Bible questions is a Bible concordance, which is an alphabetical index of words, showing the places in the text of the Bible where certain words may be found. Some are large and exhaustive, others are small, using only principal words. A major help in this regard is the section entitled “Important Bible Words for Quick Reference,” found at the back of the 1961 edition of the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.</em></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">This section of the Bible can be used in many ways. For example, suppose you desire information on the subject “Faith.” To find some of the most important scriptures on the subject, all you need do is turn to the back of the Bible and look up the key word “faith.” There you will find a number of helpful scriptures, such as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965127/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:6</a>: “Without faith it is impossible to please” God well, and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965127/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">James 2:26</a>: “Faith without works is dead.”</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Perhaps you remember the words of Jesus Christ, “All those who take the sword will perish by the sword.” But where is it found in the Bible? The concordance comes to your aid. By looking under the key word “sword,” for example, you can find the Biblical reference. It is <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965127/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matthew 26:52</a>. You found it by using the section “Important Bible Words for Quick Reference” at the back of the 1961 edition of the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.</em> So use Bible concordances, and you will benefit, indeed.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong>“WATCH TOWER PUBLICATIONS INDEX”</strong></p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">One of the most valuable aids of all in finding answers to Bible questions is the <em>Watch Tower Publications Index,</em> 1930-1960, <span id="page127" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="127" data-before-text="127"></span>along with its yearly supplements.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Since Jesus knew he was to be bruised by the great Serpent, Satan the Devil, in fulfillment of</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958498/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 3:15</strong></a><strong>, why did he, when dying on the torture stake, ask: “My God, my God, to what end have you forsaken me?”—</strong><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958498/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Matt. 27:46</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jesus on the torture stake asked this question, not because he did not know why Jehovah God, his heavenly Father, had forsaken him, but in order that prophecy might be fulfilled. The prophecy here fulfilled was one found in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958498/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 22</a>, which was written by David, who was a prophetic type of the Lord Jesus Christ in many respects.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the opening words of that psalm, David cries out: “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” (<em>AV</em>) When any disciples of Jesus who were standing near his torture stake, such as John and Mary, the mother of Jesus, heard him cry out those words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958498/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 22:1</a>, they may not at the time have appreciated why Jesus made such an outcry. But after understanding came upon them, following the outpouring of the holy spirit on the day of Pentecost, then they must have remembered and appreciated the fact that this prophetic outcry identified Jesus as the Christ, the Messiah of God.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">On the torture stake Jesus was indeed forsaken by his heavenly Father, Jehovah, in order that his integrity to God might be tested to the very limit. God forsook him, abandoning him to the cruel devices of Satan the Devil and his wicked religious agents on earth. Thus Satan, who has the means to cause death, was given free allowance to exercise that power against the Son of God.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">But God’s abandonment of Jesus was only as far as allowing the Devil and his dupes to put Jesus to death. This abandonment of Jesus did not include the disposal of his dead body or corpse. Instead of Jesus’ enemies taking his body down from the torture stake and casting it into the fiery valley of Hinnom (or Gehenna), his body was recovered from the torture stake by Joseph of Arimathea, who had the corpse buried in a new tomb that he had cut. This burial of Jesus meant he was in Sheol, the common grave of mankind. In Sheol he was not abandoned by Jehovah God, for <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958498/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 139:8</a> (which was written by David, a type of Jesus Christ) says: “If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, thou art there.” (<em>AS</em>) Hence on the third day after Jesus’ death Jehovah God showed that he had not permanently abandoned Jesus, by raising him from the dead to spirit life immortal. When Jesus later appeared to his disciples that same resurrection day he could therefore say: “All the things written in the law of Moses and in the Prophets and Psalms about me must be fulfilled,” including <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958498/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 22:1</a> (<em>AV</em>), namely, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958498/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Luke 24:44</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"></p>

Having this in mind, Jehovah in the Psalms foretold Jesus’ resurrection from the dead. The dead Jesus was buried in a nearby tomb in a rock and thus his soul, which he had poured out in death, went to Sheol or mankind’s common grave. But Jesus died with full hope of a resurrection, his hope being voiced in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 16:8-11</a>: “I have placed Jehovah in front of me constantly.

You will not allow your man of loving-kindness to see the pit. You will cause me to know the path of life. Rejoicing to the full is with your face; there is pleasantness at your right hand forever.” That this and other prophecies of the Psalms might be carried out, Jehovah God brushed aside the Devil’s preventive efforts and raised Jesus from the dead, delivering him from Sheol on the third day. God rewarded him with a spirit body in place of the sacrificed human body, that he might know again the path of life and know pleasantness at God’s right hand forever.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Acts 2:22-31</a>.</p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The foremost representative of Jehovah God is Christ Jesus, and in his case also this principle is confirmed. Jehovah God is rightly referred to as the Creator of all things, yet we know from the Bible record that after he directly created his “only-begotten Son” the remainder of the creation work was performed by and through that Son, in his capacity as the Logos or Word. But since he was Jehovah’s representative and workman in this creative activity, and empowered by God to do it, Jehovah himself is spoken of as the Creator of heavens and earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Isa. 40:26,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/13/2" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> John 1:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/13/3" data-bid="14-4" class="b"> Col. 1:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/13/4" data-bid="14-5" class="b"> Rev. 3:14</a>) For similar reasons, and because Jesus’ course and speech on earth were so perfectly representative of Jehovah God, Jesus said: “He that has seen me has seen the Father also.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">John 14:9</a>, <em>NW</em>) So this text proves no trinity teaching, no more so than do <span id="page479" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="479" data-before-text="479"></span>references that seeing angels was seeing God prove the representative angels were embraced in any trinity godhead.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>● Was Jesus’ side pierced with the spear before or after his death on the torture stake? The accounts of Matthew and John seem to conflict on this point.—D. L., Washington.</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The weight of evidence is that it was after death that his side was pierced. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 27:49, 50</a> (<em>NW</em>) says: “But the rest of them said: ‘Let him be! Let us see whether Elijah comes to save him.’ Another man took a spear and pierced his side, and blood and water came out. Again Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and ceased to breathe.” The <em>New World Translation</em> has a footnote that states that the sentence about the man piercing his side and blood and water coming out is in some important manuscripts but is not in others. The belief by many is that this statement was later interpolated from John’s Gospel, but was misplaced by the interpolater. Some translations leave it out entirely, others set it off in brackets or parentheses, and some put it in along with an explanatory footnote, as did the <em>New World Translation</em>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">However, there is nothing questionable about John’s account of the matter. It reads: “The soldiers came, therefore, and broke the legs of the first man and those of the other man that had been impaled with him. But on coming to Jesus, as they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. Yet one of the soldiers jabbed his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">John 19:32-34</a>, <em>NW</em>) The legs of the other impaled ones were broken to hasten death, and if Jesus had not already died his legs would have been broken. His early death worked for fulfillment of the prophecy that none of his bones would be broken. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 34:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> John 19:36</a>) That his death did come more quickly than usual in such cases is shown by Pilate’s surprise upon hearing that he was already dead. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Mark 15:44, 45</a>) Possibly the soldier speared Jesus’ side to remove all doubt of his death, and eliminate any later revival that might be falsely heralded as a resurrection, as could have happened if Jesus had only fainted.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">But what caused his death to come so soon? Many take the view that he died of a broken heart, and in this way explain not only his quick death but also the flow of “blood and water” from the spear wound. By a literal rupture of the heart or one of the great blood vessels where it attaches to the heart blood would be discharged into the pericardium, the membrane that loosely encases the heart and in which is also contained the watery pericardial fluid. In writing on the physical cause of Jesus’ death one doctor said that such a rupture did take place and blood gushed into the pericardium, there to separate into watery serum and red, soft clotted matter. He pointed out that such separation of the blood’s constituent parts seldom occurs in a dead body except under such cases of extravasation, that is, where the blood is forced or let out of its proper vessels. Then if a soldier standing below Jesus’ body on the stake would thrust a spear upward into the side, it could easily travel upward, under the ribs, pierce the pericardium bulging with serum and clotted matter, and cause the flow of what would appear as “blood and water”. Or, it is possible for the ruptured heart or aorta to force blood into the chest cavity, and in this unnatural place the blood would soon begin separating into serum and red clotted matter. Out of the big gash made by the upthrust spearhead this watery serum and clotted matter would gush.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">There are Scriptural grounds for the belief that Jesus died of a broken heart. His mental anguish at the moment was intense, as indicated by his words: “My God, my God, to what end have you forsaken me?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matt. 27:46</a>, <em>NW</em>) This expression of his feeling abandoned was foretold at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Psalm 22:1</a>, along with several other verses in that psalm that were prophetic of Christ Jesus at the time of his death. A broken heart could certainly be seen in the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ps 22 verse 14</a>: “I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.” Ordinarily blood would not flow from a corpse, but the piercing of the pericardium in the above-described state would be like puncturing a bag of water. And if he were pierced before death, as Matthew’s account indicates, blood would gush out but it would be whole blood, and not separated into its constituent parts to give the appearance of “blood and water”.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Hence the evidence is that John’s account is the accurate one, and certainly he was an eyewitness very near at hand, so near that the impaled Jesus spoke to him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">John 19:25-27</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"></p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● What was the “knowledge of good and evil” mentioned at</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951048/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 2:17</strong></a><strong>, and is it the same as that referred to at</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951048/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 3:5 and</strong></a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951048/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Ge <strong>3:22</strong></a><strong>?—G. G., South Africa.</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The “good and evil” in the three texts seems to refer to the one thing. Adam and Eve knew something about evil before eating the fruit from the “tree of the knowledge of good and evil”. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951048/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 2:17</a>) They knew it would be wrong for them to eat that fruit, and they knew that death was an evil to be shunned. To “be as gods, knowing good and evil” seems to mean more than just helpful knowledge of what is right and what is wrong. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951048/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 3:5</a>) The word <em>gods</em> could mean just Jehovah God, since the Hebrew word here is <em>Elohim</em> and can mean either God (Jehovah) or gods. If it means gods, then it could refer to Jehovah God and his co-creator and only-begotten Son, the Logos. It was to that one that Jehovah said, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951048/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 3:22</a>: “Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil.”</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">To know “good and evil” as Jehovah and his only-begotten Son know it would seem to mean to know good and evil for yourself, that is, you make the decision of what is good and what is evil, you judge what is right and what is wrong. Adam and Eve were no longer theocratic, no longer looked to God as the Universal Sovereign over all creatures, no longer accepted him as the one to determine right and wrong. They were going to determine for themselves what they were going to do on the earth, and not let God be the Supreme Arbiter.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Hence to the more responsible man, the woman’s head, Jehovah said in substance: ‘All right, Adam, if you want to be non-theocratic you go your own way. Decide for yourself what is good and evil from your viewpoint. You have no place in the garden of Eden. This garden is for theocratic people who are subject to me. Now get out.’ This view of the matter harmonizes with the fact that God does not assign the committing of sin as the reason for ousting Adam from Eden, but says it was because “the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil” and therefore should have no opportunity to eat of the tree of life.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>● What did Jesus mean by his words, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?”—F. M., Georgia.</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Jesus spoke these words in fulfillment of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951048/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 22:1</a>, which was originally written relative to David. Not that David was forsaken for impalement on any torture stake, but he was forsaken to the fury of enemies because of his faithfulness to the Kingdom covenant. In all this David was a prophetic type of Christ. Jesus was forsaken to a disgraceful death, on an accursed tree, in order to test his integrity. By remaining faithful he triumphed in his integrity, as the rest of the Psalm shows. Other verses of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951048/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 22</a> concerning David were fulfilled upon Jesus, further proving it was prophetic of the Greater David, Christ.

At the time Jesus uttered them on the torture stake they really had a background against which to be fulfilled. In this case God’s forsaking Jesus did not mean that God turned his back upon him as disapproved and condemned, but merely that God released him to the full fury of his enemies, even to the extent of allowing them to kill him. Thus God forsook or released Jesus over to his enemies, to be subject to the enemies to do whatsoever they wanted to do with him, not even shielding him from ignominious death.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The foremost representative of Jehovah God is Christ Jesus, and in his case also this principle is confirmed. Jehovah God is rightly referred to as the Creator of all things, yet we know from the Bible record that after he directly created his “only-begotten Son” the remainder of the creation work was performed by and through that Son, in his capacity as the Logos or Word. But since he was Jehovah’s representative and workman in this creative activity, and empowered by God to do it, Jehovah himself is spoken of as the Creator of heavens and earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Isa. 40:26,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/13/2" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> John 1:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/13/3" data-bid="14-4" class="b"> Col. 1:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/13/4" data-bid="14-5" class="b"> Rev. 3:14</a>) For similar reasons, and because Jesus’ course and speech on earth were so perfectly representative of Jehovah God, Jesus said: “He that has seen me has seen the Father also.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">John 14:9</a>, <em>NW</em>) So this text proves no trinity teaching, no more so than do <span id="page479" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="479" data-before-text="479"></span>references that seeing angels was seeing God prove the representative angels were embraced in any trinity godhead.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>● Was Jesus’ side pierced with the spear before or after his death on the torture stake? The accounts of Matthew and John seem to conflict on this point.—D. L., Washington.</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The weight of evidence is that it was after death that his side was pierced. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 27:49, 50</a> (<em>NW</em>) says: “But the rest of them said: ‘Let him be! Let us see whether Elijah comes to save him.’ Another man took a spear and pierced his side, and blood and water came out. Again Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and ceased to breathe.” The <em>New World Translation</em> has a footnote that states that the sentence about the man piercing his side and blood and water coming out is in some important manuscripts but is not in others. The belief by many is that this statement was later interpolated from John’s Gospel, but was misplaced by the interpolater. Some translations leave it out entirely, others set it off in brackets or parentheses, and some put it in along with an explanatory footnote, as did the <em>New World Translation</em>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">However, there is nothing questionable about John’s account of the matter. It reads: “The soldiers came, therefore, and broke the legs of the first man and those of the other man that had been impaled with him. But on coming to Jesus, as they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. Yet one of the soldiers jabbed his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">John 19:32-34</a>, <em>NW</em>) The legs of the other impaled ones were broken to hasten death, and if Jesus had not already died his legs would have been broken. His early death worked for fulfillment of the prophecy that none of his bones would be broken. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 34:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> John 19:36</a>) That his death did come more quickly than usual in such cases is shown by Pilate’s surprise upon hearing that he was already dead. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Mark 15:44, 45</a>) Possibly the soldier speared Jesus’ side to remove all doubt of his death, and eliminate any later revival that might be falsely heralded as a resurrection, as could have happened if Jesus had only fainted.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">But what caused his death to come so soon? Many take the view that he died of a broken heart, and in this way explain not only his quick death but also the flow of “blood and water” from the spear wound. By a literal rupture of the heart or one of the great blood vessels where it attaches to the heart blood would be discharged into the pericardium, the membrane that loosely encases the heart and in which is also contained the watery pericardial fluid. In writing on the physical cause of Jesus’ death one doctor said that such a rupture did take place and blood gushed into the pericardium, there to separate into watery serum and red, soft clotted matter. He pointed out that such separation of the blood’s constituent parts seldom occurs in a dead body except under such cases of extravasation, that is, where the blood is forced or let out of its proper vessels. Then if a soldier standing below Jesus’ body on the stake would thrust a spear upward into the side, it could easily travel upward, under the ribs, pierce the pericardium bulging with serum and clotted matter, and cause the flow of what would appear as “blood and water”. Or, it is possible for the ruptured heart or aorta to force blood into the chest cavity, and in this unnatural place the blood would soon begin separating into serum and red clotted matter. Out of the big gash made by the upthrust spearhead this watery serum and clotted matter would gush.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">There are Scriptural grounds for the belief that Jesus died of a broken heart. His mental anguish at the moment was intense, as indicated by his words: “My God, my God, to what end have you forsaken me?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matt. 27:46</a>, <em>NW</em>) This expression of his feeling abandoned was foretold at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Psalm 22:1</a>, along with several other verses in that psalm that were prophetic of Christ Jesus at the time of his death. A broken heart could certainly be seen in the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ps 22 verse 14</a>: “I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.” Ordinarily blood would not flow from a corpse, but the piercing of the pericardium in the above-described state would be like puncturing a bag of water. And if he were pierced before death, as Matthew’s account indicates, blood would gush out but it would be whole blood, and not separated into its constituent parts to give the appearance of “blood and water”.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Hence the evidence is that John’s account is the accurate one, and certainly he was an eyewitness very near at hand, so near that the impaled Jesus spoke to him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">John 19:25-27</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"></p>

<strong>“Certainly This Man Was God’s Son”</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">About the time the darkness ends, Jesus says: “I am thirsty.” In this he is fulfilling the scriptures.

Christ calls out in what may be Aramaic of a Galilean dialect: <em>“Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?”</em> which means, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” Some standing nearby misunderstand him and exclaim: “See! He is calling Elijah.” One of them runs and, placing a sponge soaked with sour wine on the end of a reed, gives Jesus a drink. But others say: “Let him be! Let us see whether Elijah comes to take him down.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102014732/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Mark 15:34-36</a>.</p>

The Hebrew word <em>hheʹres,</em> though sometimes applying to an earthenware vessel or earthenware flask that is unbroken (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013457/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Num. 5:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013457/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Jer. 19:1</a>), is from a root word meaning “to scrape” or “scratch” and can thus denote something rough, as a potsherd. When Satan struck Job with “a malignant boil” from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot, Job “proceeded to take for himself a fragment of earthenware with which to scrape himself.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013457/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 2:7, 8</a>) And concerning Leviathan it is stated: “As pointed earthenware fragments are its under parts.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013457/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 41:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013457/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 30</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Greek word <em>oʹstra·kon</em> (appearing in <em>LXX</em> at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013457/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 2:8</a>) means “shell” or “tile,” though the Greeks also applied the term to potsherds on which they recorded votes. The English words “ostraca,” “ostracism,” and so forth, have this derivation. According to ancient Athenian law an unpopular citizen or one considered dangerous could be banished if a sufficient number of votes against him were cast in the popular assembly and senate. The votes were written on shells, pieces of tile or potsherds.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCOVERIES</strong></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Potsherds or pieces of pottery are the most numerous items found by archaeologists during excavations of ancient sites. In the past, a broken piece of pottery might be used for such things as raking ashes or dipping water. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013457/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 30:14</a>) But especially were potsherds employed as inexpensive writing materials in Egypt, Mesopotamia and elsewhere in the ancient Middle East. For instance, earthenware fragments were used for the well-known Lachish Letters, which repeatedly contain the divine name, Jehovah, in Tetragrammaton form (YHWH). In Egypt, archaeologists have found numerous pieces of limestone and earthenware fragments on which there appear drawings and inscriptions written in ink (generally in cursive hieroglyphic script), many said to date from about the sixteenth to the eleventh centuries B.C.E. and some thus possibly reaching back to the days of Moses and of Israel’s bondage in Egypt. Certain of these inscribed fragments consist of stories, poems, hymns, and the like, some of which were probably written as school lessons. Earthenware fragments apparently were used as writing material by people generally much as memo pads and other pieces of paper are today, to record accounts, sales, marriage contracts, lawsuits and many other matters.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">More than sixty ostraca inscribed with ink in palaeo-Hebrew script were discovered in the ruins of the royal palace in Samaria. They seem to be records of vineyard production, many possibly dating from the time of Jeroboam II. They give names of places and persons, the latter including some compound forms involving the use of the names Baal, El and Yahweh. Greek ostraca found in Egypt include various types of documents, but principally tax receipts. They give some insight into the Greek language as spoken by the common people of that land during Ptolemaic, Roman and Byzantine times and so they are of some use in studies of the <em>koi·neʹ</em> Greek used by writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures. Twenty Greek ostraca found in Upper Egypt were inscribed with portions of the four Gospels, these probably dating from the seventh century C.E.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>USED IN FIGURATIVE WAY</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Potsherds are also used with figurative associations in the Scriptures. David, distressed and surrounded by enemies, said in a psalm prophetic of the Messiah’s sufferings: “My power has dried up just like a fragment of earthenware.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013457/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 22:11-15</a>) As articles made of clay were baked they would harden and become very dry.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Glazing methods were evidently common in King Solomon’s day, for <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013457/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 26:23</a> states: “As a silver glazing overlaid upon a fragment of earthenware are fervent lips along with a bad heart.” Like “silver glazing” that would hide the earthenware it covered, “fervent lips” could conceal “a bad heart” when there was only a pretense of friendship.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Oholibah, Jerusalem, was warned by Jehovah that she would be filled with drunkenness and grief, drinking the cup her sister Oholah, or Samaria, had drunk. Judah would drink this figurative cup to the limit, God’s judgments being fully executed upon her. Thus, through Ezekiel, God said: “You will have to drink it and drain it out, and its earthenware fragments you will gnaw.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013457/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ezek. 23:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013457/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 32-34</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The utter folly of man’s complaining about God and finding fault with the divine way of doing things is shown in the words: “Woe to the one that has contended with his Former, as an earthenware fragment with the other earthenware fragments of the ground!

Having this in mind, Jehovah in the Psalms foretold Jesus’ resurrection from the dead. The dead Jesus was buried in a nearby tomb in a rock and thus his soul, which he had poured out in death, went to Sheol or mankind’s common grave. But Jesus died with full hope of a resurrection, his hope being voiced in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 16:8-11</a>: “I have placed Jehovah in front of me constantly.

You will not allow your man of loving-kindness to see the pit. You will cause me to know the path of life. Rejoicing to the full is with your face; there is pleasantness at your right hand forever.” That this and other prophecies of the Psalms might be carried out, Jehovah God brushed aside the Devil’s preventive efforts and raised Jesus from the dead, delivering him from Sheol on the third day. God rewarded him with a spirit body in place of the sacrificed human body, that he might know again the path of life and know pleasantness at God’s right hand forever.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Acts 2:22-31</a>.</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1990206/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">19:23, 24</a>) Such a tunic might be woven of wool or linen in a single piece and could be white or of varied colors. Often sleeveless, it was worn next to the skin and reached to the knees or even the ankles. Of course, Jesus was not materialistic, but he did wear such a garment of good quality, his seamless tunic.</p>

And now that some clergymen have put forth the idea that “God is dead,” many wonder where they can find the truth about the matter. The truth can be found in the Holy Bible, and especially pertinent to this controversy of whether God lives is the testimony of fulfilled prophecy.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When prophecies of the Bible are seen being fulfilled, it is evidence that God lives. Humans cannot accurately foretell events and give precise details concerning them even a few years in advance, but God has done so centuries in advance. For example, centuries before the arrival of Jesus Christ on earth, God foretold in detail many things in connection with him.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>WHAT PROPHECIES CONCERNING JESUS TESTIFY</strong></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Consider Jesus’ birth. About seven hundred years in advance God inspired his prophet to foretell that it would take place in Bethlehem. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967121/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mic. 5:2</a>) And how remarkably this was fulfilled! It was, in fact, as a result of a royal decree of the Roman Caesar himself! The Jewish virgin Mary and her husband Joseph were living in Galilee, in Nazareth, some sixty or more miles north of Bethlehem, a long journey over rugged terrain in those days. However, Augustus Caesar’s registration decree required them to travel to Bethlehem to register​—at just the right time for Jesus to be born there!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967121/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 2:1-7</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Consider, also, the prophecies that were fulfilled at Jesus’ death. In the inspired Psalms it was foretold that not one of his bones would be broken, and that those present would cast lots for his clothing. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967121/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 34:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967121/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 22:18</a>) Did this occur? Since the day following the execution was a holy one to the Jews and bodies were not to be left on the torture stake overnight, the Roman soldiers proceeded to break the legs of the men to hasten their death. But since Jesus had just died, his were left unbroken. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967121/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 19:31-36</a>) As for Jesus’ inner garment, it was woven with no seam, so the soldiers decided to determine by lot whose it would be, rather than to tear it up and divide it. How miraculously these prophecies were fulfilled!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967121/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 19:23, 24</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Prophecies regarding Jesus’ time in the tomb and his resurrection likewise were astonishingly fulfilled. In the Psalms it was foretold that God would not leave his holy one in hell, or the grave. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967121/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 16:10</a>, <em>AV</em>) And Jesus himself explained that he would “be killed, and on the third day be raised up.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967121/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 16:21</a>) Was he?

Testified the apostle Peter: “This Jesus God resurrected, of which fact we are all <span id="page102" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="102" data-before-text="102"></span>witnesses.” The prophecies were fulfilled!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967121/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 2:30-32</a>.</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isa. 53:3</a>, <em>Leeser</em>) They “esteemed him not” because they mistakenly expected the Messiah to come in power and glory in the first century and deliver them from the yoke of Rome. This is confirmed by the <em>Daily Prayer Book,</em> which says on pages 145 and 146: “The rebuilding of Jerusalem as the City of Righteousness would usher in the Messianic era. . . . In that New Jerusalem, the Messianic King would establish his throne. Throughout the days of the Second Temple, this feeling prevailed, and it grew in intensity during the tyranny of the Herods, the Roman puppet-kings of Judea.” The Hebrews failed to see that the humble coming of the Messiah in the first century, which they rejected, was preparatory to <span id="page457" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="457" data-before-text="457"></span>the more glorious coming due in the time future to their day.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">As foretold at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 69:22</a> in the <em>Leeser</em> translation (verse 21 in others), he was given vinegar to drink by his enemies. As foretold at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 22:19</a> in the <em>Leeser</em> translation (verse 18 in others), lots were cast for his garments. As foretold at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Isaiah 53:9</a>, he was buried with the rich by being placed in a rich man’s empty tomb. He and his earthly mother could have no control over these things that happened to him in fulfillment of the prophecies.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">As foretold by <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>, he was a prophet like Moses, and as such he foretold the siege and destruction of Jerusalem. This took place more than thirty-five years later when the Romans burned the temple in 70 C.E. With the destruction of Jerusalem, Jesus Christ was proved a true prophet through whom God spoke. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Luke 21:20-24</a>) He was not God in the flesh, as some persons have mistakenly claimed, for he said: “I am ascending to my Father and your Father and to my God and your God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">John 20:17</a>) Nevertheless, he was the foretold Messiah.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Jesus fulfilled more than a hundred prophecies that were given to identify the Messiah. The chance that one man would fulfill them by accident is infinitesimally small. The fact that Jesus fulfilled them at a time when the genealogical records were in existence that proved his ancestry is further evidence identifying him as the promised Ruler from the house of David.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">The kingdom of Messiah was not established by God in the first century because God’s appointed time for this had not then come. People had to be instructed and shown the need for repentance because of their disobedience to God, just as in Jeremiah’s day. Unlike Jeremiah’s preparatory work, which took forty years and was limited mainly to Judea, the preparatory work for the Messiah’s kingdom was to be done earth-wide. That takes time. When the work is finished, the Messiah will then institute the revolutionary changes that will affect all mankind. As foretold at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Psalm 2:9</a>, he will smash the political governments man has made “like a potter’s vessel,” and he will bless people of all nations with a rule of justice, righteousness and peace, as foretold at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Isaiah 9:5, 6</a> in the <em>Leeser</em> translation (verses 6 and 7 in others).</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">It is during the second presence of the Messiah, when ruling from his glorious heavenly throne, that he will do what Hebrews mistakenly expected him to do in the first century. So the King Messiah is yet to bring to an end wicked rulers, oppression, injustice, wars and human suffering. To benefit from the changes he will bring, you must exercise faith in him and permit yourself to be guided by the preparatory work for his kingdom rule that he began more than 1900 years ago, at which time he fulfilled the prophecies that identify the Messiah. Your exercising faith in this Ruler from the house of David and in his God means eternal life under the righteous rule of his kingdom.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sd">Said a man who was trained at the feet of the famous Jewish Law teacher Gamaliel in the first century C.E.: “So we are declaring to you the good news about the promise made to the forefathers, that God has entirely fulfilled it to us their children in that he resurrected Jesus; even as it is written in the second psalm, ‘You are my son, I have become your Father this day.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Acts 13:32, 33</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Worship That Leads to the Kingdom of God</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><span id="page245" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="245" data-before-text="245"></span><strong>THE BOOK OF TRUE WORSHIP</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">However, regardless of what form of religion you now practice, you will want to know about the Kingdom hope that the Creator of mankind holds out to those that worship him in the way he approves. Yes, this Great Spirit <em>does</em> communicate with man today; no, not by means of a witch doctor or a religious clergyman, but through the pages of the oldest book in existence, a book that even records information about the first man and his creation by God. This is an Oriental book originating in and being written entirely by men from Eastern lands. This famous book, which contains the inspired writings of some forty Orientals, is generally called today the Holy Bible, or simply the Scriptures.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">In addition to its great antiquity the Bible from earliest times has realized the greatest distribution of any writings in existence. During the past five hundred years billions of copies have been printed—far more than of any other book. Equally remarkable is the fact that the Bible has been translated into 1,202 different languages, so that it is available to more than 90 percent of earth’s population in their own tongue. Is not such a large distribution and wide circulation what you would expect of the Book that is inspired by Almighty God?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">But what particularly stamps this Book as being of Divine authorship are its prophecies that have consistently proved reliable. Humans are not always able to accurately foretell the weather twenty-four hours in advance, yet the Holy Bible foretold ever so many events centuries and even millenniums before they actually occurred. No other book claiming to be of Divine authorship has been able to do this, which is evidence that the Bible is the book that God is using to communicate with men today.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Why, consider for a moment how the Holy Bible recorded in advance the rise and fall of World Powers that have dominated earth’s affairs. Under inspiration of God, the Hebrew prophet Isaiah foretold in the eighth century B.C.E. that Cyrus the Persian would serve as a liberator of the captive Israelites from Babylon. God even gave details of the conquest. Nearly two hundred years later Cyrus marched into Babylon, exactly as foretold. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 44:26-45:3</a>) The prophet Daniel, writing under inspiration of God, also recorded in advance the rise of the Medo-Persian World Power. More than that, in unmistakable terms, he told about the coming to prominence of the next World Power, Greece, its conquest of Medo-Persia, and, in time, its dissolution into four smaller empires with the death of its conquering king, Alexander the Great.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Dan. 8:1-8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 20-22</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Perhaps even more amazing are the fulfillments of scores of prophecies relating to the promised Messiah, the one appointed by God as deliverer to all mankind. He was to be born of the Israelite tribe of Judah in Bethlehem.

<strong>Light on Life’s Roadway from the Psalms</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">To begin with, the Psalms eloquently and repeatedly call attention to the fact that Jehovah God created all things: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man?” (8:3, 4) “Before the mountains themselves were born, or you proceeded to bring forth as with labor pains the earth and the productive land, even from time indefinite to time indefinite you are God.” (90:2) “Know that Jehovah is God. It is he that has made us, and not we ourselves.” (100:3) <span id="page550" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="550" data-before-text="550"></span>“I shall laud you because in a fear-inspiring way I am wonderfully made.”—139:14.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Among the earliest instances of God’s dealings with his creatures that the book of Psalms records is that of Jehovah concluding a covenant with Abraham and his making sworn statements to Isaac and Jacob. In fulfillment of these promises Jehovah God “brought out his people with exultation” to the land promised.—105:9, 10, 42-44.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Bringing his people Israel into their Promised Land involved many mighty acts, and these the book of Psalms also features. It tells that Jehovah sent ten plagues upon Egypt, that he split the Red Sea so that they could pass over and that he miraculously sustained them in the wilderness, providing bread, meat and water. Noted also are the striking victories God gained for his people in the days of Barak and Gideon.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalms 78,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 83,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 105,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 106,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/4" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> 135</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Then too, the Psalms record that it was necessary for Jehovah God repeatedly to chastise his people, even to the point of bringing them into Babylonian captivity: “By the rivers of Babylon—there we sat down. We also wept when we remembered Zion.” (137:1-9) And they record also Israel’s return from captivity: “When Jehovah gathered back the captive ones of Zion, we became like those who were dreaming. . . . At that time they proceeded to say among the nations: ‘Jehovah has done a great thing in what he has done with them.’” (126:1, 2) Yes, by recording how Jehovah God dealt with his people in times past and why, the book of Psalms throws much light on life’s roadway, for thereby it acquaints us with God’s attributes and principles.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>THE LIGHT OF PROPHECY</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The book of Psalms also serves as a light on life’s roadway by reason of the prophecies it contains, many of which have already been fulfilled, giving confidence that the rest will also have fulfillment. Among the many prophecies of the Psalms regarding Jesus Christ that the Christian Greek Scriptures show had fulfillment were that he would come in dedication to do God’s will (40:8; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 10:7-9</a>); that zeal for God’s house would eat him up, as it were (69:9; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 2:17</a>); that he would be betrayed by an intimate (41:9; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 13:18</a>); that lots would be cast for his garments (22:18; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 19:24</a>); that not a bone of him would be broken (34:20; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 19:36</a>) and that God would not leave his soul in Sheol or Hades.—16:10; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 2:29-31</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Further, the book of Psalms foretold Jesus’ exaltation to the right hand of his Father, there to await God’s due time for him to go into action against God’s enemies and for God to subject all things under Christ’s feet.—110:1, 2; 8:6; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Heb. 1:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 2:8</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The fulfillment of such prophecies instills faith that the prophecies in the Psalms regarding the blessings of the Messianic reign of the King’s Son, Jesus Christ, will also have fulfillment: “Let him judge the afflicted ones of the people, let him save the sons of the poor one, and let him crush the defrauder. He will descend like the rain upon the mown grass, like copious showers that wet the earth. In his days the righteous one will sprout, and the abundance of peace until the moon is no more. There will come to be plenty of grain on the earth; on the top of the mountains there will be an overflow.”—72:4, 6, 7, 16.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>BIBLE TEACHINGS</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The book of Psalms also throws light on life’s roadway by the various Bible teachings it touches on. Fittingly it stresses the role of Jehovah God as the Universal <span id="page551" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="551" data-before-text="551"></span>Sovereign. Though ‘the rulers of earth mass together as one against Jehovah and his anointed one, Jehovah himself will laugh at them in derision, speak to them in his anger and disturb them in hot displeasure.’ (2:1, 2, 4, 5) He will put them in their place, answering the psalmists’ prayers: “Do arise, O Jehovah! Let not mortal man prove superior in strength. Let the nations be judged before your face. Do put fear into them, O Jehovah, that the nations may know that they are but mortal men.” “Fill their faces with dishonor, that people may search for your name, O Jehovah. That people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.”—9:19, 20; 83:16, 18.</p>

<strong>The Bible—Authentic and Inspired</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Of the many evidences establishing the truth of the Bible, no greater proof could be desired than its inspired prophecy. Man cannot reliably foretell the future. True prophecy comes from the true God, Jehovah, who says: “The first things—here they have come, but new things I am telling <span id="page247" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="247" data-before-text="247"></span>out. Before they begin to spring up, I cause you people to hear them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962284/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isa. 42:9</a>) Examine the chart of prophecies accompanying this article. The events fulfilling prophecy are occurrences known to you through personal observation or history, Biblical and secular. The predictions were made many years or many centuries before the fulfillments. The fulfillment of these prophecies proves the divine inspiration of the Bible. Any one of Jehovah’s witnesses will be glad to give you further details at your request. Investigate and discover why prophecy has been called a continuing miracle.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">This chart by no means exhausts all the fulfilled Bible prophecies, nor have all the evidences of the Bible’s authenticity been explored here. But what we have learned from archaeology, history, prophecy and reason should be enough to convince any honest person that Paul’s statement at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962284/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16</a> is positively true: “All Scripture is inspired of God.”</p>

<strong>Why Bible Prophecies Are Valuable to You</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Furthermore, while hanging on the stake, Jesus could do nothing to determine what was being done with his garments. He could not maneuver the Roman soldiers into casting lots over them. But they did, exactly as Bible prophecy foretold that they would!

<strong>Jehovah—The One Who Is Vigorous in Power</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> If we ‘search for God’s works’ as David did, we will see evidence of his power everywhere​—in wind and waves, in thunder and lightning, in mighty rivers and majestic mountains. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000162/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 111:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000162/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Job 26:12-14</a>) Furthermore, as Jehovah reminded Job, animals testify to His strength. Among these is Behemoth, or the hippopotamus. Jehovah told Job: “Its power is in its hips . . . Its strong bones are like wrought-iron rods.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000162/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 40:15-18</a>) The fearsome power of the wild bull was also well-known in Bible times, and David prayed that he might be spared from “the mouth of the lion, and from the horns of wild bulls.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000162/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 22:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000162/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Job 39:9-11</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 6.

The others are love, wisdom, and justice. Since power is such an important facet of God’s personality, a clear understanding of his power and how he uses it will draw us closer to him and help us to imitate his example by using well any power at our disposal.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000162/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:1</a>.</p>

<strong>The Prevailing Will of God</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="si">“They are little inferior in size to elephants; they are bulls in their nature, color and figure. Great is their strength and great is their swiftness, neither do they spare man or beast, which they have caught sight of. . . . [They] can not be habituated to man and made tractable, not even when caught very young. The great spread of the horns <span id="page423" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="423" data-before-text="423"></span>as well as the shape and quality of them differ much from the horns of our oxen.”</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Little wonder the psalmist David linked the lion and the wild bull together: “Save me from the mouth of the lion, and from the horns of wild bulls you must answer and save me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 22:21</a>) What farmer would trust this wild bull?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>STORK AND OSTRICH CONTRASTED</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">God next asked Job if he could account for the difference between the stork and the ostrich, which are both birds and yet are so unlike in habits:</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">“Has the wing of the female ostrich flapped joyously, or has she the pinions of a stork and the plumage? For she leaves her eggs to the earth itself and in the dust she keeps them warm, and she forgets that some foot may crush them or even a wild beast of the field may tread on them. She does treat her sons roughly, as if not hers—in vain is her toil because she has no dread. For God has made her forget wisdom, and he has not given her a share in understanding. At the time she flaps her wings on high, she laughs at the horse and at its rider.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 39:13-18</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Has the wing of the ostrich flapped joyously, as that of the stork? No. The stork has powerful wings and flies very high in the air. The Bible speaks of “the stork in the heavens.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jer. 8:7</a>) But the ostrich, though it flaps its wings, cannot do the same. The stork’s pinions are of great breadth and power, the secondaries and tertiaries being as long as the primaries, giving an immense surface to the wing and enabling it to be a bird of lofty and long-continued flight. But can the ostrich flap its wings in such a joyous way?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">What a contrast, too, between the ostrich and the stork as to where they nest and lay their eggs. The female ostrich “leaves her eggs to the earth itself.” It is not said that the female ostrich in the wild necessarily forsakes her eggs. No, but she leaves her eggs to the earth itself rather than trust them to a nest built on a lofty tree, as does the stork. “As for the stork, the juniper trees are its house.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 104:17</a>) The stork’s large and well-compacted nest is usually built in the loftiest places. Not so the ostrich. The earth is her nest. In nontropical countries the female birds incubate by day, the males taking their turn by night, carefully guarding the eggs. In tropical countries the parent birds incubate by turn during the night but leave them by day to the sun’s heat, the eggs being partly or wholly covered with sand or dust. “Actual incubation of the eggs is performed by the heat of the sun.” (<em>The New Funk &amp; Wagnalls Encyclopedia</em>) By leaving her eggs to the earth and by keeping them warm in the dust, she appears to be doing a stupid thing: “She forgets that some foot may crush them or even a wild beast of the field may tread on them.” She may need to leave the eggs uncared-for at the approach of enemies.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Not only is there a difference in the nest location of the ostrich and the stork but also in the way they treat their young. Says John Kitto, in <em>The Pictorial Bible,</em> about storks: “No bird is more famous for its attachment to its young; and, which is more rare among birds, for the kindness to the old and feeble of its own race.” But the ostrich? “She does treat her sons roughly, as if not hers.” Wrote God’s prophet Jeremiah: “The daughter of my people becomes cruel, like ostriches in the wilderness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Lam. 4:3</a>) Commenting on this rough treatment, English traveler Thomas Shaw wrote in <em>Travels in Barbary:</em></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="si">“A very little share of that natural affection, which so strongly exerts itself in most other creatures, is observable in the ostrich. For, upon the least distant noise, or trivial occasion, she forsakes her eggs or her young ones, to which perhaps she never returns; or, if she does, it may be too late. . . . The Arabs meet sometimes with whole nests of <span id="page424" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="424" data-before-text="424"></span>these eggs undisturbed, some of which are sweet and good, others addled and corrupted. . . . They oftener meet a few of the little ones, no bigger than well-grown pullets, half-starved, straggling and moaning about, like so many distressed orphans, for their mothers.”</p>

It shows that in an inclusive sense, Christ was a member of a congregation where he declared God’s name to his brothers. Who were those brothers? Those forming part of “Abraham’s seed,” the spirit-anointed brothers of Christ, “partakers of the heavenly calling.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007285/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Hebrews 2:16–3:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007285/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Matthew 25:40</a>) Yes, the primary sense of “congregation” in the Christian Greek Scriptures is <em>the composite group of spirit-anointed followers of Christ.</em> These 144,000 anointed ones constitute “the congregation of the firstborn who have been enrolled in the heavens.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007285/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:23</a>.</p>

<strong>Act Promptly Upon the “Sign”!</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Jesus drew a distinction between his spiritual “brothers” and those proving to be like sheep or goats. At the time of this parable’s fulfillment, his “brothers” are those who have imitated him by unreservedly giving themselves to God. Like Jesus, they have offered public evidence of this by getting baptized in water. Moreover, Jehovah, the Father of the King Jesus Christ, has become their heavenly Father by begetting them with His holy spirit and thus making them spiritual “brothers” of his Son. This puts them in line for a place in the heavenly Kingdom with their Elder Brother, Jesus Christ, the “King of kings and Lord of lords.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985084/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Revelation 19:16</a>) In this connection it was written concerning him: “For both he who is sanctifying and those who are being sanctified all stem from one, and for this cause he is not ashamed to call them ‘brothers,’ as he says: ‘I will declare your name to my brothers; in the middle of the congregation I will praise you with song.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985084/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Hebrews 2:11, 12</a>) Here <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985084/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 22:22</a> is applied to the glorified Son of God, Jesus Christ.</p>

But he did have in mind the setting up of a Messianic congregation after the foretold “new covenant” was put in force by the presentation of his sacrificial merit to Jehovah God in heaven. That was why Jesus, less than a year before his sacrificial death and resurrection, said in response to the apostle Peter’s confession, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God,” these words: “You are Peter, and on this rock-mass I will build my congregation, and the gates of Hádes will not overpower it.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971921/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matt. 16:16-18</a>.</p>

From the standpoint of Christ Jesus being included as the head or chief one, we could properly use the term “congregation” in this most inclusive sense, and this is in harmony with the application of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963647/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 22:22</a> to Jesus. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963647/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Heb. 2:12</a>) David, the writer of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963647/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 22</a>, was a member of the congregation in the midst of which he declared Jehovah’s name; so the one to whom this text is applied, Jesus Christ, could also be said to be one of the congregation, and in harmony with that, the others in the congregation are called his “brothers.” In David’s case, the congregation was that of Jehovah God, and for thirty-three and a half years Jesus Christ was a member of it and preached amidst it while on earth. A remnant of these became part of <em>his</em> congregation or spiritual body. However, generally when the Christian Greek Scriptures speak of the “congregation” in the broad sense, they are referring to the 144,000 as a body subject to the head Christ Jesus. Thus Paul, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963647/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ephesians 1:22, 23</a>, speaks of “the congregation, which is his body,” and later writes: “I am speaking with respect to Christ <em>and</em> the congregation.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963647/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Eph. 5:32</a></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">In addition to the uses mentioned above, the word “congregation” (Greek: <em>ekklesía</em>) is also applied in other ways. One of these is illustrated at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963647/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:32</a>, where we read: “Keep from becoming causes for stumbling to Jews as well as Greeks and to the congregation of God.” Here the writer obviously does not have in mind the “congregation” in the broad sense of the entire 144,000. Rather, he uses the term as applying to the Christians living at that particular time.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">But by far the most common use of the word “congregation” in the Christian Greek Scriptures is in referring to a local assembly of Christians. This may include all the Christians in one particular city, or may refer to an even smaller group meeting in a private home. So we find it recorded that “great persecution arose against the congregation that was in Jerusalem.” Also: “Greet the congregation that is in their house.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963647/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Acts 8:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963647/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Rom. 16:5</a>) Accordingly it would be proper to speak of “congregations” in the plural, and this is often done in the Scriptures. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963647/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963647/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Acts 15:41;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963647/19/2" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 2 Thess. 1:4</a>) Today, when applying to a local assembly, the term “congregation” would include all the dedicated Christians associated with it, regardless of what may be their hope or destiny.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Most of the Scriptural terms that apply to the 144,000 members of Christ’s body apart from their Head do so quite obviously. Among such are “Christ’s body,” “the body of the Christ,” “the bride, the Lamb’s <span id="page539" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="539" data-before-text="539"></span>wife.” And since the “Lamb’s wife” is also termed “the holy city, New Jerusalem,” it follows that this name also applies only to the 144,000 body members. This is borne out by the description of it in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963647/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Revelation chapter 21</a>.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963647/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Cor. 12:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963647/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Eph. 4:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963647/21/2" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> Rev. 21:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963647/21/3" data-bid="22-4" class="b"> 9, 10</a>.</p>

<strong>International Praise to the One God</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[79]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> But a dead Jesus would not serve to vindicate himself as a Son of God faithful to the death nor to vindicate Jehovah God as universal Sovereign Lord with all power and dominion. Having this in mind, Jehovah in the Psalms foretold Jesus’ resurrection from the dead. The dead Jesus was buried in a nearby tomb in a rock and thus his soul, which he had poured out in death, went to Sheol or mankind’s common grave. But Jesus died with full hope of a resurrection, his hope being voiced in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 16:8-11</a>: “I have placed Jehovah in front of me constantly. Because [he] is at my right hand I shall not be made to totter. Therefore my heart does rejoice and my glory is inclined to be joyful. Also, <span id="page631" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="631" data-before-text="631"></span>my own flesh will reside in security. For you will not leave my soul in Sheol. You will not allow your man of loving-kindness to see the pit. You will cause me to know the path of life. Rejoicing to the full is with your face; there is pleasantness at your right hand forever.” That this and other prophecies of the Psalms might be carried out, Jehovah God brushed aside the Devil’s preventive efforts and raised Jesus from the dead, delivering him from Sheol on the third day. God rewarded him with a spirit body in place of the sacrificed human body, that he might know again the path of life and know pleasantness at God’s right hand forever.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Acts 2:22-31</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>THE CONGREGATION AND THE KINGDOM COVENANT</strong></p><p id="p80" data-pid="80" class="qu">20.

His work was to make known the name and the sovereignty of the one true God; it was to be the foremost witness of Jehovah, it was to gather about him a congregation of disciples, spiritual brothers, who should carry forward and finish on earth the work of Kingdom witnessing that he had begun. That was part of Jehovah’s will for Jesus, as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Psalm 40:8-10</a> foretold: “To do your will, O my God, I have delighted, and your law is within my inward parts.

Your righteousness I have not covered over within my heart. Your faithfulness and your salvation I have declared. I have not hidden your loving-kindness and your trueness in the big congregation.” True to this prophecy that was written about him in the roll of God’s Bible Jesus proceeded to gather twelve apostles and other disciples round about him. To this “little flock” he was Jehovah’s Right Shepherd. But he himself was the “Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world,” and so, like the psalmist David, he could say to God his Father: “Jehovah is my Shepherd. I shall lack nothing. In grassy pastures he makes me lie down; by well-watered resting places he conducts me.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ps. 23:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p81" data-pid="81" class="qu">21.

You will not mind so much, remembering it is really a privilege to suffer as a Christian and that Jesus warned that all his followers were sure to be persecuted, as he was.

He does not instruct us separately, as individual pupils, but he has his school of music, which is his organization, Zion. This is under the headship of his beloved Son, who takes the lead in singing his heavenly Father’s praises, fulfilling, as Paul shows, the prophetic word at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953207/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Psalm 22:22</a>: “I will declare your name to my brothers; in the midst of a congregation I will praise you with song.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953207/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Heb. 2:12</a>, <em>NW</em>) The equipment provided for all in Zion in this day of Jehovah is nicely summed up for us at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953207/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Isaiah 59:21</a> (<em>AS</em>): “My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, . . . for ever.”</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">18.

Two of the disciples were walking to Emmaus, despondent and perplexed, when Jesus, unrecognized, joined them. After leading the conversation up to the right point, what does the record say? “And commencing at Moses and all the Prophets he interpreted to them things pertaining to himself in all the Scriptures.” And with what effect? As they said to each other afterward, “Were not our hearts burning . . . as he was fully opening up the Scriptures to us?” That same night the lesson was repeated to the eleven and others, when, as it says, “He opened up their minds fully to grasp the meaning of the Scriptures.” Then he finally said they would be sent out as witnesses of these things that they had seen and heard, but only after they were “clothed with power from on high”. So, in a miniature fulfillment, God put his words in the mouths of his witnesses, and endowed them with the energizing, enlightening power of his spirit. Today, in the major fulfillment, the same thing is taking place on a worldwide scale, the major chord of our song being “this good news of the kingdom”.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953207/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Luke 24:27,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953207/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 32,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953207/23/2" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> 45,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953207/23/3" data-bid="24-4" class="b"> 49;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953207/23/4" data-bid="24-5" class="b"> Matt. 24:14</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">19.

After all, the Word is our Songbook, and if this work is done aright it will cause their hearts to <em>burn</em> within them. If, for example, you are privileged to give a public talk, do not spend overlong quoting and commenting on what world leaders have said. Rather, quickly get down to your <span id="page189" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="189" data-before-text="189"></span>Scriptural argument, clearly explaining the meaning of the Scriptures and their fulfillment. This was Paul’s method. “He reasoned with them from the Scriptures, explaining and proving by references.” Notice, too, how Apollos profited by the right training and equipment. “For with intensity [‘aglow with the spirit’] . . . he demonstrated publicly by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953207/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Acts 17:2, 3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953207/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 18:25,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953207/24/2" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> 28</a>, <em>NW</em>) Do not fail to profit, too, by the modern-day training and equipment provided by the regular study of <em>The Watchtower</em> and other publications of the Society, also the theocratic ministry school course, with its practical help.</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971921/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ps. 22:22, 23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971921/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> Heb. 2:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971921/28/2" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> Matt. 18:17</a>) Therefore, while Jesus was on earth and under the Theocratic Law covenant, he did not establish any rival congregation, church or ecclesia. But he did have in mind the setting up of a Messianic congregation after the foretold “new covenant” was put in force by the presentation of his sacrificial merit to Jehovah God in heaven. That was why Jesus, less than a year before his sacrificial death and resurrection, said in response to the apostle Peter’s confession, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God,” these words: “You are Peter, and on this rock-mass I will build my congregation, and the gates of Hádes will not overpower it.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971921/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matt. 16:16-18</a>.</p>

<strong>Increase Your Praise of Jehovah!</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> To whom, then, do the above Bible prophecies have reference? Not to heathendom whose people worship millions of gods of their own making, and who, for the most part, never even heard of the great name of the true God Jehovah. The “godless” Communists who dominate a great portion of the earth’s surface bitterly hate and fight against the name of Jehovah and are against his Word of truth, the Holy Bible. The same is true of millions of Moslems throughout the earth. Well, what about Christendom with her nearly 920,000,000 members? Alas! Christendom is a dominant part of the United Nations and as such is very much a part of “the present wicked system of things” of which Satan the Devil is god. She therefore constitutes herself “an enemy of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gal. 1:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 4:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Jas. 4:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> Eph. 2:2</a>) Furthermore, like Judaism, Christendom deliberately tries to hide Jehovah’s holy name from the people by never mentioning it in her pulpits and by removing it from her popular translations of the Bible. As a result there are millions of people in <span id="page336" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="336" data-before-text="336"></span>Christendom who have never heard of the holy name <em>Jehovah.</em></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 5.

Simon Peter related how God “for the first time turned his attention to the [non-Jewish] nations to take out of them <em>a people for his name.</em> And with this the words of the Prophets agree, just as it is written, ‘After these things I shall return and rebuild the booth of David that is fallen down . . . in order that those who remain of the men may earnestly seek Jehovah, together with people of all the nations, <em>people who are called by my name,</em> says Jehovah.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 15:14-17</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>THE PRIVILEGES OF THE PRAISERS</strong></p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 9.

<strong>Increase Your Praise of Jehovah!</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> To whom, then, do the above Bible prophecies have reference? Not to heathendom whose people worship millions of gods of their own making, and who, for the most part, never even heard of the great name of the true God Jehovah. The “godless” Communists who dominate a great portion of the earth’s surface bitterly hate and fight against the name of Jehovah and are against his Word of truth, the Holy Bible. The same is true of millions of Moslems throughout the earth. Well, what about Christendom with her nearly 920,000,000 members? Alas! Christendom is a dominant part of the United Nations and as such is very much a part of “the present wicked system of things” of which Satan the Devil is god. She therefore constitutes herself “an enemy of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gal. 1:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 4:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Jas. 4:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> Eph. 2:2</a>) Furthermore, like Judaism, Christendom deliberately tries to hide Jehovah’s holy name from the people by never mentioning it in her pulpits and by removing it from her popular translations of the Bible. As a result there are millions of people in <span id="page336" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="336" data-before-text="336"></span>Christendom who have never heard of the holy name <em>Jehovah.</em></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 5.

More than thirty years ago they were given a name that was based on Jehovah’s Word, namely, <em>Jehovah’s witnesses.</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isa. 43:10</a>) These are, not Jews according to the flesh, but, rather, spiritual Judeans (meaning, ‘praisers of Jehovah’), spiritual Israelites composed of many nationalities who have been brought out of captivity to Babylon the Great.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rom. 2:28, 29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 9:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Eph. 2:11-18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/6/3" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> Heb. 8:7-13</a>.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 7.

Simon Peter related how God “for the first time turned his attention to the [non-Jewish] nations to take out of them <em>a people for his name.</em> And with this the words of the Prophets agree, just as it is written, ‘After these things I shall return and rebuild the booth of David that is fallen down . . . in order that those who remain of the men may earnestly seek Jehovah, together with people of all the nations, <em>people who are called by my name,</em> says Jehovah.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 15:14-17</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>THE PRIVILEGES OF THE PRAISERS</strong></p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 9.

<strong>Earth</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Bible writers often speak from the standpoint of the observer on the earth, or from his particular position geographically, as we often naturally do today. For example, the Bible mentions “the sunrising.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001239/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Nu 2:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001239/44/1" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> 34:15</a>) Some have seized upon this as an opportunity to discredit the Bible as scientifically inaccurate, claiming that the Hebrews viewed earth as the center of things, with the sun revolving around it. But the Bible writers nowhere expressed such a belief. These same critics overlook the fact that they themselves use the identical expression and that it is in all of their almanacs. It is common to hear someone say, ‘it is sunrise,’ or ‘the sun has set,’ or ‘the sun traveled across the sky.’ The Bible also speaks of “the extremity of the earth” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001239/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Ps 46:9</a>), “the ends of the earth” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001239/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Ps 22:27</a>), “the four extremities of the earth” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001239/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Isa 11:12</a>), “the four corners of the earth,” and “the four winds of the earth” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001239/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Re 7:1</a>). These expressions cannot be taken to prove that the Hebrews understood the earth to be square. The number four is often used to denote that which is fully rounded out, as it were, just as we have four directions and sometimes employ the expressions “to the ends of the earth,” “to the four corners of the earth,” in the sense of embracing all the earth.​—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001239/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Eze 1:15-17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001239/49/1" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> Lu 13:29</a>.</p>

<strong>International Praise to the One God</strong><br/><p id="p39" data-pid="39" data-rel-pid="[93]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="33"><sup>33</sup></span> What do those who rejoice do? Outstandingly since the close of World War I in 1918 they fulfill <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Psalm 145:10-13</a>: “All your works will laud you, O Jehovah, and your men of loving-kindness [the congregation of those in the kingdom covenant] will bless you. About the glory of your kingship they will talk, and about your mightiness they will speak, to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts and the glory of the splendor of his kingship. Your kingship is a kingship of all times indefinite, <span id="page635" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="635" data-before-text="635"></span>and your dominion is throughout all successive generations.” This talking about the glory of Jehovah’s kingship by all the many means of preaching has not been in vain. Already hundreds of thousands of the sons of men to whom the glory of the splendor of Jehovah’s kingship has been made known in more than a hundred languages have believed and accepted the Kingdom message and are rejoicing in it. More than that, they are acting upon it in fulfillment of the psalmist’s prayer: “The praise of Jehovah my mouth will speak, and let all flesh bless his holy name to time indefinite, even forever.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Ps. 145:21</a>) They too have become Kingdom witnesses of Jehovah.</p><p id="p94" data-pid="94" class="qu">34.

The remnant are the last remaining ones on earth of the class pictured as the bride of Christ. They have been begotten or engendered by Jehovah God by means of his life-giving spirit and so they have become as a daughter to the great King of eternity, Jehovah, the universal Sovereign. Now that the kingdom of God’s dear Son, their Bridegroom, has been established, the time draws near for their marriage to him in the “first resurrection.” Now as the remnant of the bride class approach the wedding day they are telling all lovers of divine government about their Bridegroom, who has been made King at Jehovah’s right hand in heaven. As they move on through this world to their final union with the Bridegroom they are joined by well-wishing companions who want to become subjects of their Bridegroom King. These become as bridesmaids to the remnant.</p><p id="p95" data-pid="95" class="qu">35. How does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/91/0" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Psalm 45</a> describe these bridal companions, and how are they now in the king’s palace?</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" data-rel-pid="[95]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="35"><sup>35</sup></span> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Psalm 45:13-15</a> describes both the bride class and the bridesmaids in these beautiful words: “The king’s daughter is all glorious within [the house]; her clothing is out of settings of gold. In woven apparel she will be brought to the king. The virgins in her train as her companions are being brought . . . with rejoicing and joyfulness; they will enter into the palace of the king.” These as-it-were bridesmaids out of all the nations were thus foretold as a happy multitude of persons, and today they are unspeakably happy. They are happy because they are privileged to give out to others the Kingdom good news in close companionship with the remnant of the bride class. They are in the palace of the universal King, Jehovah, because they are now at his spiritual temple, there rendering him sacred service continually.</p><p id="p96" data-pid="96" class="qu">36.

They have learned about the name of Jehovah and they have turned away from false gods with other names in order to worship Jehovah as God and to serve him as rightful King. In them is being fulfilled <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Psalm 22:27, 28</a>: “All the ends of the earth will remember and turn back to Jehovah.

Do we want to be happy? We can be. How? There are twenty-four happinesses or beatitudes in the Psalms that tell us the secret of how to be happy with the happiness that will never end. It is instructive for us to hear some of these beatitudes! The very book of Psalms opens with a beatitude, “Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked ones, and in the way of sinners has not stood and in the seat of ridiculers has not sat. But his delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1, 2</a>) The beatitude in the Second Psalm is one that not only world rulers but all of us under the shadow of Armageddon ought to heed: “Serve Jehovah with fear and be joyful with trembling. Kiss the son, that He may not become incensed and you may not perish [from] the way, for his anger flares up easily. Happy are all those taking refuge in him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Ps. 2:11, 12</a>.</p>

<strong>Earth</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The Bible, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Job 26:7</a>, speaks of God as “hanging the earth upon nothing.” Science says that the earth remains in its orbit in space primarily due to the interaction of gravity and centrifugal force. These forces, of course, are invisible. Therefore the earth, as other heavenly bodies, is suspended in space as if hanging on nothing. Speaking from Jehovah’s viewpoint, the prophet Isaiah says: “There is One who is dwelling above the circle of the earth, the dwellers in which are as grasshoppers.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Isa. 40:22</a>) The Bible says: “He [God] has described a circle upon the face of the waters.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Job 26:10</a>) The waters are limited by his decree to their proper place. They do not come up and inundate the land; neither do they fly off into space. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Job 38:8-11</a>) From the viewpoint of Jehovah, the earth’s face, or the surface of the waters, would, of course, have a circular form, <span id="page477" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="477" data-before-text="477"></span>just as the edge of the moon presents a circular appearance to us. Before land surfaces appeared, the surface of the entire globe was one circular (spherical) mass of surging waters.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Gen. 1:2</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Bible writers often speak from the standpoint of the observer on the earth, or from his particular position geographically, as we often naturally do today. For example, the Bible mentions the “sunrising.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Num. 2:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/44/1" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> 34:15</a>) Some have seized upon this as an opportunity to discredit the Bible as scientifically inaccurate, claiming that the Hebrews viewed earth as the center of things, with the sun revolving around it. But the Bible writers nowhere expressed such a belief. These same critics overlook the fact that they themselves use the identical expression and that it is in all their almanacs. It is common to hear someone say, “it is sunrise,” or “the sun has set,” or “the sun traveled across the sky.” The Bible also speaks of “the extremity of the earth” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Ps. 46:9</a>), “the ends of the earth” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Ps. 22:27</a>), “the four extremities of the earth” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Isa. 11:12</a>), “the four corners of the earth” and “the four winds of the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Rev. 7:1</a>) These expressions cannot be taken to prove that the Hebrews understood the earth to be square. The number four is often used to denote that which is fully rounded out, as it were, just as we have four directions an] sometimes employ the expressions “to the ends of the earth,” “to the four quarters of the earth” in the sense of embracing all the earth.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Ezekiel 1:15-17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/49/1" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> Luke 13:29</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">The Bible describes the earth as having an expanse or firmament, an atmosphere, and indicates that prior to the Flood there was a heavy canopy of water vapor above the expanse. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Gen. 1:6-8</a>) The expanse was an air-filled space between the earth and these waters above. The apostle Peter therefore describes the situation as “an earth standing compactly out of water and in the midst of water.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:5</a>) It seems that, because of such an arrangement, the ground was watered by a mist rather than a direct rain. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Gen. 2:5, 6</a>) Peter says that it was by “those means” (the arrangement of the waters above described) that the world of that time, the people, suffered destruction when the earth was deluged with water.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:6</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Geologists have uncovered evidence that the now-frozen wastes of the Arctic and even of ice-covered Antarctica enjoyed a temperate climate in the past. Even frozen mammals of tropical habitat have been found in far-northern areas. McReady Price states the following in his book <em>The New Geology:</em> “There is but one climate known to the ancient fossil world, as revealed by the plants and animals entombed in the rocks; and that climate was a mantle of springlike loveliness which seems to have prevailed continuously over the whole globe. Just how the world could have been thus warmed all over may be a matter of conjecture; that it was so warmed effectively and continuously is a matter of fact.” And George Gamow, in his book <em>Biography of the Earth,</em> 1948, writes: “While the areas now covered by temperate vegetation were occupied by tropical jungles, such ordinary trees as oak, chestnut, and maple were growing in Alaska, Greenland, Spitsbergen, and Northern Asia. Finally, the typical boreal plants, such as dwarf birch and dwarf willow, were very common in regions which are so far north that no vegetation at all can grow there today. Data concerning the Southern Hemisphere are again rather meagre, but the finding of coal deposits in several places along the shore of Antarctica indisputably proves that there were times when this continent, at present almost completely glaciated, was covered by rich vegetation.” These facts would support the above-mentioned vapor-canopy arrangement, which could bring about the conditions Biblically described and scientifically discovered.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>FIGURATIVE AND SYMBOLIC EXPRESSIONS</strong></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The earth is spoken of figuratively in several instances. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Job 38:4-6</a> it is likened to a building, when Jehovah asks Job questions that he obviously cannot answer, concerning earth’s creation and Jehovah’s management of it. Jehovah also uses a figurative expression describing the result of earth’s rotation. He says: “[The earth] transforms itself like clay under a seal.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Job 38:13, 14</a>) In Bible times some seals for “signing” documents were in the form of a roller engraved with the writer’s emblem. It was rolled over the soft clay document or clay envelope, leaving behind it an impression in the clay. In similar manner at the arrival of dawn, the portion of the earth coming from the blackness of night begins to show itself to have form and color as the sunlight moves progressively across its face. The heavens, the location of Jehovah’s throne, being higher than the earth, the earth is, figuratively, his footstool (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Ps. 103:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/56/1" data-bid="57-2" class="b"> Isa. 55:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/56/2" data-bid="57-3" class="b"> 66:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/56/3" data-bid="57-4" class="b"> Matt. 5:35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/56/4" data-bid="57-5" class="b"> Acts 7:49</a>) Those who are in Sheol or Hades, the common grave of mankind, are considered as being under the earth.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Rev. 5:3</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">The apostle Peter compares the literal heavens and earth (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/58/0" data-bid="59-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:5</a>) with the symbolic heavens and earth (vs. 7). The “heavens” of verse seven do not mean Jehovah’s own dwelling place, the place of his throne in the heavens. Jehovah’s heavens cannot be shaken. Neither is the “earth” in the same verse the literal planet earth, for Jehovah says that he has established the earth firmly. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Ps. 78:69;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/59/1" data-bid="60-2" class="b"> 119:90</a>) Yet God says that he will shake both the heavens and the earth (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/60/0" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Hag. 2:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/60/1" data-bid="61-2" class="b"> Heb. 12:26</a>), that the heavens and earth will flee away before him and that new heavens and a new earth will be established.

<strong>International Praise to the One God</strong><br/><p id="p39" data-pid="39" data-rel-pid="[93]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="33"><sup>33</sup></span> What do those who rejoice do? Outstandingly since the close of World War I in 1918 they fulfill <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Psalm 145:10-13</a>: “All your works will laud you, O Jehovah, and your men of loving-kindness [the congregation of those in the kingdom covenant] will bless you. About the glory of your kingship they will talk, and about your mightiness they will speak, to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts and the glory of the splendor of his kingship. Your kingship is a kingship of all times indefinite, <span id="page635" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="635" data-before-text="635"></span>and your dominion is throughout all successive generations.” This talking about the glory of Jehovah’s kingship by all the many means of preaching has not been in vain. Already hundreds of thousands of the sons of men to whom the glory of the splendor of Jehovah’s kingship has been made known in more than a hundred languages have believed and accepted the Kingdom message and are rejoicing in it. More than that, they are acting upon it in fulfillment of the psalmist’s prayer: “The praise of Jehovah my mouth will speak, and let all flesh bless his holy name to time indefinite, even forever.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Ps. 145:21</a>) They too have become Kingdom witnesses of Jehovah.</p><p id="p94" data-pid="94" class="qu">34. How is the bride class of Christ a King’s daughter, and by whom has she now been joined as she nears her marriage day?</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" data-rel-pid="[94]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="34"><sup>34</sup></span> In delightsome language the book of Psalms tells of these joyful companions of the preaching remnant of the Kingdom heirs. The remnant are the last remaining ones on earth of the class pictured as the bride of Christ. They have been begotten or engendered by Jehovah God by means of his life-giving spirit and so they have become as a daughter to the great King of eternity, Jehovah, the universal Sovereign. Now that the kingdom of God’s dear Son, their Bridegroom, has been established, the time draws near for their marriage to him in the “first resurrection.” Now as the remnant of the bride class approach the wedding day they are telling all lovers of divine government about their Bridegroom, who has been made King at Jehovah’s right hand in heaven. As they move on through this world to their final union with the Bridegroom they are joined by well-wishing companions who want to become subjects of their Bridegroom King. These become as bridesmaids to the remnant.</p><p id="p95" data-pid="95" class="qu">35. How does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/91/0" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Psalm 45</a> describe these bridal companions, and how are they now in the king’s palace?</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" data-rel-pid="[95]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="35"><sup>35</sup></span> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Psalm 45:13-15</a> describes both the bride class and the bridesmaids in these beautiful words: “The king’s daughter is all glorious within [the house]; her clothing is out of settings of gold. In woven apparel she will be brought to the king. The virgins in her train as her companions are being brought . . . with rejoicing and joyfulness; they will enter into the palace of the king.” These as-it-were bridesmaids out of all the nations were thus foretold as a happy multitude of persons, and today they are unspeakably happy. They are happy because they are privileged to give out to others the Kingdom good news in close companionship with the remnant of the bride class. They are in the palace of the universal King, Jehovah, because they are now at his spiritual temple, there rendering him sacred service continually.</p><p id="p96" data-pid="96" class="qu">36. How has <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/92/0" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Psalm 22:27, 28</a> been fulfilled in them?</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" data-rel-pid="[96]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="36"><sup>36</sup></span> This great crowd of bridesmaids comes from the very ends of the earth to which the Kingdom message has been preached, and they are members of all the families of the nations, God being impartial toward all. They have learned about the name of Jehovah and they have turned away from false gods with other names in order to worship Jehovah as God and to serve him as rightful King. In them is being fulfilled <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Psalm 22:27, 28</a>: “All the ends of the earth will remember and turn back to Jehovah. And all the families of the nations will bow down before you. For the kingship belongs to Jehovah and he is dominating the nations.”</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="ss"><strong>HAPPINESSES (BEATITUDES)</strong></p><p id="p97" data-pid="97" class="qu">37. For our guide to happiness what does the book of Psalms furnish us, as shown in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/93/0" data-bid="94-1" class="b">Psalms 1 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/93/1" data-bid="94-2" class="b"> 2</a>?</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" data-rel-pid="[97]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="37"><sup>37</sup></span> As the worldly nations worry along in their distress and uncertainty, and as they march on to their destruction in the universal <span id="page636" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="636" data-before-text="636"></span>war of Armageddon, we can be happy. Do we want to be happy? We can be. How? There are twenty-four happinesses or beatitudes in the Psalms that tell us the secret of how to be happy with the happiness that will never end. It is instructive for us to hear some of these beatitudes! The very book of Psalms opens with a beatitude, “Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked ones, and in the way of sinners has not stood and in the seat of ridiculers has not sat. But his delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1, 2</a>) The beatitude in the Second Psalm is one that not only world rulers but all of us under the shadow of Armageddon ought to heed: “Serve Jehovah with fear and be joyful with trembling. Kiss the son, that He may not become incensed and you may not perish [from] the way, for his anger flares up easily. Happy are all those taking refuge in him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Ps. 2:11, 12</a>.</p>
