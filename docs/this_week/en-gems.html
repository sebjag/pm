<strong>Fault, Faultfinding</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>Jehovah’s Dealings With Faulty Mankind.</strong> That which Jehovah God makes is perfect, faultless (Heb., <em>ta·mimʹ,</em> referring to something sound, perfect, faultless), as are all his words and acts. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001499/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">De 32:4</a>, ftn) For this reason and because of his almightiness, he can say, as in correcting Job: “Should there be any contending of a faultfinder [literally, one who chastises, corrects, disciplines] with the Almighty?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001499/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 40:1, 2</a>) The apostle Paul points out that God has the right to deal with his creatures as He pleases, just as a potter makes the kinds of vessels he desires to produce. God tolerates “vessels of wrath” for a purpose, just as he did Pharaoh, while he has mercy on “vessels of mercy,” and we cannot rightly question God’s action in this.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001499/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ro 9:14-24</a>.</p>

<strong>Should There Be Faultfinding with God?</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Then there is the security of the eagle’s nest, because “it builds its nest high up,” even “on a crag it resides . . . upon the <span id="page487" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="487" data-before-text="487"></span>tooth of a crag.” Other birds are content with lower elevations, but the eagle builds on inaccessible heights, and thus sets her young out of reach of danger. Is it at man’s order that this bird makes her nest her castle, building it upon the “tooth of a crag”?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Third is the eagle’s farsightedness. God says: “Far into the distance its eyes keep looking.” No man gave the eagle its penetrating vision, enabling it to scan the wide expanse of the country and pierce into the deep ravines. Eagles have the peculiar ability to change the focus of their eyes rapidly, a great help in catching their prey. Commenting on their vision, Rutherford Platt writes in <em>The River of Life:</em></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">“We find the championship eyes of the whole animal kingdom high in the daylight sky—they are the eyes of the eagle, the vulture, and the hawk. So keen are they that they can look down from a thousand feet in the air and spot a rabbit or a grouse half hidden in the grass.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">“Sharp eyesight of the hunter eye is caused by the reflection of the object falling on a dense clump of pointed, cone-shaped cells. This tiny spot in the back of the eyeball absorbs light rays from the object through thousands of points, in a special manner which summons up a clear image in the mind. For almost all hunters, such as the skunk, the cougar, and ourselves, the single spot of cones is enough; we look straight ahead and approach directly the object of our gaze. But not so the eagle or the hawk, which, having fixed the rabbit in the grass with its sharp focusing cones, may then approach by a long, slanting dive. This causes the image of the target to move across the back of the eyeball on a curved path. Such a path is precisely plotted for the eagle eye so that instead of a clump of cones the diving bird has a curved path of cones. As the eagle zooms down, the rabbit in the grass is thus held in constant focus. It may seem to be a very small point that the curving path of the focusing cells in the eyeball corresponds exactly to the curving path of the dive, but it is of great importance to the individuals involved, and I wonder who thought of it.”</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">The Creator did! He, not man, has conferred on the eagle this marvelous eyesight.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Fourth is the remarkable way the eagle has of maintaining herself and her young. Some species of eagles do not disdain the carcasses of animals that have recently died, and thus their food supply comes from two sources: What is already dead and what they catch. Eagles prey upon small animals, which they seize and carry to their young ones. Baby eagles, still too feeble to devour flesh, sip up the blood of the prey. So the eagle maintains herself and her family by swiftness of wings and keenness of sight and the ability to capture prey and also by finding and searching out the bodies of the slain. “Where the slain are, there it is.”</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="ss"><strong>GETTING THE PROPER VIEWPOINT</strong></p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Following those words about his creation, animate and inanimate, Jehovah asks out of the windstorm: “Should there be any contending of a faultfinder with the Almighty? Let the reprover of God himself answer it.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 40:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Jehovah has spoken. Those words about God’s wonders in nature brought Job into the proper state of mind, to see that the creature is nothing in comparison with the Creator, that in the face of God’s grandeur, Job’s “declaring his own soul righteous rather than God” was not the thing to do. Since Jehovah has evinced so much power and wisdom in his visible creation and since there is also so much that surpasses man’s comprehension, God is entitled to implicit trust. Whatever God does, whether immediately understood by man or not, the only proper feeling for man is that God does what is right. It would be the height of presumption to question any part of God’s doings at the bar of human judgment. Who, then, will do any contending of a faultfinder with the Almighty? <span id="page488" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="488" data-before-text="488"></span>Certainly not Job. “Job went on to answer Jehovah and say: ‘Look! I have become of little account. What shall I reply to you? My hand I have put over my mouth. Once have I spoken, and I will not answer; and twice, and I will add nothing.’” Job’s remorse was not wordy; nothing to smack of self-righteousness. It was simply: “I have become of little account.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 40:3-5</a>.</p>

Really, will you invalidate my justice? Will you pronounce me wicked in order that you may be in the right? Or do you have an arm like that of the true God, and with a voice like his can you make it thunder? Deck yourself, please, with superiority and highness; and with dignity and splendor may you clothe yourself. Let flow the furious outbursts of your anger, and see every one haughty and bring him low. See every one haughty, humble him, and tread down the wicked right where they are. Hide them together in the dust, bind their very faces in the hidden place, and I, even I, shall commend you, because your right hand can save you.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 40:6-14</a>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Will any man question God’s right to be Universal Sovereign? Has any man an “arm like God” to abase the proud and wicked and hide them in the dust of the earth, as God will do at the war of Armageddon? If so, then says Jehovah, “I, even I, shall commend you, because your right hand can save you.” It is not man but Jehovah’s arm and right hand that will deliver righteous men from the wicked. Armageddon is God’s battle for the vindication of his sovereignty. No creatures on earth will need to fight in that war for God. So if man cannot do God’s work, what right has any man to say God does not do it well? He can never have the right to impugn God’s actions.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">We must be careful not to charge God with injustice or to be found faultfinding with the divine way. “We are not stronger than he is, are we?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:22</a>) Let us remember the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isaiah 45:9</a>: “Woe to the one that has contended with his Former, as an earthenware fragment with the other earthenware fragments of the ground! Should the clay say to its former: ‘What do you make?’”</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">Let us realize our proper place, as Job did. Under the influence of the new knowledge that Job had gained, he realized the impotence of man and the greatness of God. Like Job, Christians need to get the true size of themselves, they need to see how insignificant their justification is compared with the vindication of Jehovah’s name and sovereignty. Let there be no faultfinding with God. Let our words be: “To my Fashioner I shall ascribe righteousness.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Job 36:3</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Progress Toward Taming the Tongue</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The tongue is but a tool of the mind and heart. Jesus said, “Out of the abundance <span id="page104" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="104" data-before-text="104"></span>of the heart the mouth speaks.” So we must go to the root of the trouble when seeking to tame an unruly tongue. We must work to erase from mind and heart the urges that drive the tongue to make foolish talk. If the mind and heart are filled with what is good, they will not empower the tongue to gossip, lie, flatter, play the hypocrite, and mouth obscenities. The properly filled mind and heart will have no room for such follies.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matt. 12:34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 15:18, 19</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Not only will the Christian mind shut the mouth against sending out meddling talk, but it will close the ears to incoming gossip, and discourage backbiters by meeting them with a displeased countenance. “The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.” Or, “The north wind bringeth forth rain; so doth a backbiting tongue an angry countenance.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Prov. 25:23</a>, <em>m.; AS</em>) The discerning mind knows that criticizing and gossiping about others is an indirect way of exalting and bragging on self. To run down others brings a false and deceptive sense of superiority. Hence the Christian aids both himself and the talebearer by refusing to listen. Without refueling the fire dies out.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps. 141:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Prov. 14:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/25/2" data-bid="26-3" class="b"> 17:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/25/3" data-bid="26-4" class="b"> 20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/25/4" data-bid="26-5" class="b"> 20:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/25/5" data-bid="26-6" class="b"> 26:20, 21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/25/6" data-bid="26-7" class="b"> 28:23</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Recall Jesus’ parable of the sheep and goats. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Matt. 25:31-46</a>) What the goats did to Christ’s brothers was counted as done to him. What we do to those brothers is counted as done to Christ. Would you gossip about your Lord? find fault with him? carry tales against him? Would you try to lie about him or to him? flatter him? play the hypocrite toward him? Or would you feel free to approach him with obscene jests? If you would not do these things with him, do not do them with your brothers. Do not commit the goats’ error!</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">So seek to progress toward taming the tongue by crowding out the evil with the good. “Brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are of serious concern, whatever things are righteous, whatever things are chaste, whatever things are lovable, whatever things are well spoken of, whatever virtue there is and whatever praiseworthy thing there is, continue considering these things.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Phil. 4:8</a>, <em>NW</em>) By studying God’s Word make your mind over, that it may make your unruly tongue over: “Quit being fashioned after this system of things, but be transformed by making your mind over, that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and complete will of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Rom. 12:2</a>, <em>NW</em>) By continual study gain more of such knowledge that will clothe you with a personality imaged after Christ: “Strip off the old personality with its practices, and clothe yourselves with the new personality which through accurate knowledge is being renewed according to the image of the one who created it.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Col. 3:9, 10</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Until such changes occur fully through study and the aid of God’s spirit and allow for complete taming of the tongue, all of us will have to keep close watch over that little member, each looking to his own, keeping its fires banked and controlled. Keep words few and cool when circumstances are unsettling, as counseled: “Where words abound, sin is not wanting: he who controls his tongue is a wise man.

While it has complimentary implications, the way it is used by the Hebrew Scripture writers keeps man cognizant of his inferior relationship to his Maker, Jehovah God. Thus we find that, when at last Jehovah God called patient Job to account because of his mistaken view of things, God twice addressed Job, not as a mere <em>ish,</em> a mere <em>adám</em> or a mere <em>enósh,</em> but he used the term <em>geber:</em> “Gird up your loins, please, like an able-bodied man, and let me question you, and you inform me,” since you were so sure of yourself as not to justify me! How fitting!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 38:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 40:7</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Pharaoh, when beginning to yield under the impact of the plagues, at first only granted permission for the able-bodied men to go into the wilderness to worship. And when the Israelites finally left Egypt we read that 600,000 able-bodied men, above twenty years old and able to fight, left Egypt together with their little ones.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ex. 10:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 12:37</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Because an able-bodied man is inclined to be “self-assuming,” trusting in his own strength, he is repeatedly singled out for reminders of the folly of such a mental attitude: “Here is the able-bodied man that does not put God as his fortress.” “What able-bodied man is there alive who will not see death?” “An able-bodied man dies and lies vanquished.” Yes, “cursed is the able-bodied man who puts his trust,” not in Jehovah, but in what is, after all, a mere “earthling man [<em>adám</em>].”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Hab. 2:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Ps. 52:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/19/2" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 89:48;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/19/3" data-bid="20-4" class="b"> Job 14:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/19/4" data-bid="20-5" class="b"> Jer. 17:5</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"><em>Geber</em> is frequently used to drive home a point by way of contrast. Thus the psalmist complains: “I have become like an able-bodied man without strength.” It would not have made much of a point had he said he became like a weak mortal, an <em>enósh,</em> because such a one does not have strength to begin with! Making the same point, Solomon observed that it is not good that “an able-bodied man should transgress over a mere piece of bread.” There might be an excuse for an <em>enósh</em> to do so, but certainly not a <em>geber.</em> The bad news he received caused Jeremiah’s bones to shake like “an able-bodied man whom wine has overcome,” hence a violent shaking. He also stressed the wretchedness of the men of Israel by employing this term: “Why is it that I have seen every able-bodied man with his hands upon his loins like a female that is giving birth, and all faces have turned pale?” Yes, this was serious when even able-bodied men, not mere <em>enósh</em> or weak mortals, were affected in this way!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 88:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Prov. 28:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/20/2" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> Jer. 23:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/20/3" data-bid="21-4" class="b"> 30:6</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Logically we are told that “one wise in strength is,” not an <em>adám, ish</em> or <em>enósh,</em> but a <em>geber,</em> “an able-bodied man.” A wise <em>geber</em> trusts not in his own strength but in Jehovah: “Blessed is the able-bodied man who puts his trust in Jehovah, and whose confidence Jehovah has become.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Prov. 24:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Jer. 17:7</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Truly, to note the way “man” is used in the Hebrew Scriptures strengthens our faith and helps us to get God’s view on man.

<strong>Should There Be Faultfinding with God?</strong><br/><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Jehovah has spoken. Those words about God’s wonders in nature brought Job into the proper state of mind, to see that the creature is nothing in comparison with the Creator, that in the face of God’s grandeur, Job’s “declaring his own soul righteous rather than God” was not the thing to do. Since Jehovah has evinced so much power and wisdom in his visible creation and since there is also so much that surpasses man’s comprehension, God is entitled to implicit trust. Whatever God does, whether immediately understood by man or not, the only proper feeling for man is that God does what is right. It would be the height of presumption to question any part of God’s doings at the bar of human judgment. Who, then, will do any contending of a faultfinder with the Almighty? <span id="page488" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="488" data-before-text="488"></span>Certainly not Job. “Job went on to answer Jehovah and say: ‘Look! I have become of little account. What shall I reply to you? My hand I have put over my mouth. Once have I spoken, and I will not answer; and twice, and I will add nothing.’” Job’s remorse was not wordy; nothing to smack of self-righteousness. It was simply: “I have become of little account.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 40:3-5</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Jehovah’s further words show the wisdom of Job’s expression:</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">“And Jehovah went on to answer Job out of the windstorm and say: ‘Gird up your loins, please, like an able-bodied man; I shall question you, and you inform me. Really, will you invalidate my justice? Will you pronounce me wicked in order that you may be in the right? Or do you have an arm like that of the true God, and with a voice like his can you make it thunder? Deck yourself, please, with superiority and highness; and with dignity and splendor may you clothe yourself. Let flow the furious outbursts of your anger, and see every one haughty and bring him low. See every one haughty, humble him, and tread down the wicked right where they are. Hide them together in the dust, bind their very faces in the hidden place, and I, even I, shall commend you, because your right hand can save you.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 40:6-14</a>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Will any man question God’s right to be Universal Sovereign?

In fact, a number of Bible translations (<em>AT, La, Ro, NW, JB, RS</em>) use the word “hippopotamus” in the main text or in footnotes to identify the creature referred to by God.</p>

<strong>Animal Creation Magnifies Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Behemoth climbs out of the river to feast on “green grass.” Why, the greenery of an entire mountain seems necessary to sustain it! Some 200 to 400 pounds <strong>[90-180 kg]</strong> of vegetation go into its stomach every day. Its appetite satisfied, Behemoth lies under lotus trees or in the shade of poplars. If the river it lives in overflows, the hippo can keep its head above water and swim against a deluge. Confronted with Behemoth’s mammoth mouth and formidable tusks, Job would not have the audacity to pierce its nose with a hook.</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963087/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 38:2</a>) Though Job had kept integrity to God, he had obscured divine counsel by speaking words not based on accurate knowledge; he had cast some doubt upon the wise, loving and just procedure of the Creator. Job’s course of justifying his own soul more than God needed to be corrected. Out of the windstorm Jehovah spoke to Job, giving him knowledge of God’s infinite wisdom and loving care of his creatures. Deeply humiliated by the questions raised by the Almighty regarding works in nature, the animals and birds, Job confessed he had nothing to say toward his own justification. Then Jehovah asked another question: “Do you have an arm like that of the true God?” And to illustrate God’s power in nature, Jehovah describes a creative marvel, the mighty behemoth:</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Here, now, is Behemoth that I have made as well as you. Green grass it eats just as a bull does. Here, now, its power is in its hips, and its dynamic energy in the tendons of its belly. It bends down its tail like a cedar; the sinews of its thighs are interwoven. Its bones are tubes of copper; its strong bones are like wrought-iron rods. It is the beginning of the ways of God; its Maker can bring near his sword.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963087/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 40:15-19</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Here is a mammoth creature made by God, mighty in power. From God’s description of the creature, the hippopotamus is generally identified with the behemoth; and a number of Bible translations of the book of Job use the word “hippopotamus” in their main text or in footnotes to identify the creature referred to by God.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Prodigious in size, a full-grown hippo may be twelve to fourteen feet long and may weigh up to 8,000 pounds. “The bulk of a full-grown male hippopotamus can hardly be believed even when viewed at close range in a zoo,” declares zoologist Ivan Sanderson. “One wonders, when so observing the brute, how on earth its small stumpy legs, for all their girth, can support the body, yet the same beast in its native waters can overtake almost any man-powered small boat and even motorboats by paddling like a dog with these same ridiculous little limbs.”—<em>Living Mammals of the World.</em></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Those small legs are of sturdy build. The bones of the hippo’s legs are as strong as “tubes of copper,” strong enough to support a four-ton creature. Its bones and ribs are like iron bars. “The sinews of its thighs are interwoven,” so that the fiber and tendons of muscles of its thighs are twisted together and braided like powerful cables. Its “power is in its hips,” in the muscles of its back, and “its dynamic energy in the tendons of its belly,” the muscles of its belly being powerful. The hide of the belly is thicker than that on other <span id="page90" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="90" data-before-text="90"></span>parts of the body, since the hippo is short-legged and drags his body over grass, sticks and stones of riverbeds. Its tail is like a cedar, not in length but since it can set its thick tail rigidly upright or swing it about like a tree.</p>

<strong>Meet Mighty Behemoth</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“BEHEMOTH” is the designation applied to an animal in a record that has been preserved for some 3,500 years through repeated copying and recopying. The term probably means “huge beast.” What creature is of such tremendous size as to merit the ancient designation “Behemoth”? It is a thick-skinned, nearly hairless mammal called the hippopotamus. That “Behemoth” is the hippopotamus agrees with the description of this creature found in the Bible book of Job.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In part, that ancient description reads: “Green grass it eats just as a bull does. Its bones are tubes of copper; its strong bones are like wrought-iron rods. Under the thorny lotus trees it lies down, in the concealed place of reeds and the swampy place. The thorny lotus trees keep it blocked off with their shadow; the poplars of the torrent valley surround it. If the river acts violently, it does not run in panic. It is confident, although the Jordan should burst forth against its mouth.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101976006/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 40:15,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101976006/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 18,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101976006/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 21-23</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The hippopotamus does indeed eat vegetation ‘as does a bull.’ More than 200 pounds of soft water plants, grass, reeds and other greenery enter its stomach every day. Having a capacity of forty or fifty gallons, the stomach of the hippopotamus is fully capable of handling all this food.</p>

<strong>Behemoth</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The description in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000619/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">the 40th chapter of the book of Job</a> offers a vivid word picture of this huge mammal, Behemoth.

Since the tail of a hippopotamus is fairly short, measuring about 46 to 51 cm (18 to 20 in.), this is likely to be understood as meaning that the animal can set its thick tail rigidly upright or swing it about like a tree. “The <span id="page281" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="281" data-before-text="281"></span>sinews of its thighs are interwoven,” so that the fiber and tendons of muscles of its thighs are twisted together and braided like powerful cables.

<strong>Animal Creation Magnifies Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Again turning his attention to animal creation, God asked Job about Behemoth, generally identified as the hippopotamus. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006045/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 40:15-24</a>) A full-grown hippo may be from 12 to 15 feet <strong>[4 to 5 m]</strong> long and may weigh up to 8,000 pounds <strong>[3,600 kg]</strong>. Behemoth’s “power is in its hips”​—the muscles in its back. The thick hide of its belly is a real advantage as short-legged Behemoth drags its body over stones in riverbeds. Surely a man is no match for Behemoth, with its massive body, huge mouth, and powerful jaws.</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963087/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 38:2</a>) Though Job had kept integrity to God, he had obscured divine counsel by speaking words not based on accurate knowledge; he had cast some doubt upon the wise, loving and just procedure of the Creator. Job’s course of justifying his own soul more than God needed to be corrected. Out of the windstorm Jehovah spoke to Job, giving him knowledge of God’s infinite wisdom and loving care of his creatures. Deeply humiliated by the questions raised by the Almighty regarding works in nature, the animals and birds, Job confessed he had nothing to say toward his own justification. Then Jehovah asked another question: “Do you have an arm like that of the true God?” And to illustrate God’s power in nature, Jehovah describes a creative marvel, the mighty behemoth:</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Here, now, is Behemoth that I have made as well as you. Green grass it eats just as a bull does. Here, now, its power is in its hips, and its dynamic energy in the tendons of its belly. It bends down its tail like a cedar; the sinews of its thighs are interwoven. Its bones are tubes of copper; its strong bones are like wrought-iron rods. It is the beginning of the ways of God; its Maker can bring near his sword.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963087/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 40:15-19</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Here is a mammoth creature made by God, mighty in power. From God’s description of the creature, the hippopotamus is generally identified with the behemoth; and a number of Bible translations of the book of Job use the word “hippopotamus” in their main text or in footnotes to identify the creature referred to by God.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Prodigious in size, a full-grown hippo may be twelve to fourteen feet long and may weigh up to 8,000 pounds. “The bulk of a full-grown male hippopotamus can hardly be believed even when viewed at close range in a zoo,” declares zoologist Ivan Sanderson. “One wonders, when so observing the brute, how on earth its small stumpy legs, for all their girth, can support the body, yet the same beast in its native waters can overtake almost any man-powered small boat and even motorboats by paddling like a dog with these same ridiculous little limbs.”—<em>Living Mammals of the World.</em></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Those small legs are of sturdy build. The bones of the hippo’s legs are as strong as “tubes of copper,” strong enough to support a four-ton creature. Its bones and ribs are like iron bars. “The sinews of its thighs are interwoven,” so that the fiber and tendons of muscles of its thighs are twisted together and braided like powerful cables. Its “power is in its hips,” in the muscles of its back, and “its dynamic energy in the tendons of its belly,” the muscles of its belly being powerful. The hide of the belly is thicker than that on other <span id="page90" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="90" data-before-text="90"></span>parts of the body, since the hippo is short-legged and drags his body over grass, sticks and stones of riverbeds.

<strong>Behemoth</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The description in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000619/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">the 40th chapter of the book of Job</a> offers a vivid word picture of this huge mammal, Behemoth. It is described as being herbivorous. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000619/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Vs 15</a>) The sources of its tremendous power and energy are noted to be in the hips and in the tendons of its belly, that is, the muscles of its back and those of its belly. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000619/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Vs 16</a>) The tail of Behemoth is like a cedar. Since the tail of a hippopotamus is fairly short, measuring about 46 to 51 cm (18 to 20 in.), this is likely to be understood as meaning that the animal can set its thick tail rigidly upright or swing it about like a tree. “The <span id="page281" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="281" data-before-text="281"></span>sinews of its thighs are interwoven,” so that the fiber and tendons of muscles of its thighs are twisted together and braided like powerful cables. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000619/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Vs 17</a>) The bones of its legs are as strong as “tubes of copper,” thus being able to support the great weight of the body.

<strong>Bones</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Composed of living tissues, bones form a strong framework in the bodies of vertebrates. Too complicated in construction to be fully understood by scientists, man is ‘woven together’ with a skeleton of more than 200 bones and their connecting sinews. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000788/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 10:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000788/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ec 11:5</a>) Pound for pound, bone is stronger than steel, and its construction is comparable to reinforced concrete. In fact, in describing “Behemoth,” Jehovah says: “Its bones are tubes of copper; its strong bones are like wrought-iron rods.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000788/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 40:15,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000788/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 18</a>) The description aptly fits the hippopotamus, the bones of whose short, powerful legs and heavily built hips support his massive weight of from 2,300 to 3,600 kg (5,000 to 8,000 lb).</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963087/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 38:2</a>) Though Job had kept integrity to God, he had obscured divine counsel by speaking words not based on accurate knowledge; he had cast some doubt upon the wise, loving and just procedure of the Creator. Job’s course of justifying his own soul more than God needed to be corrected. Out of the windstorm Jehovah spoke to Job, giving him knowledge of God’s infinite wisdom and loving care of his creatures. Deeply humiliated by the questions raised by the Almighty regarding works in nature, the animals and birds, Job confessed he had nothing to say toward his own justification. Then Jehovah asked another question: “Do you have an arm like that of the true God?” And to illustrate God’s power in nature, Jehovah describes a creative marvel, the mighty behemoth:</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Here, now, is Behemoth that I have made as well as you. Green grass it eats just as a bull does. Here, now, its power is in its hips, and its dynamic energy in the tendons of its belly. It bends down its tail like a cedar; the sinews of its thighs are interwoven. Its bones are tubes of copper; its strong bones are like wrought-iron rods. It is the beginning of the ways of God; its Maker can bring near his sword.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963087/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 40:15-19</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Here is a mammoth creature made by God, mighty in power. From God’s description of the creature, the hippopotamus is generally identified with the behemoth; and a number of Bible translations of the book of Job use the word “hippopotamus” in their main text or in footnotes to identify the creature referred to by God.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Prodigious in size, a full-grown hippo may be twelve to fourteen feet long and may weigh up to 8,000 pounds. “The bulk of a full-grown male hippopotamus can hardly be believed even when viewed at close range in a zoo,” declares zoologist Ivan Sanderson. “One wonders, when so observing the brute, how on earth its small stumpy legs, for all their girth, can support the body, yet the same beast in its native waters can overtake almost any man-powered small boat and even motorboats by paddling like a dog with these same ridiculous little limbs.”—<em>Living Mammals of the World.</em></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Those small legs are of sturdy build. The bones of the hippo’s legs are as strong as “tubes of copper,” strong enough to support a four-ton creature. Its bones and ribs are like iron bars. “The sinews of its thighs are interwoven,” so that the fiber and tendons of muscles of its thighs are twisted together and braided like powerful cables. Its “power is in its hips,” in the muscles of its back, and “its dynamic energy in the tendons of its belly,” the muscles of its belly being powerful. The hide of the belly is thicker than that on other <span id="page90" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="90" data-before-text="90"></span>parts of the body, since the hippo is short-legged and drags his body over grass, sticks and stones of riverbeds. Its tail is like a cedar, not in length but since it can set its thick tail rigidly upright or swing it about like a tree.</p>

In adults the marrow is red in the flatter bones and yellow in the long, rounder bones. It is in the red marrow, particularly in the flat bones of the skull, the ribs, the sternum and pelvis, that red blood corpuscles (erythrocytes) are manufactured. Recent studies have indicated that the marrow also has a share in producing white corpuscles (leucocytes), which fight disease infections, as well as blood platelets, which have a key role in bringing about clotting. Bones are also storehouses of calcium and phosphorus, ready to be supplied to the bloodstream as the need arises. A constant reconstruction goes on in the bones, old cells and materials being replaced by new. In infancy bones are very flexible, becoming more firm in maturity and finally becoming very brittle in an aged person.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Eve, the first woman, was formed from a rib taken from Adam. This was appropriate in view of the fact that bones are the body’s foundation, are wholly made up of living cells and are blood-cell producers. Adam could truly say of Eve: “This is at last bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.” She was the closest possible relative of Adam.

This was proof that it was God’s power, not Elisha’s, that performed the miracles Elisha had accomplished, and was a powerful attestation or a seal of God as to the genuineness of his faithful prophet.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010779/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Ki. 13:20, 21</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">After Jesus’ resurrection he appeared to some of his disciples, who thought they were beholding an apparition.

There is no foundation for this argument, for the disciples could see that he had bones and flesh but no blood was running from his body for him to call to their attention. Jesus thereby provided evidence by the mouth of eleven apostles and many others that he was truly resurrected to life and that the disciples were suffering no hallucination in declaring his resurrection.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010779/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:3-6</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>UNCLEANNESS</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Under the Law given through Moses, a person was religiously “unclean” if he touched a corpse or a bone of a man or a burial place.

But King Josiah adopted a more effective method. He filled the places of sacred poles of pagan worship with human bones and burned the bones from burial places on the altars, making them defiled and unfit for use. This he did to the altar of calf worship at Bethel, as well as the other altars and high places of pagan worship in Samaria and Judah.

The tombs near Jerusalem were whitewashed one month before Passover to avoid uncleanness by accidentally touching them at this special period of worship. Jesus used this custom as a basis for an illustration of the scribes and Pharisees as appearing righteous outwardly but being within “full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010779/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 23:27, 28</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>PROVERBIAL USAGE</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Since the bones are essential to hold up the body and to protect the organs and since the life (soul) is in the blood (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010779/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Lev. 17:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010779/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 14</a>), the Bible in its references to bones and marrow highlight their vitalness to the health of the individual and, figuratively and symbolically, to his spiritual health.

Conversely, bad mental attitudes bow one down spiritually. A wife being as one flesh with her husband can greatly affect his spiritual standing by showing either respect or disrespect through her course of action and her speech.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">By way of wise counsel for us, the power of patience and kind words to overcome stiff, firm opposition is expressed in the Proverbs: “By patience a commander is induced, and a mild tongue itself can break a bone.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010779/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Prov. 25:15</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>PROPHETIC</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">At the institution of the Passover, Jehovah commanded that the lamb (or goat) be roasted whole and “you must not break a bone in it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010779/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ex. 12:46</a>) This was fulfilled in Jesus Christ, “the Lamb of God,” who is the antitypical passover sacrifice.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963087/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 38:2</a>) Though Job had kept integrity to God, he had obscured divine counsel by speaking words not based on accurate knowledge; he had cast some doubt upon the wise, loving and just procedure of the Creator. Job’s course of justifying his own soul more than God needed to be corrected. Out of the windstorm Jehovah spoke to Job, giving him knowledge of God’s infinite wisdom and loving care of his creatures. Deeply humiliated by the questions raised by the Almighty regarding works in nature, the animals and birds, Job confessed he had nothing to say toward his own justification. Then Jehovah asked another question: “Do you have an arm like that of the true God?” And to illustrate God’s power in nature, Jehovah describes a creative marvel, the mighty behemoth:</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Here, now, is Behemoth that I have made as well as you. Green grass it eats just as a bull does. Here, now, its power is in its hips, and its dynamic energy in the tendons of its belly. It bends down its tail like a cedar; the sinews of its thighs are interwoven. Its bones are tubes of copper; its strong bones are like wrought-iron rods. It is the beginning of the ways of God; its Maker can bring near his sword.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963087/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 40:15-19</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Here is a mammoth creature made by God, mighty in power. From God’s description of the creature, the hippopotamus is generally identified with the behemoth; and a number of Bible translations of the book of Job use the word “hippopotamus” in their main text or in footnotes to identify the creature referred to by God.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Prodigious in size, a full-grown hippo may be twelve to fourteen feet long and may weigh up to 8,000 pounds. “The bulk of a full-grown male hippopotamus can hardly be believed even when viewed at close range in a zoo,” declares zoologist Ivan Sanderson. “One wonders, when so observing the brute, how on earth its small stumpy legs, for all their girth, can support the body, yet the same beast in its native waters can overtake almost any man-powered small boat and even motorboats by paddling like a dog with these same ridiculous little limbs.”—<em>Living Mammals of the World.</em></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Those small legs are of sturdy build. The bones of the hippo’s legs are as strong as “tubes of copper,” strong enough to support a four-ton creature. Its bones and ribs are like iron bars. “The sinews of its thighs are interwoven,” so that the fiber and tendons of muscles of its thighs are twisted together and braided like powerful cables. Its “power is in its hips,” in the muscles of its back, and “its dynamic energy in the tendons of its belly,” the muscles of its belly being powerful. The hide of the belly is thicker than that on other <span id="page90" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="90" data-before-text="90"></span>parts of the body, since the hippo is short-legged and drags his body over grass, sticks and stones of riverbeds. Its tail is like a cedar, not in length but since it can set its thick tail rigidly upright or swing it about like a tree.</p>

<strong>Animal Creation Magnifies Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Behemoth climbs out of the river to feast on “green grass.” Why, the greenery of an entire mountain seems necessary to sustain it! Some 200 to 400 pounds <strong>[90-180 kg]</strong> of vegetation go into its stomach every day. Its appetite satisfied, Behemoth lies under lotus trees or in the shade of poplars. If the river it lives in overflows, the hippo can keep its head above water and swim against a deluge. Confronted with Behemoth’s mammoth mouth and formidable tusks, Job would not have the audacity to pierce its nose with a hook.</p>

Yes, “green grass” is its food, and because of its enormous appetite, it seems that the greenery of whole mountains is required to sustain it. The teeth cut the grass and a cavernous mouth scoops up the feed, the jaws crushing the mass. Some 200 to 400 pounds of greenery go into its mammoth stomach every day. Yet when the hippo leaves the water to feed where green grass grows, the other animals have no need to fear, since the monster does not attack them.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">When its appetite has been assuaged, the hippo lies down under the thorny lotus trees or conceals itself in a swampy place, beneath the shade of the poplars.

<strong>Behemoth and Leviathan—Creative Marvels</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Those small legs are of sturdy build. The bones of the hippo’s legs are as strong as “tubes of copper,” strong enough to support a four-ton creature. Its bones and ribs are like iron bars. “The sinews of its thighs are interwoven,” so that the fiber and tendons of muscles of its thighs are twisted together and braided like powerful cables. Its “power is in its hips,” in the muscles of its back, and “its dynamic energy in the tendons of its belly,” the muscles of its belly being powerful. The hide of the belly is thicker than that on other <span id="page90" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="90" data-before-text="90"></span>parts of the body, since the hippo is short-legged and drags his body over grass, sticks and stones of riverbeds.

He created it; he gave it its power. Who can approach such a creature with a sword to take its life? So great is the hippo’s power in its jaw and teeth that it has bitten men clean through the torso. With its recurved canines and pointed incisors, the hippo can shear through a native dugout canoe like cardboard and bite through the metal plates of a riverboat. Little wonder an ancient Egyptian inscription going back to the time of Thutmose III reads: “The hippopotamus, the lord of terrors in the water, which man cannot approach unto.”<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1963087/0">a</a> Concerning this behemoth Jehovah said to Job:</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="si">“The mountains themselves bear their produce for it, and all the wild beasts of the field themselves play there.

Yes, “green grass” is its food, and because of its enormous appetite, it seems that the greenery of whole mountains is required to sustain it. The teeth cut the grass and a cavernous mouth scoops up the feed, the jaws crushing the mass. Some 200 to 400 pounds of greenery go into its mammoth stomach every day. Yet when the hippo leaves the water to feed where green grass grows, the other animals have no need to fear, since the monster does not attack them.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">When its appetite has been assuaged, the hippo lies down under the thorny lotus trees or conceals itself in a swampy place, beneath the shade of the poplars. It is of little concern to the hippo if the river in which it dwells rises and overflows its banks. It can still keep its head above the level of water and swim against the force of the deluge.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Seeing the behemoth is so mighty and has a mammoth mouth equipped with formidable tusks in the lower jaw, would Job have the audacity to confront such a monster before its eyes and try to pierce its nose with a hook?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>LEVIATHAN</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Humbled by God’s description of the power of the grass-eating behemoth, Job is next asked about another amphibious creature, which, unlike the hippo, is meat-eating and ferocious in disposition:</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">“Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook, or with a rope can you hold down its tongue?

Since the tail of a hippopotamus is fairly short, measuring about 46 to 51 cm (18 to 20 in.), this is likely to be understood as meaning that the animal can set its thick tail rigidly upright or swing it about like a tree. “The <span id="page281" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="281" data-before-text="281"></span>sinews of its thighs are interwoven,” so that the fiber and tendons of muscles of its thighs are twisted together and braided like powerful cables.

<strong>Beheading</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Pharaoh ‘lifted up the head from off’ his chief baker, evidently beheading him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010617/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 40:19</a>) David, after felling Goliath with a stone from his sling, took Goliath’s sword and “definitely put him to death” by beheading him before the armies of Israel and the Philistines. This threw great fear into the Philistine army and resulted in a mighty rout.

For this David had them put to death.

Beheading is thought to have been the means used, since it was not lawful to put a Roman citizen to death by scourging or impaling. John, in a vision, “saw the souls of those executed with the ax for the witness they bore to Jesus and for speaking about God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010617/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rev. 20:4</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Many men were doubtless killed in battle by beheading or were beheaded after falling.

<strong>Behemoth and Leviathan—Creative Marvels</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Those small legs are of sturdy build. The bones of the hippo’s legs are as strong as “tubes of copper,” strong enough to support a four-ton creature. Its bones and ribs are like iron bars. “The sinews of its thighs are interwoven,” so that the fiber and tendons of muscles of its thighs are twisted together and braided like powerful cables. Its “power is in its hips,” in the muscles of its back, and “its dynamic energy in the tendons of its belly,” the muscles of its belly being powerful. The hide of the belly is thicker than that on other <span id="page90" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="90" data-before-text="90"></span>parts of the body, since the hippo is short-legged and drags his body over grass, sticks and stones of riverbeds. Its tail is like a cedar, not in length but since it can set its thick tail rigidly upright or swing it about like a tree.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">How the mighty hippo exemplifies God’s power! He created it; he gave it its power. Who can approach such a creature with a sword to take its life? So great is the hippo’s power in its jaw and teeth that it has bitten men clean through the torso. With its recurved canines and pointed incisors, the hippo can shear through a native dugout canoe like cardboard and bite through the metal plates of a riverboat. Little wonder an ancient Egyptian inscription going back to the time of Thutmose III reads: “The hippopotamus, the lord of terrors in the water, which man cannot approach unto.”<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1963087/0">a</a> Concerning this behemoth Jehovah said to Job:</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="si">“The mountains themselves bear their produce for it, and all the wild beasts of the field themselves play there. Under the thorny lotus trees it lies down, in the concealed place of reeds and the swampy place. The thorny lotus trees keep it blocked off with their shadow; the poplars of the torrent valley surround it. If the river acts violently, it does not run in panic. It is confident, although the Jordan should burst forth against its mouth. Before its eyes can anyone take it? With snares can anyone bore its nose?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963087/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 40:20-24</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The mighty behemoth, being amphibious, climbs out of the river, ascending steep riverbanks to enjoy the produce that the mountains bear for it. Yes, “green grass” is its food, and because of its enormous appetite, it seems that the greenery of whole mountains is required to sustain it. The teeth cut the grass and a cavernous mouth scoops up the feed, the jaws crushing the mass. Some 200 to 400 pounds of greenery go into its mammoth stomach every day. Yet when the hippo leaves the water to feed where green grass grows, the other animals have no need to fear, since the monster does not attack them.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">When its appetite has been assuaged, the hippo lies down under the thorny lotus trees or conceals itself in a swampy place, beneath the shade of the poplars. It is of little concern to the hippo if the river in which it dwells rises and overflows its banks. It can still keep its head above the level of water and swim against the force of the deluge.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Seeing the behemoth is so mighty and has a mammoth mouth equipped with formidable tusks in the lower jaw, would Job have the audacity to confront such a monster before its eyes and try to pierce its nose with a hook?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>LEVIATHAN</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Humbled by God’s description of the power of the grass-eating behemoth, Job is next asked about another amphibious creature, which, unlike the hippo, is meat-eating and ferocious in disposition:</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">“Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook, or with a rope can you hold down its tongue? Can you put a rush in its nostrils, or with a thorn can you bore its jaws? Will it make many entreaties to you, or will it say soft words to you? Will it conclude a covenant with you, that you may take it as a slave to time indefinite? Will you play with it as with a bird, or will you tie it for your young girls? Will partners barter for it? Will they divide it up among tradesmen? Will you fill its skin with harpoons, or its head with fish spears? Put your hands upon it. Remember the battle. Do not do it again.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963087/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 41:1-8</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">From the description Jehovah gives of leviathan in the book of Job, it is thought that this creative marvel must be that giant among reptiles, the crocodile. Thus a number of Bible translations of the book of Job such as J.

The crocodile fits that description.</p>

<strong>Studying the Bible—In the Zoo!</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>“Out Of Its Nostrils Smoke Goes Forth”</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">But there are more animals we definitely want to see. The other day in our Bible study, we came across “Leviathan,” the crocodile. At first, Pepijn described it as ‘a kind of fish, but then a very large one!’ As crocodiles are very sensitive to temperature variations, they are accommodated in the Africa House, where a tropical climate is maintained. Upon entering, we are struck by the heat and the humidity, which steam up our glasses. In addition to that, we have to get accustomed to the darkness. Walking across a wooden suspension bridge, we suddenly come face-to-face with a couple of huge crocodiles holding sway over the wallows on either side of the bridge. They lie there so motionless that Pepijn is prompted to say: “They are not real.”</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><span id="page19" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>Crocodiles are among the largest extant reptiles. Some may reach a length of 20 feet <strong>[6 m]</strong> and may weigh as much as 2,000 pounds <strong>[900 kg]</strong>. The strength of their jaws is stunning—even a relatively small crocodile weighing 100 pounds <strong>[50 kg]</strong> is able to exert a force equal to over 1,500 pounds <strong>[700 kg]</strong>. When a crocodile surfaces after a period of submersion, the rapid exhalation of air through its nostrils can produce a spray that in the glare of the morning sun may well be the ‘flash of light’ and the ‘going forth of smoke out of its nostrils’ that the book of Job describes.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101996165/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 41:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101996165/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 18-21</a>.</p>

<strong>Meet Mighty Leviathan</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What creature has a set of fear-inspiring teeth and hide so tough that ancient swords, spears, darts and javelins were almost powerless to penetrate it? The creature is a reptile, one of the largest in existence. Since the ancient description of Leviathan was committed to writing in the Middle East, the creature meant was doubtless the Nile crocodile. This crocodile may attain a length ranging from thirteen to sixteen feet (3.9 to 4.8 meters).</p>

<strong>Honey, Honeycomb</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The temptation to sexual immorality that the “strange woman” can bring to bear by her appeal to a man with her use of charm and smooth words is described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012015/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Proverbs, chapters five and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012015/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> seven</a>. It constitutes a fine warning to Christians today. “As a honeycomb the lips of a strange woman keep dripping, and her palate is smoother than oil. But the aftereffect from her is as bitter as wormwood; it <span id="page786" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="786" data-before-text="786"></span>is as sharp as a two-edged sword. Her feet are descending to death,” says the wise man. Her smooth, honeylike words and actions lead the man right up to the immoral act so that “all of a sudden he is going after her, like a bull that comes even to the slaughter.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012015/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Prov. 5:3-5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012015/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 7:21, 22</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>HONEY OF FRUITS</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The Hebrew word <em>d<sup>e</sup>vashʹ</em> can refer also to the juice or syrup of fruits—figs, dates, and so forth. Often the context enables the reader to determine whether or not bee honey is meant. Evidently the syrup of fruits is what is prohibited from being offered on the altar at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012015/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Leviticus 2:11</a>, because of its tendency to ferment. That bee honey is not meant here is indicated by the next verse, which included the prohibited “honey” as firstfruits. Most of the honey used by the Israelites was wild honey, not a cultivated crop as in the case of grapes, figs, dates and other fruits. For the same reason the “honey” offered as firstfruits when Hezekiah motivated the people to support the priesthood was undoubtedly the juice or syrup of fruits.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012015/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Chron. 31:5</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>A LAND OF MILK AND HONEY</strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The description of Palestine as “a land flowing with milk and honey,” often repeated in the Scriptures, is apt, for not only was the product of bees abundant, but also the syrup of fruits.

With its recurved canines and pointed incisors, the hippo can shear through a native dugout canoe like cardboard and bite through the metal plates of a riverboat.

Yes, “green grass” is its food, and because of its enormous appetite, it seems that the greenery of whole mountains is required to sustain it. The teeth cut the grass and a cavernous mouth scoops up the feed, the jaws crushing the mass. Some 200 to 400 pounds of greenery go into its mammoth stomach every day. Yet when the hippo leaves the water to feed where green grass grows, the other animals have no need to fear, since the monster does not attack them.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">When its appetite has been assuaged, the hippo lies down under the thorny lotus trees or conceals itself in a swampy place, beneath the shade of the poplars.

Thus a number of Bible translations of the book of Job such as J.

<strong>Weaving</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">On the loom the warp threads were usually separated into two sets, so that the woof thread would pass over one set when drawn across the warp in one direction and under that set when moved across it in the opposite way. For this, two “sheds” or passages were needed. In a simple horizontal loom a flat “shed stick” was placed across the warp under alternate warp threads and by turning it on edge one “shed” was made, through which the woof thread was passed in one direction. Alternate warp threads <span id="page1650" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1650" data-before-text="1650"></span>attached by loops of thread to a “leash rod” lying on top of the warp were next raised by lifting the “leash rod” vertically from the warp, making another “shed” through which the weft was drawn in the opposite direction across the warp. After each movement across the warp the woof thread was pressed against the growing cloth with a peg. The weaver drew the weft across the warp with a shuttle, basically a rod carrying the thread. Since the skillful weaver moved the shuttle rapidly, Job could say: “My days themselves have become swifter than a weaver’s shuttle.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014485/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 7:6</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">After the cloth had been woven to the desired length and rolled up, the loom worker cut it from the warp threads. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014485/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isa. 38:9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014485/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 12</a>) Materials commonly used by weavers included animal hair (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014485/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ex. 36:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014485/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Matt. 3:4</a>), wool and linen.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014485/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 31:13</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Fabrics of varying patterns could be made by using threads of different colors in the warp or the woof, or both. Or woof thread of a particular color might be run only part way in the warp. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014485/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Gen. 37:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014485/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 2 Sam. 13:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014485/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Prov. 7:16</a>) The loom worker might weave in an irregular manner, such as running a set of woof threads over one and then under two warp threads across the warp and then running the next set over two warp threads, under two, then over one for the width of the warp, as in weaving gabardine today. By variations in weaving methods a pattern is developed in the fabric even when warp and woof threads are the same color. Aaron, for instance, was provided with a white robe of fine linen woven “in checker work.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014485/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ex. 28:39</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Behemoth and Leviathan—Creative Marvels</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Those small legs are of sturdy build. The bones of the hippo’s legs are as strong as “tubes of copper,” strong enough to support a four-ton creature. Its bones and ribs are like iron bars. “The sinews of its thighs are interwoven,” so that the fiber and tendons of muscles of its thighs are twisted together and braided like powerful cables. Its “power is in its hips,” in the muscles of its back, and “its dynamic energy in the tendons of its belly,” the muscles of its belly being powerful. The hide of the belly is thicker than that on other <span id="page90" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="90" data-before-text="90"></span>parts of the body, since the hippo is short-legged and drags his body over grass, sticks and stones of riverbeds.

With its recurved canines and pointed incisors, the hippo can shear through a native dugout canoe like cardboard and bite through the metal plates of a riverboat.

<strong>Canaan</strong><br/><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb"><strong>Commercial and Geopolitical Importance.</strong> Canaan formed a land bridge connecting Egypt with Asia and, more particularly, Mesopotamia. Though the economy of the country was basically agricultural, commercial trade was also engaged in, and the seaport cities of Tyre and Sidon became major trade centers with fleets of ships that were renowned throughout the then-known world. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000874/101/0" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Eze 27</a>.) Thus, as far back as Job’s time, the word “Canaanite” had become synonymous with ‘tradesman’ and is so translated. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000874/102/0" data-bid="103-1" class="b">Job 41:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000874/102/1" data-bid="103-2" class="b"> Zep 1:11</a>; note also the reference to Babylon as “the land of Canaan,” <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000874/103/0" data-bid="104-1" class="b">Eze 17:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000874/103/1" data-bid="104-2" class="b"> 12</a>.) Canaan thus occupied a very strategic place in the Fertile Crescent and was the target of the great empires of Mesopotamia, Asia Minor, and Africa that were seeking to control military passage and commercial traffic through Canaan’s confines. God’s placing of his chosen people in this land, therefore, was certain to draw the attention of the nations and have far-reaching effects; in a geographic sense, though more importantly in a religious sense, the Israelites could be said to dwell “in the center of the earth.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000874/104/0" data-bid="105-1" class="b">Eze 38:12</a>.</p>

The continued presence of the Canaanites among them brought infection into Israel that, in the course of time, undoubtedly contributed toward more deaths (not to mention crime, immorality and idolatry) than the decreed extermination of all the Canaanites would have produced had it been faithfully effected.

The wars with the nations of Canaan described thereafter in the book of Judges, and the later wars fought by Saul and David, exemplify this purpose.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">In view of all of this, it is clear that opinions held by some Bible critics that the destruction or the Canaanites by Israel is not in harmony with the ‘spirit’ of the Christian Greek Scriptures does not accord with the facts, as a comparison of such texts as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010864/77/0" data-bid="78-1" class="b">Matthew 3:7-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010864/77/1" data-bid="78-2" class="b"> 22:1-7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010864/77/2" data-bid="78-3" class="b"> 23:33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010864/77/3" data-bid="78-4" class="b"> 25:41-46;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010864/77/4" data-bid="78-5" class="b"> Mark 12:1-9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010864/77/5" data-bid="78-6" class="b"> Luke 19:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010864/77/6" data-bid="78-7" class="b"> 27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010864/77/7" data-bid="78-8" class="b"> Romans 1:18-32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010864/77/8" data-bid="78-9" class="b"> 2 Thessalonians 1:6-9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010864/77/9" data-bid="78-10" class="b"> 2:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010864/77/10" data-bid="78-11" class="b"> Revelation 19:11-21</a> will demonstrate.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="ss"><strong>LATER HISTORY</strong></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">Following the conquest, the situation between the Canaanites and the Israelites gradually became one of relatively peaceful coexistence, though to Israel’s detriment.

Syrian, Moabite and Philistine rulers successively gained temporary domination over the Israelites, but it was not until the time of Jabin, called “the king of Canaan,” that the Canaanites regained sufficient power to accomplish a twenty-year subjugation of Israel.

Likewise during Saul’s reign, of the Canaanite tribes only the Amorites are briefly mentioned.

The term “Canaan” came to refer primarily to Phoenicia, as in Isaiah’s prophecy concerning Tyre (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010864/90/0" data-bid="91-1" class="b">Isa. 23:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010864/90/1" data-bid="91-2" class="b"> 11</a>, <em>NW,</em> 1958 ed., ftn.) and in the case of the “Phoenician” (literally, Canaanite [Gr., <em>Kha·na·naiʹos</em>]) woman from the region of Tyre and Zidon (Sidon) who approached Jesus.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010864/91/0" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Matt. 15:22</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010864/92/0" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Mark 7:26</a>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="ss"><strong>COMMERCIAL AND GEOPOLITICAL IMPORTANCE</strong></p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">Canaan formed a land bridge connecting Egypt with Asia and, more particularly, Mesopotamia. Though the economy of the country was basically agricultural, commercial trade was also engaged in and the seaport cities of Tyre and Sidon became major trade centers with fleets of ships that were renowned throughout the then known world. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010864/93/0" data-bid="94-1" class="b">Ezekiel chapter 27</a>.) Thus, as far back as Job’s time, the word “Canaanite” had become synonymous with ‘tradesman’ or ‘merchant’ and is so translated. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010864/94/0" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Job 41:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010864/94/1" data-bid="95-2" class="b"> Zeph. 1:11</a>; note also the reference to Babylon as “the land of Canaan,” <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010864/95/0" data-bid="96-1" class="b">Ezekiel 17:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010864/95/1" data-bid="96-2" class="b"> 12</a>.) Canaan thus occupied a very strategic place in the “Fertile Crescent” and was the target of the great empires of Mesopotamia, Asia Minor and Africa seeking to control military passage and commercial traffic through its confines. God’s placing of his chosen people in this land, therefore, was certain to draw the attention of the nations and have far-reaching effects; in a geographical sense, though more importantly in a religious sense, the Israelites could be said to dwell “in the center of the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010864/96/0" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Ezek. 38:12</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="ss"><strong>LANGUAGE</strong></p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="sb">Although the Bible record clearly shows the Canaanites to be Hamitic, the majority of reference works speak of them as of Semitic origin. This classification is based on the evidence of a Semitic language spoken by the Canaanites. The evidence most frequently appealed to is the large number of texts found at Ras Shamra (Ugarit) written in a Semitic language or dialect and considered to date from as far back as the fourteenth century B.C.E. However, as already stated, Ugarit apparently did not come within the Biblical boundaries of Canaan. An article in <em>The Biblical Archaeologist</em> (Vol. XXVIII, 1965, 4, p. 105) by A. F. Rainey states that on ethnic, political, and, probably, linguistic bases “it is now clearly a misnomer to call Ugarit a ‘Canaanite’ city.” He gives further evidence to show that “Ugarit and the land of Canaan were separate and distinct political entities.” Hence, these tablets provide no clear rule by which to determine the language of the Canaanites.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="sb">Many of the Tell el-Amarna letters found in Egypt do proceed from cities in Canaan proper, and these letters, considered as predating the Israelite conquest, are written mainly in cuneiform Babylonian, a Semitic language. This, however, was the diplomatic language of the entire Near East at that time, so that it was used even when writing to the Egyptian court. Thus, it is of considerable interest to note the statement by Professor Alfred Haldar (writing in <em>The Interpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible,</em> Vol. 1, p. 495) that “the Amarna Letters contain evidence for the opinion that <em>non-Semitic ethnic elements</em> settled in Palestine and Syria at a rather early date, for a number of these letters show <em>a remarkable influence of non-Semitic tongues</em>.” [Italics ours.]</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="sb">The facts are that the <em>original</em> language spoken by the first inhabitants of Canaan is as yet unknown. As the <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em> (1959 ed., Vol. 4, p. 689) states of Canaan, prior to the time of the Tell el-Amarna tablets: “But ancient Canaan is a ‘dumb’ country; there are no inscriptions. This is due to the perishable nature of their writing material. Papyrus, wood and leather disappeared in the wet soil.” So there are no writings available from Canaanite sources for a period of some seven centuries after the Flood by which to determine their original language.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sb">It is true, however, that the Bible account itself appears to show that Abraham and his descendants <span id="page289" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="289" data-before-text="289"></span>were able to converse with the people of Canaan without the need of an interpreter, and it may also be noted that, while some place-names of a non-Semitic type were used, most of the towns and cities captured by the Israelites already bore Semitic names. Still, Philistine kings in Abraham’s time and also, evidently, David’s time, were called “Abimelech” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010864/97/0" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Gen. 20:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010864/97/1" data-bid="98-2" class="b"> 21:32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010864/97/2" data-bid="98-3" class="b"> Psalm 34</a>, superscription), a thoroughly Semitic name (or title), whereas it is nowhere contended that the Philistines were a Semitic race. So, it would appear that the Canaanite tribes, over a period of some centuries from the time of the confusion of tongues at Babel (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010864/98/0" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Gen. 11:8, 9</a>), apparently changed over to a Semitic tongue from their original Hamitic language. This may have been due to their close association with the Aramaic-speaking peoples of Syria, or as a result of Mesopotamian domination for a period of time, or for other reasons not now apparent. Such a change would be no greater than that of other ancient nations, such as the ancient Persians, who, though of Indo-European (Japhetic) stock, later adopted the Semitic Aramaean language and alphabet.</p>

<strong>A Closer Look at the Crocodile</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Visitors to Africa’s rivers, lakes, and swamps often get to see crocodiles, although for the above-​mentioned terrified tourist, the encounter was probably a bit too close. Kenya is home to the Nile crocodile. In the local Swahili language, he is simply known as <em>mamba.</em> Reaching up to 23 feet <strong>[7 m]</strong> in length, crocodiles are reptiles, agile both on land and in water. In water they can attain great speed because of the flattened, paddlelike shape of their tails. They can swim at speeds up to 25 miles an hour <strong>[40 km/​hr]</strong>! And it is not unusual for them to stay underwater for two hours, even three. On land they can run in short, very fast bursts.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Little wonder, then, that the Bible evidently refers to the crocodile as an example of a fear-​inspiring creation of God called Leviathan. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101995206/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 41:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101995206/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 10</a> says: “Put your hand upon [Leviathan]. Remember the battle. Do not do it again. . . . None is so audacious that he should stir it up.” Very wise warnings! According to the book <em>The Fascination of Reptiles,</em> <span id="page18" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>by Maurice Richardson, crocodiles have even been known to attack outboard motorboats! <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101995206/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 41:25</a> appropriately says: “Due to its rising up the strong get frightened; due to consternation they get bewildered.”</p>

<strong>Behemoth and Leviathan—Creative Marvels</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Those small legs are of sturdy build. The bones of the hippo’s legs are as strong as “tubes of copper,” strong enough to support a four-ton creature. Its bones and ribs are like iron bars. “The sinews of its thighs are interwoven,” so that the fiber and tendons of muscles of its thighs are twisted together and braided like powerful cables. Its “power is in its hips,” in the muscles of its back, and “its dynamic energy in the tendons of its belly,” the muscles of its belly being powerful. The hide of the belly is thicker than that on other <span id="page90" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="90" data-before-text="90"></span>parts of the body, since the hippo is short-legged and drags his body over grass, sticks and stones of riverbeds. Its tail is like a cedar, not in length but since it can set its thick tail rigidly upright or swing it about like a tree.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">How the mighty hippo exemplifies God’s power! He created it; he gave it its power. Who can approach such a creature with a sword to take its life? So great is the hippo’s power in its jaw and teeth that it has bitten men clean through the torso. With its recurved canines and pointed incisors, the hippo can shear through a native dugout canoe like cardboard and bite through the metal plates of a riverboat. Little wonder an ancient Egyptian inscription going back to the time of Thutmose III reads: “The hippopotamus, the lord of terrors in the water, which man cannot approach unto.”<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1963087/0">a</a> Concerning this behemoth Jehovah said to Job:</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="si">“The mountains themselves bear their produce for it, and all the wild beasts of the field themselves play there. Under the thorny lotus trees it lies down, in the concealed place of reeds and the swampy place. The thorny lotus trees keep it blocked off with their shadow; the poplars of the torrent valley surround it. If the river acts violently, it does not run in panic. It is confident, although the Jordan should burst forth against its mouth. Before its eyes can anyone take it? With snares can anyone bore its nose?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963087/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 40:20-24</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The mighty behemoth, being amphibious, climbs out of the river, ascending steep riverbanks to enjoy the produce that the mountains bear for it. Yes, “green grass” is its food, and because of its enormous appetite, it seems that the greenery of whole mountains is required to sustain it. The teeth cut the grass and a cavernous mouth scoops up the feed, the jaws crushing the mass. Some 200 to 400 pounds of greenery go into its mammoth stomach every day. Yet when the hippo leaves the water to feed where green grass grows, the other animals have no need to fear, since the monster does not attack them.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">When its appetite has been assuaged, the hippo lies down under the thorny lotus trees or conceals itself in a swampy place, beneath the shade of the poplars. It is of little concern to the hippo if the river in which it dwells rises and overflows its banks. It can still keep its head above the level of water and swim against the force of the deluge.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Seeing the behemoth is so mighty and has a mammoth mouth equipped with formidable tusks in the lower jaw, would Job have the audacity to confront such a monster before its eyes and try to pierce its nose with a hook?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>LEVIATHAN</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Humbled by God’s description of the power of the grass-eating behemoth, Job is next asked about another amphibious creature, which, unlike the hippo, is meat-eating and ferocious in disposition:</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">“Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook, or with a rope can you hold down its tongue? Can you put a rush in its nostrils, or with a thorn can you bore its jaws? Will it make many entreaties to you, or will it say soft words to you? Will it conclude a covenant with you, that you may take it as a slave to time indefinite? Will you play with it as with a bird, or will you tie it for your young girls? Will partners barter for it? Will they divide it up among tradesmen? Will you fill its skin with harpoons, or its head with fish spears? Put your hands upon it. Remember the battle. Do not do it again.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963087/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 41:1-8</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">From the description Jehovah gives of leviathan in the book of Job, it is thought that this creative marvel must be that giant among reptiles, the crocodile. Thus a number of Bible translations of the book of Job such as J. Smith and Moffatt use the word “crocodile” in the main text for the Hebrew word <em>liw-ya-than.</em> The etymology <span id="page91" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="91" data-before-text="91"></span>of this word is uncertain, and it has been variously defined as meaning “a wreathed animal,” “one spirally wound” and “a twisted animal.” The word itself is believed to be nonspecific, so that the term could apply to any such great sea monster or reptile; however, because of the description Jehovah gives in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963087/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job chapter 41</a>, the term there applies to a mighty reptile with armor and scales and formidable teeth.

<strong>Behemoth and Leviathan—Creative Marvels</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">From the description Jehovah gives of leviathan in the book of Job, it is thought that this creative marvel must be that giant among reptiles, the crocodile. Thus a number of Bible translations of the book of Job such as J. Smith and Moffatt use the word “crocodile” in the main text for the Hebrew word <em>liw-ya-than.</em> The etymology <span id="page91" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="91" data-before-text="91"></span>of this word is uncertain, and it has been variously defined as meaning “a wreathed animal,” “one spirally wound” and “a twisted animal.” The word itself is believed to be nonspecific, so that the term could apply to any such great sea monster or reptile; however, because of the description Jehovah gives in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963087/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job chapter 41</a>, the term there applies to a mighty reptile with armor and scales and formidable teeth. The crocodile fits that description.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Though Job may not have seen a crocodile, he would have heard about this creative marvel not only because of his long life but because the Nile River abounded with crocodiles. Job could have heard about the limber leviathan, for his home was not far from the Gulf of Aqaba. From what Job heard about this leviathan monster, he knew that it was far too formidable for him to use it as an object on which to demonstrate fishing ability. Its disposition is wild and fierce, so could Job make leviathan serve him just as his domestic animals did? Or could Job even put leviathan to use as a plaything? Would it cooperate as a plaything for children? Will fishermen take leviathan with their hooks? Will traders bargain over this creature, and will they divide him among merchants? Suppose men lay their hands on this creative marvel that Jehovah evidently describes as the most formidable species of crocodile, then what? The ensuing struggle will be such a terrifying experience they will never forget it nor will they do it again!</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>WHAT, THEN, OF ITS CREATOR?</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">If a fisherman entertains expectations of taking leviathan with his ordinary fishing equipment, he is in for a surprise. Jehovah continues speaking to Job:</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="si">“Look! One’s expectation about it will certainly be disappointed. One will also be hurled down at the mere sight of it. None is so audacious that he should stir it up. And who is it that can hold his ground before me? Who has given me something first, that I ought to reward him? Under the whole heavens it is mine.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963087/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 41:9-11</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The mere sight of a giant crocodile is enough to warn one to stay clear. Hands off! Who, then, is so audacious as to stir leviathan up? Is Job? The temperament of most giant crocodiles, whether the Nile River or the seagoing species, is not suitable for man to get too close to them and then stir them up. Zoo keepers find that some alligators get so tame they can practically walk on them, but they know the wisdom of staying clear of crocodiles. Writes Raymond Ditmars, a noted authority on reptiles, in his book <em>Reptiles of the World:</em></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">“There is about as much difference in temper and activity between an alligator and a crocodile, as between a tortoise and a snapping turtle. An enraged alligator will throw its head from side to side, bang the jaws together sonorously and violently swish the tail, but a man with steady nerves may approach within a few feet of the animal, throw a noose over the head, tie the jaws together, push a pole toward the body—then, by successive nooses pulled backward over the head, and forward over the tail, splint the animal to the pole so it is entirely powerless.”</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Doing that with a crocodile that is formidable and ferocious is something else again, says Ditmars. Even those that appear to be the epitome of good nature are to be treated with utmost respect. Reptile expert Ditmars tells how he approached a captured crocodile that appeared to be rather tame-looking:</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">“Standing away from what he thought to be the reach of his tail, the writer prodded the apparently sluggish brute with a stick to start it for the tank. Several things happened in quick order. With a crescentic twist of the body utterly beyond <span id="page92" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="92" data-before-text="92"></span>the power of an alligator, the brute dashed its tail at the writer, landing him such a powerful blow that he was lifted completely from the ground. As he left <em>terra-firma,</em> an almost involuntary inclination caused him to hurl his body away from a pair of widely-gaping, tooth-studded jaws swinging perilously near. Landing with a thud on one shoulder, though otherwise unhurt, the writer threw himself over and over rolling from the dangerous brute that was actually pursuing him on the run, body raised high from the ground. For an instant it seemed as if the crocodile would win.

<strong>An Exemplary Man Who Accepted Correction</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“ZAMBIA Crocs Eat 30 People a Month.” So reported an African newspaper some years ago. According to a zoologist who caught these reptiles for study, “it took 12 men to hold down one croc.” With a powerful tail and mighty jaws, the crocodile can be a terrifying animal!</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Apparently referring to the crocodile as “Leviathan,” the Creator used this “king over all majestic wild beasts” to teach his servant Job an important lesson. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000205/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 41:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000205/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 34</a>) This took place about 3,500 years ago in the land of Uz, likely somewhere in northern Arabia. While describing this creature, God told Job: “None is so audacious that he should stir it up. And who is it that can hold his ground before me?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000205/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 41:10</a>) How true! If we are afraid of the crocodile, how much more should we fear to speak against the One who created it! Job showed appreciation for this lesson by confessing his error.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000205/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 42:1-6</a>.</p>

<strong>Behemoth and Leviathan—Creative Marvels</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">From the description Jehovah gives of leviathan in the book of Job, it is thought that this creative marvel must be that giant among reptiles, the crocodile. Thus a number of Bible translations of the book of Job such as J. Smith and Moffatt use the word “crocodile” in the main text for the Hebrew word <em>liw-ya-than.</em> The etymology <span id="page91" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="91" data-before-text="91"></span>of this word is uncertain, and it has been variously defined as meaning “a wreathed animal,” “one spirally wound” and “a twisted animal.” The word itself is believed to be nonspecific, so that the term could apply to any such great sea monster or reptile; however, because of the description Jehovah gives in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963087/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job chapter 41</a>, the term there applies to a mighty reptile with armor and scales and formidable teeth. The crocodile fits that description.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Though Job may not have seen a crocodile, he would have heard about this creative marvel not only because of his long life but because the Nile River abounded with crocodiles. Job could have heard about the limber leviathan, for his home was not far from the Gulf of Aqaba. From what Job heard about this leviathan monster, he knew that it was far too formidable for him to use it as an object on which to demonstrate fishing ability. Its disposition is wild and fierce, so could Job make leviathan serve him just as his domestic animals did? Or could Job even put leviathan to use as a plaything? Would it cooperate as a plaything for children? Will fishermen take leviathan with their hooks? Will traders bargain over this creature, and will they divide him among merchants? Suppose men lay their hands on this creative marvel that Jehovah evidently describes as the most formidable species of crocodile, then what? The ensuing struggle will be such a terrifying experience they will never forget it nor will they do it again!</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>WHAT, THEN, OF ITS CREATOR?</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">If a fisherman entertains expectations of taking leviathan with his ordinary fishing equipment, he is in for a surprise. Jehovah continues speaking to Job:</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="si">“Look! One’s expectation about it will certainly be disappointed. One will also be hurled down at the mere sight of it. None is so audacious that he should stir it up. And who is it that can hold his ground before me? Who has given me something first, that I ought to reward him? Under the whole heavens it is mine.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963087/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 41:9-11</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The mere sight of a giant crocodile is enough to warn one to stay clear. Hands off! Who, then, is so audacious as to stir leviathan up? Is Job? The temperament of most giant crocodiles, whether the Nile River or the seagoing species, is not suitable for man to get too close to them and then stir them up. Zoo keepers find that some alligators get so tame they can practically walk on them, but they know the wisdom of staying clear of crocodiles. Writes Raymond Ditmars, a noted authority on reptiles, in his book <em>Reptiles of the World:</em></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">“There is about as much difference in temper and activity between an alligator and a crocodile, as between a tortoise and a snapping turtle. An enraged alligator will throw its head from side to side, bang the jaws together sonorously and violently swish the tail, but a man with steady nerves may approach within a few feet of the animal, throw a noose over the head, tie the jaws together, push a pole toward the body—then, by successive nooses pulled backward over the head, and forward over the tail, splint the animal to the pole so it is entirely powerless.”</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Doing that with a crocodile that is formidable and ferocious is something else again, says Ditmars. Even those that appear to be the epitome of good nature are to be treated with utmost respect. Reptile expert Ditmars tells how he approached a captured crocodile that appeared to be rather tame-looking:</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">“Standing away from what he thought to be the reach of his tail, the writer prodded the apparently sluggish brute with a stick to start it for the tank. Several things happened in quick order. With a crescentic twist of the body utterly beyond <span id="page92" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="92" data-before-text="92"></span>the power of an alligator, the brute dashed its tail at the writer, landing him such a powerful blow that he was lifted completely from the ground. As he left <em>terra-firma,</em> an almost involuntary inclination caused him to hurl his body away from a pair of widely-gaping, tooth-studded jaws swinging perilously near. Landing with a thud on one shoulder, though otherwise unhurt, the writer threw himself over and over rolling from the dangerous brute that was actually pursuing him on the run, body raised high from the ground. For an instant it seemed as if the crocodile would win. As the writer suddenly sprang to his feet and glanced backward, he beheld the brute throw itself flat on its belly, open the jaws widely, then remain motionless as a statue. Such is the average crocodile—an active, vicious and, above all, treacherous brute.”</p>

Furrows of scales are its haughtiness, closed as with a tight seal. One to the other they fit closely, and not even air can come in between them. Each one to the other they are stuck together; they grasp one another and cannot be separated. Its very sneezings flash forth light, and its eyes are like the beams of dawn.

Beautifully narrow and streamlined is the crocodile’s body, but its teeth and jaws are frightful. Its jaws are very extended, and, there being no lips, the teeth, long and pointed and of various sizes, present a frightful sight. What crushing power! In experiments in France a 120-pound crocodile exerted a pressure between its jaws of 1,540 pounds.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Jehovah’s poetic description is most apt; for instance, “its eyes are like the beams of dawn.” Thus the flashing eyes of the crocodile as it lifts its head out of the water at sunrise produced such a strong impression upon the ancient Egyptians that they adopted the crocodile’s eyes as the symbol of morning. “Though in a poetical form,” says one writer about God’s description of leviathan, “it is without exaggeration.” The writer relates the observations of ancient naturalists who beheld the monster rise after a long submergence in the water: “Then the breath, long suppressed, rushes out with such violence that it would seem to vomit out flames from its mouth and nostrils.”<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1963087/1">b</a></p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">Its tightly closed scales are leviathan’s haughtiness; the folds of its flesh make up immovable armor.

Imbedded in the skin are bones, and on these are plates of horn. The bony plates set in the thick, leathery skin furnish an armor that is difficult to pierce with an ordinary bullet, which often ricochets. How useless, then, arrows and darts! Jehovah explains further to Job:</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="si">“Overtaking it, the sword itself does not prove equal, nor spear, dart or arrowhead. It regards iron as mere straw, copper as mere rotten wood. An arrow does not chase it away; the slingstones have been changed for it into mere stubble. A club has been regarded by it as mere stubble, and it laughs at the rattling of a javelin. As pointed earthenware fragments are its under parts; it spreads out a threshing instrument upon the mire. It causes the depths to boil just like a pot; it makes the very sea like an ointment pot. Behind itself it makes a pathway shine; one would regard the watery deep as gray-headedness. Upon the dust there is not the like of it, the one made to be without terror. Everything high it sees. It is king over all majestic wild beasts.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963087/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 41:26-34</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">To this day the warriors of some African tribes use the plated hide of a crocodile as an armor; against javelins and arrows the hide is a protection. Many creatures have a smooth and unprotected belly, but the crocodile’s belly is covered with tough, sharp-edged scales, leaving the impression upon the mud banks of “a threshing instrument.” In the water the voracious fury of the crocodile is the very stuff of which nightmares are made. Leviathan stirs up a frothy foam like the foaming mixture in an ointment pot. The furrow of the crocodile’s foam-shining track through the water is comparable to the grayness of the old ages of humans.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">God’s description of the very sea in turmoil need not limit his words to the oceangoing crocodile, since the Hebrew word <em>yam</em> may refer not only to a sea or a large body of water but sometimes to a large river. But the seagoing crocodile is the <span id="page94" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="94" data-before-text="94"></span>terror of warm seas, the giant of the family and the great traveler of the family. It makes vast excursions from one shore to another, and large ones are often seen from ships when out of sight of land. From the seagoing crocodile’s nonchalant motions, it appears that it is in no danger of tiring or ultimately drowning. On the other hand, sometimes this sea monster goes far inland as a river rover, lying in wait to devour some unwary animal.</p>

<strong>Doorway</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Leviathan, with its double jaw, is represented as having “doors” in its face. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001211/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Job 41:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001211/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 13, 14</a>) The congregator observed that in the case of the aged man “the doors onto the street have been closed,” perhaps to show that the two doors of the mouth no longer open very much or at all to give expression of what is in the house of the body.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001211/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ec 12:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001211/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 4</a>.</p>

<strong>A Closer Look at the Crocodile</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Why do people flee in terror at the sight of this scaly beast? Verse 14 explains one reason: “The doors of its face who has opened? Its teeth round about are frightful.” Each of the crocodile’s jaws, both upper and lower, has up to 24 teeth of various sizes, all being continuously replaced during its lifetime. Interestingly, the crocodile’s fourth tooth of the lower jaw fits outside in a groove in the upper jaw and can easily be seen when the jaws are closed. This helps to distinguish it from its cousin, the alligator. The problem is, if you get too close in making this little dental exam, you could very well find yourself examining <em>all</em> the crocodile’s teeth from the inside!</p>

<strong>Behemoth and Leviathan—Creative Marvels</strong><br/><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="si">“I shall not keep silent about its parts or the matter of its mightiness and the grace of its proportions. Who has uncovered the face of its clothing? Into its double jaw who will enter? The doors of its face who has opened? Its teeth round about are frightful. Furrows of scales are its haughtiness, closed as with a tight seal. One to the other they fit closely, and not even air can come in between them. Each one to the other they are stuck together; they grasp one another and cannot be separated. Its very sneezings flash forth light, and its eyes are like the beams of dawn. Out of its mouth there go lightning flashes, even sparks of fire make their escape. Out of its nostrils smoke goes forth, like a furnace set aflame even with rushes. Its soul itself sets coals ablaze, and even a flame goes forth out of its mouth. <span id="page93" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="93" data-before-text="93"></span>In its neck lodges strength, and before it despair leaps. The folds of its flesh do cling together; they are as a casting upon it, immovable. Its heart is cast like stone, yes, cast like a lower millstone.

Jehovah explains further to Job:</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="si">“Overtaking it, the sword itself does not prove equal, nor spear, dart or arrowhead. It regards iron as mere straw, copper as mere rotten wood. An arrow does not chase it away; the slingstones have been changed for it into mere stubble. A club has been regarded by it as mere stubble, and it laughs at the rattling of a javelin. As pointed earthenware fragments are its under parts; it spreads out a threshing instrument upon the mire. It causes the depths to boil just like a pot; it makes the very sea like an ointment pot. Behind itself it makes a pathway shine; one would regard the watery deep as gray-headedness.

Imbedded in the skin are bones, and on these are plates of horn. The bony plates set in the thick, leathery skin furnish an armor that is difficult to pierce with an ordinary bullet, which often ricochets. How useless, then, arrows and darts! Jehovah explains further to Job:</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="si">“Overtaking it, the sword itself does not prove equal, nor spear, dart or arrowhead. It regards iron as mere straw, copper as mere rotten wood. An arrow does not chase it away; the slingstones have been changed for it into mere stubble. A club has been regarded by it as mere stubble, and it laughs at the rattling of a javelin. As pointed earthenware fragments are its under parts; it spreads out a threshing instrument upon the mire. It causes the depths to boil just like a pot; it makes the very sea like an ointment pot. Behind itself it makes a pathway shine; one would regard the watery deep as gray-headedness.

Sharp scales on a crocodile’s belly leave the impression of “a threshing instrument” on mud banks. Its fury in water stirs up a froth like foaming ointment.

<strong>Behemoth and Leviathan—Creative Marvels</strong><br/><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="si">“I shall not keep silent about its parts or the matter of its mightiness and the grace of its proportions. Who has uncovered the face of its clothing? Into its double jaw who will enter? The doors of its face who has opened? Its teeth round about are frightful.

Beautifully narrow and streamlined is the crocodile’s body, but its teeth and jaws are frightful. Its jaws are very extended, and, there being no lips, the teeth, long and pointed and of various sizes, present a frightful sight. What crushing power! In experiments in France a 120-pound crocodile exerted a pressure between its jaws of 1,540 pounds.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Jehovah’s poetic description is most apt; for instance, “its eyes are like the beams of dawn.” Thus the flashing eyes of the crocodile as it lifts its head out of the water at sunrise produced such a strong impression upon the ancient Egyptians that they adopted the crocodile’s eyes as the symbol of morning. “Though in a poetical form,” says one writer about God’s description of leviathan, “it is without exaggeration.” The writer relates the observations of ancient naturalists who beheld the monster rise after a long submergence in the water: “Then the breath, long suppressed, rushes out with such violence that it would seem to vomit out flames from its mouth and nostrils.”<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1963087/1">b</a></p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">Its tightly closed scales are leviathan’s haughtiness; the folds of its flesh make up immovable armor. The true scales of this creative marvel are no more easily removed than human fingernails. What a masterpiece is the crocodile’s rough covering of plate and mail! Imbedded in the skin are bones, and on these are plates of horn. The bony plates set in the thick, leathery skin furnish an armor that is difficult to pierce with an ordinary bullet, which often ricochets. How useless, then, arrows and darts! Jehovah explains further to Job:</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="si">“Overtaking it, the sword itself does not prove equal, nor spear, dart or arrowhead. It regards iron as mere straw, copper as mere rotten wood. An arrow does not chase it away; the slingstones have been changed for it into mere stubble. A club has been regarded by it as mere stubble, and it laughs at the rattling of a javelin. As pointed earthenware fragments are its under parts; it spreads out a threshing instrument upon the mire. It causes the depths to boil just like a pot; it makes the very sea like an ointment pot. Behind itself it makes a pathway shine; one would regard the watery deep as gray-headedness. Upon the dust there is not the like of it, the one made to be without terror. Everything high it sees. It is king over all majestic wild beasts.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963087/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 41:26-34</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">To this day the warriors of some African tribes use the plated hide of a crocodile as an armor; against javelins and arrows the hide is a protection. Many creatures have a smooth and unprotected belly, but the crocodile’s belly is covered with tough, sharp-edged scales, leaving the impression upon the mud banks of “a threshing instrument.” In the water the voracious fury of the crocodile is the very stuff of which nightmares are made. Leviathan stirs up a frothy foam like the foaming mixture in an ointment pot. The furrow of the crocodile’s foam-shining track through the water is comparable to the grayness of the old ages of humans.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">God’s description of the very sea in turmoil need not limit his words to the oceangoing crocodile, since the Hebrew word <em>yam</em> may refer not only to a sea or a large body of water but sometimes to a large river. But the seagoing crocodile is the <span id="page94" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="94" data-before-text="94"></span>terror of warm seas, the giant of the family and the great traveler of the family. It makes vast excursions from one shore to another, and large ones are often seen from ships when out of sight of land. From the seagoing crocodile’s nonchalant motions, it appears that it is in no danger of tiring or ultimately drowning. On the other hand, sometimes this sea monster goes far inland as a river rover, lying in wait to devour some unwary animal.</p>

Some may reach a length of 20 feet <strong>[6 m]</strong> and may weigh as much as 2,000 pounds <strong>[900 kg]</strong>. The strength of their jaws is stunning—even a relatively small crocodile weighing 100 pounds <strong>[50 kg]</strong> is able to exert a force equal to over 1,500 pounds <strong>[700 kg]</strong>. When a crocodile surfaces after a period of submersion, the rapid exhalation of air through its nostrils can produce a spray that in the glare of the morning sun may well be the ‘flash of light’ and the ‘going forth of smoke out of its nostrils’ that the book of Job describes.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101996165/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 41:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101996165/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 18-21</a>.</p>

It regards iron as mere straw, copper as mere rotten wood. An arrow does not chase it away; the slingstones have been changed for it into mere stubble. A club has been regarded by it as mere stubble, and it laughs at the rattling of a javelin. As pointed earthenware fragments are its under parts; it spreads out a threshing instrument upon the mire. It causes the depths to boil just like a pot; it makes the very sea like an ointment pot. Behind itself it makes a pathway shine; one would regard the watery deep as gray-headedness. Upon the dust there is not the like of it, the one made to be without terror. Everything high it sees. It is king over all majestic wild beasts.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963087/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 41:26-34</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">To this day the warriors of some African tribes use the plated hide of a crocodile as an armor; against javelins and arrows the hide is a protection. Many creatures have a smooth and unprotected belly, but the crocodile’s belly is covered with tough, sharp-edged scales, leaving the impression upon the mud banks of “a threshing instrument.” In the water the voracious fury of the crocodile is the very stuff of which nightmares are made.

Naturalist R. L. Ditmars observes: “Against javelins and arrows the hide is undoubtedly invulnerable.” (<em>Reptiles of the World,</em> 22nd printing, p. 16) Although not bulletproof, the plates, if struck obliquely, will often cause the bullet to ricochet. (<em>Library of Natural History,</em> Vol. V, p. 2381) Just what is the makeup of the crocodile’s hide?</p>

<strong>Behemoth and Leviathan—Creative Marvels</strong><br/><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="si">“I shall not keep silent about its parts or the matter of its mightiness and the grace of its proportions. Who has uncovered the face of its clothing? Into its double jaw who will enter? The doors of its face who has opened? Its teeth round about are frightful.

Each one to the other they are stuck together; they grasp one another and cannot be separated. Its very sneezings flash forth light, and its eyes are like the beams of dawn.

Beautifully narrow and streamlined is the crocodile’s body, but its teeth and jaws are frightful. Its jaws are very extended, and, there being no lips, the teeth, long and pointed and of various sizes, present a frightful sight. What crushing power! In experiments in France a 120-pound crocodile exerted a pressure between its jaws of 1,540 pounds.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Jehovah’s poetic description is most apt; for instance, “its eyes are like the beams of dawn.” Thus the flashing eyes of the crocodile as it lifts its head out of the water at sunrise produced such a strong impression upon the ancient Egyptians that they adopted the crocodile’s eyes as the symbol of morning. “Though in a poetical form,” says one writer about God’s description of leviathan, “it is without exaggeration.” The writer relates the observations of ancient naturalists who beheld the monster rise after a long submergence in the water: “Then the breath, long suppressed, rushes out with such violence that it would seem to vomit out flames from its mouth and nostrils.”<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1963087/1">b</a></p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">Its tightly closed scales are leviathan’s haughtiness; the folds of its flesh make up immovable armor.

Imbedded in the skin are bones, and on these are plates of horn. The bony plates set in the thick, leathery skin furnish an armor that is difficult to pierce with an ordinary bullet, which often ricochets. How useless, then, arrows and darts! Jehovah explains further to Job:</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="si">“Overtaking it, the sword itself does not prove equal, nor spear, dart or arrowhead. It regards iron as mere straw, copper as mere rotten wood. An arrow does not chase it away; the slingstones have been changed for it into mere stubble. A club has been regarded by it as mere stubble, and it laughs at the rattling of a javelin. As pointed earthenware fragments are its under parts; it spreads out a threshing instrument upon the mire. It causes the depths to boil just like a pot; it makes the very sea like an ointment pot. Behind itself it makes a pathway shine; one would regard the watery deep as gray-headedness. Upon the dust there is not the like of it, the one made to be without terror. Everything high it sees.

Many creatures have a smooth and unprotected belly, but the crocodile’s belly is covered with tough, sharp-edged scales, leaving the impression upon the mud banks of “a threshing instrument.” In the water the voracious fury of the crocodile is the very stuff of which nightmares are made.

<strong>Letters</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In addition to papyrus, materials employed for letter writing in ancient times included ostraca (small pieces of broken pottery or earthenware) and clay tablets. (See ARCHAEOLOGY, pages 110, 111.) Thousands of clay tablets have been found in Babylonia and other regions. Washed and cleaned, smooth clay was made <span id="page1057" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1057" data-before-text="1057"></span>into a tablet and, while still wet, it was imprinted by means of a stylus forming wedge-shaped (cuneiform) characters. These tablets were often enclosed in clay envelopes. In the case of contracts, the text was sometimes repeated on the envelope. The envelopes were sealed and then baked in a kiln or dried in the sun to make them hard and durable.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Letter writing was often done by professional scribes. As in the Persian court, such scribes were usually on hand to take down official government correspondence. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012667/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Esther 8:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012667/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Ezra 4:8</a>) Scribes were also to be found in the marketplaces near city gates, where they could be engaged by the populace to write letters and to record business transactions.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Letters were sometimes delivered by messengers (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012667/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Ki. 19:14</a>), runners (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012667/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Chron. 30:6</a>), or couriers.

Earlier Job gave too much attention to himself and others. But accepting the correction implicit in God’s questions, Job changed his thinking. He confessed: “I have come to know that you [Jehovah] are able to do all things, and there is no idea that is unattainable for you. ‘Who is this that is obscuring counsel without knowledge?’ Therefore I talked, but I was not understanding things too wonderful for me, which I do not know.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001281/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Job 42:2, 3</a>) Yes, after giving attention to God’s works, Job said that these things were too wonderful for him. After reviewing these creative marvels, we should likewise be impressed with God’s wisdom and power. To what end? Is it simply a matter of being impressed with Jehovah’s enormous power and ability? Or should we be moved beyond that?</p>

<strong>Behemoth and Leviathan—Creative Marvels</strong><br/><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">God’s description of the very sea in turmoil need not limit his words to the oceangoing crocodile, since the Hebrew word <em>yam</em> may refer not only to a sea or a large body of water but sometimes to a large river.

It makes vast excursions from one shore to another, and large ones are often seen from ships when out of sight of land.

<strong>Jesus Christ</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The disciples ‘seeing’ the Father in Jesus can also be understood in the light of other Scriptural examples. Jacob, for instance, said to Esau: “I have seen your face as though seeing God’s face in that you received me with pleasure.” He said this because Esau’s reaction had been in harmony with Jacob’s prayer to God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/78/0" data-bid="79-1" class="b">Ge 33:9-11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/78/1" data-bid="79-2" class="b"> 32:9-12</a>) After God’s interrogation of Job out of a windstorm had clarified that man’s understanding, Job said: “In hearsay I have heard about you, but now my own eye does see you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/79/0" data-bid="80-1" class="b">Job 38:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/79/1" data-bid="80-2" class="b"> 42:5</a>; see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/80/0" data-bid="81-1" class="b">Jg 13:21, 22</a>.) The ‘eyes of his heart’ had been enlightened. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/81/0" data-bid="82-1" class="b">Eph 1:18</a>.) That Jesus’ statement about seeing the Father was meant to be understood figuratively and not literally is evident from his own statement at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/82/0" data-bid="83-1" class="b">John 6:45</a> as well as from the fact that John, long after Jesus’ death, wrote: “No man has seen God at any time; the only-begotten god who is in the bosom position with the Father is the one that has explained him.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/83/0" data-bid="84-1" class="b">Joh 1:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002451/83/1" data-bid="84-2" class="b"> 1Jo 4:12</a>.</p>

<strong>Presence</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Some, on the basis of texts speaking of Jesus’ being seen “coming in clouds with great power and glory” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Mr 13:26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> Re 1:7</a>), conclude that his presence must be a visible one. Yet, as shown under the heading <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/1">CLOUD</a> (Illustrative Usage), the use of clouds in connection with other divine manifestations suggests invisibility rather than visibility. So, too, ‘seeing’ can refer to figurative sight, perception with the mind and heart. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Isa 44:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Jer 5:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/29/2" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> Eze 12:2, 3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/29/3" data-bid="30-4" class="b"> Mt 13:13-16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/29/4" data-bid="30-5" class="b"> Eph 1:17, 18</a>) To deny this would be to deny that the opposite of sight, namely, blindness, could be used in a figurative or spiritual, rather than literal, sense. Yet Jesus clearly used both sight and blindness in such a figurative or spiritual sense. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Joh 9:39-41;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> Re 3:14-18</a>; compare also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">2Co 4:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/31/1" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 2Pe 1:9</a>.) Job, being spoken to by Jehovah “out of the windstorm” (likely accompanied by clouds), afterward said: “In hearsay I have heard about you, but now my own eye does see you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Job 38:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/32/1" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> 42:5</a>) This, too, must have been by perception of mind and heart rather than the literal eye, in view of the clear Scriptural teaching that “no man has seen God at any time.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Joh 1:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/33/1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 5:37;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/33/2" data-bid="34-3" class="b"> 6:46;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003548/33/3" data-bid="34-4" class="b"> 1Jo 4:12</a>.</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006205/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Job 19:26</a>) This adjusted his thinking.

<strong>Build Trust in Jehovah—By Diligently Studying His Word</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Job was one “fearing God and turning aside from bad.” But after Jehovah further revealed himself in a windstorm, Job could say: “In hearsay I have heard about you, but now my own eye does see you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988603/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 1:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988603/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 42:5</a>) Can we today “see” God, that is, go beyond mere acquaintance, intimately know the many facets of his personality? Indeed we can! Through the pages of the Bible, Jehovah has revealed more of himself than was known even to Job.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204407/1073/0">12/1/1966, pp. 710-711</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>“Happy Are the Pure in Heart, Since They Will See God”</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The apostle John, therefore, wrote, at the beginning of his Gospel: “No man has seen God at any time; the only-begotten god [Jesus Christ] who is in the bosom <span id="page711" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="711" data-before-text="711"></span>position with the Father is the one that has explained him.” In fact, it would be impossible for any human to see God and survive, because, as Jehovah himself told Moses when Moses asked to see God’s face: “No man may see me and yet live.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966881/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 1:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966881/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Ex. 33:20</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">But there are and will be some, a comparatively small number with pure hearts, that will literally see God. Who are they? They are the ones the apostle John saw standing upon heavenly Mount Zion, the 144,000 redeemed from the earth, who will share heavenly glory with their Lord Jesus Christ.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966881/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rev. 14:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966881/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 20:4</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Why will it be possible for these to see God? Because they will have spirit bodies, having been raised from the dead “changed,” for “flesh and blood cannot inherit God’s kingdom, neither does corruption inherit incorruption.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966881/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:50, 51</a>) These will have a share in what the Scriptures term “the first resurrection,” concerning which we further read: “It is sown a physical body, it is raised up a spiritual body. . . . For this which is corruptible must put on incorruption, and this which is mortal must put on immortality.” Sharing heavenly glory with Jesus Christ as incorruptible, immortal spirits, these will indeed be able to see Jehovah God literally and yet live.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966881/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Rev. 20:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966881/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 15:44,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966881/13/2" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 53</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>SEEING GOD FIGURATIVELY</strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">However, while the promise of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966881/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matthew 5:8</a> about the pure in heart seeing God has its primary and literal application to those belonging to the anointed Christian congregation against whom the gates of Haʹdes will not prevail, there might be said to be a principle stated in Jesus’ words that has a wider application. Thus, for example, after Jehovah God had given Job a lesson on how great Jehovah is compared with puny and tiny man, Job exclaimed: “I have heard about you, but now my own eye does see you.” Not with his literal eye but with his eye of understanding, his eye of faith and appreciation, Job could now look at God’s work and God’s dealings with him and see God as he had not been able to see him before.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966881/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Job 42:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966881/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Matt. 16:18</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Thus even to those pure in heart whose eternal destiny is life on earth God reveals himself in both his written Word and his book of the visible creation. Because of having pure hearts of faith these, like the prophet Moses, are able to continue “steadfast as seeing the One who is invisible.” And soon, in the coming system of things, these will see more evidence all about them that God exists and that he is indeed the kind of God the Bible shows him to be, infinite in wisdom and power, perfect in justice and the very personification of love.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966881/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Heb. 11:27</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">However, we should not conclude that the happiness of the pure in heart is limited to seeing God, either literally or figuratively. Jesus does not say that; he merely implies that that is its chief reward. But there are other blessings that come to the pure in heart even now. Being pure in heart gives one peace of mind and a clear conscience. It makes for contentment. It also works for peaceful relations with Jehovah God and with one’s neighbors, be they the people living next door, one’s fellow employees or one’s fellow worshipers in the Christian congregation. And surely all this is added reason for striving to be among those who are “pure in heart.”</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The hard consequences of the unscriptural divorce bear just as heavily upon the divorcer as upon the divorcee. Therefore the hard consequences of an unscriptural divorce should stand as a warning to any prospective divorcer so that he will consider first the limitations and restrictions and dangers that would result from his unscriptural course to his own self as well as to his innocent marriage mate. It is not the prerogative or obligation of the Christian congregation to relieve the divorced couple of the hard consequences of their unscriptural divorce. In its tendency toward mercy the Christian congregation must not go beyond what is written in God’s Word and attempt a reversal of the situation by doing something that it is not authorized to do. A man that forces an unscriptural divorce through becomes very responsible toward the innocent, undeserving mate inasmuch as he makes the post-divorce life and course of her very hard with respect to morality. If the innocent divorcee goes <span id="page96" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="96" data-before-text="96"></span>bad, the Christian congregation is not primarily responsible for not sanctioning her remarriage before the death or post-divorce adultery of her ex-husband. The self-seeking divorcer is the responsible one, according to the Scriptures. All that the Christian congregation can do legitimately is to help her to grow straight morally as a Christian by extending to her all the spiritual help possible.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Because of his adultery, unrepented of before the divorce, the unfaithful husband could be disfellowshiped by the Christian congregation of which he may be a baptized member. By concealing his adultery from wife and congregation he may postpone his disfellowshipment for a time. If in addition to his concealed adultery he undertakes to divorce his innocent wife, then he shows that he has not repented of his adultery. Neither does he have his wife’s forgiveness for it. Hence he must be disfellowshiped by the congregation when the facts of the matter become known. To the wrong that he has committed against his wife by the adultery that he has concealed from her he hardheartedly adds injury by suing for divorce from her in her innocence. For his moral uncleanness, of which his hypocritical, unloving course shows he has not repented, he must be disfellowshiped from the Christian congregation on the basis of the evidence laid before the congregation’s judicial committee.</p>

In the <em>King James Version</em> it reads the opposite of the way it does in the <em>American Standard Version;</em> the one saying, “Yet in my flesh shall I see God,” and the other, “Then without my flesh shall I see God.”—J.G., U.S.A.</strong></p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The <em>New World Translation</em> of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961090/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 19:26</a> reads: “Yet reduced in my flesh I shall behold God.” Under footnote b it gives two alternate renderings: “Yet out of my flesh,” and, “Yet apart from my flesh.” The <em>American Standard Version,</em> which reads “without my flesh,” has a footnote reading, “Yet from my flesh shall I see God.”</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Why these differences in translations and the presence of the footnotes? These are no doubt due to the ambiguity of the Hebrew text. However, the thought seems to be that Job, when so wasted away as to be merely skin and bones, and thus practically “without flesh,” or “reduced in my flesh,” would “see” God. Job cannot be accused of here speaking ill-advisedly, as some would have it, but rather prophetically. He himself did later “see” God by seeing the manifestation of his power, by hearing his voice by means of the Word or Logos, and by having the eyes of his understanding opened to see the truth about God. Because of this he could say: “In hearsay I have heard about you, but now my own eye does see you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961090/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 42:5</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Not that faithful Job himself literally saw Jehovah God, for God plainly told Moses: “You are not able to see my face, because no man may see me and yet live.” The apostle John testified to the same effect, saying: “No man has seen God at any time.” “At no time has anyone beheld God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961090/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ex. 33:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961090/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> John 1:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961090/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 1 John 4:12</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Behemoth and Leviathan—Creative Marvels</strong><br/><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">God’s description of the very sea in turmoil need not limit his words to the oceangoing crocodile, since the Hebrew word <em>yam</em> may refer not only to a sea or a large body of water but sometimes to a large river. But the seagoing crocodile is the <span id="page94" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="94" data-before-text="94"></span>terror of warm seas, the giant of the family and the great traveler of the family. It makes vast excursions from one shore to another, and large ones are often seen from ships when out of sight of land. From the seagoing crocodile’s nonchalant motions, it appears that it is in no danger of tiring or ultimately drowning. On the other hand, sometimes this sea monster goes far inland as a river rover, lying in wait to devour some unwary animal.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">Because of its size, armor and offensive weapons at both ends, the crocodile is king of reptiles. The dangerous cobra? Just a tasty snack, an appetizer for the crocodile. It has no natural enemies in the wild state and knows no terror. After this description of leviathan, Job says to Jehovah:</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="si">“I have come to know that you are able to do all things, and there is no idea that is unattainable for you. ‘Who is this that is obscuring counsel without knowledge?’ Therefore I talked, but I was not understanding things too wonderful for me, which I do not know.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963087/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 42:2, 3</a>.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">Job declares God can do all things; he realizes now that whatever God does is wise, loving and just. He repeats the very question Jehovah had asked at the beginning of the series of questions about creative marvels; Job does this to admit the justice of the rebuke implied by it and to admit, ‘I was the man!’</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">Job had said some things he should not have uttered; but now he confesses he had argued his case without understanding. “I make a retraction,” he said, “and I do repent in dust and ashes.” As Job did, we should take this lesson to heart. Lest we find ourselves contending against God, we should think hard before we let the outward appearance of our circumstances induce us to believe or declare that God is directly responsible for our sufferings. Behold behemoth and leviathan! They and other creative marvels should impress us with God’s great wisdom and power, adding force to the inspired words: “As for the Almighty, we have not found him out; he is exalted in power, and justice and abundance of righteousness he will not belittle. Therefore let men fear him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963087/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 42:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963087/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 37:23, 24</a>.</p>

<strong>Job’s Integrity Is Rewarded</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">First, Jehovah reproved Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. Addressing Eliphaz, evidently the eldest, he said: “My anger has grown hot against you and your two companions, for you men have not spoken concerning me what is truthful as has my servant Job. And now take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job, and you men must offer up a burnt sacrifice in your own behalf; and Job my servant will himself pray for you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998323/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 42:7, 8</a>) Think of what this implied!</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Jehovah required a considerable sacrifice from Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, perhaps to impress upon them the gravity of their sin. Indeed, either wittingly or unwittingly, they had blasphemed God by saying that he ‘has no faith in his servants’ and that it did not really matter to him whether Job was faithful or not. Eliphaz even said that in God’s eyes Job was of no more value than a moth! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998323/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 4:18, 19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998323/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 22:2, 3</a>) No wonder Jehovah said: “You men have not spoken concerning me what is truthful”!</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">But that is not all. Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar also sinned against Job personally by telling him that his problems were of his own making. Their baseless accusations and utter lack of empathy left Job embittered and depressed, causing him to cry out: “How long will you men keep irritating my soul and keep crushing me with words?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998323/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 10:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998323/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 19:2</a>) Imagine the expressions of shame on the faces of these three men as they now had to present Job with an offering for <em>their</em> sins!</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">But Job was not to gloat over their humiliation. Indeed, Jehovah required that he pray in behalf of his accusers. Job did just as he was instructed, and for this he was blessed. First, Jehovah cured his dreaded disease. Then, Job’s brothers, sisters, and former associates came to comfort him, “and they proceeded each one to give him a piece of money and each one a gold ring.”<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1998323/0">a</a> Moreover, Job “came to have fourteen thousand sheep and six thousand camels and a thousand spans of cattle and a thousand she-asses.”<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1998323/1">b</a> And Job’s wife was evidently reconciled with him. In time, Job was blessed with seven sons and three daughters, and he lived to see four generations of his offspring.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998323/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 42:10-17</a>.</p>

<strong>A Lesson in How to Handle Problems</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">His three companions further disheartened Job by voicing personal ideas rather than godly wisdom. Eliphaz went so far as to say that ‘God has no faith in his servants’ and that it did not really matter to Jehovah whether Job was righteous or not. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995126/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 4:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995126/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 22:2, 3</a>) It is hard to imagine a more discouraging​—or more untruthful—​remark than that! Not surprisingly, Jehovah later rebuked Eliphaz and his companions for this blasphemy. “You men have not <span id="page28" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>spoken concerning me what is truthful,” he said. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995126/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 42:7</a>) But the most damaging assertion was yet to come.</p>

By way of illustration, Job’s companion Eliphaz wrongly charged God: “In <span id="page147" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="147" data-before-text="147"></span>his holy ones he has no faith, and the heavens themselves are actually not clean in his eyes.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975163/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Job 15:15</a>) Jehovah God later reproved Eliphaz and his companions for their misrepresentations. Eliphaz was told: “My anger has grown hot against you and your two companions, for you men have not spoken concerning me what is truthful as has my servant Job.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975163/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Job 42:7</a>) While Eliphaz and his companions obviously were not inspired of God, the writer of the book of Job was guided by God’s spirit in making an accurate record of their statements. This record serves to identify and expose wrong reasoning about God’s permission of wickedness. Therefore, <em>as a whole</em> it is God’s inspired word or message. Nevertheless, this shows that we must exercise care when quoting certain portions from the Bible. If taken out of their proper setting, out of context, something that is in reality the view of imperfect men can be wrongly attributed to God.</p>

<strong>Divine Rulership—Over Mankind at the Start</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> In the case of Job, Jehovah God won out over Satan, for Satan proved to be a liar. How so? As Satan brought trials upon Job, we read, “in all this Job did not sin or ascribe anything improper to God.” When the state of Job seemed desperate and his wife gave up hope concerning him, she said to him: “Are you yet holding fast your integrity? Curse God and die!” But Job said to her: “As one of the senseless women speaks, you speak also. Shall we accept merely what is good from the true God and not accept also what is bad?” Hence the record says: “In all this Job did not sin with his lips.” Finally, before Jehovah reversed the situation for Job, he said to three hypocritical critics of Job: “My anger has grown hot against you and your two companions, for you men have not spoken concerning me what is truthful as has my servant Job.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972801/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 1:1-22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972801/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2:9, 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972801/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 42:7, 8</a>) This, in effect, proved to be a rebuke to Satan, and he was exposed as a slanderer or Devil.</p>

<strong>Jehovah’s Witnesses Endure for His Sovereign Godship</strong><br/><p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[72]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Now a special Job-like time of testing came upon the few thousand anointed ones from the autumn of 1914 to the spring of 1919. A period of Babylon-like captivity came to be forced upon them. Ridicule was heaped upon them by the clergy. During World War I they were slanderously branded as “security risks.” This brought governmental opposition <span id="page559" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="559" data-before-text="559"></span>upon them in Canada, the United States and other countries. Their publications became subject to ban. Those taking the lead among them came to be imprisoned. Finally their organized public witness work was crippled by the summer of 1918. Their headquarters in Brooklyn, New York, had to be shut down, with temporary offices maintained back in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Places of their religious meetings were raided and closed. Yes, a spiritually destitute, forsaken condition came upon them. To the faithful anointed ones questions came as to what all this meant and why Jehovah was permitting all this open hostility. Had they not in the name of God and Christ been undertaking a great public witness work among the nations in the thirty-some years before 1914? Did not Jehovah seem to favor that work by granting it continued growth before 1914? The Job-like ones wanted to know: Why now all this adversity and hostility?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966682/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Matt. 24:9, 10</a>.</p><p id="p73" data-pid="73" class="qu">18.

All together, it was a time of destitution as to “spiritual children” and means for religious worship. Considered by the sectarian clergy as outcasts and spiritually diseased ones who were to be loathed and shunned, the anointed ones were left by 1918 to ponder their sad spiritual state, present and future. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966682/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Rev. 11:7-10</a>) A state of spiritual unhappiness had been enforced upon them by Satan and all his earthly forces.

Unloving in their thinking and hearts, the religious leaders put to use all their Babylonish tactics and arguments. They pretended to worship the God of the Bible but in fact were out “to pronounce God wicked.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966682/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Job 32:3</a>) Jehovah God found them untruthful in their arguments and attacks, whereas the anointed ones were found to be truthful.

From 325 C.E. to the present, Christendom’s clergy have been the most powerful part of Babylon the Great. They have been and are now the worst persecutors of Jehovah’s witnesses. These modern ‘three false comforters’ in their bitterness will continue to be, figuratively speaking, ‘after the hide’ and ‘on the necks’ of the true witnesses right down to the very ruinous end of Babylon the Great.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="ss"><strong>DELIVERANCE INTO SPIRITUAL PROSPERITY</strong></p><p id="p75" data-pid="75" class="qu">20.

To add to their joy, a vast crowd of sheeplike persons has been directed to flee from Babylon the Great and to come over into their realm of spiritual favor.

<strong>Jehovah Taunted by Babylonish Hostility Against Anointed Witnesses</strong><br/><p id="p77" data-pid="77" data-rel-pid="[120]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="29"><sup>29</sup></span> The exchanges just presented have set forth the striking parallels between the Job drama of old and the drama on the worldwide stage today revolving around Jehovah’s witnesses. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966683/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">1 Cor. 4:9</a>) In each case the Babylonized agents of Satan have had to resort to lies, half-truths, concealment of facts, slander, emotionalism, astrology and have argued from plain ignorance of the Bible. On the other hand, Job-like witnesses have responded with truth, restraint, Christian love, setting forth of Scripture, adhering to facts and reasoned from a position of a thorough and accurate knowledge of the Scriptures, always championing the truth of the Bible <span id="page570" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="570" data-before-text="570"></span>and the Sovereign Godship of Jehovah. Now it can be appreciated why many of the clergy sympathetically claim to understand and quote from the arguments of Job’s adversaries rather than those presented by Job himself. One authority says: “The words of his [Job’s] friends . . . are more acceptable than many of the rasher utterances of Job.”<a id="footnotesource19" data-fnid="19" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966683/18">g</a></p><p id="p78" data-pid="78" data-rel-pid="[120]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"><sup>30</sup></span> It has now been clearly shown that those of Babylonish thinking can only understand the <em>sibboleth</em> of apostasy and, therefore, such sectarians can never appreciate the <em>shibboleth</em> sayings of the true worship of Jehovah as anciently championed by Job, then by Jesus Christ and his apostles and now by Jehovah’s modern witnesses. Though taunted for ages by Satan and his Babylonized agents, the true God Jehovah has been vindicated by his true servants on earth. Jehovah himself has shown which side has proved to be right. To the modern sectarian apostates Jehovah says: “My anger has grown hot against you . . . for you men have not spoken concerning me what is truthful as has my servant Job.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966683/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Job 42:7</a>) Happy are Jehovah’s anointed ones today who in their Job-like restoration since 1919 continue to endure Babylonish hostility directed against them as they faithfully support Jehovah’s Sovereign Godship as the Grand King of Eternity. “Now to the King of Eternity, incorruptible, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever.

Deep down in Job’s heart this jabbing, testing process occurred, with questions and answers flowing from him. “If I have sinned, what can I accomplish against you, the Observer of mankind? Why is it that you have set me as your target, so that I should become a burden to you?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/70/0" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Job 7:20</a>) “I myself well know that my redeemer is alive.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/71/0" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Job 19:25</a>) “O that I had someone listening to me, that according to my signature the Almighty himself would answer me!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/72/0" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Job 31:35</a>) Yes, by means of this long duel under the permitted hand of Satan through his earthly dupes, Job was tested to the very core of his heart, yet his heart proved to be true, clean, full of hope and trusting in God.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="ss"><strong>ELIHU’S ASSESSMENT</strong></p><p id="p74" data-pid="74" class="qu">23.

Also, against his three companions his anger blazed over the fact that they had not found an answer but they proceeded to pronounce God wicked.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/73/0" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Job 32:2, 3</a>) So on the issue of Godship the three false comforters proved to have utterly failed, whereas Job had become sidetracked upon himself although never failing in his integrity to the true God. Then the drama ends with the tremendous display of wisdom from the true God by his speaking out of the windstorm. There Jehovah demonstrated his overwhelming Godship by referring to creation’s marvels and to natural things pertaining to the earth far too wonderful to be grasped by the mind of mortal man. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/74/0" data-bid="75-1" class="b">Job, chapters 38-41</a>) To this amazing shower of heavenly wisdom, Job’s clean heart quickly responds: “I have come to know that you are able to do all things, and there is no idea that is unattainable for you. That is why I make a retraction, and I do repent in dust and ashes.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/75/0" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Job 42:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/75/1" data-bid="76-2" class="b"> 6</a>.</p><p id="p75" data-pid="75" class="qu">24, 25.

And now take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job, and you men must offer up a burnt sacrifice in your own behalf; and Job my servant will himself pray for you. His face only I shall accept so as not to commit disgraceful folly with you, for you have not spoken concerning me what is <em>truthful,</em> as has my servant Job.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/76/0" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Job 42:7, 8</a>) Thus the apostate religion of these Babylonized wise men became exposed by Jehovah himself, twice declaring them as ‘not truthful.’ Their so-called wisdom turned out to be foolishness. Satan miserably lost the contest resulting from his challenge. The three “companions” had to make a climb-down, reform themselves and submit their lives to the priesthood services of Job by accepting the true religion. As to Job personally, “Jehovah himself turned back the captive condition of Job” and blessed him with twice the material wealth <span id="page529" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="529" data-before-text="529"></span>he had lost at the beginning.

When you read that an innocent man spent years in prison for the offense of another, do you wonder why such injustices occur? What do you think when an upright, God-fearing Christian writhes with the pain of incurable cancer, while his loose-living, unprincipled neighbor prospers and enjoys excellent health? Does it cause you to wonder why the righteous suffer?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Some feel that a righteous person should be rewarded with freedom from suffering, that suffering is an evidence of one’s having committed unrighteous acts. That was the argument used by the three supposed friends of Job when they came to comfort him. Job was suffering indescribably from disease and pain. He had lost all his material possessions, including his ten lovely children. His brothers and intimate acquaintances, who had held him in high esteem, detested his very presence. Even his wife turned away from him and recommended that he curse God and die.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job, chaps. 1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Job 19:13-19</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">After Job’s three visitors had silently observed his excruciating pain and extreme humiliation for seven days and nights, finally one of them spoke, not comfortingly or sympathetically, but with stinging, cutting words that accused Job of unrighteous acts for which he was now suffering punishment. “Remember, please,” said Eliphaz: “Who that is innocent has ever perished? And where have the upright ever been effaced? According to what I have seen, those devising what is hurtful and those sowing trouble will themselves reap it. Through the breath of God they perish, and through the spirit of his anger they come to an end.” Yes, contended Eliphaz, God is punishing you for your sins, Job. That is why you are suffering.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 4:7-9</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Have you not heard people, even clergymen, use the same argument: that calamities are acts of God to punish people for their sins? However, the charge against Job was false. God was not punishing him because of some unrighteous acts he had committed. Job was righteous. That is why Jehovah said to Eliphaz the Temanite: “My anger has grown hot against you and your two companions, for you men have not spoken concerning me what is truthful as has my servant Job.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 42:7</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>GOD NOT TO BLAME</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Today human suffering is observed on every hand.

Unlike Job, who “did not sin or ascribe unseemliness to God,” many become embittered and blame God. This was especially true during World War II when bombs rained from the sky, spreading death and suffering to both good people and bad. Yet when men break God’s laws by hating and warring against one another, can they properly blame Him when suffering results? If a parent warns his children that they should not fight among themselves and they disregard the good counsel and assault one another with sticks and stones, is the parent responsible if bruises and injuries are suffered? He is no more responsible than God is for human suffering when people disregard his laws.</p>

Of course not.<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/502019376/2">c</a> However, there was a vast difference between Job and his accusers. Job was brokenhearted, racked with grief, and stung by false accusations. Thus, it is understandable that he would speak rashly at times. However, Eliphaz and his two friends did not bear such burdens. Weak in their own faith, they spoke deliberately and arrogantly. Not only did they attack an innocent man, but worse, they misrepresented Jehovah himself, in effect painting him as a harsh, even wicked, God!</p>

He was deeply hurt when his “friends”​—Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar—​hurled baseless accusations at him.

<strong>Do You Remember?</strong><br/>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">◻ <strong>What lesson can we learn from Jehovah’s requiring Job to pray for those who transgressed against him? (</strong><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998609/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>Job 42:8</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">Before Job was restored to a healthy state, Jehovah required that he pray in behalf of those who had transgressed against him. This shows that Jehovah requires that we forgive those who sin against us before we can have our sins forgiven.

<strong>Job’s Integrity Is Rewarded</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">First, Jehovah reproved Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. Addressing Eliphaz, evidently the eldest, he said: “My anger has grown hot against you and your two companions, for you men have not spoken concerning me what is truthful as has my servant Job. And now take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job, and you men must offer up a burnt sacrifice in your own behalf; and Job my servant will himself pray for you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998323/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 42:7, 8</a>) Think of what this implied!</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Jehovah required a considerable sacrifice from Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, perhaps to impress upon them the gravity of their sin. Indeed, either wittingly or unwittingly, they had blasphemed God by saying that he ‘has no faith in his servants’ and that it did not really matter to him whether Job was faithful or not. Eliphaz even said that in God’s eyes Job was of no more value than a moth! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998323/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 4:18, 19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998323/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 22:2, 3</a>) No wonder Jehovah said: “You men have not spoken concerning me what is truthful”!</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">But that is not all. Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar also sinned against Job personally by telling him that his problems were of his own making. Their baseless accusations and utter lack of empathy left Job embittered and depressed, causing him to cry out: “How long will you men keep irritating my soul and keep crushing me with words?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998323/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 10:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998323/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 19:2</a>) Imagine the expressions of shame on the faces of these three men as they now had to present Job with an offering for <em>their</em> sins!</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">But Job was not to gloat over their humiliation. Indeed, Jehovah required that he pray in behalf of his accusers. Job did just as he was instructed, and for this he was blessed. First, Jehovah cured his dreaded disease. Then, Job’s brothers, sisters, and former associates came to comfort him, “and they proceeded each one to give him a piece of money and each one a gold ring.”<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1998323/0">a</a> Moreover, Job “came to have fourteen thousand sheep and six thousand camels and a thousand spans of cattle and a thousand she-asses.”<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1998323/1">b</a> And Job’s wife was evidently reconciled with him. In time, Job was blessed with seven sons and three daughters, and he lived to see four generations of his offspring.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998323/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 42:10-17</a>.</p>

<strong>Jehovah’s Witnesses Endure for His Sovereign Godship</strong><br/><p id="p37" data-pid="37" data-rel-pid="[75]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> As Job was made happy in his outcome of a restoration, so the modern anointed ones came to experience a spiritually paradisaic restoration from 1919 onward. This restoration has meant great spiritual prosperity and happiness for them in Jehovah’s royal Kingdom service. To add to their joy, a vast crowd of sheeplike persons has been directed to flee from Babylon the Great and to come over into their realm of spiritual favor. Actually in 1934 the “other sheep” were told to get dedicated and baptized and to become the happy spiritual children of the anointed remnant.<a id="footnotesource10" data-fnid="10" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966682/9">j</a> But it was not until 1942 that the fulfillment in complete force of the bringing forth of Job’s ten new children <span id="page560" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="560" data-before-text="560"></span>began to take place.<a id="footnotesource11" data-fnid="11" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966682/10">k</a> From then on by the hundreds of thousands the figurative “ten children” have come to the aid of the modern Job, the anointed remnant.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966682/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Isa. 2:2, 3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966682/35/1" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> Zech. 8:23</a>.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="ss"><strong>FORMER CLERGYMEN NOW WITNESSES</strong></p><p id="p76" data-pid="76" class="qu">21, 22.

(b) What course have such repentant ones followed, according to modern experiences?</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" data-rel-pid="[76]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> In Job’s day of restoration, Eliphaz, Zophar and Bildad took Jehovah’s advice to repent of their false religious stand, to accept the priesthood services of Job so that no “disgraceful folly” should come upon them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966682/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Job 42:8, 9</a>) Also after Jesus’ restoration by resurrection and exaltation to heaven, his effective priesthood services were accepted as “a great crowd of priests began to be obedient to the faith.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966682/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Acts 6:7</a>) Has there been a parallel development in these last days? Yes! In the decades of restoration since 1919, right-hearted clergymen of various religious sects in different parts of the earth have repentantly accepted the priesthood services of the anointed remnant of Job-like ones by becoming rebaptized and ordained as true ministers of Jehovah.<a id="footnotesource12" data-fnid="12" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966682/11">l</a> Even clergymen in prominent places have made this about-face, including one priest who had formerly been a Greek Orthodox bishop. No longer seeking worldly fame, these many reformed ministers now zealously preach the good news of the Kingdom right in the same places where they had functioned as sectarian clergymen. But instead of preaching from a pulpit in a church building they now have the doorstep as their right pulpit.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" data-rel-pid="[76]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> What has resulted to these former clergymen for following this right and humble course? From their former clergy “friends” they get much Babylonish hostility and reproach, which they have courageously and faithfully endured. From the Sovereign God Jehovah they get goodwill for worthily bearing the divine name, making known Jehovah’s Sovereign Godship from house to house even as Jesus Christ did. After years of right preaching activity, several of these former clergymen have become appointed as presiding ministers of local congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses. They, in turn, have had the privilege of attending the Watchtower Society’s Kingdom Ministry Schools for further ministerial training. Here, then, is another merciful reason for Jehovah’s permitting Babylon the Great to exist a while longer so that more of such humbled, right-hearted, captive clergy individually may follow the lead set by these earlier ones and get out soon before “disgraceful folly” comes upon all who are left in Babylon the Great.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="ss"><strong>CLERGY HOSTILITY STILL PERSISTS</strong></p><p id="p77" data-pid="77" class="qu">23, 24.

The situation is similar to the antitypical seven years of famine and seven years of prosperity in Egypt during Joseph’s administration.<a id="footnotesource13" data-fnid="13" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966682/12">a</a> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966682/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Gen. 41:29-32</a>) In their present-day application those two antitypical seven-year periods run concurrently.

<strong>Championing Jehovah’s Godship in Spite of Babylonish Hostility</strong><br/><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="ss"><span id="page528" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="528" data-before-text="528"></span><strong>JOB LOOKS INWARD</strong></p><p id="p73" data-pid="73" class="qu">22. How was Job forced to look upon himself, and what did he say?</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[73]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> So by these three lengthy rounds of arguments of materialistic philosophy this unholy trio force Job to defend himself personally and to look inward upon himself to keep declaring his own soul righteous rather than extolling the rightness of the true God in conducting this case as to His Sovereign Godship. Deep down in Job’s heart this jabbing, testing process occurred, with questions and answers flowing from him. “If I have sinned, what can I accomplish against you, the Observer of mankind? Why is it that you have set me as your target, so that I should become a burden to you?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/70/0" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Job 7:20</a>) “I myself well know that my redeemer is alive.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/71/0" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Job 19:25</a>) “O that I had someone listening to me, that according to my signature the Almighty himself would answer me!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/72/0" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Job 31:35</a>) Yes, by means of this long duel under the permitted hand of Satan through his earthly dupes, Job was tested to the very core of his heart, yet his heart proved to be true, clean, full of hope and trusting in God.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="ss"><strong>ELIHU’S ASSESSMENT</strong></p><p id="p74" data-pid="74" class="qu">23. (a) What was Elihu’s assessment of the lengthy religious controversy? (b) How did Jehovah step in, and what was Job’s reaction?</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" data-rel-pid="[74]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> Finally the neutral watcher, Elihu, spoke up and presented the right assessment as to the true and false schools of wisdom that had concluded their arguments. “Against Job his anger blazed over his declaring his own soul righteous rather than God. Also, against his three companions his anger blazed over the fact that they had not found an answer but they proceeded to pronounce God wicked.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/73/0" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Job 32:2, 3</a>) So on the issue of Godship the three false comforters proved to have utterly failed, whereas Job had become sidetracked upon himself although never failing in his integrity to the true God. Then the drama ends with the tremendous display of wisdom from the true God by his speaking out of the windstorm. There Jehovah demonstrated his overwhelming Godship by referring to creation’s marvels and to natural things pertaining to the earth far too wonderful to be grasped by the mind of mortal man. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/74/0" data-bid="75-1" class="b">Job, chapters 38-41</a>) To this amazing shower of heavenly wisdom, Job’s clean heart quickly responds: “I have come to know that you are able to do all things, and there is no idea that is unattainable for you. That is why I make a retraction, and I do repent in dust and ashes.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/75/0" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Job 42:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/75/1" data-bid="76-2" class="b"> 6</a>.</p><p id="p75" data-pid="75" class="qu">24, 25.

And now take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job, and you men must offer up a burnt sacrifice in your own behalf; and Job my servant will himself pray for you. His face only I shall accept so as not to commit disgraceful folly with you, for you have not spoken concerning me what is <em>truthful,</em> as has my servant Job.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/76/0" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Job 42:7, 8</a>) Thus the apostate religion of these Babylonized wise men became exposed by Jehovah himself, twice declaring them as ‘not truthful.’ Their so-called wisdom turned out to be foolishness. Satan miserably lost the contest resulting from his challenge. The three “companions” had to make a climb-down, reform themselves and submit their lives to the priesthood services of Job by accepting the true religion. As to Job personally, “Jehovah himself turned back the captive condition of Job” and blessed him with twice the material wealth <span id="page529" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="529" data-before-text="529"></span>he had lost at the beginning.

<strong>Jehovah’s Witnesses Endure for His Sovereign Godship</strong><br/><p id="p37" data-pid="37" data-rel-pid="[75]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> As Job was made happy in his outcome of a restoration, so the modern anointed ones came to experience a spiritually paradisaic restoration from 1919 onward. This restoration has meant great spiritual prosperity and happiness for them in Jehovah’s royal Kingdom service. To add to their joy, a vast crowd of sheeplike persons has been directed to flee from Babylon the Great and to come over into their realm of spiritual favor. Actually in 1934 the “other sheep” were told to get dedicated and baptized and to become the happy spiritual children of the anointed remnant.<a id="footnotesource10" data-fnid="10" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966682/9">j</a> But it was not until 1942 that the fulfillment in complete force of the bringing forth of Job’s ten new children <span id="page560" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="560" data-before-text="560"></span>began to take place.<a id="footnotesource11" data-fnid="11" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966682/10">k</a> From then on by the hundreds of thousands the figurative “ten children” have come to the aid of the modern Job, the anointed remnant.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966682/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Isa. 2:2, 3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966682/35/1" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> Zech. 8:23</a>.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="ss"><strong>FORMER CLERGYMEN NOW WITNESSES</strong></p><p id="p76" data-pid="76" class="qu">21, 22.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966682/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Job 42:8, 9</a>) Also after Jesus’ restoration by resurrection and exaltation to heaven, his effective priesthood services were accepted as “a great crowd of priests began to be obedient to the faith.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966682/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Acts 6:7</a>) Has there been a parallel development in these last days? Yes! In the decades of restoration since 1919, right-hearted clergymen of various religious sects in different parts of the earth have repentantly accepted the priesthood services of the anointed remnant of Job-like ones by becoming rebaptized and ordained as true ministers of Jehovah.<a id="footnotesource12" data-fnid="12" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966682/11">l</a> Even clergymen in prominent places have made this about-face, including one priest who had formerly been a Greek Orthodox bishop. No longer seeking worldly fame, these many reformed ministers now zealously preach the good news of the Kingdom right in the same places where they had functioned as sectarian clergymen. But instead of preaching from a pulpit in a church building they now have the doorstep as their right pulpit.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" data-rel-pid="[76]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> What has resulted to these former clergymen for following this right and humble course? From their former clergy “friends” they get much Babylonish hostility and reproach, which they have courageously and faithfully endured. From the Sovereign God Jehovah they get goodwill for worthily bearing the divine name, making known Jehovah’s Sovereign Godship from house to house even as Jesus Christ did. After years of right preaching activity, several of these former clergymen have become appointed as presiding ministers of local congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses. They, in turn, have had the privilege of attending the Watchtower Society’s Kingdom Ministry Schools for further ministerial training. Here, then, is another merciful reason for Jehovah’s permitting Babylon the Great to exist a while longer so that more of such humbled, right-hearted, captive clergy individually may follow the lead set by these earlier ones and get out soon before “disgraceful folly” comes upon all who are left in Babylon the Great.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="ss"><strong>CLERGY HOSTILITY STILL PERSISTS</strong></p><p id="p77" data-pid="77" class="qu">23, 24.

The situation is similar to the antitypical seven years of famine and seven years of prosperity in Egypt during Joseph’s administration.<a id="footnotesource13" data-fnid="13" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966682/12">a</a> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966682/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Gen. 41:29-32</a>) In their present-day application those two antitypical seven-year periods run concurrently.

<strong>Have the Endurance of Job Today</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">But did Job get discouraged and quit? Did he follow his wife’s counsel, “Curse God and die”? No, he did not. He endured. And not only did he endure these things, but he held on to his integrity in spite of eight speeches made by those supposed friends of his who turned out to be his enemies, hypocrites in fact. “A true companion is loving all the time, and is a brother that is born for when there is distress.” But these three turned on Job with questions such as this: “Is not your own badness too much already, and will there <span id="page420" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="420" data-before-text="420"></span>be no end to your errors?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 2:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Prov. 17:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Job 22:5</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The record goes on to show that Jehovah God rewarded Job for his endurance, even as James notes, and, though having lived some thirty-five centuries ago, Job stands as a good example for all lovers of righteousness today; especially when these find themselves beset with similar hardship. Loss of one’s material possessions, of loved ones, of health and of friends are still the common lot of man.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 42:10-17</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">What will enable you to endure these evils without becoming resentful, bitter or discouraged? Faith in God and in his promises. Job had such faith. In spite of all his suffering he “did not sin or ascribe anything improper to God.” He kept trusting God ‘even though God would slay him.’ Faith will enable you to endure, to continue “steadfast as seeing the One who is invisible.” Besides, has not God promised that in his due time, which is now very near, all suffering, all sorrow, pain and death will end? Having faith in such promises of God will give you hope, and hope will help you to endure.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 1:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 13:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Heb. 11:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/5/3" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> Rev. 21:4</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Prayer is another great aid to endurance. Job’s words show that his attitude was one of prayer; he pleaded with God, presenting his case to him. So, should adversity come your way, you may pray to have what is needful. Is it illness you have to endure? You may pray for wisdom to cope with your affliction and strength to endure it. Is your hardship persecution? Here also you may pray, not only for strength to endure, but for your persecutors, even as Jesus commanded: “Pray for those persecuting you,” and as he himself did when saying: “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 5:44;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Luke 23:34</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Another aid to your enduring is a knowledge and understanding of God’s purposes. Job did not know why God permitted him to suffer, but we today, by reason of having the account of Job and God’s light upon it, know why God permits the righteous to suffer, namely, to prove to the Devil as well as to all creation that he can have creatures that will remain faithful to him come what may. Job kept integrity without knowing about this reason. Certainly knowledge of it should help all lovers of righteousness to endure.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 1:7-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2:2-8</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">And, above all, love will help you to endure. Love for God will help you to put up with what he permits, not rebelling or even complaining about it. Love will cause you to trust God as Job trusted him, always obeying him, for “this is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments.” And love for your neighbor will also help you to endure, to put up with him, be that neighbor a member of your own family, a member of your congregation or a fellow worker at your place of employment. If you truly love your neighbor you will also want to be setting him a good example by enduring and helping him to endure. “Love is long-suffering and kind. . . . It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 John 5:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 13:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 7</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Yes, among the many things that will aid you to endure are faith, prayer, knowledge and understanding, and love. Endurance is the course of wisdom. There is peace, comfort and an inner joy from knowing that you are enduring, bearing up under adversity because it is the right thing to do. Such endurance assures you of future reward: “He that has endured to the end is the one that will be saved.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 24:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Rom. 5:3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"></p>

Wisely taking the lesson to heart, Job confessed that he had argued his case without understanding. Said he to Jehovah: “In hearsay I have heard about you, but now my own eye does see you. That is why I make a retraction and I do repent in dust and ashes.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Job 42:1-6</a>.</p><p id="p94" data-pid="94" class="qu">40.

Yes! This windstorm is the great tribulation that he brings on Satan’s organization to begin and finish this “time of the end” of Satan’s world. This tribulation struck the invisible part of Satan’s organization in 1914, and whirled him and his demons down from heaven to earth’s vicinity. The days of that tribulation have been cut short by allowing Satan a “short period of time” to operate at the earth for the testing of the remnant, while the remnant and their good-will associates are doing a world-wide preaching of the good news of God’s established kingdom. The tribulation will resume at the battle of Armageddon and will destroy Satan’s visible organization and put out of operation his invisible organization. During this in-between period by which the days of tribulation have been cut short, as it were out of the calm eye of the windstorm before the final part of the storm breaks forth, Jehovah has answered the Joblike remnant, particularly since 1919. From then on the spiritual remnant have had a great clearing up of many Bible doctrines. They have been made acquainted with the challenge that Satan has made of their integrity, and also with the paramount issue of Jehovah’s universal sovereignty, which must be vindicated by his established kingdom. So we have become his witnesses as never before.</p><p id="p95" data-pid="95" class="qu">41.

They were obliged to take sacrifices, offer them up and have Job pray for them. They needed conversion, not Job, for Jehovah said: “His face only I shall accept so as not to commit disgraceful folly with you, for you have not spoken concerning me what is truthful as has my servant Job.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Job 42:8</a>.</p><p id="p96" data-pid="96" class="qu">42.

It is written: “Jehovah proceeded to accept Job’s face. And Jehovah himself turned back the captive condition of Job when he prayed in behalf of his companions, and Jehovah began to give in addition all that had been Job’s, in double amount.” His brothers and sisters and former acquaintances came and ate and drank and associated with him as formerly, and gave him presents.

<strong>How Will You React to Pressure?</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Ask yourself, Why is such an offer coming right at this time?

He made that claim in connection with God’s servant Job. But, in spite of being deprived of family, friends and possessions, Job refused to bend to such a pressure tactic. He thus proved Satan’s charge to be false. For faithful perseverance under pressure Jehovah “blessed the end of Job afterward more than his beginning.” Will your reaction to economic pressure be the same as Job’s? If so you can be assured of a comparable reward.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973605/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Job chapters 1 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973605/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973605/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> Job 42:12</a>.</p>

The cassia bark tree (<em>Cinnamomum cassia</em>) now grows in eastern Asia and is of the same family as the cinnamon tree. It may reach a height of 12 m (40 ft) and has glossy, stiff leaves. The inner bark of the branches (called cassia lignea), when cut, dries and peels off, rolling itself into tubes, which are then sent to market. The cassia bark is coarser and more pungent than cinnamon bark. The buds are used as cloves in preparing food dishes, and the mature flowers, when dried, serve as an aromatic incense.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When the holy anointing oil was prepared at the time of making the tabernacle, cassia was included among the ingredients as one of “the choicest perfumes.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000903/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex 30:23-25</a>) Cassia was prominent among the products in which the merchants and traders of the city of Tyre dealt.

The cassia bark tree (<em>Cinnamomum cassia</em>) now grows in eastern Asia and is of the same family as the cinnamon tree. It may reach a height of 12 m (40 ft) and has glossy, stiff leaves. The inner bark of the branches (called cassia lignea), when cut, dries and peels off, rolling itself into tubes, which are then sent to market. The cassia bark is coarser and more pungent than cinnamon bark. The buds are used as cloves in preparing food dishes, and the mature flowers, when dried, serve as an aromatic incense.</p>

<strong>Inheritance</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Patriarchal Period.</strong> The faithful Hebrew patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob possessed no land, except for the field with the cave used as a burial place and the field near Shechem purchased by Jacob.

Wisely taking the lesson to heart, Job confessed that he had argued his case without understanding. Said he to Jehovah: “In hearsay I have heard about you, but now my own eye does see you. That is why I make a retraction and I do repent in dust and ashes.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Job 42:1-6</a>.</p><p id="p94" data-pid="94" class="qu">40.

Yes! This windstorm is the great tribulation that he brings on Satan’s organization to begin and finish this “time of the end” of Satan’s world. This tribulation struck the invisible part of Satan’s organization in 1914, and whirled him and his demons down from heaven to earth’s vicinity. The days of that tribulation have been cut short by allowing Satan a “short period of time” to operate at the earth for the testing of the remnant, while the remnant and their good-will associates are doing a world-wide preaching of the good news of God’s established kingdom. The tribulation will resume at the battle of Armageddon and will destroy Satan’s visible organization and put out of operation his invisible organization. During this in-between period by which the days of tribulation have been cut short, as it were out of the calm eye of the windstorm before the final part of the storm breaks forth, Jehovah has answered the Joblike remnant, particularly since 1919. From then on the spiritual remnant have had a great clearing up of many Bible doctrines. They have been made acquainted with the challenge that Satan has made of their integrity, and also with the paramount issue of Jehovah’s universal sovereignty, which must be vindicated by his established kingdom. So we have become his witnesses as never before.</p><p id="p95" data-pid="95" class="qu">41.

They were obliged to take sacrifices, offer them up and have Job pray for them. They needed conversion, not Job, for Jehovah said: “His face only I shall accept so as not to commit disgraceful folly with you, for you have not spoken concerning me what is truthful as has my servant Job.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Job 42:8</a>.</p><p id="p96" data-pid="96" class="qu">42.

It is written: “Jehovah proceeded to accept Job’s face. And Jehovah himself turned back the captive condition of Job when he prayed in behalf of his companions, and Jehovah began to give in addition all that had been Job’s, in double amount.” His brothers and sisters and former acquaintances came and ate and drank and associated with him as formerly, and gave him presents. His wife presented him again with seven sons and three daughters, the most beautiful girls in all the land, and they were given a hereditary share with their seven brothers. Job’s life was miraculously extended for 140 years more, and he saw the fourth generation of his descendants. Finally he died in his integrity, as an example of how tenderly affectionate and compassionate Jehovah is with those who keep integrity toward him and how happy in God his servants come to be for enduring all forms of Satan’s hostility to vindicate him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Job 42:7-17</a>.</p><p id="p97" data-pid="97" class="qu">43.

After the end of World War I they were released from spiritual bondage to Satan’s world and their relationship to Jehovah God was healed. He blessed them with youthful vigor to preach the Kingdom message everywhere, and favored them with a grand increase, so great in number that it made up for all of their companions who had turned unfaithful and dropped away during the previous trial, and it also brought the membership of the remnant to completion, that thereby the spiritual body of Christ might have 144,000 members as foreordained.</p>
