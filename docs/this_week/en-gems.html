But they do not discern that the offer is made them in terms the exact opposite to the language God employs. God tells them that there is such a place as Hell, and it is not Hades or the grave. Their leaders tell them that such a place does not exist. This is plainly anti-God and brands the ‘Witnesses’ as having the ‘mark of the beast.’ God says the wicked ‘shall go away into eternal punishment’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966683/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Matt. 25:46</a>); but the ‘Witnesses’ say there is no such place. <em>But in so saying, they are preparing themselves to go there!”</em><a id="footnotesource12" data-fnid="12" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966683/11">l</a> (Brackets and italics ours)</p><p id="p114" data-pid="114" class="qu">18.

Certainly this is not making another Bible, a Bible different from the one God gave us, but is using the exact language God employs. You are far-fetched, therefore, in branding this as ‘plainly anti-God’ and as having ‘the mark of the beast.’ Jehovah’s witnesses are not abolishing Gehenna, but are putting it back into the Scriptures where it belongs. . . . Jesus warned his opposers with the admonition: ‘By your words you will be vindicated, and by your words you will be condemned.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966683/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Matt. 12:37</a>, <em>NW</em>) By your words against Jehovah’s witnesses your paper <em>The Vindicator</em> stands, not vindicated, but condemned before God and all men of good will.”<a id="footnotesource13" data-fnid="13" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966683/12">a</a> <span id="page567" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="567" data-before-text="567"></span>Once again the reader can judge who is in the right as to this teaching of the clergy on hellfire.</p>

<strong>Gentleness</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>False Gentleness.</strong> Gentleness in tone or manner, such as being soft-spoken, does not always prove true gentleness. It is a quality that, to be thoroughly genuine, must come from the heart. While Job, God’s servant, was suffering at the hands of Satan in a test of his integrity to God, he was verbally attacked by three companions. They charged Job with secret sin, wickedness, and stubbornness, intimating also that he was apostate and that his sons had met death at God’s hands because of their wickedness. Yet one of the three, Eliphaz, said to Job: “Are the consolations of God not enough for you, or a word spoken gently with you?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001654/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Job 15:11</a>) Thus, some of their speech at least may have been in a soft tone, yet it was harsh in content, hence not truly gentle.</p>

It can lead us to feel that God requires too much of us. This view attacks our very relationship with Jehovah. Moreover, if we succumb to this type of reasoning, how would we respond when we are given needed discipline? Rather than humbly accepting the correction, our heart may become “enraged against Jehovah himself,” and we may harbor resentment toward him.

By way of illustration, Job’s companion Eliphaz wrongly charged God: “In <span id="page147" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="147" data-before-text="147"></span>his holy ones he has no faith, and the heavens themselves are actually not clean in his eyes.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975163/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Job 15:15</a>) Jehovah God later reproved Eliphaz and his companions for their misrepresentations. Eliphaz was told: “My anger has grown hot against you and your two companions, for you men have not spoken concerning me what is truthful as has my servant Job.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975163/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Job 42:7</a>) While Eliphaz and his companions obviously were not inspired of God, the writer of the book of Job was guided by God’s spirit in making an accurate record of their statements. This record serves to identify and expose wrong reasoning about God’s permission of wickedness. Therefore, <em>as a whole</em> it is God’s inspired word or message. Nevertheless, this shows that we must exercise care when quoting certain portions from the Bible. If taken out of their proper setting, out of context, something that is in reality the view of imperfect men can be wrongly attributed to God.</p>

It varied in width from two to six inches (5.1 to 15.2 centimeters) and was often studded with plates of iron, silver or gold. The warrior’s sword was suspended from it and at times the belt was supported by a shoulder strap. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">1 Sam. 18:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/48/1" data-bid="49-2" class="b"> 2 Sam. 20:8</a>) Daggers were generally stuck in the girdle, even as some persons in the Middle East today might carry a dagger or pistol in that manner. Also, a cuirass or coat of mail might thus be secured at the waist.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sb">Before going in to Moabite King Eglon, Ehud made a sword and “girded it underneath his garment upon his right thigh.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Judg. 3:15-17</a>) The Messianic King was also to gird his sword upon his thigh and “ride in the cause of truth and humility and righteousness.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Ps. 45:3-6</a>.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="sb">Whereas a loosened girdle denoted leisure (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">1 Ki. 20:11</a>), girding up the loins or hips indicated readiness for action or battle.

In some instances, they seem to have covered the entire thigh. The Greeks and Romans had metal greaves. These had leather, felt or cloth linings and were usually fastened by means of straps around the ankle and the calf. The Israelites may also have used greaves to some extent.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="ss"><strong>HANDSTAVE</strong></p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="sb">A wooden staff, perhaps tipped with a metal point, that was used as a weapon.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Ezek. 39:9</a>.</p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="ss"><strong>HELMET</strong></p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="sb">A military headgear designed to protect a fighter during battle and a very basic part of defensive armor. In very early times helmets were made of rushes and were in the form of beehives or of skullcaps. Skins of animal heads were also worn on the head, perhaps to conceal the soldier, to terrify the enemy, or the wearer may have thought thereby to acquire the animal’s strength. It appears that the Elamites (to the E of Babylonia) first developed the metal helmet.</p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="sb">Shapes of helmets varied considerably and their forms often served particular desired purposes. Round or cone-shaped helmets, for instance, made penetration difficult or deflected arrows. Forms and decorations of helmets also made it possible to distinguish between friend and foe on the battlefield. Sometimes different kinds were worn by the various units of the same army, thus enabling the commander to see where each was situated at all times. However, in other instances, tradition rather than military purpose apparently influenced helmet shapes and decorations.</p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="sb">Originally, Israelite helmets were probably made of leather. Later these were covered with copper or iron and were worn over woolen, felt or leather bonnets. Copper helmets were used in Israel as early as the days of King Saul. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">1 Sam. 17:38</a>) While helmets may at first have been reserved for kings and other leaders, later they seem to have been in general use, Uzziah furnishing his entire army with them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:14</a>) The Bible itself gives us no description of the actual form of the Israelite helmet.</p><p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="sb">Among the Egyptians, helmets were usually made of quilted linen cloth, though they also used leather helmets. The Philistines possessed metal helmets, Goliath wearing one of copper. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/58/0" data-bid="59-1" class="b">1 Sam. 17:5</a>) A relief in the temple of Ramses III at Medinet Habu depicts a dead Philistine warrior in full armor, complete with a plumed helmet. Assyrian helmets varied in shape in different periods. As indicated on ancient monuments, some were plain round caps and may have resembled those worn by the Israelites. Other Assyrian helmets were of iron and terminated in a point at the top to deflect the blows of assailants. To protect the ears and the back of the head, they sometimes had flaps with metal scales descending over the shoulders. Babylonian helmets also had earflaps.</p><p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="sb">Ezekiel mentioned helmets in connection with Persians, Ethiopians and others. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Ezek. 27:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/59/1" data-bid="60-2" class="b"> 38:5</a>) Greek and Roman helmets of Herodian times were commonly made of either leather or bronze. The early Greek helmet enclosed the whole head, but it was later reduced and provided with a visor, a crest and often a plume. Roman helmets had movable earflaps and plumes.</p><p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="sb">Isaiah wrote that Jehovah put on a figurative “helmet of salvation.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/60/0" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Isa. 59:15-17</a>) The apostle Paul cited as part of the Christian’s “suit of armor from God” the “helmet of salvation.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Eph. 6:13,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/61/1" data-bid="62-2" class="b"> 17</a>) He also urged wearing “as a helmet the hope of salvation.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/62/0" data-bid="63-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:8</a>.</p><p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="ss"><strong>LADDER</strong></p><p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="sb">Wooden siege ladders were often employed in warfare in ancient times, being used by attackers to scale city walls. On some monuments, as at Thebes, soldiers equipped with them are shown assaulting fortifications. Similar representations appear on Assyrian monuments. An Egyptian wall painting from a tomb at Saqqara depicts the use by warriors of a unique wheeled and hence mobile scaling-ladder.</p><p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="sb">During an assault, troops carrying spears and shields might attempt to mount a city’s walls by means of strategically placed ladders, while their fellow besiegers showered defenders on the walls with a barrage of arrows. Some features of this type of attack are shown on a relief from Nineveh depicting Assyrian King Ashurbanipal attacking an Egyptian city. In the face of such an onslaught the city’s defenders frequently retaliated with flaming arrows, stones or boiling water or oil. The only mention of a ladder in the Scriptures is the one Jacob saw in his dream.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/63/0" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Gen. 28:12</a>; see LADDER.</p><p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="ss"><strong>SHIELD</strong></p><p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="sb">A broad piece of defensive armor used by all ancient nations. It was equipped with an inside handle and was carried by the warrior during battle, usually on the left arm or in the left hand, although during the march it may have been hung from a shoulder strap. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Isaiah 22:6</a> indicates that some may have been provided with a cover that was removed at time of combat. In peacetime shields were often placed in arsenals.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/65/0" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Song of Sol. 4:4</a>.</p><p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="sb">Shields used in ancient times were often made of wood covered with leather, and such shields could be burned.

Among whom did Jesus Christ begin to reign in 1914, and how was it possible for him to be struck upon the cheek after that?</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> Nations today are not grateful for Jehovah’s provisions any more than they were when the “ruler in Israel” came out of the earthly Bethlehem nineteen centuries ago. Hence in a larger fulfillment of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962042/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Micah 5:1</a> they have struck this “judge of Israel” upon the cheek. When? How? Not directly, of course; for Jesus Christ is now enthroned at God’s right hand in the heavens, impossible for the nations to reach even by space ships. After his kingdom was born in the heavens in 1914, he at once began ruling in the midst of his enemies. He cast Satan the Devil and his demon angels out of heaven and down to the neighborhood of our earth, never to return to the heavens of God’s holy organization. So the insulting strike upon the cheek of the heavenly “judge of Israel” took place indirectly. How? By being inflicted upon his remnant of faithful followers on earth during World War I. When Jesus sent out his twelve apostles to preach God’s kingdom he said: “He that receives you receives me also.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962042/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Matt. 10:40</a>) Conversely, he that turns away a disciple of Jesus when he brings the Kingdom message turns Jesus away also.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">22. What principle did the King Jesus Christ state in his illustration of the sheep and the goats, and so how could a strike upon the cheek be rendered in His case?</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> In his illustration using sheep and goats to picture the judgment of the nations that is now going on, Jesus the enthroned King says to the sheep: “Truly I say to you, To the extent that you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.” To the goats he says: “To the extent that you did not do it to one of these least ones, you did not do it to me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962042/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Matt. 25:40,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962042/32/1" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> 45</a>) Hence, in these days, to strike Jesus’ remnant of spiritual brothers on the cheek in abusing the rod of authority means to strike the heavenly “ruler of Israel” on the cheek with insult.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962042/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">1 Ki. 22:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962042/33/1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> Job 16:10</a>.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">23, 24. (a) Long before 1914 what had the spiritual remnant preached regarding that year, and what was the attitude toward them on the part of Christendom’s rulers?

This Kingdom preaching they did by distributing books, booklets, magazines and tracts and by public lectures and at last the free public showing of the Photo-Drama of Creation to great crowds. The religious leaders of Christendom were all taken up with the issues in the world war of that time. Neither they nor the warring nations had any regard for the remnant of Christ’s spiritual brothers who preached God’s kingdom as the rightful rulership of the earth now that the Gentile Times had ended in the year 1914.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> At this message the religious clergy were incensed. Martial law and fanatical, delirious patriotism furnished them an opportunity. They took advantage of it to put <span id="page47" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="47" data-before-text="47"></span>the faithful Kingdom preachers in a bad light before people and in a seditious cast before the militarized political governments. Like Jesus, the remnant of his brothers were insulted with the false charge of sedition, conspiracy and obstruction to national welfare. Outrageously the rod of political and judicial authority was viciously swung to strike them on the cheek, as it were, and to imprison them and put them in detention camps and to ban their literature or prohibit their religious meetings. Did this unjust, antichristian action escape the notice of the heavenly “ruler of Israel” out of Bethlehem? No! As these were his spiritual brothers and his Kingdom representatives, he took it as being done to him. To add further insult to injury, Christendom chose the League of Nations instead of Christ’s kingdom, thinking that she could fool him by calling the League of Nations “the political expression of the kingdom of God on earth.”</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204407/428/0"><em>The Watchtower,</em></a> ]</strong></p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204407/428/0">4/1/1965, p. 219</a> ]</strong></p>
	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page219" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="219" data-before-text="219"></span><strong>The Kidneys—Why Used Symbolically</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THROUGHOUT the Bible, even as in everyday usage, the various parts of the human body are used in a symbolic or figurative way. Among these are the hands, the shoulders and the heart. Such figurative use of words not only is expressive and adds force to speech but often is quite enlightening. In particular is the heart used in a figurative way both in the Bible and in everyday language.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">However, there are certain figurative expressions found in the Bible that have no counterpart in modern usage, at least not in English. Among these are the kidneys. In Biblical Hebrew the word for kidneys is <em>kelayoth.</em> Of the some thirty times it occurs in the Hebrew Scriptures about one-third of the times the reference is to kidneys in a figurative sense. Thus we read: “Examine me, O Jehovah, and put me to the test; refine my kidneys and my heart.” “Jehovah of armies is judging with righteousness; he is examining the kidneys and the heart.” “I, Jehovah, am searching the heart, examining the kidneys, even to give to each one according to his ways, according to the fruitage of his dealings.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 26:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Jer. 11:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 17:10</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Why do the Scripture writers use the kidneys in a symbolic sense? For more than one reason. In cutting up animals for sacrifice—the kidneys are repeatedly mentioned in the Levitical code of sacrifices—the Israelites could not help noting that they came upon the kidneys last; they were buried the deepest. The kidneys would therefore well stand for or represent the deepest part of man, his inmost or deepest thoughts and feelings. That is why we read at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jeremiah 12:2</a>: “They keep going ahead; they have also produced fruit. You are near in their mouth, but far away from their kidneys,” far away from the inmost thoughts and feelings of such wicked ones.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">No doubt the kidneys were associated with the deepest emotions also because these emotions affect the kidneys. Thus authorities on psychosomatic medicine tell us that sustained emotional strain can well cause such disturbances as <em>diabetes insipidous,</em> in which the kidneys fail to function properly. (This should not be confused with <em>diabetes mellitus</em> or “sugar” diabetes.)—<em>Emotions and Bodily Changes,</em> Dunbar.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Because of this we find that various Bible dictionaries and commentaries have the following to say about the symbolic use of “kidneys”: “The kidneys were considered the seat of affections and emotions and the most vital and sensitive part of man.” “The kidneys, from the sensitiveness of that part of the person, were believed to be the seat of longing and desire.” “The Orientals regarded the kidneys as the seat of the desires and affections, and hence under them spoke of the soul in respect to its inmost purposes or cravings.” “The most secret workings and affections of the heart.”</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In keeping with all the foregoing we note that in the <em>New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures,</em> First Edition, whenever “kidneys” is used with this symbolic or figurative sense there is a footnote reading, “deepest emotions.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 7:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 16:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 26:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/3" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> Prov. 23:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/4" data-bid="3-5" class="b"> Jer. 11:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/5" data-bid="3-6" class="b"> 12:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/6" data-bid="3-7" class="b"> 17:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/7" data-bid="3-8" class="b"> 20:12</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">As for the use of “kidneys” in the Christian Greek Scriptures, the Greek word for “kidneys,” <em>nephros,</em> is found only once, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 2:23</a>. There, in the <em>New World Translation</em> it is freely rendered “inmost thoughts.” “Her children I will kill with deadly plague, so that all the congregations will know that I am he who searches the <em>inmost thoughts</em> and hearts, and I will give to you individually according to your deeds.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The word “kidneys” when used figuratively in the Scriptures has but the one meaning, that of deepest or inmost emotions or thoughts. Many modern translators render the Hebrew and Greek words for “kidneys” as “heart.” However, strictly speaking, “kidneys” used in a symbolic sense goes deeper than does “heart” when applied to the emotions, feelings. Thus both Job and Jeremiah spoke of being wounded in the kidneys, meaning a very deep wound.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 16:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Lam. 3:13</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Whenever we ask Jehovah God, as did David, to examine our “kidneys” we mean for him to make a most searching examination, one that takes in the deepest emotions, thoughts, feelings. Being omniscient and omnipotent, Jehovah God has no difficulty at all in making such an examination. “All things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Heb. 4:13</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"></p>

What, then, did he mean? One possibility is that if he should die, none of his contemporaries would see him. From their standpoint, he would neither return to his house nor get further acknowledgment until God’s appointed time. Job might also have meant that no one can come back from Sheol on his own. That Job hoped in a future resurrection is clear from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006205/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Job 14:13-15</a>.</p>

<strong>‘We Know They Will Rise in the Resurrection’</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">‘Now, wait,’ some people acquainted with the Bible might object, ‘did not Job say in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989441/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job chapter 16, verse 22</a>, that “by the path by which” he would “not return” he would “go away”? And at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989441/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 7:9</a> he pointed out: “He that is going down to Sheol [the grave] will not come up.” Job added in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989441/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 7 verse 10</a>: “He will not return anymore to his house, and his place will not acknowledge him anymore.”’</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">So, as some scholars claim, do not those verses and similar statements show that Job viewed death as ‘a land of no return’? Do such statements mean that Job did not believe in a future resurrection? For the answer, we must take these words in their setting, also comparing them with other thoughts that Job expressed on the subject.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Job did not know the reasons behind his suffering. For a time he mistakenly thought that God was responsible for his tribulation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989441/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 6:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989441/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 7:17-20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989441/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 16:11-13</a>) Dispirited, he felt that his only place of immediate relief was the grave.

<strong>Surety</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The customary mode of becoming surety for another remained unchanged for centuries. The patriarch Job made the following reference to it: “Please, do put my security with yourself. Who else is there that will shake hands with me in pledge?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004265/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 17:3</a>) <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004265/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:18</a> is helpful in determining the procedure followed: “A man that is wanting in heart shakes hands, going full surety before his companion.” Evidently a person became surety for another when, in the presence of witnesses, he struck, clasped, or shook the hand of the creditor of the transaction and promised to assume the obligations of the debtor if he should fail to make payment. In the Orient this act of striking or touching hands meant that a bargain or covenant was sealed. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004265/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Pr 11:21</a>) Apparently in this way Jehu confirmed Jehonadab’s affirmative reply to the question, “Is your heart upright with me, just as my own heart is with your heart?” For he said to Jehonadab: “If it is, do give me your hand.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004265/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2Ki 10:15</a>.</p>

To the bars of Sheol they will go down, when we, all together, must descend to the very dust.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 17:13-16</a>) Now, just what is Job describing here? Any honest reader will answer, “The grave!” It is in the dust of the earth. It is a dark place, where the dead body is laid out as on a lounge; it is a pit, and there the maggot is to be found, feeding on the rotting corpse. It has bars, in the sense that those buried in it cannot free themselves.

How does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Job 17:13-16</a> indicate Sheol is a low place and is the grave?</p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>AS ALREADY noted Haʹdes or Sheol is not in heaven but is a low place. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 11:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Luke 10:15</a>) The patient man Job of ancient times indicates that it is a low place. When he was near death from a terrible disease, Job said: “If I keep waiting, Sheol is my house; in the darkness I shall have to spread out my lounge. To the pit I shall have to call out, ‘You are my father!’ to the maggot, ‘My mother and my sister!’ So where, then, is my hope? And my hope—who is it that beholds it? To the bars of Sheol they will go down, when we, all together, must descend to the very dust.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 17:13-16</a>) Now, just what is Job describing here? Any honest reader will answer, “The grave!” It is in the dust of the earth. It is a dark place, where the dead body is laid out as on a lounge; it is a pit, and there the maggot is to be found, feeding on the rotting corpse. It has bars, in the sense that those buried in it cannot free themselves. In fact, the Authorized Version Bible of King James of England uses here the words “grave” and “pit” instead of the Hebrew word Sheol.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 2. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Psalm 141:7</a>, what remains are associated with Sheol?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> Having in mind a woodchopper scattering chips and sticks of wood around, the psalmist David said: “As when one is doing cleaving and splitting on the earth, our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 141:7</a>) Instead of Sheol, the English <em>Authorized Version</em> uses the words “the grave,” and fittingly so, for bones are scattered at the mouth of the grave before burial.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 3. How does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Isaiah 28:15-18</a> indicate that Sheol is the grave?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> When speaking about the enemies of God, the prophet Isaiah links death (not life) and Sheol together, saying: “Because you men have said: ‘We have concluded a covenant with Death; and with Sheol we have effected a vision; the overflowing flash flood, in case it should pass through, will not come to us. . . ’; therefore this is what the Lord Jehovah has said: ‘ . . . your covenant with Death will certainly be dissolved, and that vision of yours with Sheol will not stand. The overflowing flash flood, when it passes through—you must also become for it a trampling place.”’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 28:15-18</a>) This very language indicates that Sheol is the common grave of dead mankind, for the grave is the place of death.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 4. How is Sheol shown to be a low place also in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Isaiah 57:9</a>?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 57:9</a> also indicates that Sheol is a low place, as low as the grave. After telling how the Jewish kingdom of Judah tried to lure other nations, Gentile nations, into political alliances with her, this prophecy says: “You proceeded to descend toward Melech with oil, and kept making your ointments abundant. And you continued sending your envoys far off, so that you lowered matters to Sheol.” In her political dealings with Gentile nations the unfaithful kingdom of Judah stooped so low in God’s view that she was bringing upon herself the condemnation of death in the grave, thus ceasing to be an independent nation with a king.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 5. (a) How is lowness associated with Sheol in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Psalm 86:12, 13</a>? (b) How does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Psalm 88:2-6</a> associate burial, pit and loss of strength with Sheol?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Associating lowness and death with Sheol, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 86:12, 13</a> says: “I laud you, O Jehovah my God, with all my heart, and I will glorify your name to time indefinite, for your loving-kindness is great toward me, and you have delivered my soul out of Sheol, its lowest place.” Associating the burial place, the pit and the loss of strength with Sheol, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 88:2-6</a> says: “Before <span id="page45" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="45" data-before-text="45"></span>you my prayer will come. Incline your ear to my entreating cry. For my soul has had enough of calamities, and my very life has come in touch even with Sheol. I have been reckoned in among those going down to the pit; I have become like an able-bodied man without strength, set free among the dead themselves, like slain ones lying in the burial place, whom you have remembered no longer and who have been severed from your own helping hand. You have put me in a pit of the lowest depths, in dark places, in a large abyss.”</p>
