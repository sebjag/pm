<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204406/237/0">10/15/1965, pp. 630-632</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>A Powerful Identification of the Messiah</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">What year in the currently used Gregorian calendar would be the twentieth year of Artaxerxes? We set forth here the chronological evidence: Xerxes began to reign in December, 486 B.C.E. Since the record in the book of Esther counts the year as beginning in the spring (Nisan, or March/April), Xerxes’ first year on that calendar would end February/March, 485 <span id="page631" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="631" data-before-text="631"></span>B.C.E. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Esther 9:1</a>) Xerxes’ twelfth year ran from March/April of 475 through February/March of 474. It is possible that Xerxes lived beyond his twelfth year (that is, beyond Adar [February/March of 474] into his thirteenth year, as mentioned above). Artaxerxes succeeded him in the same year, 474. But Nehemiah’s calendar counted the year as beginning in the fall (Tishri, or September/October), so the calendar year running from Tishri 475 to Tishri 474 would be the year in which Artaxerxes’ rule began.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965762/1">b</a> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Neh. 1:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 2:1</a>) Artaxerxes’ twentieth year ran, therefore, from September/October of 456 B.C.E. through August/September of 455 B.C.E.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Nehemiah, a zealous servant of Jehovah God, was vitally interested in true worship at the place where Jehovah had put his name, the city of Jerusalem. On hearing the bad news about Jerusalem, he prayed to Jehovah, desiring to be used to bring Jerusalem relief. In the seventh month of the lunar calendar year in this same twentieth year of Artaxerxes, which would be Nisan (March/April) according to Nehemiah’s reckoning, in the year 455 B.C.E., Nehemiah as cupbearer had opportunity to present the matter, to obtain the king’s approval, as he relates: “And it came about in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him, and I as usual took up the wine and gave it to the king.” “So it seemed good before the king that he should send me, when I gave him the appointed time.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Neh. 2:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 6</a>) Nehemiah acted promptly.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Just as the ending of the seventy years of desolation of Jerusalem took place when the decree of Cyrus <em>went into effect</em> at the arrival of the Jews in Jerusalem to lay the foundation of the temple, so there would be seventy weeks of years from the time the commandment of Artaxerxes <em>took effect,</em> that is, after the Jews with Nehemiah reached Jerusalem and when he gave the orders to build the city walls. Let us see next just when the command to build the city actually took effect.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">It would take about four months to make the trip from Shushan, the king’s winter capital, to Jerusalem, placing Nehemiah’s arrival at about the beginning of the eleventh month Ab. Nehemiah rested and held conferences for three days, inspected the city walls by night, then gave orders for the building to begin. This would be about the third or fourth day of Ab, 455 B.C.E., or about July 26-27 or 27-28, 455 B.C.E., still in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes.<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965762/2">c</a> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Neh. 2:11-18</a>) It marks our starting point for the count of time given by this important prophecy of Daniel. This is when the <span id="page632" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="632" data-before-text="632"></span>commandment to restore and rebuild Jerusalem <em>took effect.</em><a id="footnotesource4" data-fnid="4" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965762/3">d</a></p>

<strong>Festivals of Praise to Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> Through the fearless action of Queen Esther, herself a Jewess, a counterlaw was issued granting the Jews the right to “stand for their souls, to annihilate and kill and destroy all . . . that were showing hostility to them, . . . on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, that is, the month of Adar.” Under the fine leadership of faithful Mordecai the Jews were preparing their defense. And when the day arrived, they were assisted not only by the Persian people but, according to the historic record, by “all the princes . . . and the satraps and the governors and the doers of the business that belonged to the king . . . for the dread of Mordecai had fallen upon them. . . . and there was an avenging of themselves upon their enemies and a killing among those hating them of seventy-five thousand.” In Shushan the Castle the fight extended into the next day, with a total of 810 of the enemy killed, including Haman’s ten sons. The Jews in the provinces and in Shushan banqueted on the fourteenth and fifteenth days respectively. Consequently, Mordecai put them under obligation to keep the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar in each and every year “as days of banqueting and rejoicing and sending of portions to one another and of gifts to the poor people.” The Jews were thereby reminded every <span id="page433" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="433" data-before-text="433"></span>year of their deliverance, and year by year they gave praise and honor to Jehovah, the God of deliverance.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967522/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Esther 8:9 to 9:22</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="ss"><strong>MODERN-DAY FULFILLMENT</strong></p><p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="qu">22.

Their extermination as witnesses for the Most High, Jehovah, had been decreed by the modern-day Haman class, the religious leaders of Christendom. Jesus Christ, exercising regal power over the entire earth since 1914 as Ahasuerus did over the Persian Empire, has permitted such vicious attempts upon the life of the remnant under all kinds of false accusations, for a severe test. But as the Persian king permitted the Jews to fight for their lives, so, too, Christ Jesus has allowed the remnant to stand for their lives as Jehovah’s witnesses against their enemies.</p><p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="qu">23. How have the remnant fought for their lives?</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> Would the religious clergy of Christendom, with the help of the political state, be able to kill the remnant as Jehovah’s witnesses, kill their work of preaching Jehovah’s kingdom? Never! As the Jews in Ahasuerus’ time, the Lord’s people have fought zealously for their lives and rights as preachers and witnesses, not with material weapons of destruction, but using all the legal means at their disposal, together with the “sword of the spirit, that is, God’s Word.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967522/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Eph. 6:13-17</a>) They have steadfastly continued preaching the good news of the established Kingdom. With their spiritual weapons and the use of all available legal means, not only have they preserved their spiritual lives as witnesses of Jehovah and the right of preaching his name world wide, but they have symbolically “killed” many attackers by killing the power and influence of their enemies, who were unable to kill their preaching work.</p><p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu">24. (a) What was pictured by the killing of the Jews’ enemies? (b) As in the type, who join with the remnant, assisting them?</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[64]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> The work of the remnant has killed the influence of false religion to such a degree that thousands of honest-hearted people have left its ranks and have taken sides with the remnant, just as it was in the days of Mordecai: “Many of the peoples of the land were declaring themselves Jews.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967522/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Esther 8:17</a>) There they had seen that the king’s favor had turned away from Haman to the Jews, even making provision for their preservation. Thus since 1931; and with special momentum since 1935, many people have been impressed as they have seen the evidence of God’s favor upon the small remnant of spiritual Jews. They have observed the fight of the remnant to save their lives as Jehovah’s Christian witnesses against the whole world. They have been awakened to a lively interest in the remnant’s firmly maintained fight for true worship and clean moral principles. Even some men of high worldly status, like the princes and governors of Mordecai’s day, have assisted the remnant in their fight with what official or judicial help they could lend. In the eyes of the remnant and the “great crowd” of people who have joined the remnant in preaching the good news of the Kingdom, the antitypical religious leaders are already without power and influence, they are dead, and it is only a matter of a short time until Jesus Christ, who holds regal power, will bring about the total extermination of all his enemies on earth in the battle of Armageddon. Until then, many more people will take their stand with the remnant, as pictured in the drama. Thus the anciently celebrated festival of Purim has an antitypical significance <span id="page434" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="434" data-before-text="434"></span>that gives Christians today the unfailing hope of God’s victory over all his enemies.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Puʹrim).</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The festival celebrated on the 14th and 15th of Adar, the last month of the Jewish year, corresponding to late February and early March; also called the Festival of Lots. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003588/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Es 9:21</a>) The name comes from the act of Haman in casting pur (lot) to determine the auspicious day to carry out an extermination plot against the Jews. Being an Agagite, perhaps a royal Amalekite, and a worshiper of pagan deities, he was resorting to this as “a species of divination.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003588/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Es 3:7</a>, <em>Le,</em> ftn; see <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003588/0">DIVINATION</a>; <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003588/1">LOT, I</a>; <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003588/2">PUR</a>.) In King Ahasuerus’ (Xerxes I) 12th year, on Nisan 13, apparently in the spring of 484 B.C.E., the official extermination decree that Haman had induced the king to approve was prepared for all the Persian provinces, commanding the destruction of the Jews.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Commemoration of Deliverance.</strong> The festival commemorates the Jews’ deliverance from destruction through Haman’s plot. Consequently, the name Purim was probably given by the Jews in irony. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003588/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Es 9:24-26</a>) It is also called in the Apocryphal book of Maccabees “Mordecai’s day,” since Mordecai played an important part in the events pertaining to the festival. (2 Maccabees 15:36, <em>AT</em>) Through the efforts of Queen Esther, at the risk of her life and as directed by her older cousin Mordecai, the Jews were delivered. Esther fasted for three days before seeking an audience with the king to invite him to a banquet, and then to a second banquet where her petition could be presented. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003588/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Es 4:6–5:8</a>) The petition was favorably heard, and since the original decree could not be changed on account of the unchangeable law of the Medes and Persians (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003588/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Da 6:8</a>), another decree was issued on the 23rd day of Sivan. This document granted the Jews the right to defend themselves and enabled them to prepare. It was written by Mordecai and translated into many languages for various districts of the Persian Empire. The Jews fought​—with the help of the princes, satraps, and governors—​and turned the tables on the anti-Jewish enemies. A great slaughter took place on Adar 13, not of the Jews, but of their enemies. It continued in the royal city of Shushan through the 14th. On the 14th day of Adar the Jews in the jurisdictional districts rested, and those in Shushan on the 15th day, with banqueting and rejoicing.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003588/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Es 8:3–9:19</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">To commemorate this deliverance, Mordecai imposed upon the Jews the obligation to observe Adar 14 and 15 each year with ‘banqueting and rejoicing and sending portions to one another and gifts to the poor people.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003588/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Es 9:20-22</a>) Later, another letter was written with the confirmation of Esther the queen commanding this festival. It was to be held in each generation, in each family, jurisdictional district, and city at the appointed time each year.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003588/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Es 9:28-31</a>; see <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003588/3">ESTHER, BOOK OF</a>.</p>

<strong>A Powerful Identification of the Messiah</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Daniel 11:1</a> he mentions Darius the Mede and in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Da 11 verse 2</a> he prophesies that there will yet be three kings standing up for Persia and a fourth one who will amass greater riches than all the others and who “will rouse up everything against the kingdom <span id="page629" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="629" data-before-text="629"></span>of Greece.” The third king was Darius I, who began ruling the Persian Empire in 522 B.C.E. He had been preceded since Darius the Mede by two kings, Cyrus the Persian and Cambyses, Cyrus’ son. In 490 B.C.E. King Darius ordered a second Persian invasion of Greece. The Persian forces far outnumbered the Athenians, but at Marathon, Greece, the Persians were defeated. King Darius intended to invade Greece a third time but died in 486 B.C.E. before he could finish preparations.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Then the fourth king mentioned by Daniel rose up to make further attempts to conquer Greece. In some modern Bible translations his name is mentioned as Xerxes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Esther 1:1-3</a>, <em>AT, Mo</em>) In other Bible translations he is called Ahasuerus, as rendered according to the Hebrew. If Ahasuerus is Xerxes, he began to reign in December, 486 B.C.E. The reason that King Xerxes I figures in a discussion of the seventy weeks of Daniel’s prophecy is that he was the father of King Artaxerxes, who issued the decree to rebuild Jerusalem. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Neh. 1:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 2:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 7, 8</a>) King Xerxes I was the ruler who gave legal sanction to the Jews to defend themselves against being massacred by their enemies. Mordecai, the cousin of Xerxes’ Jewish wife Esther, was then acting as prime minister for Xerxes and he established for the Jews the memorial festival of Purim or Lots on the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the twelfth lunar month, Adar (February/ March). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Esther 9:20, 21</a>) Xerxes was then ruling in his twelfth year (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Esther 3:7</a>) and his rule must have extended over into his thirteenth year, to some time in 474 B.C.E., for after the decree of Xerxes other things took place, as stated at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Esther 9:32 to 10:3</a>:</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="si">“The command of Esther also confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in a book. Now King Xerxes laid a tribute on the land and the coast-lands of the sea. All the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai to which the king advanced him, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia? For Mordecai, the Jew, was next in rank to King Xerxes, and great among the Jews, and a favorite with the mass of his fellow-countrymen; for he sought the good of his people and voiced the welfare of his entire race.”—<em>AT.</em></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The third invasion of Greece had taken place before Xerxes’ twelfth year. Crossing the Hellespont in 480 B.C.E., Xerxes’ invasion forces, greatly outnumbering the Greeks, were defeated through the tactics of the Athenian general Themistocles. There was a Greek delaying action at Thermopylae that inflicted great losses on the Persians and that was followed by the destruction of more than half of Xerxes’ fleet. The following year the Greeks defeated the Persian army that had been left behind under the command of one of its ablest generals. On the same day the remains of the Persian fleet were destroyed near the promontory of Mycale in Asia Minor. The Persians never invaded Greece again. Thus the efforts of the Fourth World Power to invade deeply into Europe were checked in 479 B.C.E., the eighth year of Xerxes’ reign. Nevertheless, the Persian Empire continued to hold world domination for a century and a half.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>BEGINNING OF ARTAXERXES’ REIGN</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Here we present historical evidence that the reign of Artaxerxes began in 474 B.C.E.: Even though Themistocles had accomplished these victories and had greatly strengthened the Grecian defenses, he later on began to lose the confidence of the people. He was finally accused of treasonable negotiations with the Persians. He fled to Asia Minor and was proclaimed a traitor and his property confiscated. We read, however, that he was well received by the Persians:</p>

All the evidence points to the conclusion that the enemies of God’s people determined to use that war situation with its patriotism, its nationalism, its bias, its false accusations of Communism on the one hand and Nazism on the other in order to get Jehovah’s witnesses and destroy them. A global attack shaped up that appeared as though it might completely blot out the worldwide preaching of the Mordecai and Esther classes and their companions who had now begun to join with them.<a id="footnotesource4" data-fnid="4" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1971206/3">d</a> It could have been a bleak day indeed, one of mourning, but these faithful servants of God did not take this concerted action lying down. During this time represented by Adar 13 Jehovah’s witnesses fought as they have never fought before. They made a spiritual fight to preserve their spiritual lives all around the world, fighting from a centralized headquarters, presenting an organized front against the enemy. There were casualties, but there was no fighting with carnal weapons by Jehovah’s people.

Along with them, 500 of God’s enemies were slain in Shushan and 75,000 throughout the rest of the realm. On Adar 14 the fighting was continued in Shushan the castle and 300 more enemies of the Jews were put to death, whereas in the outlying districts the Jews were celebrating their victory.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971206/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Esther 9:1-19</a>.</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009207/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 1:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009207/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 3:23-38</a>) While the records Luke consulted were not inspired, his resulting Gospel certainly was. And that Gospel remains valuable for us.</p>

<strong>Medes, Media</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The Medes left virtually no written records; what is known of them is derived from the Bible record, from Assyrian texts, and also from the classical Greek historians. The Medes appear to have been formed into numerous petty kingdoms under tribal chieftains, and the boastful accounts of Assyrian Emperors Shamshi-adad V, Tiglath-pileser III, and Sargon II <span id="page1128" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1128" data-before-text="1128"></span>refer to their victories over certain ‘city chieftains’ of the distant land of the Medes. The beginning of Sargon’s reign corresponds approximately to the fall of Samaria (740 B.C.E.), and, following that Assyrian victory over the kingdom of Israel, the Israelites were sent into places of exile in Assyria and “in the cities of the Medes,” some of which were then in vassalage to Assyria.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Ki. 17:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 18:11</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Assyrian efforts to subjugate “the insubmissive Medes” continued under Assyrian Emperor Esar-haddon, son of Sennacherib and evidently a contemporary of King Manasseh of Judah (716-661 B.C.E.). In one of his inscriptions Esar-haddon speaks of “a district on the border of the salt-desert which lies in the land of the distant Medes, on the edge of Mount Bikni, the lapis-lazuli mountain, . . . powerful chieftains who had not submitted to my yoke,—themselves, together with their people, their riding-horses, cattle, sheep, asses and (Bactrian) camels,—an enormous spoil, I carried off to Assyria. . . . My royal tribute and tax I imposed upon them, yearly.”—<em>Ancient Records of Assyria and Babylonia,</em> 1927, Vol. II, by D. D. Luckenbill, pp. 215, 216.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">According to the Greek historian Herodotus (Book I, sec. 96) the Medes were formed into a united kingdom under a ruler named Deioces. Some modern authorities believe Deioces to be the ruler named in the inscriptions as “Daiaukku,” who was captured and deported to Hamath by Sargon II as a result of one of the Assyrian raids into the region of Media. However, most scholars consider that it was not until the time of Cyaxares (or Kyaxares, a grandson of Deioces according to Herodotus) that the kings of Media began to unite under a particular ruler. Even then they may well have been like the petty kings of Canaan, who at times fought under the direction of a particular king while still maintaining a considerable measure of independence.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Joshua 11:1-5</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The Medes had been growing in strength despite Assyrian incursions and now came to constitute Assyria’s most dangerous rival. When Nabopolassar of Babylon, the father of Nebuchadnezzar, rebelled against Assyria, Cyaxares allied his forces with the Babylonians. Following the Median capture of Asshur in Nabopolassar’s twelfth year (634 B.C.E.), Cyaxares (called <em>U-ma-kis-tar</em> in the Babylonian records) met with Nabopolassar before the captured city and they “established among themselves good relations and friendship.” Two sources, Berossus (quoted by Eusebius) and Abydenus, say that Nabopolassar’s son, Nebuchadnezzar, married the daughter of the Median king, her name being Amytis (or Amuhia according to Abydenus). Historians disagree, however, as to whether Amytis was the daughter of Cyaxares or of his son Astyages.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong><em>With Babylonians defeat Assyria</em></strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">After further battles against the Assyrians, finally in the fourteenth year of Nabopolassar (632/631) the combined forces of the Medes and the Babylonians conquered Nineveh. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Zeph. 2:13</a>) Assyrian resistance was transferred to Haran (some 225 miles [362 kilometers]) to the W but, though receiving assistance from Egypt, the effort was ineffectual and the Assyrian Empire was split up between the Medes and the Babylonians. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Nah. 2:8-13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 3:18, 19</a>) The Medes appear to have taken the northern portion of the territory while the Babylonians took the southern and southwestern portion, including Syria and Palestine. Cyaxares thereafter pushed into Asia Minor as far as the Halys River, where a war with Lydia resulted in a stalemate and the Halys became the far western boundary of the Median Empire. This empire now extended over the greater part of the Iranian plateau, Assyria and northern Mesopotamia, Armenia and Cappadocia.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong><em>Lose dominant position to Persians</em></strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">At this time the Medes, with their capital at Ecbatana (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezra 6:2</a>), held the dominant position over the related Persians, who had occupied the area to the S of Media. Greek historians Herodotus and Xenophon both relate that Cyaxares’ successor, Astyages (called “Ishtumegu” in the cuneiform texts) had given his daughter Mandane in marriage to Persian ruler Cambyses, resulting in the birth of Cyrus (II). Cyrus, upon becoming king of Anshan, a Persian province, united the Persian forces in an effort to throw off the Median yoke. The so-called Nabonidus Chronicle indicates that it was in the sixth year (550 B.C.E.) of Nabonidus, king of Babylon, that the opposing forces met in battle. The account states that the “army of Ishtumegu [Astyages] revolted against him” and “in fetters” they delivered him to Cyrus, who thereafter seized the Median capital. (Pritchard’s <em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts,</em> 1955 ed., p. 305) From this point forward Media merges with Persia to form the Medo-Persian Empire. Thus, the vision received by the prophet Daniel aptly likened the dual power of Medo-Persia to a two-horned ram, the taller of the two horns being “the one that came up afterward,” representing the ascendancy of the Persians and their dominance of the empire for the remainder of its existence.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Dan. 8:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 20</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The evidence is, however, that Cyrus gave positions of power and authority to the Medes so that they continued to maintain a considerable measure of prominence within his government. Thus, the prophet Daniel interpreted to King Belshazzar the cryptic writing on the wall as predicting the division of the Babylonian Empire and its being given “to the Medes and the Persians,” and elsewhere in the book of Daniel the Medes continue to be listed first in the phrase the “law of the Medes and the Persians.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Dan. 5:28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 6:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/8/3" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> 15</a>) In the following century <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">the book of Esther (1:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 18, 19</a>) reverses the order, with one exception (10:2) in which the Medes are listed as preceding the Persians historically.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong><em>With Persians defeat Babylon</em></strong></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">In the eighth century B.C.E., the prophet Isaiah had foretold that Jehovah would arouse against Babylon “the Medes, who account silver itself as nothing and who, as respects gold, take no delight in it. And their bows will dash even young men to pieces.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isa. 13:17-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 21:2</a>) The term “Medes” here may well include the Persians, even as the classical Greek historians commonly used the term to embrace both Medes and Persians. Their disdaining silver and gold evidently indicates that in Babylon’s case conquest was the prime motive with them rather than spoil, so that no bribe or offer of tribute would buy them off from their determined purpose. The Medes, like the Persians, used the bow as a principal weapon. The wooden bows, though sometimes mounted with bronze or copper (compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 18:34</a>), likely ‘dashed the young men of Babylon to pieces’ by the hail of arrows, individually polished so as to penetrate even deeper.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Jer. 51:11</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">It may be noted that <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Jeremiah (51:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 28</a>) makes reference to the “<em>kings</em> of Media” as among those attacking Babylon, the plural perhaps indicating that even under Cyrus, a subordinate Median king or kings may have continued to exist, a situation by no means incompatible with ancient practice. (Compare also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Jeremiah 25:25</a>.) Thus, too, we find that when Babylon was captured by the combined forces of Medes, Persians, Elamites and other neighboring tribes, it was a Mede named Darius, son of Ahasuerus, who was “made king over the kingdom of the Chaldeans,” perhaps as an appointee of King Cyrus the Persian.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Dan. 5:31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 9:1</a>; see DARIUS No. 1.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong><em>Conquered by Alexander the Great</em></strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">In the time of King Ahasuerus (likely Xerxes I), reference was still made to the “military force of Persia <em>and Media,”</em> the king’s privy council was formed of “seven princes of Persia and Media,” and the laws were still known as the “laws of Persia and Media.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Esther 1:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/16/2" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 19</a>) In 330 B.C.E. Alexander the <span id="page1129" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1129" data-before-text="1129"></span>Great conquered the Persian Empire and occupied Media. Following his death the southern part of Media came to form part of the Seleucid Empire, while the northern part became an independent kingdom. Though it was dominated variously by the Parthians and by the Seleucid Empire, Greek geographer Strabo indicated that a Median dynasty continued in the first century C.E. At Jerusalem, Medes along with Parthians, Elamites and persons of other nationalities were present at Pentecost in the year 33 C.E. Since they are spoken of as “Jews, reverent men, from every nation,” they may have been descendants of those Jews exiled to cities of the Medes following the Assyrian conquest of Israel, or perhaps some were proselytes to the Jewish faith.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Acts 2:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012887/17/2" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 9</a>.</p>

<strong>Persia, Persians</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The Persian rulers, while as capable of cruelty as the Semitic kings of Assyria and Babylonia, initially at least seem to have endeavored to manifest a degree of fairness and legality in their dealings with the conquered peoples. Their religion apparently contained some concept of ethics. Following their chief god <span id="page1294" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1294" data-before-text="1294"></span>Ahura Mazda, a principal deity was Mithra, who became known, not only as a god of war, but also as the god of contracts, the one whose eyes and ears were ever alert to spy out any violator of an agreement. (See GODS AND GODDESSES.) Greek historian Herodotus wrote of the Persians: “Beginning from the age of five years to twenty, they instruct their sons in three things only—to ride, to use the bow, and to speak truth. . . . To tell a lie is considered by them the greatest disgrace.” (Book I, pars. 136-138) While the history of the Persian rulers shows them to be not above duplicity and intrigue, yet a basic adherence to some tribal creed of ‘keeping one’s word’ may be reflected in their insistence on the inviolability of the “law of the Medes and the Persians.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Dan. 6:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Esther 1:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/8/3" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> 8:8</a>) Thus, when Cyrus’ decree was found some seventeen years after its date of issuance, King Darius recognized the legality of the Jews’ position as regards the building of the temple and gave orders that full cooperation be extended to them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ezra 6:1-12</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Considerable administrative ability is evidenced in the Persian imperial organization. In addition to the king’s own privy council or advisory board, composed of “seven princes of Persia and Media” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Esther 1:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Ezra 7:14</a>), there were satraps appointed over major regions or countries, such as Media, Elam, Parthia, Babylonia, Assyria, Arabia, Armenia, Cappadocia, Sardis, Ionia, and, as the empire expanded, Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya, and others. These satraps were granted a measure of autonomy in the government of the satrapy, including the administration of judicial and financial affairs within their territory. (See SATRAP.) Within the satrapy there appear to have been subordinate governors of jurisdictional districts (numbering 127 in King Ahasuerus’ day), and within the jurisdictional districts there were princes of the particular peoples composing the district’s population. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ezra 8:36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Esther 3:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 8:9</a>) Likely to overcome the disadvantage of the imperial capital’s being somewhat in a corner of the far-flung domain, a speedy system of communication was developed by means of a royal mail service employing couriers riding post horses, thereby connecting the throne with all the jurisdictional districts. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Esther 8:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 14</a>) Royal highways were maintained; one ran from Shushan all the way to Sardis in Asia Minor.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>FROM CYRUS’ DEATH TO NEHEMIAH’S GOVERNORSHIP</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The reign of Cyrus the Great ended in 530 B.C.E. due to his death while on a warring campaign. His son Cambyses II succeeded him to the throne and was successful in conquering Egypt. Though not referred to by the name Cambyses in the Bible, he is evidently the “Ahasuerus” to whom the opposers of the temple work sent accusations against the Jews, as stated at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ezra 4:6</a>. Daniel, who had prospered “in the kingdom of Darius [the Mede] and in the kingdom of Cyrus the Persian,” was likely dead by this time, having been taken captive to Babylon in 617 B.C.E.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Dan. 6:28</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The circumstances involving the end of Cambyses’ rule are confused. One account, set forth by Darius the Great in his Behistun Inscription, and recounted by Herodotus and others with certain variations, is that Cambyses had his brother Bardiya (called Smerdis by Herodotus) secretly put to death. Then, during Cambyses’ absence in Egypt, a Magian named Gaumata, posing as Bardiya (Smerdis), usurped the throne and was able to gain recognition as king. Cambyses, while returning from Egypt, either became sick and died or committed suicide, thereby leaving the usurper secure on the throne. The other version, favored by some historians, is that Bardiya had not been killed and that he, not some impostor, usurped the throne during Cambyses’ absence.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Whatever the case, the reign of Cambyses is considered as having ended in 522 B.C.E. and the rule that followed is believed to have lasted less than one year, ending also in 522 B.C.E. with the assassination of the usurper (either Bardiya or Gaumata the pseudo-Smerdis). Yet, during this brief rule it appears that a second charge against the Jews was directed to the Persian throne, the king then being designated in the Bible as “Artaxerxes” (perhaps a throne name or title), and this time the accusations were successful in producing a royal ban against further construction on the temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ezra 4:7-23</a>) The temple work then lay idle “until the second year of the reign of Darius the king of Persia.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ezra 4:24</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong><em>Darius the Great</em></strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Darius I (called Darius Hystaspis, or, Darius the Great) evidently engineered or instigated the slaying of the one occupying the Persian throne. His father Hystaspes appears to have held the position of a satrap in the empire and was of the same Achaemenian family as Cyrus, though of a different branch. Darius does not seem to have gained recognition as king until 521 B.C.E., the first part of his rule being marked by violent revolt throughout the empire, requiring several military campaigns to effect submission. Typical of the treatment dispensed to the rebel leaders was that given to Fravartish (Phraortes), who headed the revolt in Media. When finally captured, his nose, ears and tongue were cut off, his eyes put out and he was then put on public exhibition before being impaled.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">During Darius’ rule the temple work at Jerusalem was again renewed with royal approval and the temple was completed during his sixth year of rule (probably early in 515 B.C.E.). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ezra 6:1-15</a>) Darius’ reign was one of imperial reorganization and expansion. He reconquered rebellious Egypt, subdued Libya, and extended Persian dominion as far E as India and as far W as Thrace and Macedonia. At least by this time the Persian rulers had fulfilled the prophetic symbolisms of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Daniel 7:5 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 8:4</a>, where, under the symbols of a bear and also a ram, the Medo-Persian Empire is represented as seizing territories in three principal directions: to the N (as Assyria and Babylon), the W (Asia Minor and Thrace) and the S (Egypt). In a punitive campaign against Greece, however, Darius’ forces suffered defeat at Marathon in 490 B.C.E. Darius died a few years later (486 B.C.E.) before being able to avenge this defeat.—See DARIUS No. 2.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong><em>Xerxes</em></strong></p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Xerxes, Darius’ son, succeeded to the throne. He is evidently the king called “Ahasuerus” in the book of Esther. His actions also fit the description of the fourth Persian king who would “rouse up everything against the kingdom of Greece.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Dan. 11:2</a>) Endeavoring to retaliate for the Persian defeat at Marathon, Xerxes launched massive forces against the Greek mainland in 480 B.C.E. but suffered crushing defeats in both naval and land battles at Salamis, Thermopylae, and Plataea. While Xerxes is represented by some modern historians as a “weakling,” it appears that their judgment is based on the writings of the Greeks, who may well have been strongly prejudiced against Xerxes due to his military activity against their homeland. His reign was marked by certain administrative reforms and the completion of much of the construction work his father had initiated at Persepolis.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Esther 10:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The Greek stories of the end of Xerxes’ reign revolve around marital difficulties, disorders in the harem, and a supposed dominance of Xerxes by certain of his courtiers. These traditional accounts may reflect, though in a very confused and twisted way, some of the basic facts of the book of Esther, including the deposing of Queen Vashti and her replacement by Esther, and also the ascension of Mordecai to a position of great authority in the realm. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Esther 2:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 10:3</a>) According to the secular accounts, Xerxes was assassinated by one of his courtiers. While most secular authorities present 466/465 B.C.E. <span id="page1295" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1295" data-before-text="1295"></span>as the date of his death, thereby giving him a rule of some twenty-one years, an earlier date of 475/474 B.C.E. accords with the Bible record and has creditable testimony in its favor from certain of the ancient secular historians.—See ARTAXERXES No. 3.</p>
