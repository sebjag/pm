	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page89" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="89" data-before-text="89"></span><strong>Behemoth and Leviathan—Creative Marvels</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“WHO is this that is obscuring counsel by words without knowledge?” Almighty God asked of Job. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963087/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 38:2</a>) Though Job had kept integrity to God, he had obscured divine counsel by speaking words not based on accurate knowledge; he had cast some doubt upon the wise, loving and just procedure of the Creator. Job’s course of justifying his own soul more than God needed to be corrected. Out of the windstorm Jehovah spoke to Job, giving him knowledge of God’s infinite wisdom and loving care of his creatures. Deeply humiliated by the questions raised by the Almighty regarding works in nature, the animals and birds, Job confessed he had nothing to say toward his own justification. Then Jehovah asked another question: “Do you have an arm like that of the true God?” And to illustrate God’s power in nature, Jehovah describes a creative marvel, the mighty behemoth:</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Here, now, is Behemoth that I have made as well as you. Green grass it eats just as a bull does. Here, now, its power is in its hips, and its dynamic energy in the tendons of its belly. It bends down its tail like a cedar; the sinews of its thighs are interwoven. Its bones are tubes of copper; its strong bones are like wrought-iron rods. It is the beginning of the ways of God; its Maker can bring near his sword.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963087/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 40:15-19</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Here is a mammoth creature made by God, mighty in power. From God’s description of the creature, the hippopotamus is generally identified with the behemoth; and a number of Bible translations of the book of Job use the word “hippopotamus” in their main text or in footnotes to identify the creature referred to by God.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Prodigious in size, a full-grown hippo may be twelve to fourteen feet long and may weigh up to 8,000 pounds. “The bulk of a full-grown male hippopotamus can hardly be believed even when viewed at close range in a zoo,” declares zoologist Ivan Sanderson. “One wonders, when so observing the brute, how on earth its small stumpy legs, for all their girth, can support the body, yet the same beast in its native waters can overtake almost any man-powered small boat and even motorboats by paddling like a dog with these same ridiculous little limbs.”—<em>Living Mammals of the World.</em></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Those small legs are of sturdy build. The bones of the hippo’s legs are as strong as “tubes of copper,” strong enough to support a four-ton creature. Its bones and ribs are like iron bars. “The sinews of its thighs are interwoven,” so that the fiber and tendons of muscles of its thighs are twisted together and braided like powerful cables. Its “power is in its hips,” in the muscles of its back, and “its dynamic energy in the tendons of its belly,” the muscles of its belly being powerful. The hide of the belly is thicker than that on other <span id="page90" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="90" data-before-text="90"></span>parts of the body, since the hippo is short-legged and drags his body over grass, sticks and stones of riverbeds. Its tail is like a cedar, not in length but since it can set its thick tail rigidly upright or swing it about like a tree.</p>

<strong>Divine Rulership—Over Mankind at the Start</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Our earth is suspended in space upon nothing of a material kind. As that Book of books said in its account of the patriarch Job not quite three thousand five hundred years ago, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972801/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job chapter twenty-six, verse seven</a>: “He is stretching out the north over the empty place, hanging the earth upon nothing.” In comparison with the countless bodies in the heavens, our earth is like a mere speck of dust in the midst of a tremendous dust cloud. Since the God of creation runs or rules the great establishment as a whole, he must also be the ruler of the earth. His rulership, not that of human creatures on the earth, is the true, original, rightful rulership for the earth. A Creator should run his own creation. Man had nothing to do with creating this earth as his everlasting home. On this vital point the same questions deserve to be put to modern-day scientists and evolutionists that were put to the patriarch Job by God respecting the creation of the earth. To Job he said:</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> “Gird up your loins, please, like an able-bodied man, and let me question you, and you inform me. Where did you happen to be when I founded the earth? Tell me, if you do know understanding. Who set its measurements, in case you know, or who stretched out upon it the measuring line? Into what have its socket pedestals been sunk down, or who laid its cornerstone, when the morning stars joyfully cried out together, and all the sons of God began shouting in applause? . . . Was it from your days onward that you commanded the morning? Did you cause the dawn to know its place, to take hold on the extremities of the earth, that the wicked ones might be shaken out from it?”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972801/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 38:3-13</a>.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 6. (a) Whom did God say witnessed the creating of the earth? (b) Why are we in no position to pass judgment upon God’s pronouncement of six thousand years ago on his creative work?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> In answer to those questions, all of us today would have to say humbly that we were not on the scene. Those whom God here calls “the morning stars” and “all the sons of God” witnessed the creating of the earth and they were all delighted with this tiny part of the visible “establishment.” Well, then, do we inferior human creatures have any reason to criticize God for the way that he created our earthly home? When God finished the preparing of it for man’s dwelling place and put man upon it, then, as the last verse of the first chapter of the Holy Bible says, “God saw everything he had made and, look! it was very good.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972801/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 1:31</a>) Since the Creator himself looked at his earthly creation and considered it to be “very good,” who are we who have come on the scene six thousand years later to say that it was not “very good” from our human viewpoint? Who are we today to judge what the state of the earth was six thousand <span id="page647" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="647" data-before-text="647"></span>years ago when God created the first man and woman in human perfection and put them in a Paradise of Pleasure? The polluted condition of the earth today is no basis for true judgment.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204407/746/0">1/15/1962, p. 59</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>“Man” in the Hebrew Scriptures</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><span id="page59" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="59" data-before-text="59"></span><strong>“GEBER”</strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">The term <em>geber</em> means one able-bodied, well-developed, physically strong, that is, a mighty one in the case of a man. While it has complimentary implications, the way it is used by the Hebrew Scripture writers keeps man cognizant of his inferior relationship to his Maker, Jehovah God. Thus we find that, when at last Jehovah God called patient Job to account because of his mistaken view of things, God twice addressed Job, not as a mere <em>ish,</em> a mere <em>adám</em> or a mere <em>enósh,</em> but he used the term <em>geber:</em> “Gird up your loins, please, like an able-bodied man, and let me question you, and you inform me,” since you were so sure of yourself as not to justify me! How fitting!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 38:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 40:7</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Pharaoh, when beginning to yield under the impact of the plagues, at first only granted permission for the able-bodied men to go into the wilderness to worship. And when the Israelites finally left Egypt we read that 600,000 able-bodied men, above twenty years old and able to fight, left Egypt together with their little ones.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ex. 10:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 12:37</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Because an able-bodied man is inclined to be “self-assuming,” trusting in his own strength, he is repeatedly singled out for reminders of the folly of such a mental attitude: “Here is the able-bodied man that does not put God as his fortress.” “What able-bodied man is there alive who will not see death?” “An able-bodied man dies and lies vanquished.” Yes, “cursed is the able-bodied man who puts his trust,” not in Jehovah, but in what is, after all, a mere “earthling man [<em>adám</em>].”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Hab. 2:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Ps. 52:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/19/2" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 89:48;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/19/3" data-bid="20-4" class="b"> Job 14:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/19/4" data-bid="20-5" class="b"> Jer. 17:5</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"><em>Geber</em> is frequently used to drive home a point by way of contrast. Thus the psalmist complains: “I have become like an able-bodied man without strength.” It would not have made much of a point had he said he became like a weak mortal, an <em>enósh,</em> because such a one does not have strength to begin with! Making the same point, Solomon observed that it is not good that “an able-bodied man should transgress over a mere piece of bread.” There might be an excuse for an <em>enósh</em> to do so, but certainly not a <em>geber.</em> The bad news he received caused Jeremiah’s bones to shake like “an able-bodied man whom wine has overcome,” hence a violent shaking. He also stressed the wretchedness of the men of Israel by employing this term: “Why is it that I have seen every able-bodied man with his hands upon his loins like a female that is giving birth, and all faces have turned pale?” Yes, this was serious when even able-bodied men, not mere <em>enósh</em> or weak mortals, were affected in this way!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 88:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Prov. 28:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/20/2" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> Jer. 23:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/20/3" data-bid="21-4" class="b"> 30:6</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Logically we are told that “one wise in strength is,” not an <em>adám, ish</em> or <em>enósh,</em> but a <em>geber,</em> “an able-bodied man.” A wise <em>geber</em> trusts not in his own strength but in Jehovah: “Blessed is the able-bodied man who puts his trust in Jehovah, and whose confidence Jehovah has become.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Prov. 24:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Jer. 17:7</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Truly, to note the way “man” is used in the Hebrew Scriptures strengthens our faith and helps us to get God’s view on man.

<strong>Divine Rulership—Over Mankind at the Start</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Our earth is suspended in space upon nothing of a material kind. As that Book of books said in its account of the patriarch Job not quite three thousand five hundred years ago, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972801/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job chapter twenty-six, verse seven</a>: “He is stretching out the north over the empty place, hanging the earth upon nothing.” In comparison with the countless bodies in the heavens, our earth is like a mere speck of dust in the midst of a tremendous dust cloud. Since the God of creation runs or rules the great establishment as a whole, he must also be the ruler of the earth. His rulership, not that of human creatures on the earth, is the true, original, rightful rulership for the earth. A Creator should run his own creation. Man had nothing to do with creating this earth as his everlasting home. On this vital point the same questions deserve to be put to modern-day scientists and evolutionists that were put to the patriarch Job by God respecting the creation of the earth. To Job he said:</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> “Gird up your loins, please, like an able-bodied man, and let me question you, and you inform me. Where did you happen to be when I founded the earth? Tell me, if you do know understanding. Who set its measurements, in case you know, or who stretched out upon it the measuring line? Into what have its socket pedestals been sunk down, or who laid its cornerstone, when the morning stars joyfully cried out together, and all the sons of God began shouting in applause? . . . Was it from your days onward that you commanded the morning? Did you cause the dawn to know its place, to take hold on the extremities of the earth, that the wicked ones might be shaken out from it?”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972801/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 38:3-13</a>.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 6. (a) Whom did God say witnessed the creating of the earth? (b) Why are we in no position to pass judgment upon God’s pronouncement of six thousand years ago on his creative work?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> In answer to those questions, all of us today would have to say humbly that we were not on the scene. Those whom God here calls “the morning stars” and “all the sons of God” witnessed the creating of the earth and they were all delighted with this tiny part of the visible “establishment.” Well, then, do we inferior human creatures have any reason to criticize God for the way that he created our earthly home? When God finished the preparing of it for man’s dwelling place and put man upon it, then, as the last verse of the first chapter of the Holy Bible says, “God saw everything he had made and, look! it was very good.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972801/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 1:31</a>) Since the Creator himself looked at his earthly creation and considered it to be “very good,” who are we who have come on the scene six thousand years later to say that it was not “very good” from our human viewpoint? Who are we today to judge what the state of the earth was six thousand <span id="page647" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="647" data-before-text="647"></span>years ago when God created the first man and woman in human perfection and put them in a Paradise of Pleasure? The polluted condition of the earth today is no basis for true judgment.</p>

Man’s littleness contrasted with God’s greatness is the subject of a speech given by Almighty God to his faithful servant Job. Using language of incomparable grandeur, the Most High God describes his works of creation, which give humans a view of the true size of themselves.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">As you read portions of the Almighty’s speech, which has been described as “a series of questions following each other like claps of thunder,” put yourself in Job’s place. Imagine how Job felt when he heard these words from his Creator:</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Where did you happen to be when I founded the earth? Tell me, if you do know understanding. Who set its measurements, in case you know, or who stretched out upon it the measuring line? Into what have its socket pedestals been sunk down, or who laid its cornerstone, when the morning stars joyfully cried out together, and all the sons of God began shouting in applause?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 38:4-7</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">God asked Job where man was when He created the earth. Was man perhaps engaged in earth’s founding or was he the architect who assisted in forming the model and then drew the dimensions by rule according to it? How far man was from having any hand in earth’s founding! Man was not even on the scene at the time of its founding. No man stretched out upon the earth any measuring line. Though hung upon nothing, the earth is established so that it cannot be moved. But who can tell upon what the foundations of it are fastened, that it may not sink with its own weight? Comparing the earth to a stupendous building, God asks Job, “Who laid its cornerstone?” Yes, who laid the cornerstone of this immense edifice, our earth, which itself bears all human edifices? Not man, for we are reminded that only angels jubilated in innumerable array, shouting in applause at God’s creating of the earth.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>SEA AND WAVES</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In lofty language the Creator asks more questions: “And who barricaded the sea with doors, which began to go forth as when it burst out from the womb; when I put the cloud as its garment and thick gloom as its swaddling band, and I proceeded to break up my regulation upon it and to set a bar and doors, and I went on to say, ‘This far you may come, and no farther; and here your <span id="page166" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="166" data-before-text="166"></span>proud waves are limited’?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 38:8-11</a>.</p>

<strong>Hebrew Poetry</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Some expressions in the Bible are obviously to be taken, not literally, but as figures of speech. It is evident that the earth does not rest on literal “socket pedestals” nor do its rivers actually “clap their hands.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101973090/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 38:4-6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101973090/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ps. 98:8</a>) Nevertheless, very clear truths are being stated when such expressions are used: the earth <em>is</em> immovably set by changeless laws, and rivers <em>do</em> produce handlike waves that noisily slap at their banks. While this variation in style from ordinary prose is usually obvious and therefore understood, other points about Hebrew poetry may not be.</p>

Since the God of creation runs or rules the great establishment as a whole, he must also be the ruler of the earth. His rulership, not that of human creatures on the earth, is the true, original, rightful rulership for the earth. A Creator should run his own creation. Man had nothing to do with creating this earth as his everlasting home. On this vital point the same questions deserve to be put to modern-day scientists and evolutionists that were put to the patriarch Job by God respecting the creation of the earth.

Those whom God here calls “the morning stars” and “all the sons of God” witnessed the creating of the earth and they were all delighted with this tiny part of the visible “establishment.” Well, then, do we inferior human creatures have any reason to criticize God for the way that he created our earthly home? When God finished the preparing of it for man’s dwelling place and put man upon it, then, as the last verse of the first chapter of the Holy Bible says, “God saw everything he had made and, look! it was very good.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972801/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 1:31</a>) Since the Creator himself looked at his earthly creation and considered it to be “very good,” who are we who have come on the scene six thousand years later to say that it was not “very good” from our human viewpoint?

Man’s littleness contrasted with God’s greatness is the subject of a speech given by Almighty God to his faithful servant Job. Using language of incomparable grandeur, the Most High God describes his works of creation, which give humans a view of the true size of themselves.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">As you read portions of the Almighty’s speech, which has been described as “a series of questions following each other like claps of thunder,” put yourself in Job’s place. Imagine how Job felt when he heard these words from his Creator:</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Where did you happen to be when I founded the earth? Tell me, if you do know understanding. Who set its measurements, in case you know, or who stretched out upon it the measuring line? Into what have its socket pedestals been sunk down, or who laid its cornerstone, when the morning stars joyfully cried out together, and all the sons of God began shouting in applause?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 38:4-7</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">God asked Job where man was when He created the earth. Was man perhaps engaged in earth’s founding or was he the architect who assisted in forming the model and then drew the dimensions by rule according to it? How far man was from having any hand in earth’s founding! Man was not even on the scene at the time of its founding. No man stretched out upon the earth any measuring line. Though hung upon nothing, the earth is established so that it cannot be moved. But who can tell upon what the foundations of it are fastened, that it may not sink with its own weight? Comparing the earth to a stupendous building, God asks Job, “Who laid its cornerstone?” Yes, who laid the cornerstone of this immense edifice, our earth, which itself bears all human edifices? Not man, for we are reminded that only angels jubilated in innumerable array, shouting in applause at God’s creating of the earth.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>SEA AND WAVES</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In lofty language the Creator asks more questions: “And who barricaded the sea with doors, which began to go forth as when it burst out from the womb; when I put the cloud as its garment and thick gloom as its swaddling band, and I proceeded to break up my regulation upon it and to set a bar and doors, and I went on to say, ‘This far you may come, and no farther; and here your <span id="page166" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="166" data-before-text="166"></span>proud waves are limited’?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 38:8-11</a>.</p>

<strong>Hebrew Poetry</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Some expressions in the Bible are obviously to be taken, not literally, but as figures of speech. It is evident that the earth does not rest on literal “socket pedestals” nor do its rivers actually “clap their hands.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101973090/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 38:4-6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101973090/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ps. 98:8</a>) Nevertheless, very clear truths are being stated when such expressions are used: the earth <em>is</em> immovably set by changeless laws, and rivers <em>do</em> produce handlike waves that noisily slap at their banks. While this variation in style from ordinary prose is usually obvious and therefore understood, other points about Hebrew poetry may not be.</p>

<strong>Cornerstone</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Figurative and Symbolic Use.</strong> Concerning the founding of the earth, God asked Job: “Who laid its cornerstone?” The earth, on which man resides and has erected many buildings, was thus likened to a gigantic edifice, a building with a cornerstone.

Man’s littleness contrasted with God’s greatness is the subject of a speech given by Almighty God to his faithful servant Job. Using language of incomparable grandeur, the Most High God describes his works of creation, which give humans a view of the true size of themselves.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">As you read portions of the Almighty’s speech, which has been described as “a series of questions following each other like claps of thunder,” put yourself in Job’s place. Imagine how Job felt when he heard these words from his Creator:</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Where did you happen to be when I founded the earth? Tell me, if you do know understanding. Who set its measurements, in case you know, or who stretched out upon it the measuring line? Into what have its socket pedestals been sunk down, or who laid its cornerstone, when the morning stars joyfully cried out together, and all the sons of God began shouting in applause?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 38:4-7</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">God asked Job where man was when He created the earth. Was man perhaps engaged in earth’s founding or was he the architect who assisted in forming the model and then drew the dimensions by rule according to it? How far man was from having any hand in earth’s founding! Man was not even on the scene at the time of its founding. No man stretched out upon the earth any measuring line. Though hung upon nothing, the earth is established so that it cannot be moved. But who can tell upon what the foundations of it are fastened, that it may not sink with its own weight? Comparing the earth to a stupendous building, God asks Job, “Who laid its cornerstone?” Yes, who laid the cornerstone of this immense edifice, our earth, which itself bears all human edifices? Not man, for we are reminded that only angels jubilated in innumerable array, shouting in applause at God’s creating of the earth.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>SEA AND WAVES</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In lofty language the Creator asks more questions: “And who barricaded the sea with doors, which began to go forth as when it burst out from the womb; when I put the cloud as its garment and thick gloom as its swaddling band, and I proceeded to break up my regulation upon it and to set a bar and doors, and I went on to say, ‘This far you may come, and no farther; and here your <span id="page166" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="166" data-before-text="166"></span>proud waves are limited’?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 38:8-11</a>.</p>

And God began calling the dry land Earth, but the bringing together of the waters he called Seas.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101985013/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Genesis 1:9, 10</a>) As usual, the account does not describe how this was done. No doubt, tremendous earth movements would have been involved in the formation of land areas. Geologists would explain such major upheavals as catastrophism. But Genesis indicates direction and control by a Creator.</p><p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="qu">15, 16. (a) What points were raised to Job about the earth? (b) How deep do the roots of continents and mountains go, and what is likened to a “cornerstone” for earth?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> In the Biblical account where God is described as questioning Job about his knowledge of the earth, a variety of developments concerning earth’s history are described: its measurements, its cloud masses, its seas and how their waves were limited by dry land​—many things in general about the creation, spanning long periods of time. Among these things, comparing earth to a building, the Bible says that God asked Job: “Into what have its socket pedestals been sunk down, or who laid its cornerstone?”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101985013/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 38:6</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><span id="page30" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="30" data-before-text="30"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Interestingly, like “socket pedestals,” earth’s crust is much thicker under continents and even more so under mountain ranges, pushing deep into the underlying mantle, like tree roots into soil. “The idea that mountains and continents had roots has been tested over and over again, and shown to be valid,” says <em>Putnam’s Geology.</em>⁠<sup>2</sup> Oceanic crust is only about 5 miles thick, but continental roots go down about 20 miles and mountain roots penetrate about twice that far. And all earth’s layers press inward upon earth’s core from all directions, making it like a great “cornerstone” of support.</p>

<strong>Hebrew Poetry</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Some expressions in the Bible are obviously to be taken, not literally, but as figures of speech. It is evident that the earth does not rest on literal “socket pedestals” nor do its rivers actually “clap their hands.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101973090/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 38:4-6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101973090/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ps. 98:8</a>) Nevertheless, very clear truths are being stated when such expressions are used: the earth <em>is</em> immovably set by changeless laws, and rivers <em>do</em> produce handlike waves that noisily slap at their banks. While this variation in style from ordinary prose is usually obvious and therefore understood, other points about Hebrew poetry may not be.</p>

Gird up your loins, please, like an able-bodied man, and let me question you, and you inform me.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001280/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Job 38:1-3</a>) This set the tone. It helped Job to adjust his thinking to the reality that he was standing before the Creator of the universe and that he was accountable to him. That is also a good thing for us and our contemporaries to do.

Yet, long before the time of Job, God created sons in his likeness—spirit persons, angels.

His rulership, not that of human creatures on the earth, is the true, original, rightful rulership for the earth. A Creator should run his own creation.

When God finished the preparing of it for man’s dwelling place and put man upon it, then, as the last verse of the first chapter of the Holy Bible says, “God saw everything he had made and, look! it was very good.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972801/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 1:31</a>) Since the Creator himself looked at his earthly creation and considered it to be “very good,” who are we who have come on the scene six thousand years later to say that it was not “very good” from our human viewpoint?

Bible evidence shows that this happened in the days of Noah, a distant descendant of Adam. At that time the majority of mankind refused to submit to God’s will, and numerous angels, contrary to the divine purpose respecting them, “forsook their own proper dwelling place” in the heavens and materialized human bodies so as to be able to have sexual relations with beautiful women on earth.

Further, contact with them has been made!</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">The superhuman, intelligent creatures that exist in outer space were created by Jehovah God. Their creation took place even before planet Earth was prepared for human habitation. In his Word the Bible Jehovah God speaks of the time that he founded the earth. At that time, he explains, “the morning stars joyfully cried out together, and all the sons of God began shouting in applause.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967801/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 38:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967801/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 7</a>) These “sons of God” are powerful angelic creatures who are indeed “far more skillful and knowledgeable than we.” In the past they were often used by God to communicate with humans.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">One such superhuman messenger, or angel, referred to in the Bible is named Gabriel. Some 2,500 years ago he was sent forth to communicate with the Israelite Daniel, as he explained: “O Daniel, now I have come forth to make you have insight with understanding. . . . I myself have come to make report.” Gabriel then proceeded to give the valuable information as to the exact time that the Messiah, mankind’s savior, would appear. And exactly at the end of the period indicated by Gabriel (which was sixty-nine weeks of years, or 483 years, after the command was issued to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem in 455 B.C.E.) Jesus was anointed at his baptism in 29 C.E. and became the Christ or Messiah! What a reliable and important message from the invisible area of “outer space”!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967801/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Dan. 9:22-25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967801/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Neh. 2:1-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967801/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Matt. 3:13-17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967801/2/3" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> Luke 3:21-23</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Later, when the time arrived for Jesus to be born as a human, Gabriel again was used; first to announce the birth of Jesus’ forerunner, John the Baptist, and then Jesus’ own birth. To John’s father, Zechariah, the materialized angel, Gabriel, said: “I am Gabriel, who stands near before God, and I was sent forth to speak with you and declare the good news of these things to you.” Then, about six months later, Gabriel appeared to the Jewish virgin Mary and proclaimed: “Look! you will conceive in your womb and give birth to a son, and you are to call his name Jesus.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967801/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 1:19,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967801/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 31</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Here are communications from the far reaches of space, yes, from one who stands right “near before God”! How much easier to understand are his messages than the coded communications radio astronomers hope to hear from space! And of what marvelous import these messages were​—preparing people for the appearance of the one through whom Jehovah God has made provision to save believing mankind!</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="ss"><strong>OTHER VISITATIONS FROM SPACE</strong></p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Not all earth visitations, however, have been by creatures sent by God with important communications from Him. In fact, a number of angelic sons of God rebelliously left their heavenly positions, came to earth in the form of men, and “went taking wives for themselves, namely, all whom they chose.” A disciple of Jesus Christ by the name of Jude said that these “angels that did not keep their original position but forsook their own proper dwelling place [God] has reserved . . . for the judgment of the great day,” at which time they will be destroyed.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967801/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 6:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967801/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Jude 6</a>.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Jesus’ apostle Peter also spoke of these powerful spirit creatures, and identified the time of their earth visitation. He said it was “when the patience of God was waiting in Noah’s days, while the ark was being constructed.” Yes, it was just prior to the “deluge upon a world of ungodly people.” The lawless conduct of these superhuman visitors from “outer space,” and the ungodly hybrid offspring produced from their “relations with the daughters <span id="page648" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="648" data-before-text="648"></span>of men,” contributed greatly to the wickedness of those pre-Flood days.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967801/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:19, 20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967801/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 2 Pet. 2:4, 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967801/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Gen. 6:4</a>.</p>

<strong>Does God Have a Son?</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The word “son” means “a human male considered with reference to his parents or either of them; a male descendant.” Every male child or person has to be the son of someone who as father produced or generated his life. Thus, because Abdallah begot or generated the life of the one who became <span id="page550" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="550" data-before-text="550"></span>the prophet Mohammed, Mohammed is said to be “the son of Abdallah.” Now, what about the first forefather of Mohammed and of us all, the first man Adam—who was his father? Adam had no <em>human</em> father, but still he had to be the son of someone. Of whom? God was his father. Hence Adam must have been the son of God. Correctly, the Book containing the most ancient history of the human race says, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965681/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 3:38</a>, that Adam was “the son of God.”</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Long before the creation of his <em>human</em> son Adam, God already had countless <em>spirit</em> sons, angels, all of whom got their life from the Father without sexual reproduction and birth. Jehovah asked Job: “Who is this that is obscuring counsel by words without knowledge? Gird up your loins, please, like an able-bodied man, and let me question you, and you inform me. Where did you happen to be when I founded the earth? Tell me, if you do know understanding. Who set its measurements, in case you know, or who stretched out upon it the measuring line? Into what have its socket pedestals been sunk down, or who laid its cornerstone, when the morning stars joyfully cried out together, and <em>all the sons of God</em> began shouting in applause?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965681/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 38:1-7</a>) Thus the Bible says Jehovah God has many sons, both angelic and human. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965681/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gen. 6:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965681/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Job 1:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965681/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Luke 3:38</a>) Would you deny it? “Have you come to know because at that time you were being born, and because in number your days are many?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965681/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 38:21</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">More than 1,500 years before the son of Abdallah was born at Mecca, about 570 C.E., the Bible recorded that God has a Son who is preeminent among all other sons of God. Now, suppose there is a dispute in your town about a person’s line of descent, some persons saying he is the son of So-and-So but others vehemently denying. The matter is referred for settlement. “Yes, he <em>is</em> the son of So-and-So,” says a very old man who is respected because he kept the village records before any of the disputants were born. “No,” asserts a councilor whose grandfather was the old historian’s playmate, “So-and-So had no son.” Whose testimony would you accept as authoritative? The councilor’s, just because he now happens to be a man of influence or perhaps because he is a relative of yours? Certainly not! You would rather believe the word and written evidence of the old historian, wouldn’t you? Sensibly! The Bible predates all other books; we should accept its answer to the question, Does God have a Son?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>WHAT IS HIS NAME?</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">God has many sons, you agree. But is there an outstanding one we might properly call <em>the</em> Son of God? And why? If you are disturbed or disappointed, do not be prejudiced if the book you consider holy does not specifically give the name of the true <em>Allah</em> or the name of his Son. On these vital questions the Holy Bible can challenge all other holy books with the question: “Who has gathered the wind in the hollow of both hands? Who has wrapped up the waters in a mantle? Who has made all the ends of the earth to rise? What is his name and what <em>the name of his son,</em> in case you know?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965681/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Prov. 30:4</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">This preeminent Son is the one of whom the Koran says God decreed “His name shall be, Messiah Jesus the son of Mary, illustrious in this world, and in the next.” (3:40) Yes, as a human he was the son of Mary, but who was the father responsible for Mary’s pregnancy, so that the child would be his son? Some stumble here by taking a carnal viewpoint. They imagine there was only one way for Mary to conceive and that was by having sexual relations, and ‘God is not a man to have <span id="page551" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="551" data-before-text="551"></span>sexual relations with a woman.’ But even the Koran teaches that Jesus was conceived by an act of the divine will.</p>

That these world powers have demon princes over them is seen from the fact that Persia did; as the Bible records, the demon “prince of the royal realm of Persia” interfered with one of God’s angelic messengers in the days of Daniel.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962886/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962886/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Dan. 10:13</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The dragon is said to have pulled down “a third of the stars of heaven.” In the Scriptures angels are referred to as stars, “morning stars.” The dragon’s pulling down these stars would well picture that he succeeded in drawing a number of faithful angels from Jehovah’s service and causing them to become demons.

However, note that the Bishop says that the omission of the definite article <em>the</em> before the Greek word <em>theós</em> makes the word <em>theós</em> like an adjective that “describes the nature of the Word” rather than identify his person. This fact accounts for it that some translators render it: “And the Word was divine.” That is not the same as saying that the Word was God and was identical with God. One grammarian would translate the passage: “And the Word was deity,” to bring out his view that the Word was not “all of God.”<a id="footnotesource5" data-fnid="5" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1962726/4">e</a> According to trinitarians the Word was only a third of God, a coequal Second Person in a three-in-one God.

Far from it! The religion of Babylon was the original post-Flood sectarian religion, set up in opposition to Almighty God. It is a religion of the dead, and not of the living. To this day the chief duty of many of her priests is to bury the dead and to intone prayers on behalf of the dead. Whether in the West or in the Orient, or in Moscow’s Red Square, she continues to enshrine and glorify the ancestral “greats,” while ignoring Jehovah, the God of life. All who seek life with joy must heed heaven’s pronouncement of doom against modern Babylon: “Get out of her, my people, if you do not want to share with her in her sins, and if you do not want to receive part of her plagues.

Just as it is important to see worldly religion today in its true perspective as a worldwide system of sectarian confusion, so it is necessary to get the right perspective on the true religion. First, let it be noted that this is no man-made religion. It is not the religion of <em>your</em> choice, but the religion that Jehovah God has chosen, not only for mankind, but for all obedient creatures in His vast creation. It is far, far older than Babylon’s brief 4,000 years. The true religion centers in no earthly palace or temple, but in the exalted presence of Jehovah God, the eternal King and the Source of all life and energy in the universe.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961121/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isa. 66:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961121/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Ps. 10:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961121/17/2" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 36:9</a>.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">14.

It is known because it is written in the Bible, which is the oldest and most reliable record, both historical and prophetic, on the vital matter of religion. The opening part of the Bible is “a history of the heavens and the earth in the time of their being created, in the day that Jehovah God made earth and heaven.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961121/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Gen. 1:1–2:4</a>) However, the Bible also shows that Jehovah brought forth a glorious spirit creation of “sons of God” long before he laid the material foundations of this earth. The first of these spirit sons is called “the Word of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961121/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Rev. 19:13</a>) He is also described under the figure of “Wisdom” and as saying, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961121/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Proverbs 8:22-31</a>: “Jehovah himself produced me as the beginning of his way, the earliest of his achievements of long ago. From time indefinite I was installed, from the start, from times earlier than the earth. . . . Then I came to be beside him as a master worker and I came to be what he was specially fond of day by day, I being glad before him all the time.” With joy of heart the Son worshiped the Father, obediently carrying out the divine will as a master worker.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">15.

These sons were present at the creation of the earth, as Jehovah later explained to his human servant Job: “Where did you happen to be when I founded the earth? . . . When the morning stars joyfully cried out together, and all the sons of God began shouting in applause?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961121/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Job 38:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961121/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 7</a>) Is it to be supposed that these sons of God stood idly by, applauding while Jehovah and his first Son did all the work? Rather, it is certain that all His sons had assignments of work, in harmony with Jehovah’s will <span id="page106" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="106" data-before-text="106"></span>and purpose, and that in their obedient, devoted service they gave worship to Jehovah.

<strong>Part 2—What Do the Scriptures Say About “Survival After Death”?</strong><br/><p id="p46" data-pid="46" data-rel-pid="[86]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="31"><sup>31</sup></span> What, though, if spirit mediums or fortunetellers or astrologers or users of Ouija boards or planchettes make predictions and those predictions come true? Still this does not prove spiritism or spiritualism true, the right religion. Why not? Because <span id="page570" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="570" data-before-text="570"></span>this goes contrary to Jehovah God’s commandments and it turns those who rely on such spiritistic things away from God’s approved means of giving hidden knowledge and of prophesying concerning the future. It also works in support of the great lie concerning Jehovah’s Godship and concerning the dead, and so leads into error. God’s law commands: “In case a prophet or a dreamer of a dream should arise in your midst and he does give you a sign or a portent and the sign or the portent does come true of which he spoke to you, saying, ‘Let us walk after other gods, whom you have not known, and let us serve them,’” what then? “You must not listen to the words of that prophet or to the dreamer of that dream, because Jehovah your God is testing you to know whether you are loving Jehovah your God with all your heart and all your soul. . . . And that prophet or that dreamer of the dream should be put to death, because he has spoken of revolt against Jehovah your God, who has brought you out of the land of Egypt and has redeemed you from the house of slaves, to turn you from the way in which Jehovah your God has commanded you to walk, and you must clear out what is evil from your midst.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955685/65/0" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Deut. 13:1-5</a>, <em>NW</em>) A prediction that comes true but that is used to turn you from Jehovah the only living and true God is a false disguise to throw you off your guard and to mislead you away from the divine source of life and truth. It is meant to bring you under the power of the “father of the lie,” Satan the Devil, the “ruler of the demons.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955685/66/0" data-bid="67-1" class="b">John 8:44</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p87" data-pid="87" class="qu">32.

He knows their methods of operation and the destruction they cause to their victims. In his written Word he therefore warns his people and those who want salvation against these unseen wicked intelligences. To believe in the existence of demons is not superstition. It is not only Christian but also scientific to believe in the existence of demons and to believe in a spirit realm, for there is where the invisible Creator, God, who is spirit, dwells and he is certainly not alone in that vast, immeasurable spirit realm. Unknown time before he created our 4 1⁄2-billion-year-old visible universe Jehovah God made his first creation. It was a spiritual creation, namely, his beloved “only-begotten Son,” the “firstborn of all creation,” who in due time came to earth and became the “man Christ Jesus.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955685/67/0" data-bid="68-1" class="b">John 3:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955685/67/1" data-bid="68-2" class="b"> Col. 1:15</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955685/68/0" data-bid="69-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:5</a>) Then by him Jehovah made other intelligent creations also spiritual ones, namely, all the glorious, perfect, holy angels, and it was these spirit “sons of God” that “shouted for joy” at the creation of our earth for mankind’s everlasting home. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955685/69/0" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Ps. 104:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955685/69/1" data-bid="70-2" class="b"> 103:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955685/69/2" data-bid="70-3" class="b"> Job 38:4-7</a>) Thus the spirit realm existed before ever our material universe came into being. The marvelously designed, visible material creation testifies to the existence, power and intelligence of the great Spirit Creator, Jehovah God. Materialistic scientists are without excuse for their unbelief toward him. “For his invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are understood by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship, so that they are inexcusable.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955685/70/0" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Rom. 1:20</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="qu">33, 34.

Such a belief may <span id="page571" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="571" data-before-text="571"></span>have come from the Orient or the East, but it has not brought any enlightenment to mankind. Rather it has bedarkened their minds to the truth. The Occident or the West has come under such darkness and so has no light to give. The teaching of “survival after death” is not light, and Shaw Desmond is unfortunately mistaken when he, in his book entitled “We Do Not Die,” says: “Spiritually starved, Europe no longer looks to the East for light, for light no longer comes from the East but from the West. The East is still, <em>though it will not always be</em> indifferent to the light which it once gave to a darkened world, that light of the World, which in its ultimate analysis may be called the light of ‘Survival.’” Spiritualism, with its doctrine of “survival,” has only come into existence since the flood of Noah’s day in 2370 B.C.</p>

Since the God of creation runs or rules the great establishment as a whole, he must also be the ruler of the earth. His rulership, not that of human creatures on the earth, is the true, original, rightful rulership for the earth. A Creator should run his own creation. Man had nothing to do with creating this earth as his everlasting home. On this vital point the same questions deserve to be put to modern-day scientists and evolutionists that were put to the patriarch Job by God respecting the creation of the earth.

<strong>A Lesson in Man’s Littleness</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In lofty language the Creator asks more questions: “And who barricaded the sea with doors, which began to go forth as when it burst out from the womb; when I put the cloud as its garment and thick gloom as its swaddling band, and I proceeded to break up my regulation upon it and to set a bar and doors, and I went on to say, ‘This far you may come, and no farther; and here your <span id="page166" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="166" data-before-text="166"></span>proud waves are limited’?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 38:8-11</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Why, the mighty sea is but an infant in the hands of God! “I do not believe that this object,” writes Herder in <em>Spirit of Hebrew Poetry,</em> “was ever presented under a bolder figure than that by which it is expressed, of an infant which the Creator of the world swathes and clothes with its appropriate garments. It bursts forth from the clefts of the earth, as from the womb of its mother; the Ruler and Director of all things addresses it as a living being, as a young giant exulting in his subduing power, and with a word the sea is hushed, and obeys him forever.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">God has caused the mighty ocean to be confined as if by doors, bolts and bars. Tides are marvelously limited and regulated by lunar and solar attractions, as well as by the amount of time that is required to remove any part of earth’s surface from under the immediate attractive influence of the moon and sun. When the tide appears as if to engulf the earth, it rolls back; but has any man a hand in contriving or effecting this?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Waves are a marvel in themselves, sometimes traveling at great speeds and reaching remarkable heights. Says the volume <em>The World of Water:</em></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">“The sea is never still. Even on the calmest summer day ripples will pattern its surface and a rhythmic swell will roll its stately procession of undulations from the horizon to the shore. These ripples and waves so characteristic of the sea are caused by disturbances on the surface or in the depths below. The wind is the source of most of them. A gentle breeze that merely touches the surface will raise a rash of ripples as it flits across the sea; a lusty gale blowing at 100 miles an hour or more can whip the surface into a storm that raises waves higher than a house. . . . Unlike sound and radio waves, sea-waves travel at all sorts of speeds depending on their wave-length—the distance from one crest to the next. As the wind continues to scourge them they grow higher and higher and move even faster until they break on some far-distant shore. As the waves are carried along under the influence of the wind their speed across the surface is increased until they are travelling almost as fast as the wind itself. Under these conditions the ponderous swell is given preference by the wind; energy is poured into the waves, enabling them to travel perhaps from one end of the ocean to the other. . . . The larger waves, rolling away on a journey of hundreds or even thousands of miles, may gather speed until they are travelling faster than the wind that created them. In the major oceans of the world the wind can pursue the waves it has raised for immense distances, until they are 30 feet or more in height.”</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">How fitting the term “proud waves”! Some of them are mammoth, yet the Creator says: “This far you may come, and no farther; and here your proud waves are limited.”</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>MORNING LIGHT</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Still more questions from the Almighty overwhelm Job: “Was it from your days onward that you commanded the morning? Did you cause the dawn to know its place, to take hold on the extremities of the earth, that the wicked ones might be shaken out from it? It transforms itself like clay under a seal, and things take their station as in clothing. And from the wicked ones their light is held back, and the high arm itself gets broken. Have you come to the sources of the sea, or in search of the watery deep have you walked about? Have the gates of death been uncovered to you, or the gates of deep shadow can you see? Have you intelligently considered the broad spaces of the earth? Tell, if you have come to know it all.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 38:12-18</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Those words should cause us to reflect: Was it any man who gave orders for the succession of night and day? The morning light is represented as laying hold of the ends of the earth and shaking the wicked out of it, as dust from a cloth. Dawn disperses evildoers; they scurry like beasts to their several dens and hiding places. “As <span id="page167" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="167" data-before-text="167"></span>for the eye of the adulterer, it has watched for evening darkness, saying, ‘No eye will behold me!’ And over his face he puts a covering. In the darkness he has dug into houses; by day they must keep themselves locked in.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 24:15, 16</a>) Did any man cause the dawn “to take hold on the extremities of the earth, that the wicked ones might be shaken out from it”?</p>

Therefore their ‘not defiling themselves with women’ and their being “virgins” would not mean that none of these 144,000 persons had ever been married, for the Scriptures do not forbid marriage to persons on earth who are to be joint heirs with Christ.

The larger waves, rolling away on a journey of hundreds or even thousands of miles, may gather speed until they are travelling faster than the wind that created them. In the major oceans of the world the wind can pursue the waves it has raised for immense distances, until they are 30 feet or more in height.”</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">How fitting the term “proud waves”! Some of them are mammoth, yet the Creator says: “This far you may come, and no farther; and here your proud waves are limited.”</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>MORNING LIGHT</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Still more questions from the Almighty overwhelm Job: “Was it from your days onward that you commanded the morning? Did you cause the dawn to know its place, to take hold on the extremities of the earth, that the wicked ones might be shaken out from it? It transforms itself like clay under a seal, and things take their station as in clothing. And from the wicked ones their light is held back, and the high arm itself gets broken. Have you come to the sources of the sea, or in search of the watery deep have you walked about? Have the gates of death been uncovered to you, or the gates of deep shadow can you see? Have you intelligently considered the broad spaces of the earth? Tell, if you have come to know it all.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 38:12-18</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Those words should cause us to reflect: Was it any man who gave orders for the succession of night and day? The morning light is represented as laying hold of the ends of the earth and shaking the wicked out of it, as dust from a cloth. Dawn disperses evildoers; they scurry like beasts to their several dens and hiding places. “As <span id="page167" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="167" data-before-text="167"></span>for the eye of the adulterer, it has watched for evening darkness, saying, ‘No eye will behold me!’ And over his face he puts a covering. In the darkness he has dug into houses; by day they must keep themselves locked in.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 24:15, 16</a>) Did any man cause the dawn “to take hold on the extremities of the earth, that the wicked ones might be shaken out from it”?</p>

Giving even slight attention to the earth’s motion, we must marvel that earth does not spin too rapidly, which would be disastrous, as we can easily realize.

<strong>Divine Rulership—Over Mankind at the Start</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Our earth is suspended in space upon nothing of a material kind. As that Book of books said in its account of the patriarch Job not quite three thousand five hundred years ago, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972801/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job chapter twenty-six, verse seven</a>: “He is stretching out the north over the empty place, hanging the earth upon nothing.” In comparison with the countless bodies in the heavens, our earth is like a mere speck of dust in the midst of a tremendous dust cloud. Since the God of creation runs or rules the great establishment as a whole, he must also be the ruler of the earth. His rulership, not that of human creatures on the earth, is the true, original, rightful rulership for the earth. A Creator should run his own creation. Man had nothing to do with creating this earth as his everlasting home. On this vital point the same questions deserve to be put to modern-day scientists and evolutionists that were put to the patriarch Job by God respecting the creation of the earth. To Job he said:</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> “Gird up your loins, please, like an able-bodied man, and let me question you, and you inform me. Where did you happen to be when I founded the earth? Tell me, if you do know understanding. Who set its measurements, in case you know, or who stretched out upon it the measuring line? Into what have its socket pedestals been sunk down, or who laid its cornerstone, when the morning stars joyfully cried out together, and all the sons of God began shouting in applause? . . . Was it from your days onward that you commanded the morning? Did you cause the dawn to know its place, to take hold on the extremities of the earth, that the wicked ones might be shaken out from it?”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972801/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 38:3-13</a>.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 6. (a) Whom did God say witnessed the creating of the earth? (b) Why are we in no position to pass judgment upon God’s pronouncement of six thousand years ago on his creative work?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> In answer to those questions, all of us today would have to say humbly that we were not on the scene. Those whom God here calls “the morning stars” and “all the sons of God” witnessed the creating of the earth and they were all delighted with this tiny part of the visible “establishment.” Well, then, do we inferior human creatures have any reason to criticize God for the way that he created our earthly home? When God finished the preparing of it for man’s dwelling place and put man upon it, then, as the last verse of the first chapter of the Holy Bible says, “God saw everything he had made and, look! it was very good.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972801/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 1:31</a>) Since the Creator himself looked at his earthly creation and considered it to be “very good,” who are we who have come on the scene six thousand years later to say that it was not “very good” from our human viewpoint? Who are we today to judge what the state of the earth was six thousand <span id="page647" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="647" data-before-text="647"></span>years ago when God created the first man and woman in human perfection and put them in a Paradise of Pleasure? The polluted condition of the earth today is no basis for true judgment.</p>

<strong>A Lesson in Man’s Littleness</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In lofty language the Creator asks more questions: “And who barricaded the sea with doors, which began to go forth as when it burst out from the womb; when I put the cloud as its garment and thick gloom as its swaddling band, and I proceeded to break up my regulation upon it and to set a bar and doors, and I went on to say, ‘This far you may come, and no farther; and here your <span id="page166" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="166" data-before-text="166"></span>proud waves are limited’?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 38:8-11</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Why, the mighty sea is but an infant in the hands of God! “I do not believe that this object,” writes Herder in <em>Spirit of Hebrew Poetry,</em> “was ever presented under a bolder figure than that by which it is expressed, of an infant which the Creator of the world swathes and clothes with its appropriate garments. It bursts forth from the clefts of the earth, as from the womb of its mother; the Ruler and Director of all things addresses it as a living being, as a young giant exulting in his subduing power, and with a word the sea is hushed, and obeys him forever.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">God has caused the mighty ocean to be confined as if by doors, bolts and bars. Tides are marvelously limited and regulated by lunar and solar attractions, as well as by the amount of time that is required to remove any part of earth’s surface from under the immediate attractive influence of the moon and sun. When the tide appears as if to engulf the earth, it rolls back; but has any man a hand in contriving or effecting this?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Waves are a marvel in themselves, sometimes traveling at great speeds and reaching remarkable heights. Says the volume <em>The World of Water:</em></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">“The sea is never still. Even on the calmest summer day ripples will pattern its surface and a rhythmic swell will roll its stately procession of undulations from the horizon to the shore. These ripples and waves so characteristic of the sea are caused by disturbances on the surface or in the depths below. The wind is the source of most of them. A gentle breeze that merely touches the surface will raise a rash of ripples as it flits across the sea; a lusty gale blowing at 100 miles an hour or more can whip the surface into a storm that raises waves higher than a house. . . . Unlike sound and radio waves, sea-waves travel at all sorts of speeds depending on their wave-length—the distance from one crest to the next. As the wind continues to scourge them they grow higher and higher and move even faster until they break on some far-distant shore. As the waves are carried along under the influence of the wind their speed across the surface is increased until they are travelling almost as fast as the wind itself. Under these conditions the ponderous swell is given preference by the wind; energy is poured into the waves, enabling them to travel perhaps from one end of the ocean to the other. . . . The larger waves, rolling away on a journey of hundreds or even thousands of miles, may gather speed until they are travelling faster than the wind that created them. In the major oceans of the world the wind can pursue the waves it has raised for immense distances, until they are 30 feet or more in height.”</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">How fitting the term “proud waves”!

<strong>Wonders of Creation Exalt Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">God next asks Job about the effects of light and other matters.

Jehovah says of the earth as the dawn progressively moves across its face from east to west: “It transforms itself like clay under a seal, and things take their station as in clothing.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974688/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 38:14</a>) Just as a seal was anciently rolled across the clay, leaving its clear imprint, so the light of morning reveals the things on earth, these suddenly taking form in all their variegated colors and hues, just as a beautiful garment. In the same manner Jehovah’s spiritual light reveals the outcome of his purposes in all their beauty. At first the things he promises are seen only in dim outline. Then, as time progresses, we can see things taking shape.</p>

<strong>Divine Rulership—Over Mankind at the Start</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Our earth is suspended in space upon nothing of a material kind. As that Book of books said in its account of the patriarch Job not quite three thousand five hundred years ago, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972801/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job chapter twenty-six, verse seven</a>: “He is stretching out the north over the empty place, hanging the earth upon nothing.” In comparison with the countless bodies in the heavens, our earth is like a mere speck of dust in the midst of a tremendous dust cloud. Since the God of creation runs or rules the great establishment as a whole, he must also be the ruler of the earth. His rulership, not that of human creatures on the earth, is the true, original, rightful rulership for the earth. A Creator should run his own creation. Man had nothing to do with creating this earth as his everlasting home. On this vital point the same questions deserve to be put to modern-day scientists and evolutionists that were put to the patriarch Job by God respecting the creation of the earth. To Job he said:</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> “Gird up your loins, please, like an able-bodied man, and let me question you, and you inform me. Where did you happen to be when I founded the earth? Tell me, if you do know understanding. Who set its measurements, in case you know, or who stretched out upon it the measuring line? Into what have its socket pedestals been sunk down, or who laid its cornerstone, when the morning stars joyfully cried out together, and all the sons of God began shouting in applause? . . . Was it from your days onward that you commanded the morning? Did you cause the dawn to know its place, to take hold on the extremities of the earth, that the wicked ones might be shaken out from it?”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972801/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 38:3-13</a>.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 6. (a) Whom did God say witnessed the creating of the earth? (b) Why are we in no position to pass judgment upon God’s pronouncement of six thousand years ago on his creative work?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> In answer to those questions, all of us today would have to say humbly that we were not on the scene. Those whom God here calls “the morning stars” and “all the sons of God” witnessed the creating of the earth and they were all delighted with this tiny part of the visible “establishment.” Well, then, do we inferior human creatures have any reason to criticize God for the way that he created our earthly home? When God finished the preparing of it for man’s dwelling place and put man upon it, then, as the last verse of the first chapter of the Holy Bible says, “God saw everything he had made and, look! it was very good.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972801/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 1:31</a>) Since the Creator himself looked at his earthly creation and considered it to be “very good,” who are we who have come on the scene six thousand years later to say that it was not “very good” from our human viewpoint? Who are we today to judge what the state of the earth was six thousand <span id="page647" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="647" data-before-text="647"></span>years ago when God created the first man and woman in human perfection and put them in a Paradise of Pleasure? The polluted condition of the earth today is no basis for true judgment.</p>

<strong>A Lesson in Man’s Littleness</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In lofty language the Creator asks more questions: “And who barricaded the sea with doors, which began to go forth as when it burst out from the womb; when I put the cloud as its garment and thick gloom as its swaddling band, and I proceeded to break up my regulation upon it and to set a bar and doors, and I went on to say, ‘This far you may come, and no farther; and here your <span id="page166" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="166" data-before-text="166"></span>proud waves are limited’?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 38:8-11</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Why, the mighty sea is but an infant in the hands of God! “I do not believe that this object,” writes Herder in <em>Spirit of Hebrew Poetry,</em> “was ever presented under a bolder figure than that by which it is expressed, of an infant which the Creator of the world swathes and clothes with its appropriate garments. It bursts forth from the clefts of the earth, as from the womb of its mother; the Ruler and Director of all things addresses it as a living being, as a young giant exulting in his subduing power, and with a word the sea is hushed, and obeys him forever.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">God has caused the mighty ocean to be confined as if by doors, bolts and bars. Tides are marvelously limited and regulated by lunar and solar attractions, as well as by the amount of time that is required to remove any part of earth’s surface from under the immediate attractive influence of the moon and sun. When the tide appears as if to engulf the earth, it rolls back; but has any man a hand in contriving or effecting this?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Waves are a marvel in themselves, sometimes traveling at great speeds and reaching remarkable heights. Says the volume <em>The World of Water:</em></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">“The sea is never still. Even on the calmest summer day ripples will pattern its surface and a rhythmic swell will roll its stately procession of undulations from the horizon to the shore. These ripples and waves so characteristic of the sea are caused by disturbances on the surface or in the depths below. The wind is the source of most of them. A gentle breeze that merely touches the surface will raise a rash of ripples as it flits across the sea; a lusty gale blowing at 100 miles an hour or more can whip the surface into a storm that raises waves higher than a house. . . . Unlike sound and radio waves, sea-waves travel at all sorts of speeds depending on their wave-length—the distance from one crest to the next. As the wind continues to scourge them they grow higher and higher and move even faster until they break on some far-distant shore. As the waves are carried along under the influence of the wind their speed across the surface is increased until they are travelling almost as fast as the wind itself. Under these conditions the ponderous swell is given preference by the wind; energy is poured into the waves, enabling them to travel perhaps from one end of the ocean to the other. . . . The larger waves, rolling away on a journey of hundreds or even thousands of miles, may gather speed until they are travelling faster than the wind that created them. In the major oceans of the world the wind can pursue the waves it has raised for immense distances, until they are 30 feet or more in height.”</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">How fitting the term “proud waves”! Some of them are mammoth, yet the Creator says: “This far you may come, and no farther; and here your proud waves are limited.”</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>MORNING LIGHT</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Still more questions from the Almighty overwhelm Job: “Was it from your days onward that you commanded the morning? Did you cause the dawn to know its place, to take hold on the extremities of the earth, that the wicked ones might be shaken out from it? It transforms itself like clay under a seal, and things take their station as in clothing. And from the wicked ones their light is held back, and the high arm itself gets broken. Have you come to the sources of the sea, or in search of the watery deep have you walked about? Have the gates of death been uncovered to you, or the gates of deep shadow can you see? Have you intelligently considered the broad spaces of the earth? Tell, if you have come to know it all.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 38:12-18</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Those words should cause us to reflect: Was it any man who gave orders for the succession of night and day? The morning light is represented as laying hold of the ends of the earth and shaking the wicked out of it, as dust from a cloth. Dawn disperses evildoers; they scurry like beasts to their several dens and hiding places. “As <span id="page167" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="167" data-before-text="167"></span>for the eye of the adulterer, it has watched for evening darkness, saying, ‘No eye will behold me!’ And over his face he puts a covering. In the darkness he has dug into houses; by day they must keep themselves locked in.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 24:15, 16</a>) Did any man cause the dawn “to take hold on the extremities of the earth, that the wicked ones might be shaken out from it”?</p>

<strong>Earth</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><strong>Figurative and Symbolic Expressions.</strong> The earth is spoken of figuratively in several instances. It is likened to a building, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001239/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Job 38:4-6</a>, when Jehovah asks Job questions concerning earth’s creation and Jehovah’s management of it that Job obviously cannot answer. Jehovah also uses a figurative expression describing the result of earth’s rotation. He says: “[The earth] transforms itself like clay under a seal.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001239/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Job 38:14</a>) In Bible times some seals for “signing” documents were in the form of a roller engraved with the writer’s emblem. It was rolled over the soft clay document or clay envelope, leaving behind it an impression in the clay. In similar manner, at the arrival of dawn, the portion of the earth coming from the blackness of night begins to show itself to have form and color as the sunlight moves progressively across its face. The heavens, the location of Jehovah’s throne, being higher than the earth, the earth is, figuratively, his footstool.

This rotation causes the morning dawn, often stunningly beautiful. As the sun rises, features of our globe become clearer, like clay being transformed under a seal. Giving even slight attention to the earth’s motion, we must marvel that earth does not spin too rapidly, which would be disastrous, as we can easily realize. Neither does it rotate so slowly that days and nights, being much longer, would bring extremes of heat and cold that would make human life impossible.

<strong>A Lesson in Man’s Littleness</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In lofty language the Creator asks more questions: “And who barricaded the sea with doors, which began to go forth as when it burst out from the womb; when I put the cloud as its garment and thick gloom as its swaddling band, and I proceeded to break up my regulation upon it and to set a bar and doors, and I went on to say, ‘This far you may come, and no farther; and here your <span id="page166" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="166" data-before-text="166"></span>proud waves are limited’?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 38:8-11</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Why, the mighty sea is but an infant in the hands of God! “I do not believe that this object,” writes Herder in <em>Spirit of Hebrew Poetry,</em> “was ever presented under a bolder figure than that by which it is expressed, of an infant which the Creator of the world swathes and clothes with its appropriate garments. It bursts forth from the clefts of the earth, as from the womb of its mother; the Ruler and Director of all things addresses it as a living being, as a young giant exulting in his subduing power, and with a word the sea is hushed, and obeys him forever.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">God has caused the mighty ocean to be confined as if by doors, bolts and bars. Tides are marvelously limited and regulated by lunar and solar attractions, as well as by the amount of time that is required to remove any part of earth’s surface from under the immediate attractive influence of the moon and sun. When the tide appears as if to engulf the earth, it rolls back; but has any man a hand in contriving or effecting this?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Waves are a marvel in themselves, sometimes traveling at great speeds and reaching remarkable heights. Says the volume <em>The World of Water:</em></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">“The sea is never still. Even on the calmest summer day ripples will pattern its surface and a rhythmic swell will roll its stately procession of undulations from the horizon to the shore. These ripples and waves so characteristic of the sea are caused by disturbances on the surface or in the depths below. The wind is the source of most of them. A gentle breeze that merely touches the surface will raise a rash of ripples as it flits across the sea; a lusty gale blowing at 100 miles an hour or more can whip the surface into a storm that raises waves higher than a house. . . . Unlike sound and radio waves, sea-waves travel at all sorts of speeds depending on their wave-length—the distance from one crest to the next. As the wind continues to scourge them they grow higher and higher and move even faster until they break on some far-distant shore. As the waves are carried along under the influence of the wind their speed across the surface is increased until they are travelling almost as fast as the wind itself. Under these conditions the ponderous swell is given preference by the wind; energy is poured into the waves, enabling them to travel perhaps from one end of the ocean to the other. . . . The larger waves, rolling away on a journey of hundreds or even thousands of miles, may gather speed until they are travelling faster than the wind that created them. In the major oceans of the world the wind can pursue the waves it has raised for immense distances, until they are 30 feet or more in height.”</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">How fitting the term “proud waves”! Some of them are mammoth, yet the Creator says: “This far you may come, and no farther; and here your proud waves are limited.”</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>MORNING LIGHT</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Still more questions from the Almighty overwhelm Job: “Was it from your days onward that you commanded the morning? Did you cause the dawn to know its place, to take hold on the extremities of the earth, that the wicked ones might be shaken out from it? It transforms itself like clay under a seal, and things take their station as in clothing. And from the wicked ones their light is held back, and the high arm itself gets broken. Have you come to the sources of the sea, or in search of the watery deep have you walked about? Have the gates of death been uncovered to you, or the gates of deep shadow can you see? Have you intelligently considered the broad spaces of the earth? Tell, if you have come to know it all.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 38:12-18</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Those words should cause us to reflect: Was it any man who gave orders for the succession of night and day? The morning light is represented as laying hold of the ends of the earth and shaking the wicked out of it, as dust from a cloth. Dawn disperses evildoers; they scurry like beasts to their several dens and hiding places. “As <span id="page167" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="167" data-before-text="167"></span>for the eye of the adulterer, it has watched for evening darkness, saying, ‘No eye will behold me!’ And over his face he puts a covering. In the darkness he has dug into houses; by day they must keep themselves locked in.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 24:15, 16</a>) Did any man cause the dawn “to take hold on the extremities of the earth, that the wicked ones might be shaken out from it”?</p>

<strong>Earth</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The Bible, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Job 26:7</a>, speaks of God as “hanging the earth upon nothing.” Science says that the earth remains in its orbit in space primarily due to the interaction of gravity and centrifugal force. These forces, of course, are invisible. Therefore the earth, as other heavenly bodies, is suspended in space as if hanging on nothing. Speaking from Jehovah’s viewpoint, the prophet Isaiah says: “There is One who is dwelling above the circle of the earth, the dwellers in which are as grasshoppers.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Isa. 40:22</a>) The Bible says: “He [God] has described a circle upon the face of the waters.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Job 26:10</a>) The waters are limited by his decree to their proper place. They do not come up and inundate the land; neither do they fly off into space. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Job 38:8-11</a>) From the viewpoint of Jehovah, the earth’s face, or the surface of the waters, would, of course, have a circular form, <span id="page477" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="477" data-before-text="477"></span>just as the edge of the moon presents a circular appearance to us. Before land surfaces appeared, the surface of the entire globe was one circular (spherical) mass of surging waters.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Gen. 1:2</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Bible writers often speak from the standpoint of the observer on the earth, or from his particular position geographically, as we often naturally do today. For example, the Bible mentions the “sunrising.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Num. 2:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/44/1" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> 34:15</a>) Some have seized upon this as an opportunity to discredit the Bible as scientifically inaccurate, claiming that the Hebrews viewed earth as the center of things, with the sun revolving around it. But the Bible writers nowhere expressed such a belief. These same critics overlook the fact that they themselves use the identical expression and that it is in all their almanacs. It is common to hear someone say, “it is sunrise,” or “the sun has set,” or “the sun traveled across the sky.” The Bible also speaks of “the extremity of the earth” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Ps. 46:9</a>), “the ends of the earth” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Ps. 22:27</a>), “the four extremities of the earth” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Isa. 11:12</a>), “the four corners of the earth” and “the four winds of the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Rev. 7:1</a>) These expressions cannot be taken to prove that the Hebrews understood the earth to be square. The number four is often used to denote that which is fully rounded out, as it were, just as we have four directions an] sometimes employ the expressions “to the ends of the earth,” “to the four quarters of the earth” in the sense of embracing all the earth.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Ezekiel 1:15-17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/49/1" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> Luke 13:29</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">The Bible describes the earth as having an expanse or firmament, an atmosphere, and indicates that prior to the Flood there was a heavy canopy of water vapor above the expanse. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Gen. 1:6-8</a>) The expanse was an air-filled space between the earth and these waters above. The apostle Peter therefore describes the situation as “an earth standing compactly out of water and in the midst of water.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:5</a>) It seems that, because of such an arrangement, the ground was watered by a mist rather than a direct rain.

Even frozen mammals of tropical habitat have been found in far-northern areas. McReady Price states the following in his book <em>The New Geology:</em> “There is but one climate known to the ancient fossil world, as revealed by the plants and animals entombed in the rocks; and that climate was a mantle of springlike loveliness which seems to have prevailed continuously over the whole globe. Just how the world could have been thus warmed all over may be a matter of conjecture; that it was so warmed effectively and continuously is a matter of fact.” And George Gamow, in his book <em>Biography of the Earth,</em> 1948, writes: “While the areas now covered by temperate vegetation were occupied by tropical jungles, such ordinary trees as oak, chestnut, and maple were growing in Alaska, Greenland, Spitsbergen, and Northern Asia. Finally, the typical boreal plants, such as dwarf birch and dwarf willow, were very common in regions which are so far north that no vegetation at all can grow there today. Data concerning the Southern Hemisphere are again rather meagre, but the finding of coal deposits in several places along the shore of Antarctica indisputably proves that there were times when this continent, at present almost completely glaciated, was covered by rich vegetation.” These facts would support the above-mentioned vapor-canopy arrangement, which could bring about the conditions Biblically described and scientifically discovered.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>FIGURATIVE AND SYMBOLIC EXPRESSIONS</strong></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The earth is spoken of figuratively in several instances.

He says: “[The earth] transforms itself like clay under a seal.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Job 38:13, 14</a>) In Bible times some seals for “signing” documents were in the form of a roller engraved with the writer’s emblem. It was rolled over the soft clay document or clay envelope, leaving behind it an impression in the clay. In similar manner at the arrival of dawn, the portion of the earth coming from the blackness of night begins to show itself to have form and color as the sunlight moves progressively across its face. The heavens, the location of Jehovah’s throne, being higher than the earth, the earth is, figuratively, his footstool (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Ps. 103:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/56/1" data-bid="57-2" class="b"> Isa. 55:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/56/2" data-bid="57-3" class="b"> 66:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/56/3" data-bid="57-4" class="b"> Matt. 5:35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/56/4" data-bid="57-5" class="b"> Acts 7:49</a>) Those who are in Sheol or Hades, the common grave of mankind, are considered as being under the earth.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Rev. 5:3</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">The apostle Peter compares the literal heavens and earth (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/58/0" data-bid="59-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:5</a>) with the symbolic heavens and earth (vs. 7).

Darkness is their “light,” for they are accustomed to carry out their evil deeds under its cover and this figurative “light” is taken from them by the literal light of dawn.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Job 38:12-15</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Job 24:15-17</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">As the light of the sun is clearly observable, thus Jehovah’s adverse judgments are obvious.

<strong>Wonders of Creation Exalt Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span id="page14" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>In God’s hand, morning light is as a seal from which the earth gets a beautiful impression. Sunlight brings to view many colors, so that the globe seems to be arrayed in splendid garments. Job had nothing to do with this and had not walked about in the watery deep to take inventory of its treasures. Why, to this day researchers have only limited knowledge of oceanic life!</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204407/814/0">3/15/1962, pp. 165-167</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>A Lesson in Man’s Littleness</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In lofty language the Creator asks more questions: “And who barricaded the sea with doors, which began to go forth as when it burst out from the womb; when I put the cloud as its garment and thick gloom as its swaddling band, and I proceeded to break up my regulation upon it and to set a bar and doors, and I went on to say, ‘This far you may come, and no farther; and here your <span id="page166" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="166" data-before-text="166"></span>proud waves are limited’?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 38:8-11</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Why, the mighty sea is but an infant in the hands of God! “I do not believe that this object,” writes Herder in <em>Spirit of Hebrew Poetry,</em> “was ever presented under a bolder figure than that by which it is expressed, of an infant which the Creator of the world swathes and clothes with its appropriate garments. It bursts forth from the clefts of the earth, as from the womb of its mother; the Ruler and Director of all things addresses it as a living being, as a young giant exulting in his subduing power, and with a word the sea is hushed, and obeys him forever.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">God has caused the mighty ocean to be confined as if by doors, bolts and bars. Tides are marvelously limited and regulated by lunar and solar attractions, as well as by the amount of time that is required to remove any part of earth’s surface from under the immediate attractive influence of the moon and sun. When the tide appears as if to engulf the earth, it rolls back; but has any man a hand in contriving or effecting this?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Waves are a marvel in themselves, sometimes traveling at great speeds and reaching remarkable heights. Says the volume <em>The World of Water:</em></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">“The sea is never still. Even on the calmest summer day ripples will pattern its surface and a rhythmic swell will roll its stately procession of undulations from the horizon to the shore. These ripples and waves so characteristic of the sea are caused by disturbances on the surface or in the depths below. The wind is the source of most of them. A gentle breeze that merely touches the surface will raise a rash of ripples as it flits across the sea; a lusty gale blowing at 100 miles an hour or more can whip the surface into a storm that raises waves higher than a house. . . . Unlike sound and radio waves, sea-waves travel at all sorts of speeds depending on their wave-length—the distance from one crest to the next. As the wind continues to scourge them they grow higher and higher and move even faster until they break on some far-distant shore. As the waves are carried along under the influence of the wind their speed across the surface is increased until they are travelling almost as fast as the wind itself. Under these conditions the ponderous swell is given preference by the wind; energy is poured into the waves, enabling them to travel perhaps from one end of the ocean to the other. . . . The larger waves, rolling away on a journey of hundreds or even thousands of miles, may gather speed until they are travelling faster than the wind that created them. In the major oceans of the world the wind can pursue the waves it has raised for immense distances, until they are 30 feet or more in height.”</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">How fitting the term “proud waves”! Some of them are mammoth, yet the Creator says: “This far you may come, and no farther; and here your proud waves are limited.”</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>MORNING LIGHT</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Still more questions from the Almighty overwhelm Job: “Was it from your days onward that you commanded the morning? Did you cause the dawn to know its place, to take hold on the extremities of the earth, that the wicked ones might be shaken out from it? It transforms itself like clay under a seal, and things take their station as in clothing. And from the wicked ones their light is held back, and the high arm itself gets broken. Have you come to the sources of the sea, or in search of the watery deep have you walked about? Have the gates of death been uncovered to you, or the gates of deep shadow can you see? Have you intelligently considered the broad spaces of the earth? Tell, if you have come to know it all.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 38:12-18</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Those words should cause us to reflect: Was it any man who gave orders for the succession of night and day? The morning light is represented as laying hold of the ends of the earth and shaking the wicked out of it, as dust from a cloth. Dawn disperses evildoers; they scurry like beasts to their several dens and hiding places. “As <span id="page167" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="167" data-before-text="167"></span>for the eye of the adulterer, it has watched for evening darkness, saying, ‘No eye will behold me!’ And over his face he puts a covering.

As for darkness, where, now, is its place?” You may be aware that for a long time, the view prevailed that light travels like a wave, like the ripples we can watch in a pond. Then in 1905, Albert Einstein explained that light acts like packets, or particles, of energy. Did that settle matters? Well, a recent encyclopedia asks: “Is light a wave or a particle?” It answers: “Seemingly, [light] cannot be both because the two models [waves and particles] are so different. The best answer is that light is strictly neither.” Still, we keep on being warmed (directly and indirectly) by sunlight, even if no man is yet able to explain fully God’s works in this regard. We enjoy food and oxygen produced as plants respond to light. We can read, see the faces of our loved ones, gaze at sunsets, and on and on. As we do that, should we not acknowledge the wonderful works of God?​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001280/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Psalm 104:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001280/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 145:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001280/24/2" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> Isaiah 45:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001280/24/3" data-bid="25-4" class="b"> Jeremiah 31:35</a>.</p>

The hail now grew to the size of big lemons. . . . The storm raged for some while, but at last it stopped . . . We showed our scratches and bruises to each other; but about a mile farther on we came upon a scene of devastation which surpassed what we had suffered, and defies description. All the trees were stripped of their leaves and shattered; the beasts in the field lay dead; many of the herdsmen had also been killed; we observed large quantities of hailstones which could not have been grasped with two hands.”​—<em>Autobiography</em> (Book II, 50), <em>Harvard Classics,</em> Volume 31, pages 352-3.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">What will happen when Jehovah opens his storehouses of snow and hail against his enemies?

<strong>Give Attention to God’s Wonderful Works</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> At one point, God inquired of Job: “Have you entered into the storehouses of the snow, or do you see even the storehouses of the hail, which I have kept back for the time of distress, for the day of fight and war?” In many parts of our earth, snow and hail are part of life. God went on: “Who has divided a channel for the flood and a way for the thunderous storm cloud, to make it rain upon the land where there is no man, upon the wilderness in which there is no earthling man, to satisfy storm-stricken and desolate places and to cause the growth of grass to sprout? Does there exist a father for the rain, or who gave birth to the dewdrops? Out of whose belly does the ice actually come forth, and as for the hoarfrost of heaven, who indeed brings it to birth?”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001281/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 38:22, 23,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001281/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 25-29</a>.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu">4-6. In what sense is man’s knowledge of snow incomplete?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Some who live in a fast-paced society and who must travel may view snow merely as an obstacle. Yet, countless others view snow as a delight, producing a winter wonderland that opens up opportunities for special activities. With God’s question in mind, do you have an intimate knowledge of snow, even of what it looks like? Oh, we know what a <em>lot</em> of it looks like, perhaps from photos of snowbanks or because we have actually seen plenty of snow. But what of individual snowflakes? Do you know what they look like, maybe having examined them at their source?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Some men have spent decades studying and photographing snowflakes. A snowflake may be composed of a hundred delicate ice crystals in a variety of beautiful designs. The book <em>Atmosphere</em> says: “The endless variety of snowflakes is legendary, and although scientists insist that no law of nature forbids their duplication, two identical flakes have never been found. One search of epic proportions was conducted by . . . Wilson A. Bentley, who spent more than 40 years examining and photographing snowflakes through a microscope without ever finding two that were exactly alike.” And even if, in a rare case, two appeared to be twins, would that really alter the wonder of the staggering variety of snowflakes?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Recall God’s question: “Have you entered into the storehouses of the snow?” Many think of clouds as the storehouses of snow. Can you imagine going to these storehouses to inventory snowflakes in their infinite variety and to study how they came to be? A science encyclopedia says: “The nature and origin of the ice nuclei, which are necessary to induce freezing of cloud droplets at temperatures about -40°F (-40°C), are still not clear.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001281/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 147:16, 17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001281/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Isaiah 55:9, 10</a>.</p>

<strong>Give Attention to God’s Wonderful Works</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> David must have realized that since God has and controls tremendous power, he can direct it against any who merit his disfavor. For them, that is ominous. God asked Job: “Have you entered into the storehouses of the snow, or do you see even the storehouses of the hail, which I have kept back for the time of distress, for the day of fight and war?” Snow, hail, rainstorms, wind, and lightning are all in <span id="page12" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>his arsenal. And what staggeringly powerful natural forces they are!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001281/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Job 38:22, 23</a>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">16, 17.

To illustrate, toward the end of the year 1999, a vast storm struck southwestern Europe. It surprised even weather experts. Gale winds reached 125 miles per hour <strong>[200 km/​hr]</strong>, ripping off thousands of roofs, toppling electric-line pylons, and overturning trucks. Try to visualize this: That storm period uprooted or broke in half some 270 million trees, 10,000 in just the park of Versailles, outside Paris. Millions of households lost electricity. The death toll was near 100. All of that in one brief period. What force!</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> One might call storms freak, undirected, uncontrolled occurrences. What, though, could happen if the all-powerful One performs wondrous works by using such forces in a controlled, directed way? He did something like that back in the days of Abraham, who learned that the Judge of all the earth had weighed the wickedness of two cities, Sodom and Gomorrah. They were so corrupt that cries over them ascended to God, who helped all righteous ones to escape the condemned cities. History reports: “Then Jehovah made it rain sulphur and fire from Jehovah, from the heavens,” upon those cities. That was a wondrous work, preserving righteous ones and destroying the hopelessly wicked.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001281/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Genesis 19:24</a>.</p>

<strong>What the Armageddon of the Bible Is</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">For those who thus align themselves against Jehovah God and his kingdom there is no hope for survival. While God may well cause the nations to turn against one another, resulting in much slaughter with their own weapons, as he did with the armies of Ammon, Moab and Mount Seir when they came up against his people in ancient times, he also has at his disposal <span id="page40" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="40" data-before-text="40"></span>all the forces of nature. These, too, he will unleash against his foes. And his appointed executioner Jesus Christ, with the angelic forces of heaven, will himself pursue the battle until the entire visible political organization under the control of Satan the Devil, “the god of this system of things,” with all its military and civilian supporters, is completely destroyed from the face of the earth.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964041/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Chron. 20:1-30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964041/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Judg. 5:19-21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964041/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Job 38:22, 23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964041/7/3" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> 2 Cor. 4:4</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">But does not Armageddon also include the destruction of the false religious element here on earth? No, it does not. As a reading of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964041/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Revelation chapters 17-19</a> shows, this is something that will have already been taken care of in the period immediately before Har–Magedon begins. The kings of the earth, symbolized by the “ten horns” of the wild beast of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964041/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Revelation chapter 17</a>, will turn on the harlotrous system of Babylonish religion and “these will hate the harlot and will make her devastated and naked, and will eat up her fleshy parts and will completely burn her with fire.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964041/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Rev. 17:16</a>) This takes place before the kings make their Armageddon war against the representatives of God’s kingdom on earth. In fact, their pursuit thereafter on to Har–Magedon is nothing more than a demonized attack against anything that stands in the way of their selfish aims to perpetuate themselves in national governments, political systems and international alliances. So, having rid themselves of the religious harlot, they are lured on to the attack against the Messianic kingdom of God, which they refuse to recognize as the rightful government over earth. The Kingdom preaching of Jehovah’s witnesses becomes the object of their wrath. This attack means war, “the war of the great day of God the Almighty,” Har–Magedon.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">What about Satan and his demons? Will they be killed or abyssed at the battle of Har–Magedon? No, this is something that comes <em>after</em> the battle of Har–Magedon is over. Then it is that the Angel of angels, Christ Jesus, comes “down out of heaven with the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand” to seize Satan and his demons and hurl them into a state of oblivion. Having witnessed first the destruction of the worldwide empire of false religion, then Har–Magedon from its start to its finish, they will be severely vexed through the humiliation of seeing that the apparently defenseless worshipers of Jehovah whom their human puppets sought to wipe out are the only ones left remaining in the earth.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964041/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rev. 20:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">It is among these worshipers of Jehovah that all lovers of righteousness want to be, and it is for this reason that we must understand what Armageddon really is and avoid the “inspired expressions” that endeavor to align men with the enemies of God at that universal war. False conceptions with regard to man’s immediate future can lead only to disaster. Watch for the outworking of God’s prophecies regarding the Armageddon of the Bible and work in harmony with his will for survival into a new order where “righteousness is to dwell.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964041/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:13</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Drawing Courage from the Word of God</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> The moon has been in orbit since long before men began their space programs, and it is not the kind of satellite that burns out after a few months. But it is only one of these heavenly bodies, none of which <span id="page556" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="556" data-before-text="556"></span>were put there by men. Why, the earth itself is a spaceship, and one with live cargo. Rather than just one human passenger, it has three billion of them and animals without number, and they are not all packed into space suits to survive. Great though the works of men appear in the eyes of men, they become downright pathetic when viewed alongside the handiwork of God. Men may have hydrogen bombs and missiles in their arsenals, but Jehovah God can turn loose earthquakes equivalent to thousands of hydrogen bombs, and unleash storms of hail against which they cannot make a counterattack. Even with a gentle snowfall he can immobilize their operations. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963682/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Josh. 10:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963682/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Job 38:22, 23</a>) The scientific achievements of the nations will not enable them to avoid being called to account for the blood they have spilled on this earth.

As Jesus told his followers: “People will lay their hands upon you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, you being haled before kings and governors for the sake of my name. . . . Moreover, you will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death; and you will be objects of hatred by all people because of my name.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963682/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Luke 21:12-17</a>) Nevertheless, this prospect does not cause those who have placed their trust in God to lose heart. Why not?</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">15. In the face of official persecution, how do the Scriptures help Christians to maintain courage?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> They draw courage from the Scriptures, which help them to view the matter in proper perspective, assuring them: “There is One who is dwelling above the circle of the earth, the dwellers in which are as grasshoppers, the One who is stretching out the heavens just as a fine gauze, who spreads them out like a tent in which to dwell, the One who is reducing high officials to nothing, who has made the very judges of the earth as a mere unreality.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963682/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Isa. 40:22, 23</a>) So perhaps certain rulers do ban true worship. They may declare it against the law to preach to persons of another religion. They may seize the children of Christian parents and give them a blood transfusion because those parents refuse to approve a violation of God’s law, and they may turn deaf ears to the appeals of those parents for justice. But Jehovah God has a different view of matters. He does not fail to observe what is going on, and he will reverse the unrighteous decrees of these men who abuse their authority.

The Scriptures offer no reason for courage to people of that sort. The ones who find cause for courage when they study God’s Word are those whose attitude is like that of the psalmist who wrote: “Instruct me, O Jehovah, in the way of your regulations, that I may observe it down to the last. Make me understand, that I may observe your law and <span id="page557" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="557" data-before-text="557"></span>that I may keep it with the whole heart.

But did Job or any man command all these beneficial and welcome changes? Does it depend on man’s care and management? Could any man supply the want of light if the sun’s beams should be withheld? Further, the vast ocean covers immense treasures and wonderful works of the Creator. Had Job walked about in the watery deep and taken inventory of its contents?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>SNOW AND HAIL</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Jehovah propounds more questions: “Where, now, is the way to where light resides? As for darkness, where, now, is its place, that you should take it to its boundary and that you should understand the roadways to its house? Have you come to know because at that time you were being born, and because in number your days are many? Have you entered into the storehouses of the snow, or do you see even the storehouses of the hail, which I have kept back for the time of distress, for the day of fight and war?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 38:19-23</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Has any man ever escorted either light or darkness back to its home or entered into the storehouses of snow and hail that God has kept back for “the time of distress”? Snow itself is a marvel—crystals in an endless variety of beautiful forms! With snow and hail God can fight as effectually, if he pleases, as with lightning or with the sword of an angel. Snow and hail will evidently be used against God’s enemies on “the day of fight and war,” the time of Armageddon. What man can escape hail from heaven if God directs it? “Hailstones” are mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezekiel 38:22</a> in reference to the means God will use to destroy the wicked hordes of humans under satanic leadership. At the battle of Gibeon in ancient times Jehovah used hailstones against his enemies: “There were more who died from the hailstones than those whom the sons of Israel killed with the sword.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Josh. 10:11</a>) A description of a hailstorm gives us an idea of what God can do on “the day of fight and war.” In his <em>Autobiography</em> (Book II, 50) the Italian sculptor Benvenuto Cellini related this experience:</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">“We were one day distant from Lyons . . . when the heavens began to thunder with sharp rattling claps. . . . After the thunder the heavens made a noise so great and horrible that I thought the last day had come; so I reined in for a moment, while a shower of hail began to fall without a drop of water. At first the hail was somewhat larger than pellets from a popgun, and when these struck me, they hurt considerably. Little by little it increased in size, until the stones might be compared to balls from a crossbow. My horse became restive with fright; so I wheeled round, and returned at a gallop to where I found my comrades taking refuge in a fir-wood. The hail now grew to the size of big lemons. . . . There fell a stone so huge that it smashed the thick branches of the pine under which I had retired for safety. Another of the hailstones hit my horse upon the head, and almost stunned him; one struck me also, but not directly, else it would have killed me. . . .</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">“The storm raged for some while, but at last it stopped; and we, who were pounded black and blue, scrambled as well as we could upon our horses. Pursuing the way to our lodging for the night, we showed our scratches and <span id="page168" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="168" data-before-text="168"></span>bruises to each other; but about a mile farther on we came upon a scene of devastation which surpassed what we had suffered, and defies description. All the trees were stripped of their leaves and shattered; the beasts in the field lay dead; many of the herdsmen had also been killed; we observed large quantities of hailstones which could not have been grasped with two hands.”—<em>Harvard Classics,</em> Vol. 31, pp. 352, 353.</p>

The most wonderful, the most awesome of all of Jehovah’s works is rushing in upon this generation of mankind. Now, before he unleashes the whirlwind of destruction, Jehovah addresses himself to integrity-keepers in his New World society: “Gird up your loins, please, like an able-bodied man.” Keep witnessing fearlessly, to the honor of Jehovah’s name! As Armageddon breaks, God himself will thunder “with his voice in a wonderful way, doing great things that we cannot know.” His armament of heaven will roar into action, striking more accurately than <span id="page495" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="495" data-before-text="495"></span>any missiles known to man. Who knows what cosmic or other forces Jehovah will call into play in destroying the wicked? “Have you entered into the storehouses of the snow, or do you see even the storehouses of the hail, which I have kept back for the time of distress, for the day of fight and war?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961603/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Job 37:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961603/51/1" data-bid="52-2" class="b"> 38:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961603/51/2" data-bid="52-3" class="b"> 3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961603/51/3" data-bid="52-4" class="b"> 22, 23</a>) Oh, may we all maintain our dedicated stand within Jehovah’s New World society down to Armageddon, and right through that wondrous time of battle!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961603/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">1 Cor. 16:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961603/52/1" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> Ps. 46:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">28.

<strong>The Great God Who Is “Doing Wondrous Things”</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> ‘With all his heart’ David could declare: “There is none like you among the gods, O Jehovah, neither are there any works like yours.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 86:8</a>) In David’s day, as today, the earth was <span id="page38" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="38" data-before-text="38"></span>filled with a multitude of gods. Though Buddha, Brahma, Confucius and Christendom’s triune “God” had not yet appeared to add confusion to the religious scene, there were a host of gods to be worshiped in the religions of Philistia, Assyria, Babylon and other nations surrounding Israel. As they went out to war, these nations carried images of their gods on staves, from which also fluttered their national pendants. Some of these gods, such as Molech of Ammon and Chemosh of Moab, were known as “fire gods,” and exacted human sacrifices. Baal of Peor was worshiped with lewd sex rites. David not only maintained separateness from this cruel, immoral world of confused religionists, but he removed their contaminating influence by driving them right out from the God-given land of Israel.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Deut. 11:22-25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2 Sam. 8:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 14</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 5.

The gods of worldly nations had left no such record; indeed, they had accomplished nothing worthy of praise or record. It is Jehovah alone, “the grand King” and who is “great and very much to be praised,” that has caused to be written down the record of his wondrous works and eternal purposes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ex. 17:14</a>) David exulted, not only in the divine promise of an everlasting Kingdom, but in all the other glorious prophecies looking down to our day.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 6.

It is the day to which David looked forward with joy. It is the day in which prophecy upon prophecy is coming to grand fulfillment. In the modern year of 1914 Jehovah established the everlasting kingdom of heaven in the hands of one greater than David, his Son Jesus Christ. In 1919 he brought forth on this earth a New World society to preach “this good news of the kingdom . . . for the purpose of a witness to all the nations.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>) As the nucleus of this New World society, the faithful remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses serve “as signs and as wonders,” to be seen by all men. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa. 8:18</a>) And now, in their hundreds of thousands, men of good will, “the precious things of all nations,” are flocking to the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses, for they see in it a peace and joy that contrast sharply with the old world’s divisions and hatreds.

It is even as David himself prophesied: “All the nations whom you have made will themselves come and they will bow down before you, O Jehovah, and will give glory to your name.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 86:9</a>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 7.

Jehovah will “set astonishing events on the earth” when he comes forth shortly to His war at Armageddon, where he will blot out “the present wicked system of things” with its politics and its militarism, its temples and its gods. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 46:8, 9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Job 38:22, 23</a>) Incomparable the wonders that Jehovah will then perform in robing this earth with paradisaic beauty and peace.

God went on: “Who has divided a channel for the flood and a way for the thunderous storm cloud, to make it rain upon the land where there is no man, upon the wilderness in which there is no earthling man, to satisfy storm-stricken and desolate places and to cause the growth of grass to sprout?

God went on: “Who has divided a channel for the flood and a way for the thunderous storm cloud, to make it rain upon the land where there is no man, upon the wilderness in which there is no earthling man, to satisfy storm-stricken and desolate places and to cause the growth of grass to sprout? Does there exist a father for the rain, or who gave birth to the dewdrops? Out of whose belly does the ice actually come forth, and as for the hoarfrost of heaven, who indeed brings it to birth?”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001281/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 38:22, 23,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001281/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 25-29</a>.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu">4-6.

With God’s question in mind, do you have an intimate knowledge of snow, even of what it looks like? Oh, we know what a <em>lot</em> of it looks like, perhaps from photos of snowbanks or because we have actually seen plenty of snow. But what of individual snowflakes?

One search of epic proportions was conducted by . . .

For them, that is ominous. God asked Job: “Have you entered into the storehouses of the snow, or do you see even the storehouses of the hail, which I have kept back for the time of distress, for the day of fight and war?” Snow, hail, rainstorms, wind, and lightning are all in <span id="page12" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>his arsenal.

To illustrate, toward the end of the year 1999, a vast storm struck southwestern Europe. It surprised even weather experts. Gale winds reached 125 miles per hour <strong>[200 km/​hr]</strong>, ripping off thousands of roofs, toppling electric-line pylons, and overturning trucks. Try to visualize this: That storm period uprooted or broke in half some 270 million trees, 10,000 in just the park of Versailles, outside Paris. Millions of households lost electricity. The death toll was near 100. All of that in one brief period.

What, though, could happen if the all-powerful One performs wondrous works by using such forces in a controlled, directed way? He did something like that back in the days of Abraham, who learned that the Judge of all the earth had weighed the wickedness of two cities, Sodom and Gomorrah. They were so corrupt that cries over them ascended to God, who helped all righteous ones to escape the condemned cities. History reports: “Then Jehovah made it rain sulphur and fire from Jehovah, from the heavens,” upon those cities. That was a wondrous work, preserving righteous ones and destroying the hopelessly wicked.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001281/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Genesis 19:24</a>.</p>

<strong>What the Armageddon of the Bible Is</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">For those who thus align themselves against Jehovah God and his kingdom there is no hope for survival. While God may well cause the nations to turn against one another, resulting in much slaughter with their own weapons, as he did with the armies of Ammon, Moab and Mount Seir when they came up against his people in ancient times, he also has at his disposal <span id="page40" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="40" data-before-text="40"></span>all the forces of nature. These, too, he will unleash against his foes. And his appointed executioner Jesus Christ, with the angelic forces of heaven, will himself pursue the battle until the entire visible political organization under the control of Satan the Devil, “the god of this system of things,” with all its military and civilian supporters, is completely destroyed from the face of the earth.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964041/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Chron. 20:1-30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964041/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Judg. 5:19-21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964041/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Job 38:22, 23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964041/7/3" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> 2 Cor. 4:4</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">But does not Armageddon also include the destruction of the false religious element here on earth? No, it does not. As a reading of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964041/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Revelation chapters 17-19</a> shows, this is something that will have already been taken care of in the period immediately before Har–Magedon begins. The kings of the earth, symbolized by the “ten horns” of the wild beast of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964041/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Revelation chapter 17</a>, will turn on the harlotrous system of Babylonish religion and “these will hate the harlot and will make her devastated and naked, and will eat up her fleshy parts and will completely burn her with fire.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964041/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Rev. 17:16</a>) This takes place before the kings make their Armageddon war against the representatives of God’s kingdom on earth. In fact, their pursuit thereafter on to Har–Magedon is nothing more than a demonized attack against anything that stands in the way of their selfish aims to perpetuate themselves in national governments, political systems and international alliances. So, having rid themselves of the religious harlot, they are lured on to the attack against the Messianic kingdom of God, which they refuse to recognize as the rightful government over earth. The Kingdom preaching of Jehovah’s witnesses becomes the object of their wrath. This attack means war, “the war of the great day of God the Almighty,” Har–Magedon.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">What about Satan and his demons? Will they be killed or abyssed at the battle of Har–Magedon? No, this is something that comes <em>after</em> the battle of Har–Magedon is over. Then it is that the Angel of angels, Christ Jesus, comes “down out of heaven with the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand” to seize Satan and his demons and hurl them into a state of oblivion. Having witnessed first the destruction of the worldwide empire of false religion, then Har–Magedon from its start to its finish, they will be severely vexed through the humiliation of seeing that the apparently defenseless worshipers of Jehovah whom their human puppets sought to wipe out are the only ones left remaining in the earth.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964041/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rev. 20:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">It is among these worshipers of Jehovah that all lovers of righteousness want to be, and it is for this reason that we must understand what Armageddon really is and avoid the “inspired expressions” that endeavor to align men with the enemies of God at that universal war. False conceptions with regard to man’s immediate future can lead only to disaster. Watch for the outworking of God’s prophecies regarding the Armageddon of the Bible and work in harmony with his will for survival into a new order where “righteousness is to dwell.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964041/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:13</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Drawing Courage from the Word of God</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> The moon has been in orbit since long before men began their space programs, and it is not the kind of satellite that burns out after a few months. But it is only one of these heavenly bodies, none of which <span id="page556" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="556" data-before-text="556"></span>were put there by men. Why, the earth itself is a spaceship, and one with live cargo. Rather than just one human passenger, it has three billion of them and animals without number, and they are not all packed into space suits to survive. Great though the works of men appear in the eyes of men, they become downright pathetic when viewed alongside the handiwork of God. Men may have hydrogen bombs and missiles in their arsenals, but Jehovah God can turn loose earthquakes equivalent to thousands of hydrogen bombs, and unleash storms of hail against which they cannot make a counterattack. Even with a gentle snowfall he can immobilize their operations.

As Jesus told his followers: “People will lay their hands upon you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, you being haled before kings and governors for the sake of my name. . . . Moreover, you will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death; and you will be objects of hatred by all people because of my name.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963682/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Luke 21:12-17</a>) Nevertheless, this prospect does not cause those who have placed their trust in God to lose heart. Why not?</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">15.

They may declare it against the law to preach to persons of another religion. They may seize the children of Christian parents and give them a blood transfusion because those parents refuse to approve a violation of God’s law, and they may turn deaf ears to the appeals of those parents for justice. But Jehovah God has a different view of matters. He does not fail to observe what is going on, and he will reverse the unrighteous decrees of these men who abuse their authority.

The Scriptures offer no reason for courage to people of that sort. The ones who find cause for courage when they study God’s Word are those whose attitude is like that of the psalmist who wrote: “Instruct me, O Jehovah, in the way of your regulations, that I may observe it down to the last. Make me understand, that I may observe your law and <span id="page557" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="557" data-before-text="557"></span>that I may keep it with the whole heart.

<strong>A Lesson in Man’s Littleness</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Those words should cause us to reflect: Was it any man who gave orders for the succession of night and day? The morning light is represented as laying hold of the ends of the earth and shaking the wicked out of it, as dust from a cloth. Dawn disperses evildoers; they scurry like beasts to their several dens and hiding places. “As <span id="page167" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="167" data-before-text="167"></span>for the eye of the adulterer, it has watched for evening darkness, saying, ‘No eye will behold me!’ And over his face he puts a covering. In the darkness he has dug into houses; by day they must keep themselves locked in.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 24:15, 16</a>) Did any man cause the dawn “to take hold on the extremities of the earth, that the wicked ones might be shaken out from it”?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Morning light—the seal the Almighty holds in his hand—causes the earth, like crude unformed clay, to receive a beautiful impression from it, so that it suddenly assumes distinct form. Sunlight brings to view many colors with which the earth is tinged, and the earth appears in fresh beauty, as arrayed in splendid garments. But did Job or any man command all these beneficial and welcome changes? Does it depend on man’s care and management? Could any man supply the want of light if the sun’s beams should be withheld? Further, the vast ocean covers immense treasures and wonderful works of the Creator. Had Job walked about in the watery deep and taken inventory of its contents?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>SNOW AND HAIL</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Jehovah propounds more questions: “Where, now, is the way to where light resides? As for darkness, where, now, is its place, that you should take it to its boundary and that you should understand the roadways to its house? Have you come to know because at that time you were being born, and because in number your days are many? Have you entered into the storehouses of the snow, or do you see even the storehouses of the hail, which I have kept back for the time of distress, for the day of fight and war?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 38:19-23</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Has any man ever escorted either light or darkness back to its home or entered into the storehouses of snow and hail that God has kept back for “the time of distress”? Snow itself is a marvel—crystals in an endless variety of beautiful forms! With snow and hail God can fight as effectually, if he pleases, as with lightning or with the sword of an angel. Snow and hail will evidently be used against God’s enemies on “the day of fight and war,” the time of Armageddon. What man can escape hail from heaven if God directs it? “Hailstones” are mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezekiel 38:22</a> in reference to the means God will use to destroy the wicked hordes of humans under satanic leadership. At the battle of Gibeon in ancient times Jehovah used hailstones against his enemies: “There were more who died from the hailstones than those whom the sons of Israel killed with the sword.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Josh. 10:11</a>) A description of a hailstorm gives us an idea of what God can do on “the day of fight and war.” In his <em>Autobiography</em> (Book II, 50) the Italian sculptor Benvenuto Cellini related this experience:</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">“We were one day distant from Lyons . . . when the heavens began to thunder with sharp rattling claps. . . . After the thunder the heavens made a noise so great and horrible that I thought the last day had come; so I reined in for a moment, while a shower of hail began to fall without a drop of water. At first the hail was somewhat larger than pellets from a popgun, and when these struck me, they hurt considerably. Little by little it increased in size, until the stones might be compared to balls from a crossbow. My horse became restive with fright; so I wheeled round, and returned at a gallop to where I found my comrades taking refuge in a fir-wood. The hail now grew to the size of big lemons. . . . There fell a stone so huge that it smashed the thick branches of the pine under which I had retired for safety. Another of the hailstones hit my horse upon the head, and almost stunned him; one struck me also, but not directly, else it would have killed me. . . .</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">“The storm raged for some while, but at last it stopped; and we, who were pounded black and blue, scrambled as well as we could upon our horses. Pursuing the way to our lodging for the night, we showed our scratches and <span id="page168" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="168" data-before-text="168"></span>bruises to each other; but about a mile farther on we came upon a scene of devastation which surpassed what we had suffered, and defies description. All the trees were stripped of their leaves and shattered; the beasts in the field lay dead; many of the herdsmen had also been killed; we observed large quantities of hailstones which could not have been grasped with two hands.”—<em>Harvard Classics,</em> Vol. 31, pp. 352, 353.</p>

<strong>The Great God Who Is “Doing Wondrous Things”</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> ‘With all his heart’ David could declare: “There is none like you among the gods, O Jehovah, neither are there any works like yours.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 86:8</a>) In David’s day, as today, the earth was <span id="page38" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="38" data-before-text="38"></span>filled with a multitude of gods. Though Buddha, Brahma, Confucius and Christendom’s triune “God” had not yet appeared to add confusion to the religious scene, there were a host of gods to be worshiped in the religions of Philistia, Assyria, Babylon and other nations surrounding Israel. As they went out to war, these nations carried images of their gods on staves, from which also fluttered their national pendants. Some of these gods, such as Molech of Ammon and Chemosh of Moab, were known as “fire gods,” and exacted human sacrifices. Baal of Peor was worshiped with lewd sex rites. David not only maintained separateness from this cruel, immoral world of confused religionists, but he removed their contaminating influence by driving them right out from the God-given land of Israel.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Deut. 11:22-25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2 Sam. 8:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 14</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 5.

The gods of worldly nations had left no such record; indeed, they had accomplished nothing worthy of praise or record. It is Jehovah alone, “the grand King” and who is “great and very much to be praised,” that has caused to be written down the record of his wondrous works and eternal purposes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ex. 17:14</a>) David exulted, not only in the divine promise of an everlasting Kingdom, but in all the other glorious prophecies looking down to our day.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 6.

In the modern year of 1914 Jehovah established the everlasting kingdom of heaven in the hands of one greater than David, his Son Jesus Christ. In 1919 he brought forth on this earth a New World society to preach “this good news of the kingdom . . . for the purpose of a witness to all the nations.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>) As the nucleus of this New World society, the faithful remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses serve “as signs and as wonders,” to be seen by all men.

Storms blow out of the south, and cold comes from the north; the ice forms at his breath, and freezes the broad water hard; he loads a heavy cloud with hail, and from the clouds his lightning scatters, darting here and darting there, turning as he directs it, doing whatsoever he bids it over all his world. Have you ever entered the stores of the snow?

In this way many beasts of earth yearly pass through the hard time of winter. Also consider that visible evidences indicate the approach of literal winter. The blue skies of summer give way to the gray bleak skies of late fall. Temperatures drop, winds swing round from the south and come out of the north, with a chill that touches the bones, bringing snow flurries with them. The sap of trees retreats underground, the stream of life slows, leaves fall, the days become very short. We reach the time on the calendar that shows it is the seasonal time for winter. From instinct the animals appreciate the meaning of these changes. Birds gather in flocks for southward flight. Some land and water animals and certain insects also migrate. Other insects store food, such as the honeybee that packs honey in hives during the favorable season of summer and retires within those shelters stocked with food to live out the winter. Many other animals prepare when they see the sign of winter’s approach, not by migrating or by storing up food in dens, but by changing their eating habits to store up fat in their own bodies and by thickening furry pelts to keep out the coming cold.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="qu"> 5.

God went on: “Who has divided a channel for the flood and a way for the thunderous storm cloud, to make it rain upon the land where there is no man, upon the wilderness in which there is no earthling man, to satisfy storm-stricken and desolate places and to cause the growth of grass to sprout?

<strong>Creation Declares the Glory of God!</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Scientists cannot answer another question posed to Job: “Where, now, is the way by which the light distributes itself?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004403/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Job 38:24</a>) One writer called this inquiry about light “a profoundly modern scientific question.” By way of contrast, some Greek philosophers felt that light emanated from the human eye. In more modern times, scientists have thought that light consists of tiny particles. Others have thought of it as moving in waves. Today, scientists believe that light behaves both as a wave and as a particle. Still, the nature of light and how it “distributes itself” is far from fully understood.</p>

<strong>A Lesson in Man’s Littleness</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">“The storm raged for some while, but at last it stopped; and we, who were pounded black and blue, scrambled as well as we could upon our horses. Pursuing the way to our lodging for the night, we showed our scratches and <span id="page168" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="168" data-before-text="168"></span>bruises to each other; but about a mile farther on we came upon a scene of devastation which surpassed what we had suffered, and defies description. All the trees were stripped of their leaves and shattered; the beasts in the field lay dead; many of the herdsmen had also been killed; we observed large quantities of hailstones which could not have been grasped with two hands.”—<em>Harvard Classics,</em> Vol. 31, pp. 352, 353.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">When God opens up his storehouses of snow and hail at Armageddon, his enemies will be in for a terrifying time, and there will be no way of escape.

Who has divided a channel for the flood and a way for the thunderous storm cloud, to make it rain upon the land where there is no man, upon the wilderness in which there is no earthling man, to satisfy storm-stricken and desolate places and to cause the growth of grass to sprout? Does there exist a father for the rain, or who gave birth to the dewdrops? Out of whose belly does the ice actually come forth, and as for the hoarfrost of heaven, who indeed brings it to birth? The very waters keep themselves hidden as by stone, and the surface of the watery deep makes itself compact.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 38:24-30</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Can any man take credit for the wonderful diffusion of light over the whole earth? Can he provide a channel for the “thunderous storm cloud”? The great Rainmaker is Jehovah, and even “the wilderness in which there is no earthling man” enjoys his blessing.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Have rain, ice and frost a human originator or father? Ice and frost are very common things so that this may tend to lessen the marvel of them. Yet consider for a moment the marvel of ice:</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">“During winter the water of lakes and seas becomes heavier as it cools. As its density increases the water sinks and displaces the lighter, warmer water, which rises to the surface. This cooling and mixing continues until the temperature reaches 4°C. Then, as the water cools still further the density change is reversed. The water becomes lighter as it cools towards freezing point. Instead of sinking, it lies in a layer on top of the warmer water beneath. Finally, as the water turns to ice, it becomes still lighter, and the ice floats on the surface like a protecting lid.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">“If the density of cooling water did not change in this unusual way surface water would continue to sink until freezing point was reached. Ice would form at the bottom of lakes and seas and would accumulate from season to season until the waters were entirely solid. In summer only the surface layers would melt and there would be no massive movements of ocean currents to modify the world’s weather. The tropics would become unbearably hot and the ‘temperate’ regions would freeze throughout the year.”—<em>The World of Water,</em> pp. 148, 149.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Yes, Jehovah makes ice so that “the very waters keep themselves hidden as by stone” and yet the large bodies of water do not freeze solid with adverse effects for the earth. Ice, frost, rain and dew are the Creator’s handiwork. Rain and dew invigorate and give life to the whole vegetable world. Frost, by expanding the water contained in the earth, pulverizes and renders the soil fertile.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Just a few of the many questions put to Job in Jehovah’s sublime speech have been considered. And yet what a lesson we have in man’s littleness contrasted with God’s greatness! Jehovah’s speech shows up man’s true size, just as a molehill finds its true dimensions beneath the shadow of a mountain. “Behold! God is more exalted than we can know.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 36:26</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb"></p>

They were questions that could not be answered by the naturally wise in Job’s day, nor can they be answered by the scientists of our day, because the Book of Nature is silent as to the overriding purposes of the things asked about. The questions to Job were so framed that their answers all pointed to the great fact that there is but one Creative Source in the universe whose sovereign will cannot be ignored. To Job Jehovah made clear that man must go beyond the evidences in nature to understand God’s full will. This requires maintaining communication with the Sovereign as to his will and word. In such communication it is unwise for frail humans to argue with the formidable Almighty One.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955364/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 38:1 to 40:2</a>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 2.

Additionally, what is the great objective for the lightning to thunderbolt to the earth, electrically fertilizing the soil, which is now known to be the immediate beneficial service performed by lightning? Do all these things happen by mere chance, as claimed by fools who say there is no God, no Absolute Authority? Or do all these operations of the elements occur as part of a master pattern? The implied answer to Job is that all this comes about by absolute design, whereby fixed physical laws, decreed by an all-wise Creator, govern and control the functioning of the created elements. There is no chaos or lack of objectivity in Jehovah’s universal realm. All these detailed events contribute to a far grander pattern of purpose.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955364/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 38:25,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955364/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 27</a>, <em>RS;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955364/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 14:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955364/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Heb. 3:4</a>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 3.

<strong>Rain</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Among the questions that Jehovah put to Job, emphasizing man’s limited understanding of the forces and laws of creation and the earth, was: “Does there exist a father for the rain?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 38:28</a>) Though meteorologists have studied extensively the formation of rain, the volume <em>The World We Live In</em> (1955, p. 79) observes: “The processes by which a cloud manufactures rain remain obscure; it appears that several <span id="page1369" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1369" data-before-text="1369"></span>mechanisms may operate.” As warm air containing water vapor rises and cools, moisture condenses into tiny water droplets. One theory holds that this condensation occurs around dust or salt particles as nuclei of the droplets. Another theory concludes that electricity plays an essential role—that rain takes place when something upsets the electrostatic balance of a cloud.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>JEHOVAH AS A SOURCE</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Jehovah was no mere “rain god” for Israel. He was not like Baal, whom the Canaanites thought brought the rainy season with his awakening to life. Faithful Israelites recognized that Jehovah, not Baal, could withhold the precious rain. This was clearly illustrated when Jehovah brought a drought in Israel when Baal worship there was at its peak, in the time of the prophet Elijah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Ki. 17:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Jas. 5:17, 18</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">It is Jehovah who prepared rain for the earth.

His ability to control rain in harmony with his purpose is one of the things that distinguished Jehovah from the lifeless idol gods worshiped by the nations surrounding Israel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Jer. 14:22</a>) In the Promised Land the Israelites had even more reason to appreciate that than when they were in Egypt, where rain was very infrequent.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Deut. 11:10, 11</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In preaching to the Greeks in Lystra, Paul and Barnabas explained that the cheering rains served as a witness about the “living God” and a demonstration of his goodness. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 14:14-17</a>) The benefits of rain are felt not just by the good and righteous, but by all people; so, Jesus pointed out, God’s love in this regard should serve as a pattern for humans.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 5:43-48</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>RAINFALL IN THE PROMISED LAND</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">A distinct feature of the climate of the Promised Land is its variety as to rainfall. Two chief factors determining the amount of rain are proximity to the sea and elevation. The plains along the Mediterranean receive considerable rain during the rainy season, with the amount decreasing as one goes from N to S. The rainfall tends to be greater in the hills and mountains because the moisture carried eastward from the sea condenses more heavily there. The Jordan valley lies in a “rain shadow,” for the air traveling over the mountains has by then given up much of its moisture, and the air is warmed as it moves into the valley. Yet, when this air meets the elevated plateau E of the Jordan, clouds again form, resulting in some rainfall. This makes a strip of land E of the Jordan suitable for grazing or limited agriculture. Farther E is the desert, where the rain is too light and irregular to be useful for raising crops or herds.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong><em>Seasons</em></strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The two primary seasons in the Promised Land, summer and winter, can rather accurately be viewed as the dry season and the rainy season. From mid-April to mid-October very little rain falls. Rain is rare in this period during which the harvest takes place. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Proverbs 26:1</a> shows that rain at harvesttime was considered quite out of place. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Samuel 12:17-19</a>.) During the rainy season the rain is not constant; it alternates with clear days. Since this is also the cold period, exposure to the rain is very chilling. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ezra 10:9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 13</a>) Therefore, a comfortable shelter is most appreciated.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isa. 4:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 25:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/15/2" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 32:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/15/3" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> Job 24:8</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong><em>Autumn and spring rain</em></strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The Bible often mentions the “autumn [early] rain and spring [late] rain.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Jer. 5:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Joel 2:23, 24</a>) The rains of these periods between the summer and winter were promised by God as a blessing upon the faithful Israelites (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Deut. 11:14</a>) and are things the farmer patiently awaited. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Jas. 5:7</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Job 29:23</a>.) The early or autumn rain (beginning in late October) was anxiously anticipated to relieve the heat and dryness of summer. It was necessary before planting could begin, for the rain softened the ground and allowed the farmer to plow his land. Similarly, the late or spring rain (in April) was required to water the growing crops so that they would mature, and particularly so that the grain would ripen.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Zech. 10:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Amos 4:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/20/2" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> Song of Sol. 2:11-13</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>FIGURATIVE USE</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">When God blessed Israel with rains in their appointed time, an abundance resulted. Hence, Hosea could promise that Jehovah would “come in like a pouring rain,” “like a spring rain that saturates the earth” for those who sought to know him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Hos. 6:3</a>) God’s instructions were to “drip as the rain” and his sayings as “gentle rains upon grass and as copious showers upon vegetation.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Deut. 32:2</a>) They would be able to sink in slowly but be sufficient to provide full refreshment, as showers on vegetation. Similarly, a source of refreshment and plenty was depicted in likening the regathered remnant of Jacob to “copious showers upon vegetation.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Mic. 5:7</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The reign of God’s king described in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Psalm 72</a> would be marked by prosperity and blessing. Consequently, he was represented as descending “like the rain upon the mown grass, like copious showers that wet the earth” and produce fresh verdure. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps. 72:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 6</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">2 Samuel 23:3, 4</a>.) The goodwill of a king was likened to “the cloud of spring rain,” for it gave evidence of pleasant conditions to come, just as rain-bearing clouds assured the water necessary for the crops’ fruition.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Prov. 16:15</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">However, the falling rain does not always result in vegetation that is a blessing to the human cultivator; the watered earth may produce thorns and thistles. Paul used this as an example, comparing the rain-watered ground to Christians who have “tasted the heavenly free gift, and who have become partakers of holy spirit.” If they do not produce the fruits of the spirit, but fall away from the truth, they are due to be burned, like a field producing only thorns.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Heb. 6:4-8</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">In John’s vision in Revelation he saw “two witnesses” with “the authority to shut up heaven that no rain should fall during the days of their prophesying.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Rev. 11:3-6</a>) These “witnesses” representing God as ‘prophets’ or spokesmen would not pronounce God’s favor or blessing on the plans and works of wicked men on earth. Like Elijah, who announced a three-and-a-half-year drought on Israel because of their practice of Baal worship promoted by King Ahab and his wife Jezebel, so these “two witnesses” figuratively “shut up heaven” so that no refreshing “rain” from God would come to bring prosperity to such efforts of men.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 Ki. 17:1–18:45;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> Luke 4:25, 26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013546/30/2" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> Jas. 5:17, 18</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"></p>

Who has divided a channel for the flood and a way for the thunderous storm cloud, to make it rain upon the land where there is no man, upon the wilderness in which there is no earthling man, to satisfy storm-stricken and desolate places and to cause the growth of grass to sprout? Does there exist a father for the rain, or who gave birth to the dewdrops? Out of whose belly does the ice actually come forth, and as for the hoarfrost of heaven, who indeed brings it to birth? The very waters keep themselves hidden as by stone, and the surface of the watery deep makes itself compact.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 38:24-30</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Can any man take credit for the wonderful diffusion of light over the whole earth?

<strong>Rain</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>Formation.</strong> Among the questions that Jehovah put to Job, emphasizing man’s limited understanding of the forces and laws of creation and the earth, was: “Does there exist a father for the rain?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003625/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 38:28</a>) Though meteorologists have studied extensively the formation of rain, what have emerged are, as <em>The World Book Encyclopedia</em> says, “theories.” (1987, Vol. 16, pp. 123, 124) As warm air containing water vapor rises and cools, moisture condenses into tiny water droplets. One theory holds that as the larger droplets fall through a cloud, they collide with smaller droplets and combine with them, until they become too heavy for the air to support. Another theory proposes that ice crystals form in cloud tops where the temperature is below the freezing point and change to rain as they fall through warmer air.</p>

The rains came during their winter season, from the month of October through March, so that there were the autumn rains and the spring rains. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962043/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Joel 2:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962043/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Jas. 5:7</a>) From April and into September there was a period of continuous rainlessness. The land would go completely dry and the vegetation would become utterly parched were it not for the heavy dews that fell at night, in the cool of the day. The dew formed and soaked the vegetation during the months of April and May and August and September. None is mentioned as occurring during June and July.</p><p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="qu">23.

This, in turn, saved lives and made for plenty and prosperity in an agricultural country. So heavy were the dews that once when Judge Gideon put a sheep fleece upon the ground at night to test Jehovah God as the Dew Maker, the next morning “he got to drain off enough dew from the fleece to fill a large banquet bowl with water.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962043/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Judg. 6:38</a>) When the Shulammite girl’s shepherd lover came through the night to visit her, he said: “My head is filled with dew, the locks of my hair with the drops of the night.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962043/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Cant. 5:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962043/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 6:13</a>.</p><p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="qu">24. (a) What was indicated by the withholding of the giving of dew upon the land of Israel?

Not that they are continually having a “hot war,” but the heat of Jehovah’s indignation, denunciation and wrath is against them for their opposition to his kingdom by Christ that they show by hating and persecuting His witnesses. Hence only those persons who accept the Kingdom witness now being given and who turn to it as mankind’s only hope receive refreshment from the spiritual remnant. They look upon these as a dew of blessing from Jehovah God.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"><sup>26</sup></span> Among these the remnant spread the dew of God’s truth—O so gently!

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962043/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Phil. 2:16</a>) It is no deadly fallout from the explosion of lethal atomic bombs or hydrogen bombs or the pouring out of poison gases and bacteriological doses. This life-giving dew from God results in the goodness and pleasantness of brotherly unity and peace. “It is,” says <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962043/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Psalm 133:3</a>, “like the dew of Hermon that is descending upon the mountains of Zion. For there Jehovah commanded the blessing to be, even life to time indefinite.”</p>

These alone feared Jehovah, recognizing that he was fighting for Israel. By a stratagem they managed to enter into a covenant with Israel’s leaders and so were not killed but were made menial servants of Israel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011992/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Josh. 9:1-15,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011992/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 24-27</a>) This is one instance of the fulfillment of Noah’s curse upon Canaan, in that the Gibeonites and their associates, though not destroyed, became slaves of the Shemites.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011992/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Gen. 9:25-27</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Jehovah indicated his approval of Israel’s faithful keeping of their covenant with these Hivites by fighting for Gibeon’s protection against the surrounding Canaanite nations that came against them as a result of their covenant with Israel.

(See AMORITE.) At the time of Joshua’s conquest these approved Hivites resided in the city of Gibeon, located not far NW of Jerusalem, also in Chephirah, Beeroth and Kiriath-jearim. Gibeon is described as ‘a great city, like one of the royal cities, and greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty ones.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011992/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Josh. 10:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011992/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 9:17</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">After Joshua’s death Israel failed to continue to clear out the Canaanite nations as God had commanded, even intermarrying with them. Hence, the Bible record reads: “Now these are the nations that Jehovah let stay so as by them to test Israel, . . . The five axis lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, even the Sidonians and the Hivites inhabiting Mount Lebanon from Mount Baal-hermon as far as to the entering in of Hamath. . . . and they [the Israelites] took up serving their gods.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011992/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Judg. 3:1-6</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">This passage locates the Hivites as mountain dwellers in the Lebanon range clear up to the northernmost part of the Promised Land.

But verses 20 and 24 list him as a descendant of Seir the Horite. It is possible that, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011992/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Genesis 36:2</a>, a copyist confused the Hebrew letters <em>rehsh</em> (====) and <em>waw</em> (====), which are very similar in appearance. Perhaps, therefore, verse 2 should read “Zibeon the Horite.”</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">On the other hand, the word “Horite” may be derived from Hebrew <em>hohr,</em> “cave” or “hole,” and may mean merely “cave dweller.” This would eliminate any discrepancy between the texts at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011992/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Genesis 36:2 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011992/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> verses 20,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011992/22/2" data-bid="23-3" class="b"> 24</a>. Nevertheless, it seems more likely that the Horites were a separate nation.—See HORITE.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Archaeologists have unearthed ancient writings that scholars have interpreted as proof that a nation called “Hurrians” inhabited the regions of Armenia, Anatolia and Syria and parts of Palestine from patriarchal times, and they believe that this people included the Hivites, Horites and Jebusites. They equate “Horite” with “Hivite” and believe that somehow the Hurrians came to be called Hivites. Their theory is based to a great extent on linguistic similarities, particularly in proper names. The name “Horite” is, therefore, generally thought by them to be related to “Hurrian” rather than to mean “cave dweller.”</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The Bible, however, seems to make a definite distinction between these tribes, and does not mention the name Hurrian. Therefore it is wiser to await further evidence before accepting such identification as conclusive.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Ice</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Water in its solid state, produced by freezing. Both Elihu and Jehovah God called Job’s attention to the marvel of ice, the Almighty saying: “Out of whose belly does the ice actually come forth . . . ? The very waters keep themselves hidden as by stone, and the surface of the watery deep makes itself compact.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002130/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 36:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002130/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 37:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002130/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 38:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002130/0/3" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 29, 30</a>) The formation of ice as here referred to is possible only because of a most unusual property of water. As the water in lakes and seas cools, it becomes heavier. The lighter, warmer water is displaced by the heavier water and rises to the top. But when the water as a whole reaches about 4° C. (39° F.), this process reverses. The water becomes lighter as it nears the freezing point and remains as a layer above the warmer water beneath. This upper layer then turns to ice, “makes itself compact.” Being lighter than water, the ice keeps the waters beneath “hidden as by stone,” thus protecting marine life. Were it not for this phenomenon, much of the water in the lakes and even the oceans would in time become solid ice, thus making the earth inhospitable to life.</p>

<strong>Wonders of Creation Exalt Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The <em>Nature Bulletin</em> states: “The strangest and perhaps the most important property [of ice] is that water expands as it freezes . . . The blanket of ice that forms and floats on a pond in winter makes it possible for aquatic <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>plants and animals (fish, etc.) to remain alive in the water underneath. If . . . water contracted and became denser as it solidified, ice would be heavier than water and sink to the bottom. More ice would form on the surface until the pond was frozen solid. . . . In the cooler parts of the world the rivers, ponds, lakes, and even the oceans would all be permanently frozen.”</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">How thankful we can be that bodies of water do not freeze solid! And we certainly are grateful that as Jehovah’s handiwork, rain and dew invigorate the earth’s vegetation.</p>

While the identification of the particular constellation intended is indefinite, the sense of the question asked evidently is whether a mere man can bind together in a cluster a group of stars so that they comprise a permanent constellation. Thus, by this question, Jehovah brought home to Job man’s inferiority when compared with the Universal Sovereign.</p>

Notice the fascinating words with which God once addressed Job: “Can you tie fast the bonds of the Kimah constellation, or can you loosen the very cords of the Kesil constellation?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011489/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 38:31</a>) Night after night of his long life, Job saw those familiar star formations rise and set.<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2011489/2">c</a> But why did they look the same, year after year, decade after decade? What bonds held those stars, and all other heavenly bodies, in their relative positions? Surely, thinking about that was awe-inspiring to Job.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">If the stars were simply affixed to celestial spheres, there would be no need for such bonds. Only thousands of years later did scientists learn more about the invisible “bonds” or “cords” that hold the heavenly bodies together in their long, slow dance through the blackness of space. Isaac Newton and later Albert Einstein became famous for their discoveries in this field. Of course, Job knew nothing of the forces God uses to bind the heavenly bodies together. Yet, the inspired words in the book of Job have withstood the test of time far better than have the notions of the learned Aristotle. Who but the Lawmaker could have such insight?</p>

<strong>Wonders of Creation Exalt Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">God next asks Job about the heavens. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005843/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 38:31-33</a>) The Kimah constellation is usually identified as the Pleiades, a group consisting of seven large stars and a number of smaller ones some 380 light-years from the sun. Man cannot “tie fast the bonds of the Kimah constellation,” binding that group in a cluster. No human can “loosen the very cords of the Kesil constellation,” generally identified as the stellar group called Orion. Whatever may be the present identification of the Mazzaroth and Ash constellations, man cannot control and guide them. Humans cannot alter “the statutes of the heavens,” the laws governing the universe.</p>

Although the stars could be huge distances from one another, their relative positions remain fixed from earth’s perspective.

And great is the power of the One who can do everything and has made all things. Yes, his creations in heaven and earth testify to his supremacy and unfathomable wisdom. His wisdom manifest in nature, both inanimate and animate, stirs us up to worship and glorify him, thus keeping us humble. To man on earth he asks:</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Can you tie fast the bonds of the Kimah constellation, or can you loosen the very cords of the Kesil constellation? Can you bring forth the Mazzaroth constellation in its appointed time? And as for the Ash constellation alongside its sons, can you conduct them? Have you come to know the statutes of the heavens, or could you put its authority in the earth?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 38:31-33</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Almighty God raised those questions to show the littleness of man, both in wisdom and power, when compared with his Creator. Can man control the many heavenly constellations in which God’s wisdom is reflected? “There are 88 recognized constellations in the heavens now,” says James S. Pickering in <em>1001 Questions Answered About Astronomy.</em> “Constellations should be considered in the same light as geographical entities. They designate specific areas on the celestial sphere, and are the addresses of all stars and other objects permanently within their borders and of planets, comets, meteors, the Sun, Moon and other temporary visitors to their areas. Constellations are infinite in depth.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>HIS WISDOM IN THE HEAVENS</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">We do not know which of the mighty constellations or star groups the Most High God speaks of in those questions to Job. Many persons think that Orion is meant by the term Kesil constellation, that the Kimah constellation is the Pleiades and that the Ash constellation is the Great Bear. Some constellations, such as the Pleiades and Orion, are constituted of stars that give the appearance of being held together by chains and cords; so the idea is: Can man loosen the bands of a star group so that they fly apart and no longer appear as a fixed constellation? Can man move these mighty stars from the places God has assigned them in his wisdom? Man can neither place in order the clustering Kimah nor displace the cords of the Kesil constellation. He can merely behold the power and wisdom of God.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The wonderful order apparent in the entire celestial sphere is due to the commands that have been laid down by the Sovereign of the Universe, Jehovah God. God is the One who can bring forth the Mazzaroth constellation in its appointed time. Said Jehovah of all the heavenly hosts: “Raise your eyes high up and see. Who has created these things? It is the One who is bringing forth the army of them even by number, all of whom he calls even by name.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 40:26</a>) God, who can call all the stars by name, is the One who calls them forth in their respective seasons; but this is not in man’s province. God can even bring forth the stars to battle, as he did in the days of Deborah and Barak: “From heaven did the stars fight, from their orbits they fought against Sisera.” It is not in the power of man to order the motions of the stars, nor is man entrusted <span id="page294" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="294" data-before-text="294"></span>with the conduct of them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Judg. 5:20</a>.</p>

As to the “star” (Gr., <em>a·ster</em>ʹ) seen by them, many suggestions have been given as to its having been a comet, meteor, a supernova, or, more popularly, a conjunction of planets. None of such bodies could logically have ‘come to a stop above where the young child was,’ thereby identifying the one house in the village of Bethlehem where the child was found. It is also notable that only these pagan astrologers “saw” the star. Their condemned practice of astrology and the adverse results of their visit, placing in danger the life of the future Messiah, certainly allow for, and even make advisable, the consideration of their having been directed by a source <em>adverse</em> to God’s purposes as relating to the promised Messiah. It is certainly reasonable to ask if the one who “keeps transforming himself into an angel of light,” whose operation is “with every powerful work and lying signs and portents,” who was able to make a serpent appear to speak, and who was referred to by Jesus as a “manslayer when he began,” could not also cause astrologers to ‘see’ a starlike object that guided them first, not to Bethlehem, but to Jerusalem, where resided a mortal enemy of the promised Messiah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014123/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Cor. 11:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014123/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014123/19/2" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 2 Thess. 2:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014123/19/3" data-bid="20-4" class="b"> Gen. 3:1-4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014123/19/4" data-bid="20-5" class="b"> John 8:44</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>FIGURATIVE USE</strong></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Stars are used in the Bible in a figurative sense and in metaphors or similes to represent persons, as in Joseph’s dream in which his parents were represented by the sun and moon, and his eleven brothers by eleven stars.

<strong>Ash Constellation</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The fact that <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000411/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 38:32</a> refers to Ash “alongside its sons” strengthens the basis for believing that a constellation is involved. Ursa Major (the Great Bear) is the constellation most often suggested, having seven main stars in it that could be “its sons.” The important point in the text is, not the precise identification of the constellation, but the question there raised: “Can you conduct them?” Jehovah God thus impresses upon Job the wisdom and power of the Creator, inasmuch as it is utterly impossible for man to govern the movements of these immense stellar bodies.</p>

And great is the power of the One who can do everything and has made all things. Yes, his creations in heaven and earth testify to his supremacy and unfathomable wisdom. His wisdom manifest in nature, both inanimate and animate, stirs us up to worship and glorify him, thus keeping us humble. To man on earth he asks:</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Can you tie fast the bonds of the Kimah constellation, or can you loosen the very cords of the Kesil constellation? Can you bring forth the Mazzaroth constellation in its appointed time? And as for the Ash constellation alongside its sons, can you conduct them? Have you come to know the statutes of the heavens, or could you put its authority in the earth?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 38:31-33</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Almighty God raised those questions to show the littleness of man, both in wisdom and power, when compared with his Creator. Can man control the many heavenly constellations in which God’s wisdom is reflected? “There are 88 recognized constellations in the heavens now,” says James S. Pickering in <em>1001 Questions Answered About Astronomy.</em> “Constellations should be considered in the same light as geographical entities. They designate specific areas on the celestial sphere, and are the addresses of all stars and other objects permanently within their borders and of planets, comets, meteors, the Sun, Moon and other temporary visitors to their areas. Constellations are infinite in depth.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>HIS WISDOM IN THE HEAVENS</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">We do not know which of the mighty constellations or star groups the Most High God speaks of in those questions to Job. Many persons think that Orion is meant by the term Kesil constellation, that the Kimah constellation is the Pleiades and that the Ash constellation is the Great Bear. Some constellations, such as the Pleiades and Orion, are constituted of stars that give the appearance of being held together by chains and cords; so the idea is: Can man loosen the bands of a star group so that they fly apart and no longer appear as a fixed constellation? Can man move these mighty stars from the places God has assigned them in his wisdom? Man can neither place in order the clustering Kimah nor displace the cords of the Kesil constellation. He can merely behold the power and wisdom of God.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The wonderful order apparent in the entire celestial sphere is due to the commands that have been laid down by the Sovereign of the Universe, Jehovah God. God is the One who can bring forth the Mazzaroth constellation in its appointed time. Said Jehovah of all the heavenly hosts: “Raise your eyes high up and see. Who has created these things? It is the One who is bringing forth the army of them even by number, all of whom he calls even by name.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 40:26</a>) God, who can call all the stars by name, is the One who calls them forth in their respective seasons; but this is not in man’s province. God can even bring forth the stars to battle, as he did in the days of Deborah and Barak: “From heaven did the stars fight, from their orbits they fought against Sisera.” It is not in the power of man to order the motions of the stars, nor is man entrusted <span id="page294" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="294" data-before-text="294"></span>with the conduct of them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Judg. 5:20</a>.</p>

<strong>Physical Heavens Declare God’s Glory</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Recall how far it is from here to the sun and how long it would take you to get there on a high-speed train—114 years.

No human can imagine how long a time that is, so how can one comprehend how far it is across the equatorial diameter of the Milky Way when it equals 4,000 of such round trips? Why, for a beam of light, streaking along at the speed of 186,000 miles per second, it would take it 33,000 <span id="page376" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="376" data-before-text="376"></span>years to cross from one side of the Milky Way to the other!</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Man’s imagination staggers to think that the sun is more than 108 times as great in diameter as the earth, and yet there is a countless host of other stars many times as large as the sun.

Think of that, a molten ball of fire 360,000,000 miles in diameter, and 90,000,000 times as bright as our sun!

Each travels at its own particular speed. The fastest-moving bright star is Arcturus, with a speed of 75 miles a second (about 270,000 miles per hour). Reason enough why God might use it to illustrate how small and powerless man is. “Canst thou guide Arcturus?” the Almighty asked Job. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950761/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Job 38:32</a>) Some stars are cooler than our sun, others are twice, three times and even five times as hot. Some are brighter; others are extremely faint. A comet’s tail is practically a vacuum, weighing only one four-sextillionth (1/4000000000000000000000) as much as a similar volume of air, whereas a <em>dwarf star</em> is so unbelievably heavy that a cubic inch of it weighs as much as 1,000 tons! Wonders indeed! showing forth the glory and majesty of their Creator.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Dwarfing man and exalting Jehovah even more, the giant telescopes disclose that this galaxy to which our earth belongs is only an island universe in the sea of space. Out and beyond our Milky Way there are more than 100,000,000,000 other Milky Ways called nebulae, each containing billions of suns, stars and planets. The 200-inch Palomar telescope is able to reach out 1,100,000,000 light-years (one light-year equals six trillion miles), and still no end to the stars. This means that these stars are so far away that the light that left them 1,100,000,000 years ago is just now reaching our globe. So in view of such astronomical facts, such distances, how much greater than time and space and all that fill them must Jehovah God be! What powers of communication he must possess! For moment by moment he knows what is going on in the most distant corner of infinity. No, not even “the heaven and heaven of heavens” are able to contain Jehovah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950761/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Ki. 8:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950761/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 2:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950761/12/2" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> 6:18</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Again the question: “What is man, that thou art mindful of him?” Again the only truthful answer: compared with God Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, man is oh so very, very small! “Why, the nations are a mere drop in the bucket, no more to him than dust upon a balance! Before him all the nations are as nothing; to him they are but empty and inane. Then whom can you compare with God?” Jehovah God is he who “sits over the round earth, so high that its inhabitants look like grasshoppers; he spreads the skies out like a curtain, and stretches them like a tent. Lift high your eyes, look up; who made these stars? he who marshals them in order, summoning each one by name”.

The tremendous forces that determine the relative positions of certain stars according to physical laws are indicated by God’s questions to Job: “Can you tie fast the bonds of the Kimah constellation, or can you loosen the very cords of the Kesil constellation? Can you bring forth the Mazzaroth constellation in its appointed time? And as for the Ash constellation alongside its sons, can you conduct them? Have you come to know the statutes of the heavens, or could you put its authority in the earth?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004224/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Job 38:31-33</a>; see <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004224/1">ASH CONSTELLATION</a>; <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004224/2">KESIL CONSTELLATION</a>; <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004224/3">KIMAH CONSTELLATION</a>; <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004224/4">MAZZAROTH CONSTELLATION</a>.) Thus, the <em>New Bible Dictionary</em> states: “We assert, then, that the Bible consistently assumes a universe which is fully rational, and vast in size, in contrast to the typical contemporary world-view, in which the universe was not rational, and no larger than could actually be proved by the unaided senses.”​—Edited by J. Douglas, 1985, p. 1144.</p>

Again and again, new discoveries have led scientists to rethink their theories on the workings of the universe. Have new findings rendered God’s question to Job obsolete?

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005843/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 38:31-33</a>) The Kimah constellation is usually identified as the Pleiades, a group consisting of seven large stars and a number of smaller ones some 380 light-years from the sun. Man cannot “tie fast the bonds of the Kimah constellation,” binding that group in a cluster. No human can “loosen the very cords of the Kesil constellation,” generally identified as the stellar group called Orion. Whatever may be the present identification of the Mazzaroth and Ash constellations, man cannot control and guide them. Humans cannot alter “the statutes of the heavens,” the laws governing the universe.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">God established the laws that guide the heavenly bodies, which influence earth’s weather, tides, atmosphere, and the very existence of life on this planet. Consider the sun. Concerning it, <em>The Encyclopedia Americana</em> (1996 Edition) states: “The sun’s rays supply the earth with heat and light, contribute to the growth of plant life, evaporate water from the ocean and other bodies of water, play a role in the production of winds, and perform many other functions that are vital to the existence of life on earth.” The same reference work says: “To appreciate the vastness of the power that is inherent in sunlight, one need only reflect that all the <span id="page16" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>power represented in the winds and in dams and rivers and all the power contained in natural fuels such as wood, coal, and oil is nothing more than sunlight that has been stored up by a tiny planet [the earth] 93 million miles <strong>[150 million kilometers]</strong> away from the sun.”</p>

After all, people in ancient times used the steady motions of these vast, elegant star-patterns to mark the changing seasons. But for all the times he gazed at them in awe, Job did not know what mighty forces held these star formations together. Thus, he could scarcely begin to answer when Jehovah God asked him: “Have you grasped the celestial laws?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996642/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 38:31-33</a>, <em>The New Jerusalem Bible</em>) Yes, the stars are governed by laws—laws so precise and complex that today’s scientists do not fully comprehend them.</p>

And great is the power of the One who can do everything and has made all things. Yes, his creations in heaven and earth testify to his supremacy and unfathomable wisdom. His wisdom manifest in nature, both inanimate and animate, stirs us up to worship and glorify him, thus keeping us humble. To man on earth he asks:</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Can you tie fast the bonds of the Kimah constellation, or can you loosen the very cords of the Kesil constellation? Can you bring forth the Mazzaroth constellation in its appointed time? And as for the Ash constellation alongside its sons, can you conduct them? Have you come to know the statutes of the heavens, or could you put its authority in the earth?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 38:31-33</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Almighty God raised those questions to show the littleness of man, both in wisdom and power, when compared with his Creator. Can man control the many heavenly constellations in which God’s wisdom is reflected? “There are 88 recognized constellations in the heavens now,” says James S. Pickering in <em>1001 Questions Answered About Astronomy.</em> “Constellations should be considered in the same light as geographical entities. They designate specific areas on the celestial sphere, and are the addresses of all stars and other objects permanently within their borders and of planets, comets, meteors, the Sun, Moon and other temporary visitors to their areas. Constellations are infinite in depth.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>HIS WISDOM IN THE HEAVENS</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">We do not know which of the mighty constellations or star groups the Most High God speaks of in those questions to Job. Many persons think that Orion is meant by the term Kesil constellation, that the Kimah constellation is the Pleiades and that the Ash constellation is the Great Bear. Some constellations, such as the Pleiades and Orion, are constituted of stars that give the appearance of being held together by chains and cords; so the idea is: Can man loosen the bands of a star group so that they fly apart and no longer appear as a fixed constellation? Can man move these mighty stars from the places God has assigned them in his wisdom? Man can neither place in order the clustering Kimah nor displace the cords of the Kesil constellation. He can merely behold the power and wisdom of God.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The wonderful order apparent in the entire celestial sphere is due to the commands that have been laid down by the Sovereign of the Universe, Jehovah God. God is the One who can bring forth the Mazzaroth constellation in its appointed time. Said Jehovah of all the heavenly hosts: “Raise your eyes high up and see. Who has created these things? It is the One who is bringing forth the army of them even by number, all of whom he calls even by name.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 40:26</a>) God, who can call all the stars by name, is the One who calls them forth in their respective seasons; but this is not in man’s province. God can even bring forth the stars to battle, as he did in the days of Deborah and Barak: “From heaven did the stars fight, from their orbits they fought against Sisera.” It is not in the power of man to order the motions of the stars, nor is man entrusted <span id="page294" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="294" data-before-text="294"></span>with the conduct of them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Judg. 5:20</a>.</p>

Our Milky Way is just one of a million million milky ways or galaxies in the known universe. All of these millions and billions and trillions of stars are hurtling through space, each keeping in its assigned orbit, each running on a schedule of split-second timing so flawless that we set our most accurate timepieces by their movements. Can men guide them? No. And this Jehovah called to Job’s notice saying: “Can you send forth Mazzaroth in its season, and lead forth the Bear with its satellites? Do you know the laws of the heavens?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952044/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 38:32, 33</a>, <em>AT.</em></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Birds migrate for hundreds and thousands of miles, without map or compass, without ever having made the trip before. Can man guide the birds on their southward flight? God queried Job: “Is it by your understanding that the hawk soars, and spreads his wings toward the south?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952044/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 39:26</a>, <em>AT</em>) To the backsliding, rebellious Israelites Jehovah said: “Even the stork knows her time for assembly and migration, and the crane and swallow keep the season of their coming, but my people know not the decrees of the Everliving [Jehovah].”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952044/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jer. 8:7</a>, <em>Fenton.</em></p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">God guides the stars by his laws of motion and gravitation. Man cannot guide them. God guides the migrating birds by his laws of instinct. Man cannot guide them. Man cannot even guide himself. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952044/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jeremiah 10:23</a> (<em>AS</em>) states: “O Jehovah, I know that the way of man is not in himself; it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.” The stars heed God’s laws, the birds obey the migration laws, but men balk at God’s laws for them. But if God is capable of guiding the stars by natural law, of guiding the birds by instinct, then is he not capable of guiding man by the Bible? “Thy word is a lamp to my feet, and a light on my path.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952044/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 119:105</a>, <em>AT.</em></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Consider a few of the fields in which God’s Word gives sure guidance. It is a guide in matters of marriage. When Israel entered Canaan they were told concerning the heathen: “You must not intermarry with them, neither giving your daughters in marriage to their sons, nor receiving their daughters for your sons; for they would turn your sons from following me to serving alien gods.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952044/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Deut. 7:3, 4</a>, <em>AT</em>) To Christians the same prohibition was carried over when they were told to marry “only in the Lord”. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952044/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:39</a>, <em>NW</em>) Of course, there are always some headstrong ones who resent any interference in their personal affairs, even from God’s Word. Solomon was one of such. He married women not in the truth, probably reasoning that they were nice girls, and that he could get them into the truth after marriage. Instead, they got him out of the truth. God’s guiding Word was right, and Solomon’s rejection of it was so wrong it cost <span id="page50" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="50" data-before-text="50"></span>him eternal life.

Thus, <em>The New Bible Dictionary</em> edited by Douglas (p. 1215) states: “We assert, then, that the Bible consistently assumes a universe which is fully rational, and vast in size, in contrast to the typical contemporary world-view, in which the universe was not rational, and no larger than could actually be proved by the unaided senses.”</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The apostle Paul’s expression as to the difference between individual stars can be appreciated even more in the light of modern astronomy, which shows the contrast existing as to color, size, amount of light produced, temperature, and even the relative density of the stars.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014123/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:40, 41</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>STAR WORSHIP</strong></p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">While star worship was rampant among the ancient nations of the Middle East, the Scriptural view held by God’s faithful servants was that such astral bodies were simply material bodies subject to divine laws and control, not dominating man but serving as luminaries and time indicators.

As to the “star” (Gr., <em>a·ster</em>ʹ) seen by them, many suggestions have been given as to its having been a comet, meteor, a supernova, or, more popularly, a conjunction of planets. None of such bodies could logically have ‘come to a stop above where the young child was,’ thereby identifying the one house in the village of Bethlehem where the child was found. It is also notable that only these pagan astrologers “saw” the star. Their condemned practice of astrology and the adverse results of their visit, placing in danger the life of the future Messiah, certainly allow for, and even make advisable, the consideration of their having been directed by a source <em>adverse</em> to God’s purposes as relating to the promised Messiah. It is certainly reasonable to ask if the one who “keeps transforming himself into an angel of light,” whose operation is “with every powerful work and lying signs and portents,” who was able to make a serpent appear to speak, and who was referred to by Jesus as a “manslayer when he began,” could not also cause astrologers to ‘see’ a starlike object that guided them first, not to Bethlehem, but to Jerusalem, where resided a mortal enemy of the promised Messiah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014123/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Cor. 11:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014123/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014123/19/2" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 2 Thess. 2:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014123/19/3" data-bid="20-4" class="b"> Gen. 3:1-4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014123/19/4" data-bid="20-5" class="b"> John 8:44</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>FIGURATIVE USE</strong></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Stars are used in the Bible in a figurative sense and in metaphors or similes to represent persons, as in Joseph’s dream in which his parents were represented by the sun and moon, and his eleven brothers by eleven stars.

But how dependent humans are on the water cycle that the Creator has established!</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">What is the water cycle? One reference work states: “The water cycle consists of four distinct stages: storage, evaporation, precipitation, and runoff. Water may be stored temporarily in the ground; in oceans, lakes, and rivers; and in ice caps and glaciers. It evaporates from the earth’s surface, condenses in clouds, falls back to the earth as precipitation (rain or snow), and eventually either runs into the seas or reevaporates into the atmosphere. Almost all the water on the earth has passed through the water cycle countless times.”​—<em>Microsoft Encarta Reference Library 2005.</em></p>

<strong>The Wisdom of God</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The wonderful order apparent in the entire celestial sphere is due to the commands that have been laid down by the Sovereign of the Universe, Jehovah God. God is the One who can bring forth the Mazzaroth constellation in its appointed time. Said Jehovah of all the heavenly hosts: “Raise your eyes high up and see. Who has created these things? It is the One who is bringing forth the army of them even by number, all of whom he calls even by name.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 40:26</a>) God, who can call all the stars by name, is the One who calls them forth in their respective seasons; but this is not in man’s province. God can even bring forth the stars to battle, as he did in the days of Deborah and Barak: “From heaven did the stars fight, from their orbits they fought against Sisera.” It is not in the power of man to order the motions of the stars, nor is man entrusted <span id="page294" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="294" data-before-text="294"></span>with the conduct of them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Judg. 5:20</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Even if modern man has gained a little knowledge about “the statutes of the heavens,” can he put its authority in the earth? The laws of nature are the thoughts of God. In his wisdom he originated these laws that guide the heavenly bodies. Man knows that the heavenly bodies exercise a controlling influence over our weather, tides and atmosphere, yet how utterly impotent he is in exercising any command! The heavenly bodies, such as our sun, exercise authority in unusual ways, as the book <em>Our Astonishing Atmosphere</em> says:</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">“The dark patches on the sun which we call sunspots are believed to be areas of intense activity. Great surges of atomic upheaval boil up from inside the sun. Accompanying these solar eruptions are huge flares that can be seen sweeping out from the sun’s surface into space. And associated with the flares are streams of electrically charged atomic particles that are spewed out from the sun like water from a hose. . . . When sunspots are active the earth’s magnetism is disturbed. Compass needles misbehave, and the earth acts as though it were a magnet influenced by tremendous electric currents passing near to it. Immediately after a sunspot flare is seen there is a disturbance of radio communications over the sunlit area of the earth. And a day later comes the magnetic storm, the aurora, and a further disturbance of radio communications, less severe than the first but affecting the entire world. Electric currents set up in the earth’s crust can be powerful enough to upset telephone communications as well.”</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>WISDOM IN THE CLOUDS</strong></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">If man cannot control the statutes of the heavens and exercise authority over the heavenly bodies, what about that which is nearer to our earth—the clouds? God asks: “Can you raise your voice even to the cloud, so that a heaving mass of water itself may cover you? Can you send forth lightnings that they may go and say to you, ‘Here we are!’? Who put wisdom in the cloud layers, or who gave understanding to the sky phenomenon? Who can exactly number the clouds in wisdom, or the water jars of heaven—who can tip them over, when the dust pours out as into a molten mass, and the clods of earth themselves get stuck together?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 38:34-38</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Who is it that can raise his voice to the cloud so that it will let loose an abundance of rain? Not Job. No man can command a cloud to appear above him and then order it to let loose its water. The process of a cloud’s letting loose its water shows great wisdom. Research in cloud physics has made much progress, but what has already been learned is that it is one of many complex sky phenomena. There are many factors involved in the process of rain about which man knows very little. Says the volume <em>The World We Live In:</em></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="si">“The processes by which a cloud manufactures rain remain obscure; it appears that several mechanisms may operate, varying with the temperature of the cloud. In the cold upper strata of lofty clouds it is believed that water vapor congeals on tiny floating crystals of ice which continue to grow until they are heavy enough to fall. On reaching warmer levels they melt and descend as rain. At lower levels raindrops may form through the simple coalescence of minute droplets into larger ones. But there appear to be other requirements. One theory demands the presence of microscopic nuclei, in the form of dust or salt particles, upon which the water vapor can condense to form the cloud droplets. Another theory holds that electricity plays an essential role in rain formation.”</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Wisdom in the cloud layers indeed! And who has the wisdom to number exactly the countless clouds? The One of whom it is said: “He is counting the number of the stars,” the great Cloudmaker and Rainmaker, Jehovah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 147:4</a>) Jehovah, the Source of all wisdom, determines the number of the clouds and when their contents shall be poured out on the earth.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">God likens the rain-filled clouds to water jars of heaven, and He can tip them according to his pleasure. And when the <span id="page295" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="295" data-before-text="295"></span>clouds have poured down rain in abundance, so that the dust becomes mire and the clods cleave fast together, who can seal up those water jars of heaven and prevent more rain from falling? Jehovah can hold back rain as well as produce it. The prophet Elijah prayed for God to hold back rain: “Elijah was a man with feelings like ours, and yet in prayer he prayed for it not to rain; and it did not rain upon the land for three years and six months. And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain and the land put forth its fruit.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jas. 5:17, 18</a>) Men who have true wisdom take up the words of Jeremiah: “Do there exist among the vain idols of the nations any that can pour down rain, or can even the heavens themselves give copious showers? Are you not the One, O Jehovah our God? And we hope in you, for you yourself have done all these things.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jer. 14:22</a>.</p>

<strong>Wonders of Creation Exalt Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Rain is often accompanied by lightning, but man cannot cause it to fulfill his wishes. Lightnings are represented as reporting to God and saying, “Here we are!” <em>Compton’s Encyclopedia</em> states: “Lightning produces significant chemical changes in the atmosphere. As a stroke moves through the air, it generates tremendous heat that unites nitrogen and oxygen to form nitrates and other compounds. These compounds fall to the Earth with the rain. In this way, the atmosphere is able continually to help replenish the supply of nutrients that soil needs to produce plants.” Full knowledge of lightning remains a mystery to man but not to God.</p>

And when you see that a south wind is blowing, you say, ‘There will be a heat wave,’ and it occurs.” These words of Jesus, penned by the Gospel writer Luke, are examples of weather forecasts as they were made in ancient Palestine. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998808/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 12:54, 55</a>) In certain circumstances, the ancients could read the signs and make accurate short-term predictions.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Today, meteorologists use sophisticated instruments, such as earth-orbiting satellites, Doppler radar, and powerful computers, to gauge weather patterns over longer periods. But their predictions are often wrong. Why?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Many factors make accurate weather forecasting difficult. For example, unforeseen changes in temperature, humidity, air pressure, and wind-speed and direction can complicate matters. Added to these are the complex interactions of the sun, clouds, and oceans, which scientists do not yet fully understand. For that reason, weather forecasting remains an inexact science.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Man’s limited knowledge of weather reminds us of the questions asked of Job: “Who gave birth to the dewdrops? Out of whose belly does the ice actually come forth? . . . Can you raise your voice even to the cloud, so that a heaving mass of water itself may cover you? . . . Who put wisdom in the cloud layers, or who gave understanding to the sky phenomenon? Who can exactly number the clouds in wisdom, or the water jars of heaven—who can tip them over?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998808/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 38:28-37</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The answer to all these questions is, Not man but Jehovah God. Yes, however wise humans may seem to be, the wisdom of our Creator is far, far superior. It is truly loving on his part that he has made his wisdom available to us in the pages of the Bible, so that we can make our way successful.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998808/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 5:1, 2</a>.</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 147:4</a>) Jehovah, the Source of all wisdom, determines the number of the clouds and when their contents shall be poured out on the earth.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">God likens the rain-filled clouds to water jars of heaven, and He can tip them according to his pleasure. And when the <span id="page295" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="295" data-before-text="295"></span>clouds have poured down rain in abundance, so that the dust becomes mire and the clods cleave fast together, who can seal up those water jars of heaven and prevent more rain from falling? Jehovah can hold back rain as well as produce it. The prophet Elijah prayed for God to hold back rain: “Elijah was a man with feelings like ours, and yet in prayer he prayed for it not to rain; and it did not rain upon the land for three years and six months. And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain and the land put forth its fruit.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jas. 5:17, 18</a>) Men who have true wisdom take up the words of Jeremiah: “Do there exist among the vain idols of the nations any that can pour down rain, or can even the heavens themselves give copious showers? Are you not the One, O Jehovah our God? And we hope in you, for you yourself have done all these things.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jer. 14:22</a>.</p>

<strong>Heaven</strong><br/><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/117/0" data-bid="118-1" class="b">Psalm 102:25-27</a> stresses God’s eternity and imperishability, whereas his physical creation of heavens <span id="page734" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="734" data-before-text="734"></span>and earth is perishable, that is, it <em>could be</em> destroyed—if such were God’s purpose. Unlike God’s eternal existence, the permanence of any part of his physical creation is not independent. As seen in the earth, the physical creation must undergo a continual renewing process if it is to endure or retain its existing form. That the physical heavens are dependent on God’s will and sustaining power is indicated at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/118/0" data-bid="119-1" class="b">Psalm 148</a>, where, after referring to sun, moon and stars, along with other parts of God’s creation, verse six states that God “keeps them standing forever, to time indefinite.

This is because God’s only-begotten Son was God’s personal Agent employed in creating the physical universe. Paul contrasts the Son’s permanence with that of the physical creation, which God, if he so designed, could ‘wrap up just as a cloak’ and set it aside.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/120/0" data-bid="121-1" class="b">Heb. 1:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/120/1" data-bid="121-2" class="b"> 8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/120/2" data-bid="121-3" class="b"> 12</a>.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="ss"><strong>VARIOUS POETIC AND FIGURATIVE EXPRESSIONS</strong></p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sb">Because the physical heavens play a vital part in sustaining and prospering life on earth—by sunshine, rain, dew, refreshing winds, and other atmospheric benefits—they are spoken of poetically as Jehovah’s “good storehouse.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/121/0" data-bid="122-1" class="b">Deut. 28:11, 12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/121/1" data-bid="122-2" class="b"> 33:13, 14</a>) Jehovah opens its “doors” to bless his servants, as when causing manna, “the grain of heaven,” to descend upon the ground.

Having foretold the devastating results of Israel’s unfaithfulness, Jehovah now tells of the time of her restoration and the resulting blessings. In that day, he says, “I shall answer the heavens, and they, for their part, will answer the earth; and the earth, for its part, will answer the grain and the sweet wine and the oil; and they, for their part, will answer Jezreel.” Evidently this represents Israel’s petition for Jehovah’s blessing as being routed through the chain of things of Jehovah’s creation here named. For that reason these things are viewed as personified; hence, as if able to make a request or petition. Israel asks for grain, wine and oil; these products, in turn, seek their plant food and water from the earth; the earth, in order to supply this need, requires (or figuratively calls for) sun, rain and dew from the heavens; and the heavens (till now “shut up” due to the withdrawal of God’s blessing) can respond only if God accepts the petition and restores his favor to the nation, thereby putting the productive cycle in motion. The prophecy gives the assurance that he will do so.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/126/0" data-bid="127-1" class="b">2 Samuel 22:8-15</a> David apparently uses the figure of a tremendous storm to represent the effect of God’s intervention on David’s behalf, freeing him from his enemies. The fierceness of this symbolic storm agitates the foundation of the heavens and they ‘bend down’ with dark low-lying clouds. Compare the literal storm conditions described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/127/0" data-bid="128-1" class="b">Exodus 19:16-18</a>; also the poetic expressions at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/128/0" data-bid="129-1" class="b">Isaiah 64:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="ss"><strong><em>Stretching out the heavens</em></strong></p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="sb">Jehovah, the “Father of the celestial lights” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/129/0" data-bid="130-1" class="b">Jas. 1:17</a>), is frequently spoken of as having ‘stretched out the heavens,’ just as one would a tent cloth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/130/0" data-bid="131-1" class="b">Ps. 104:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/130/1" data-bid="131-2" class="b"> Isa. 45:12</a>) The heavens, both the expanse of atmosphere by day and the starry heavens by night, have the appearance of an immense domed canopy from the standpoint of humans on earth. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/131/0" data-bid="132-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:22</a> the simile is that of stretching out “fine gauze,” rather than the coarser tent cloth. This expresses the delicate finery of such heavenly canopy. On a clear night the thousands of stars do, indeed, form a lacy web stretched over the black velvet background of space. It may also be noted that even the enormous galaxy known as the Via Lactea or “Milky Way,” in which our solar system is located, has a filmy gauzelike appearance from earth’s viewpoint.</p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="sb">It can be seen from the foregoing that the context must always be considered in determining the sense of these figurative expressions. Thus, when Moses called on the “heavens and the earth” to serve as witnesses to the things that he declared to Israel, it is obvious that he did not mean the inanimate creation but, rather, the intelligent residents inhabiting the heavens and the earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/132/0" data-bid="133-1" class="b">Deut. 4:25, 26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/132/1" data-bid="133-2" class="b"> 30:19</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/133/0" data-bid="134-1" class="b">Ephesians 1:9, 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/133/1" data-bid="134-2" class="b"> Philippians 2:9, 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/133/2" data-bid="134-3" class="b"> Revelation 13:6</a>.) This is also true of the rejoicing by the heavens and earth over Babylon’s fall, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/134/0" data-bid="135-1" class="b">Jeremiah 51:48</a>.

Likewise it must be the spiritual heavens that “trickle with righteousness,” as described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/136/0" data-bid="137-1" class="b">Isaiah 45:8</a>. In other cases the literal heavens are meant but are figuratively described as rejoicing or shouting out loud. At Jehovah’s coming to judge the earth, as described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/137/0" data-bid="138-1" class="b">Psalm 96:11-13</a>, the heavens, along with the earth, sea, and the field, take on a gladsome appearance.

The physical heavens also praise their Creator, in the same way that a beautifully designed product brings praise to the craftsman producing it. In effect, they speak of Jehovah’s power, wisdom and majesty.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/139/0" data-bid="140-1" class="b">Ps. 19:1-4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/139/1" data-bid="140-2" class="b"> 69:34</a>.</p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="ss"><strong>ASCENSION TO HEAVEN</strong></p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/140/0" data-bid="141-1" class="b">2 Kings 2:11, 12</a> the prophet Elijah is described as “ascending in the windstorm to the heavens.” The heavens here referred to are the atmospheric heavens in which windstorms occur, not the spiritual heavens of God’s presence. As the article on ELIJAH shows, Elijah did not die at the time of such ascension, but continued to live for a number of years after his heavenly transportation away from his successor Elisha. Nor did Elijah upon death ascend to the spiritual heavens, since Jesus, while on earth, clearly stated that “no man has ascended into heaven.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/141/0" data-bid="142-1" class="b">John 3:13</a>) At Pentecost Peter likewise said of David that he “did not ascend to the heavens.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/142/0" data-bid="143-1" class="b">Acts 2:34</a>) In reality, there is nothing in the Scriptures to show that a heavenly hope was held out to God’s servants prior to the coming of Christ Jesus.

<strong>Wonders of Creation Exalt Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Rain-filled clouds are like water jars of heaven. When Jehovah tips them, they may pour down so much rain that the dust becomes mire and the clods cleave together. God can produce rain or hold it back.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005843/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">James 5:17, 18</a>.</p>

<strong>The Wisdom of God</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The wonderful order apparent in the entire celestial sphere is due to the commands that have been laid down by the Sovereign of the Universe, Jehovah God. God is the One who can bring forth the Mazzaroth constellation in its appointed time. Said Jehovah of all the heavenly hosts: “Raise your eyes high up and see. Who has created these things? It is the One who is bringing forth the army of them even by number, all of whom he calls even by name.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 40:26</a>) God, who can call all the stars by name, is the One who calls them forth in their respective seasons; but this is not in man’s province. God can even bring forth the stars to battle, as he did in the days of Deborah and Barak: “From heaven did the stars fight, from their orbits they fought against Sisera.” It is not in the power of man to order the motions of the stars, nor is man entrusted <span id="page294" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="294" data-before-text="294"></span>with the conduct of them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Judg. 5:20</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Even if modern man has gained a little knowledge about “the statutes of the heavens,” can he put its authority in the earth? The laws of nature are the thoughts of God. In his wisdom he originated these laws that guide the heavenly bodies. Man knows that the heavenly bodies exercise a controlling influence over our weather, tides and atmosphere, yet how utterly impotent he is in exercising any command! The heavenly bodies, such as our sun, exercise authority in unusual ways, as the book <em>Our Astonishing Atmosphere</em> says:</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">“The dark patches on the sun which we call sunspots are believed to be areas of intense activity. Great surges of atomic upheaval boil up from inside the sun. Accompanying these solar eruptions are huge flares that can be seen sweeping out from the sun’s surface into space. And associated with the flares are streams of electrically charged atomic particles that are spewed out from the sun like water from a hose. . . . When sunspots are active the earth’s magnetism is disturbed. Compass needles misbehave, and the earth acts as though it were a magnet influenced by tremendous electric currents passing near to it. Immediately after a sunspot flare is seen there is a disturbance of radio communications over the sunlit area of the earth. And a day later comes the magnetic storm, the aurora, and a further disturbance of radio communications, less severe than the first but affecting the entire world. Electric currents set up in the earth’s crust can be powerful enough to upset telephone communications as well.”</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>WISDOM IN THE CLOUDS</strong></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">If man cannot control the statutes of the heavens and exercise authority over the heavenly bodies, what about that which is nearer to our earth—the clouds? God asks: “Can you raise your voice even to the cloud, so that a heaving mass of water itself may cover you? Can you send forth lightnings that they may go and say to you, ‘Here we are!’? Who put wisdom in the cloud layers, or who gave understanding to the sky phenomenon? Who can exactly number the clouds in wisdom, or the water jars of heaven—who can tip them over, when the dust pours out as into a molten mass, and the clods of earth themselves get stuck together?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 38:34-38</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Who is it that can raise his voice to the cloud so that it will let loose an abundance of rain? Not Job. No man can command a cloud to appear above him and then order it to let loose its water. The process of a cloud’s letting loose its water shows great wisdom. Research in cloud physics has made much progress, but what has already been learned is that it is one of many complex sky phenomena. There are many factors involved in the process of rain about which man knows very little. Says the volume <em>The World We Live In:</em></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="si">“The processes by which a cloud manufactures rain remain obscure; it appears that several mechanisms may operate, varying with the temperature of the cloud. In the cold upper strata of lofty clouds it is believed that water vapor congeals on tiny floating crystals of ice which continue to grow until they are heavy enough to fall. On reaching warmer levels they melt and descend as rain. At lower levels raindrops may form through the simple coalescence of minute droplets into larger ones. But there appear to be other requirements. One theory demands the presence of microscopic nuclei, in the form of dust or salt particles, upon which the water vapor can condense to form the cloud droplets. Another theory holds that electricity plays an essential role in rain formation.”</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Wisdom in the cloud layers indeed! And who has the wisdom to number exactly the countless clouds? The One of whom it is said: “He is counting the number of the stars,” the great Cloudmaker and Rainmaker, Jehovah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 147:4</a>) Jehovah, the Source of all wisdom, determines the number of the clouds and when their contents shall be poured out on the earth.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">God likens the rain-filled clouds to water jars of heaven, and He can tip them according to his pleasure. And when the <span id="page295" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="295" data-before-text="295"></span>clouds have poured down rain in abundance, so that the dust becomes mire and the clods cleave fast together, who can seal up those water jars of heaven and prevent more rain from falling? Jehovah can hold back rain as well as produce it. The prophet Elijah prayed for God to hold back rain: “Elijah was a man with feelings like ours, and yet in prayer he prayed for it not to rain; and it did not rain upon the land for three years and six months. And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain and the land put forth its fruit.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jas. 5:17, 18</a>) Men who have true wisdom take up the words of Jeremiah: “Do there exist among the vain idols of the nations any that can pour down rain, or can even the heavens themselves give copious showers? Are you not the One, O Jehovah our God? And we hope in you, for you yourself have done all these things.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jer. 14:22</a>.</p>

Can any man give life to the lightnings, so that they may fulfill his wishes? Man may wield electric forces, but the lightnings, who can send and who can control them? In God’s words to Job the lightnings are represented as reporting to God the accomplishment of their task: “Here we are!” Could Job get the lightnings to do so for him? One of the assigned tasks of lightning is to fertilize the earth electrically. “Lightning is the world’s greatest producer of nitrogen compounds,” said <em>Science Digest</em> for July, 1956. “In very dilute forms, these compounds fall to earth with rain. . . . It’s even considered possible that without lightning, virtually all plant life on earth might actually wither and die.” What wisdom in lightning! “The scientific study of lightning has been going on for more than two hundred years,” reports the volume <em>Our Astonishing Atmosphere.</em> “Though lightning has been recognized for so long as a mammoth electric flash, its cause and detailed behaviour have remained mysteries to the present time.”</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>HIS WISDOM IN ANIMAL CREATION</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Jehovah now takes examples of his wisdom from the animal creation, illustrating the various endowments and capabilities of living creatures. Jehovah asks: “Can you hunt prey for a lion itself and can you satisfy the lively appetite of young lions, when they crouch in the hiding places, or keep lying in the covert for an ambush? Who prepares for the raven its food when its own young ones cry to God for help, when they keep wandering about because there is nothing to eat?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 38:39-41</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">All the animal creation shows the matchless handiwork and loving providence of God beyond man’s understanding. Even before man was created and given dominion over the fish and fowls and beasts and creeping things, God was providing for these creatures, the lion as well as the raven. God asks Job if he would undertake to provide food for the lions. Was not this far beyond his power? The lions can shift for themselves. “The maned young lions are roaring for the prey and for seeking their food from God himself.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 104:21</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">God’s care does not end with the noble lion; it extends even to the raven, though unclean by Mosaic law. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Deut. 14:11-14</a>) The raven was the first creature to go forth from the ark and to stay out and trust to Jehovah God to provide for it in the earth cleansed by the global Flood.

They get their food from God. God’s own Son said: “Mark well that the ravens neither sow seed nor reap, and they have neither barn nor storehouse, and yet God feeds them.

Can any man give life to the lightnings, so that they may fulfill his wishes? Man may wield electric forces, but the lightnings, who can send and who can control them? In God’s words to Job the lightnings are represented as reporting to God the accomplishment of their task: “Here we are!” Could Job get the lightnings to do so for him? One of the assigned tasks of lightning is to fertilize the earth electrically. “Lightning is the world’s greatest producer of nitrogen compounds,” said <em>Science Digest</em> for July, 1956. “In very dilute forms, these compounds fall to earth with rain. . . . It’s even considered possible that without lightning, virtually all plant life on earth might actually wither and die.” What wisdom in lightning! “The scientific study of lightning has been going on for more than two hundred years,” reports the volume <em>Our Astonishing Atmosphere.</em> “Though lightning has been recognized for so long as a mammoth electric flash, its cause and detailed behaviour have remained mysteries to the present time.”</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>HIS WISDOM IN ANIMAL CREATION</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Jehovah now takes examples of his wisdom from the animal creation, illustrating the various endowments and capabilities of living creatures. Jehovah asks: “Can you hunt prey for a lion itself and can you satisfy the lively appetite of young lions, when they crouch in the hiding places, or keep lying in the covert for an ambush? Who prepares for the raven its food when its own young ones cry to God for help, when they keep wandering about because there is nothing to eat?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 38:39-41</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">All the animal creation shows the matchless handiwork and loving providence of God beyond man’s understanding. Even before man was created and given dominion over the fish and fowls and beasts and creeping things, God was providing for these creatures, the lion as well as the raven. God asks Job if he would undertake to provide food for the lions. Was not this far beyond his power? The lions can shift for themselves. “The maned young lions are roaring for the prey and for seeking their food from God himself.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 104:21</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">God’s care does not end with the noble lion; it extends even to the raven, though unclean by Mosaic law. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Deut. 14:11-14</a>) The raven was the first creature to go forth from the ark and to stay out and trust to Jehovah God to provide for it in the earth cleansed by the global Flood. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gen. 8:6, 7</a>) Not only is the raven’s home in desolate places, but its food is scanty and must be sought over a wide extent of country, as indicated by its habit of flying restlessly about in search of food. They get their food from God. God’s own Son said: “Mark well that the ravens neither sow seed nor reap, and they have neither barn nor storehouse, and yet God feeds them. Of how much more worth are you <span id="page296" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="296" data-before-text="296"></span>than birds?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 12:24</a>) Since God provides for the unclean raven, we can be certain that he will not forget or forsake those persons who put their trust in him.</p>

<strong>Goat</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>Mountain Goat, Wild Goat.</strong> The Hebrew designation <em>yeʽe·limʹ,</em> rendered “mountain goats” (<em>NW</em>) and “wild goats” (<em>KJ</em>), is generally understood to refer to the Nubian ibex (<em>Capra ibex nubiana</em>), a mountain-dwelling wild goat with large, heavily ridged, backward-curving horns. This animal is at home in the high mountains (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001726/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Ps 104:18</a>), where it negotiates jagged crags and narrow mountain ledges with graceful ease. During the period of gestation these goats seek out places not easily found by man. This may be alluded to at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001726/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Job 39:1</a>, where the question raised points up the fact that these creatures are quite independent of man, the birth of their young taking place unobserved by man.</p>

<strong>Acrobats of the Mountain Crags</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>‘Do You Know When Mountain Goats Give Birth?’</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Mountain goats are very timid creatures. They prefer to live isolated from man. Indeed, people have difficulty getting near enough to observe them in their wild state. Thus, the Owner of “the beasts upon a thousand mountains” could rightfully ask the man Job: “Have you come to know the appointed time for the mountain goats of the crag to give birth?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997526/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 50:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997526/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Job 39:1</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">God-given instinct tells the female mountain goat when it is time to give birth. She searches out a secure spot and delivers one or two kids, usually at the end of May or in June. Newborn kids acquire a sureness of step within just a few days.</p>

<strong>The Wisdom of God</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">God’s care does not end with the noble lion; it extends even to the raven, though unclean by Mosaic law. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Deut. 14:11-14</a>) The raven was the first creature to go forth from the ark and to stay out and trust to Jehovah God to provide for it in the earth cleansed by the global Flood. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gen. 8:6, 7</a>) Not only is the raven’s home in desolate places, but its food is scanty and must be sought over a wide extent of country, as indicated by its habit of flying restlessly about in search of food. They get their food from God. God’s own Son said: “Mark well that the ravens neither sow seed nor reap, and they have neither barn nor storehouse, and yet God feeds them. Of how much more worth are you <span id="page296" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="296" data-before-text="296"></span>than birds?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 12:24</a>) Since God provides for the unclean raven, we can be certain that he will not forget or forsake those persons who put their trust in him.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">God cares for the wild animals at their season of greatest need. Their instinct comes directly from God and guides them to help themselves when giving birth. So God asks Job: “Have you come to know the appointed time for the mountain goats of the crag to give birth? Do you observe just when the hinds bring forth with birth pangs? Do you count the lunar months that they fulfill, or have you come to know the appointed time that they give birth? They bow down when they cast forth their young ones, when they get rid of their pangs. Their sons become robust, they get big in the open field; they actually go forth and do not return to them.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Job 39:1-4</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Can any man keep an exact register of all these happenings and exercise such providential care over these creatures, the mountain goats and the hinds, as to preserve them from dangers during the time of giving birth? Wild goats and hinds are continued from age to age, but not by the care of man. If man even knew when they were going to bring forth, could he tend to them as he can for domestic animals?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Man has difficulty even getting near mountain goats, to observe them in the wild state. “The high mountains,” wrote the psalmist, “are for the mountain goats.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 104:18</a>) At one time Saul hunted for David “upon the bare rocks of the mountain goats.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Sam. 24:2</a>) The lonely cliffs above the Dead Sea in the wilderness of En-gedi must have been special haunts for wild goats. But wherever they live, man does not find it easy to get close to them, as the Swiss traveler Johanne Burckhardt wrote in his <em>Travels in Syria:</em></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="si">“As we approached the summit of the mountain [St. Catherine, adjacent to Mount Sinai], we saw at a distance a small flock of mountain-goats feeding among the rocks. One of our Arabs left us, and by a widely circuitous route endeavored to get to the leeward of them, and near enough to fire at them; he enjoined us to remain in sight of them, and to sit down in order not to alarm them. He had nearly reached a favorable spot behind a rock, when the goats suddenly took to flight. They could not have seen the Arab; but the wind changed, and thus they smelt him.”</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Just as the mountain goats get along without man, so do the hinds, the female deer. By God-given instinct, when the hind knows she is about to give birth, she secludes herself in the forest and conceals her young and cares for it. Her young ones soon “become robust” and “go forth and do not return.” They shift on their own, cared for by God.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Jehovah’s questions to Job should stir us to worship him, to trust him and to study, not only his Book of nature, but his written Word, the Book of life-giving wisdom. Then our thankfulness for his goodness will be increased: “Respond to Jehovah with thanksgiving, you people; . . . the One who is covering the heavens with clouds, the One preparing rain for the earth, the One making the mountains to sprout green grass. To the beasts he is giving their food, to the young ravens that keep calling.” “Jehovah is good to all, and his mercies are over all his works.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 147:7-9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 145:9</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Goat</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The he-goat of Daniel’s prophecy represented the Grecian (or Greco-Macedonian) World Power.

Monuments are still extant in which this symbol occurs, as one of the pilasters of Persepolis, where a goat is depicted with one immense horn on his forehead, and a Persian holding the horn, by which is intended the subjection of Macedon by Persia” (something <span id="page664" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="664" data-before-text="664"></span>accomplished by the Persians toward the close of the sixth century B.C.E.).</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>MOUNTAIN GOAT, WILD GOAT</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The Hebrew designation <em>y<sup>e</sup>ʽe·limʹ,</em> rendered “mountain goats” (<em>NW</em>) and “wild goats” (<em>AV</em>), is generally understood to refer to the Arabian ibex, a mountain-dwelling wild goat with large, heavily ridged, backward-curving horns.

The pursuers looked for David and his men upon the “bare rocks of the mountain goats” (vs. 2), suggesting that mountain goats inhabited this region. Interestingly, even in recent times the ibex has been seen there.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The feminine Hebrew form <em>ya·ʽalahʹ</em> is employed in the passage at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011681/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Proverbs 5:18, 19</a>.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Deut. 14:11-14</a>) The raven was the first creature to go forth from the ark and to stay out and trust to Jehovah God to provide for it in the earth cleansed by the global Flood. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gen. 8:6, 7</a>) Not only is the raven’s home in desolate places, but its food is scanty and must be sought over a wide extent of country, as indicated by its habit of flying restlessly about in search of food. They get their food from God. God’s own Son said: “Mark well that the ravens neither sow seed nor reap, and they have neither barn nor storehouse, and yet God feeds them. Of how much more worth are you <span id="page296" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="296" data-before-text="296"></span>than birds?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 12:24</a>) Since God provides for the unclean raven, we can be certain that he will not forget or forsake those persons who put their trust in him.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">God cares for the wild animals at their season of greatest need. Their instinct comes directly from God and guides them to help themselves when giving birth. So God asks Job: “Have you come to know the appointed time for the mountain goats of the crag to give birth? Do you observe just when the hinds bring forth with birth pangs? Do you count the lunar months that they fulfill, or have you come to know the appointed time that they give birth? They bow down when they cast forth their young ones, when they get rid of their pangs. Their sons become robust, they get big in the open field; they actually go forth and do not return to them.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Job 39:1-4</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Can any man keep an exact register of all these happenings and exercise such providential care over these creatures, the mountain goats and the hinds, as to preserve them from dangers during the time of giving birth?

If man even knew when they were going to bring forth, could he tend to them as he can for domestic animals?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Man has difficulty even getting near mountain goats, to observe them in the wild state. “The high mountains,” wrote the psalmist, “are for the mountain goats.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 104:18</a>) At one time Saul hunted for David “upon the bare rocks of the mountain goats.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962361/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Sam. 24:2</a>) The lonely cliffs above the Dead Sea in the wilderness of En-gedi must have been special haunts for wild goats. But wherever they live, man does not find it easy to get close to them, as the Swiss traveler Johanne Burckhardt wrote in his <em>Travels in Syria:</em></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="si">“As we approached the summit of the mountain [St. Catherine, adjacent to Mount Sinai], we saw at a distance a small flock of mountain-goats feeding among the rocks. One of our Arabs left us, and by a widely circuitous route endeavored to get to the leeward of them, and near enough to fire at them; he enjoined us to remain in sight of them, and to sit down in order not to alarm them. He had nearly reached a favorable spot behind a rock, when the goats suddenly took to flight. They could not have seen the Arab; but the wind changed, and thus they smelt him.”</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Just as the mountain goats get along without man, so do the hinds, the female deer. By God-given instinct, when the hind knows she is about to give birth, she secludes herself in the forest and conceals her young and cares for it. Her young ones soon “become robust” and “go forth and do not return.” They shift on their own, cared for by God.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Jehovah’s questions to Job should stir us to worship him, to trust him and to study, not only his Book of nature, but his written Word, the Book of life-giving wisdom. Then our thankfulness for his goodness will be increased: “Respond to Jehovah with thanksgiving, you people; . . . the One who is covering the heavens with clouds, the One preparing rain for the earth, the One making the mountains to sprout green grass.

<strong>Ass</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><strong>Wild Ass.</strong> The wild ass [Heb., <em>ʽa·rohdhʹ;</em> Aramaic, <em>ʽaradhʹ</em>] is distinguished from the domestic ass, not by its appearance, but by its wild and intractable disposition. This harmonizes completely with the Bible’s description of an animal with ‘loosened bands,’ as it were.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000440/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Job 39:5</a>.</p>

<strong>Cousins With Contrary Characters</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The most significant difference between wild and domestic asses lies in their character. Children love to stroke or ride donkeys. Could they do so with wild asses? In his book <em>Animals of Africa,</em> Dr. Felix wrote: “Wild asses are extremely wary and shy, and it is difficult to get close to them. At the slightest hint of danger, they rush away in all directions, adroitly climbing up and down the steep rocky slopes.”</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Those that have been caught and cared for by man do not lose their wild nature. This is how the director of the Vienna zoo described the now extinct animal mentioned earlier: “Fiery and always ready to attack . . . with its teeth and hooves . . . the Syrian wild ass is a picture of unfettered wildness.”</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">This harmonizes with the Creator’s description of the wild ass as recorded in the Bible: “Who loosened the very bands of the wild ass, whose house I have appointed the desert plain and whose dwelling places the salt country? It laughs at the turmoil of a town; the noises of a stalker it does not hear. It explores mountains for its pasturage and <span id="page22" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>after every sort of green plant it seeks.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101982927/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 39:5-8</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Does this fit present-day habitats of wild asses? The book <em>Wild, Wild World of Animals</em> says: “African wild asses live in desolate, stony regions where temperatures may rise to 122°F [50°C].” The great Salt Plain in the Danakil depression of northern Ethiopia is an inhospitable desert where few humans can be found. Here, the magnificent Somali wild ass thrives, salt being a welcome part of its diet. The largest of wild asses, the kiang, dwells in the mountains of Tibet at an altitude of 4,500 meters (15,000 ft). In spite of freezing winters and heavy snows, it survives in these mountains seeking “after every sort of green plant.” On this, the book <em>Horses, Asses and Zebras in the Wild</em> comments: “Kiangs feed on grass and low-growing plants, particularly the tough, sharp swamp grass, rich in silicic acid, which would cut and lacerate the more sensitive mouths of any other equid.”</p>

But what can man do about it? He can learn a lesson from God.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">WHEN the Almighty spoke to Job in a series of questions, he contrasted the smallness of man with his own greatness. Jehovah pointed to his inanimate creation, the earth, the sea, its waves, snow and hail, rain, dew, frost and ice, the constellations, clouds, lightnings; he asked Job if he could control them and understand fully the divine laws governing them. Then the Almighty illustrated the superiority of his power and will by pointing to the animal creation. The lions, wild goats, hinds and even the lowly ravens all get along without man’s help. Next, God brought to Job’s attention other wild creatures:</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Who sent forth the zebra free, and who loosened the very bands of the wild ass, whose house I have appointed the desert plain and whose dwelling places the salt country? It laughs at the turmoil of a town; the noises of a stalker it does not hear. It explores mountains for its pasturage and after every sort of green plant it seeks.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 39:5-8</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">What a difference between tame animals and wild ones, even when they are most similar in appearance! Whence this mysterious difference of inward disposition? God says it was his will to send forth “the zebra free” and to loosen “the very bands of the wild ass.” Before the Sabean raid Job had five hundred she-asses, which he could use for burden bearing and plowing. Such domestic asses were noted for their submissiveness. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 1:3</a>) But could Job use the wild ass in a similar way? No, for God had given the wild ass its liberty and had appointed the desert plain as its home. It is not because of man’s will that the wild ass is so nimble and untractable and that even the salt country is its dwelling place, salt being a welcome ingredient to its diet. The wild ass manages to get along without man’s help. “Every sort of green plant it seeks, gnawing even down into the roots. The wild ass migrates restlessly in search of greenery, even exploring mountain areas for pasturage.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">But would the wild ass exchange its freedom for the more easily obtained provisions of the domesticated ass? No, and it would be in vain to entice the wild ass to dwell in busy towns for the sake of more abundant food. “It laughs at the turmoil of a town.” It instinctively avoids places inhabited by man, so “the noises of a stalker it does not hear.” Not that the wild ass cannot hear well; it is exceedingly wary because of its keen senses of hearing, sight and smell. Should a man invade its desolate domain and try to stalk this creature, it will dart off with utmost rapidity. Xenophon, the Greek historian of the fourth and fifth centuries B.C., wrote in his <em>Anabasis:</em></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="si">“The asses, when they were pursued, having gained ground of the horses, stood still (for they exceeded them much in speed); and when these came up with them, they did the same thing again; so that our horsemen could take them by no other means but by dividing themselves into relays, and succeeding one another in the chase.”</p>

It explores mountains for its pasturage and <span id="page22" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>after every sort of green plant it seeks.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101982927/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 39:5-8</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Does this fit present-day habitats of wild asses? The book <em>Wild, Wild World of Animals</em> says: “African wild asses live in desolate, stony regions where temperatures may rise to 122°F [50°C].” The great Salt Plain in the Danakil depression of northern Ethiopia is an inhospitable desert where few humans can be found. Here, the magnificent Somali wild ass thrives, salt being a welcome part of its diet. The largest of wild asses, the kiang, dwells in the mountains of Tibet at an altitude of 4,500 meters (15,000 ft). In spite of freezing winters and heavy snows, it survives in these mountains seeking “after every sort of green plant.” On this, the book <em>Horses, Asses and Zebras in the Wild</em> comments: “Kiangs feed on grass and low-growing plants, particularly the tough, sharp swamp grass, rich in silicic acid, which would cut and lacerate the more sensitive mouths of any other equid.”</p>

No, for God had given the wild ass its liberty and had appointed the desert plain as its home. It is not because of man’s will that the wild ass is so nimble and untractable and that even the salt country is its dwelling place, salt being a welcome ingredient to its diet. The wild ass manages to get along without man’s help. “Every sort of green plant it seeks, gnawing even down into the roots.

No, and it would be in vain to entice the wild ass to dwell in busy towns for the sake of more abundant food. “It laughs at the turmoil of a town.” It instinctively avoids places inhabited by man, so “the noises of a stalker it does not hear.” Not that the wild ass cannot hear well; it is exceedingly wary because of its keen senses of hearing, sight and smell. Should a man invade its desolate domain and try to stalk this creature, it will dart off with utmost rapidity. Xenophon, the Greek historian of the fourth and fifth centuries B.C., wrote in his <em>Anabasis:</em></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="si">“The asses, when they were pursued, having gained ground of the horses, stood still (for they exceeded them much in speed); and when these came up with them, they did the same thing again; so that our horsemen could take them by no other means but by dividing themselves into relays, and succeeding one another in the chase.”</p>

This is how the director of the Vienna zoo described the now extinct animal mentioned earlier: “Fiery and always ready to attack . . . with its teeth and hooves . . . the Syrian wild ass is a picture of unfettered wildness.”</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">This harmonizes with the Creator’s description of the wild ass as recorded in the Bible: “Who loosened the very bands of the wild ass, whose house I have appointed the desert plain and whose dwelling places the salt country? It laughs at the turmoil of a town; the noises of a stalker it does not hear. It explores mountains for its pasturage and <span id="page22" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>after every sort of green plant it seeks.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101982927/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 39:5-8</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Does this fit present-day habitats of wild asses? The book <em>Wild, Wild World of Animals</em> says: “African wild asses live in desolate, stony regions where temperatures may rise to 122°F [50°C].” The great Salt Plain in the Danakil depression of northern Ethiopia is an inhospitable desert where few humans can be found. Here, the magnificent Somali wild ass thrives, salt being a welcome part of its diet. The largest of wild asses, the kiang, dwells in the mountains of Tibet at an altitude of 4,500 meters (15,000 ft). In spite of freezing winters and heavy snows, it survives in these mountains seeking “after every sort of green plant.” On this, the book <em>Horses, Asses and Zebras in the Wild</em> comments: “Kiangs feed on grass and low-growing plants, particularly the tough, sharp swamp grass, rich in silicic acid, which would cut and lacerate the more sensitive mouths of any other equid.”</p>

<strong>Ass</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The home of the wild ass is the desert plain and the salt country, far away from the turmoil of a town. It instinctively avoids places inhabited by man, so “the noises of a stalker it does not hear.” Not that the wild ass cannot hear well; it is exceedingly wary because of its keen senses of hearing, sight and smell. <span id="page149" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="149" data-before-text="149"></span>Should a man try to stalk this creature, it would dart off with utmost rapidity. Restlessly wild asses migrate in search of greenery, even exploring mountain areas for pasturage. They feed on every sort of green plant, gnawing even down into the roots. Salt also constitutes a part of their diet.

People in the Palestine of Bible times rarely, if ever, faced anything stronger. But they did know of a more fearsome sort of bull​—the wild bull, or aurochs, which has since become extinct.

Will you bind a wild bull fast with its ropes in the furrow, or will it harrow low plains after you? Will you trust in it because its power is abundant, and will you leave your toil to it? Will you rely on it that it will bring back your seed and that it will gather to your threshing floor?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 39:9-12</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The answer to these questions, as well as those previously asked by God, is No. What farmer would dare? The wild bull was not like the cattle used for agricultural purposes, even though similar in appearance. Job once had five hundred spans of cattle, which he used for plowing. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 1:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 14</a>) But he could not harness the greater strength of the wild bull for the same purpose. The pictorial representations on monuments show that the ancient Egyptians bound their oxen to the plow by a cord fastened around the horns and tied to the yoke and the handle. But could any man bind a wild bull fast with its ropes in the furrow? No.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Then the question: “Will you trust in it because its power is abundant?” No, indeed. The greater wonder, then, that man could not avail himself of this strength to do his work. The wild bull was one of the most powerful animals known to the Israelites. The Hebrew word for this animal, <em>reem,</em> is mistranslated in the King James Version Bible as “unicorn”; but the <em>reem</em> was no one-horned mythological beast. It had two horns, “the horns of a wild bull.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Deut. 33:17</a>) Apparently related to domesticated cattle, the <em>reem</em> was not serving man, plowing his fields or hauling home grain.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The ancients considered the wild bull to be a most formidable creature, an Assyrian king calling it “strong and fierce.” English Orientalist H. C. Rawlinson translated this inscription of an Assyrian king, and it reads: “Four wild bulls, strong and fierce, in the desert . . . with my long arrows tipped with iron, and with heavy blows, I took their lives. Their skin and their horns I brought to my city of Ashur.” And English archaeologist Sir Austen Layard wrote in <em>Nineveh and Its Remains:</em> “The wild bull, from its frequent representation in the bas-reliefs, appears to have been considered scarcely less formidable and notable game than the lion. The king is frequently seen contending with it, and warriors pursue it on horseback and on foot.”</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">What kind of animal was this wild bull? Many present-day naturalists believe that the Hebrew <em>reem</em> must have been the now-extinct aurochs, an oxlike creature that stood six feet at the shoulder. Dr. George C. Goodwin, associate curator of the Department of Mammals of the American Museum of Natural History, states in <em>The Animal Kingdom:</em> “The aurochs was once plentiful in Palestine; it appears to be mentioned in the Bible as the ‘unicorn.’” If this is the wild bull spoken of by God, it was indeed a most powerful animal.

Great is their strength and great is their swiftness, neither do they spare man or beast, which they have caught sight of. . . . [They] can not be habituated to man and made tractable, not even when caught very young. The great spread of the horns <span id="page423" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="423" data-before-text="423"></span>as well as the shape and quality of them differ much from the horns of our oxen.”</p>

<strong>Ostrich</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Contrasted With Stork.</strong> Jehovah God later drew Job’s attention to the ostrich, and the things he pointed out strikingly illustrate some of the unusual features of that bird. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003347/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 39:13-18</a>) In great contrast to the high-flying, majestically soaring storks with their broad powerful wings, the ostrich is flightless; its wings are incapable of sustaining the bird’s weight, and its flat breastbone lacks the “keel” that supports the flying muscles of birds of flight. The ostrich’s plumes, though lovely, lack even the tiny hooklike filaments that cling together and give the feathers of flying birds the resistance to air that makes flight possible.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003347/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 39:13</a>.</p>

<strong>Stork</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Contrasting the flightless ostrich with the high-flying stork, Jehovah asked Job: “Has the wing of the female ostrich flapped joyously, or has she the pinions of a stork and the plumage?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004242/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 39:13</a>) The stork’s pinions are of great breadth and power, the secondary and tertiary feathers being almost as long as the primaries, giving an immense surface to the wing and enabling the stork to be a bird of lofty and long-continued flight. A stork in flight soaring on its powerful wings, with its neck extended and its long legs stretched out straight behind it, makes an imposing sight. The two women seen in Zechariah’s vision (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004242/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Zec 5:6-11</a>) carrying an ephah measure containing the woman called “Wickedness” are described as having “wings like the wings of the stork.” The reference to the ‘wind in their wings’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004242/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">vs 9</a>) harmonizes also with the rushing sound produced by the air passing through the stork’s pinions. The primary feathers are fingered out in flight so that slots are formed at the ends of the wings, thereby controlling the airflow over the top of the wings and improving their lifting power.</p>

<strong>The Ostrich and the Stork</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In flight the stork is the very picture of grace. Its enormous wingspan can reach 8.5 feet (2.6 m). With their marvelous flying power, some storks winter in distant lands to the south. Ostriches are not so blessed. Their large bodies remain earthbound even when their wings flap furiously. Thus the Bible asks: “Has the wing of the female ostrich flapped joyously, or has she the pinions of a stork and the plumage?”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101987005/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 39:13</a>.</p>

For she leaves her eggs to the earth itself and in the dust she keeps them warm, and she forgets that some foot may crush them or even a wild beast of the field may tread on them. She does treat her sons roughly, as if not hers—in vain is her toil because she has no dread. For God has made her forget wisdom, and he has not given her a share in understanding.

No. The stork has powerful wings and flies very high in the air. The Bible speaks of “the stork in the heavens.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jer. 8:7</a>) But the ostrich, though it flaps its wings, cannot do the same.

But can the ostrich flap its wings in such a joyous way?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">What a contrast, too, between the ostrich and the stork as to where they nest and lay their eggs. The female ostrich “leaves her eggs to the earth itself.” It is not said that the female ostrich in the wild necessarily forsakes her eggs. No, but she leaves her eggs to the earth itself rather than trust them to a nest built on a lofty tree, as does the stork. “As for the stork, the juniper trees are its house.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 104:17</a>) The stork’s large and well-compacted nest is usually built in the loftiest places. Not so the ostrich. The earth is her nest. In nontropical countries the female birds incubate by day, the males taking their turn by night, carefully guarding the eggs. In tropical countries the parent birds incubate by turn during the night but leave them by day to the sun’s heat, the eggs being partly or wholly covered with sand or dust. “Actual incubation of the eggs is performed by the heat of the sun.” (<em>The New Funk &amp; Wagnalls Encyclopedia</em>) By leaving her eggs to the earth and by keeping them warm in the dust, she appears to be doing a stupid thing: “She forgets that some foot may crush them or even a wild beast of the field may tread on them.” She may need to leave the eggs uncared-for at the approach of enemies.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Not only is there a difference in the nest location of the ostrich and the stork but also in the way they treat their young. Says John Kitto, in <em>The Pictorial Bible,</em> about storks: “No bird is more famous for its attachment to its young; and, which is more rare among birds, for the kindness to the old and feeble of its own race.” But the ostrich? “She does treat her sons roughly, as if not hers.” Wrote God’s prophet Jeremiah: “The daughter of my people becomes cruel, like ostriches in the wilderness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Lam. 4:3</a>) Commenting on this rough treatment, English traveler Thomas Shaw wrote in <em>Travels in Barbary:</em></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="si">“A very little share of that natural affection, which so strongly exerts itself in most other creatures, is observable in the ostrich. For, upon the least distant noise, or trivial occasion, she forsakes her eggs or her young ones, to which perhaps she never returns; or, if she does, it may be too late. . . . The Arabs meet sometimes with whole nests of <span id="page424" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="424" data-before-text="424"></span>these eggs undisturbed, some of which are sweet and good, others addled and corrupted. . . .

<strong>Osprey</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One of the “flying creatures” decreed as unclean and not to be eaten, according to the Law covenant. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013270/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Lev. 11:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013270/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Deut. 14:12</a>) Its Hebrew name (<em>peʹres</em>) literally means “the breaker.” Understanding this to refer to the breaking of bones by a bird of prey, the <em>Authorized Version</em> renders <em>peʹres</em> as “ossifrage,” a name deriving from Latin and meaning “bone-breaker.” However, ossifrage in English is rather indefinite, since the name has been variously applied to three distinct birds: the lammergeier or bearded vulture, the giant petrel, and the osprey. The <span id="page1258" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1258" data-before-text="1258"></span>English name osprey, in fact, comes from ossifrage via the Old French <em>osfrai.</em> Others understand the Hebrew name to indicate a bird “tearing its prey” apart, and hence not necessarily denoting a breaker of bones.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The osprey, often called the “fish hawk,” appears to be related to the falcons and hawks but with certain distinct features, including feet with some similarity to those of the owl. The osprey’s head and beak resemble those of the hawk, the body and wings are dark brown above and the underparts are white with streaks of brown. Measuring about two and a half feet (.8 meter) in length, it has a wingspan of nearly six feet (1.8 meters). The osprey is found throughout the world, living near large bodies of water, where it feeds on fish that swim near the surface. The bird glides almost effortlessly above the water, wheeling gracefully and hovering until it locates its prey. Then it plunges swiftly downward, striking the water forcefully feet first, at times disappearing beneath the surface. It is admirably equipped for this type of attack, having dense compact plumage on its underparts to withstand some of the impact of hitting the water, and long, curved, very sharp claws that extend out from rough toes, enabling the bird to get a firm grip on its slippery prey. Observers say that, in flying with the fish to shore to devour it, the osprey always grips the fish so that its head faces forward, thereby reducing air resistance. In Palestine the osprey appears particularly along the Mediterranean coast.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Other suggestions for the bird designated by the Hebrew <em>peʹres</em> include the sea eagle (distinct from the osprey), and the lammergeier, a vulture known to carry bones and tortoises to some height and then drop them on rocks in order to break them open.</p>

<strong>Storehouse</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Rather than looking to earthly goods and accordingly building up a great store of them, the wise writer of Proverbs says: “Honor Jehovah with your valuable things . . .

Here the female lays the eggs, weighing some 1.5 kg (3 lb) each, and since the ostrich is often polygamous (unlike the stork, which is renowned for its fidelity to one mate), there may be a good number of eggs laid in the nest by the two or three hens. The male ostrich warms the nest eggs during the night and the hen incubates them by day, but she is known to leave the nest for periods during the day when the sun is hot. At such times the eggs, though very thick-shelled, are, nevertheless, vulnerable to damage or despoiling by animals or man.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003347/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 39:14, 15</a>.</p>

The <span id="page1258" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1258" data-before-text="1258"></span>English name osprey, in fact, comes from ossifrage via the Old French <em>osfrai.</em> Others understand the Hebrew name to indicate a bird “tearing its prey” apart, and hence not necessarily denoting a breaker of bones.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The osprey, often called the “fish hawk,” appears to be related to the falcons and hawks but with certain distinct features, including feet with some similarity to those of the owl. The osprey’s head and beak resemble those of the hawk, the body and wings are dark brown above and the underparts are white with streaks of brown. Measuring about two and a half feet (.8 meter) in length, it has a wingspan of nearly six feet (1.8 meters). The osprey is found throughout the world, living near large bodies of water, where it feeds on fish that swim near the surface. The bird glides almost effortlessly above the water, wheeling gracefully and hovering until it locates its prey. Then it plunges swiftly downward, striking the water forcefully feet first, at times disappearing beneath the surface. It is admirably equipped for this type of attack, having dense compact plumage on its underparts to withstand some of the impact of hitting the water, and long, curved, very sharp claws that extend out from rough toes, enabling the bird to get a firm grip on its slippery prey. Observers say that, in flying with the fish to shore to devour it, the osprey always grips the fish so that its head faces forward, thereby reducing air resistance. In Palestine the osprey appears particularly along the Mediterranean coast.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Other suggestions for the bird designated by the Hebrew <em>peʹres</em> include the sea eagle (distinct from the osprey), and the lammergeier, a vulture known to carry bones and tortoises to some height and then drop them on rocks in order to break them open.</p>

<strong>Ostrich</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Again in contrast to the stork, which builds its big nest firmly in the tops of trees (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003347/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps 104:17</a>), buildings, or tall rocks, the ostrich merely scoops out a shallow depression in the ground surrounded by a low embankment. Here the female lays the eggs, weighing some 1.5 kg (3 lb) each, and since the ostrich is often polygamous (unlike the stork, which is renowned for its fidelity to one mate), there may be a good number of eggs laid in the nest by the two or three hens. The male ostrich warms the nest eggs during the night and the hen incubates them by day, but she is known to leave the nest for periods during the day when the sun is hot. At such times the eggs, though very thick-shelled, are, nevertheless, vulnerable to damage or despoiling by animals or man.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003347/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 39:14, 15</a>.</p>

<strong>The Prevailing Will of God</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="si">“They are little inferior in size to elephants; they are bulls in their nature, color and figure.

For she leaves her eggs to the earth itself and in the dust she keeps them warm, and she forgets that some foot may crush them or even a wild beast of the field may tread on them. She does treat her sons roughly, as if not hers—in vain is her toil because she has no dread. For God has made her forget wisdom, and he has not given her a share in understanding. At the time she flaps her wings on high, she laughs at the horse and at its rider.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 39:13-18</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Has the wing of the ostrich flapped joyously, as that of the stork? No. The stork has powerful wings and flies very high in the air. The Bible speaks of “the stork in the heavens.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jer. 8:7</a>) But the ostrich, though it flaps its wings, cannot do the same. The stork’s pinions are of great breadth and power, the secondaries and tertiaries being as long as the primaries, giving an immense surface to the wing and enabling it to be a bird of lofty and long-continued flight. But can the ostrich flap its wings in such a joyous way?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">What a contrast, too, between the ostrich and the stork as to where they nest and lay their eggs. The female ostrich “leaves her eggs to the earth itself.” It is not said that the female ostrich in the wild necessarily forsakes her eggs. No, but she leaves her eggs to the earth itself rather than trust them to a nest built on a lofty tree, as does the stork. “As for the stork, the juniper trees are its house.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 104:17</a>) The stork’s large and well-compacted nest is usually built in the loftiest places. Not so the ostrich. The earth is her nest. In nontropical countries the female birds incubate by day, the males taking their turn by night, carefully guarding the eggs. In tropical countries the parent birds incubate by turn during the night but leave them by day to the sun’s heat, the eggs being partly or wholly covered with sand or dust. “Actual incubation of the eggs is performed by the heat of the sun.” (<em>The New Funk &amp; Wagnalls Encyclopedia</em>) By leaving her eggs to the earth and by keeping them warm in the dust, she appears to be doing a stupid thing: “She forgets that some foot may crush them or even a wild beast of the field may tread on them.” She may need to leave the eggs uncared-for at the approach of enemies.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Not only is there a difference in the nest location of the ostrich and the stork but also in the way they treat their young. Says John Kitto, in <em>The Pictorial Bible,</em> about storks: “No bird is more famous for its attachment to its young; and, which is more rare among birds, for the kindness to the old and feeble of its own race.” But the ostrich? “She does treat her sons roughly, as if not hers.” Wrote God’s prophet Jeremiah: “The daughter of my people becomes cruel, like ostriches in the wilderness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Lam. 4:3</a>) Commenting on this rough treatment, English traveler Thomas Shaw wrote in <em>Travels in Barbary:</em></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="si">“A very little share of that natural affection, which so strongly exerts itself in most other creatures, is observable in the ostrich.

<strong>Ostrich</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>‘Treats Sons Roughly.’</strong> The statement that the ostrich “does treat her sons roughly, as if not hers” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003347/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 39:16</a>) and reference to ostriches as being “cruel” with respect to their offspring (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003347/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">La 4:3</a>) have been objected to by some who claim that parent ostriches are quite solicitous in caring for their young. While it is true that the Hebrew term (<em>rena·nimʹ</em>) used at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003347/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Job 39:13</a> may grammatically apply to either male or female ostriches, some lexicographers understand it to refer to the female birds. This would seem to be the case in view of the connection with the eggs laid, obviously, by the hen bird. When understood as applying to the female, there is certainly good basis for this poetic expression concerning the ‘cruelty’ of the bird in the fact that, once the young are hatched, the male “assumes all their care while the hens generally go off together.” (<em>All the Birds of the Bible,</em> by Alice Parmelee, 1959, p. 207) It is also true that these powerful birds, both male and female, quickly abandon the nest and their young when sensing danger, and even though they may use diversionary tactics to draw enemies away from the nest, this is still ‘rough’ treatment for the unprotected young. Only the protective coloration given by the Creator is what may save the undefended and abandoned chicks, causing the enemy beasts to overlook them and chase after the fleeing parents. The ostrich may properly be termed “cruel,” then, as compared with many other birds and particularly in contrast with the stork, whose affectionate attention and constant concern for its young are proverbial.</p>

<strong>Fleet-Footed, Flightless, and Fascinating—The Ostrich</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Protection of the chicks rests with the parent birds. That the ostrich buries its head in the sand when faced with danger is a myth. On the contrary, parent birds can be fiercely aggressive when protecting their brood, driving away predators with powerful kicks. Another defense tactic they employ is distracting the predator by pretending to be wounded, thus drawing attention away from their <span id="page18" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>young and to themselves. However, if a predator comes too close to them, the parents usually turn tail and run for their lives, leaving their young to fend for themselves. The Bible statement is proved true, for on these occasions the ostrich “does treat her sons roughly, as if not hers.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101999525/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 39:16</a>.</p>

For she leaves her eggs to the earth itself and in the dust she keeps them warm, and she forgets that some foot may crush them or even a wild beast of the field may tread on them. She does treat her sons roughly, as if not hers—in vain is her toil because she has no dread. For God has made her forget wisdom, and he has not given her a share in understanding. At the time she flaps her wings on high, she laughs at the horse and at its rider.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 39:13-18</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Has the wing of the ostrich flapped joyously, as that of the stork? No. The stork has powerful wings and flies very high in the air. The Bible speaks of “the stork in the heavens.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jer. 8:7</a>) But the ostrich, though it flaps its wings, cannot do the same. The stork’s pinions are of great breadth and power, the secondaries and tertiaries being as long as the primaries, giving an immense surface to the wing and enabling it to be a bird of lofty and long-continued flight. But can the ostrich flap its wings in such a joyous way?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">What a contrast, too, between the ostrich and the stork as to where they nest and lay their eggs. The female ostrich “leaves her eggs to the earth itself.” It is not said that the female ostrich in the wild necessarily forsakes her eggs. No, but she leaves her eggs to the earth itself rather than trust them to a nest built on a lofty tree, as does the stork. “As for the stork, the juniper trees are its house.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 104:17</a>) The stork’s large and well-compacted nest is usually built in the loftiest places. Not so the ostrich. The earth is her nest. In nontropical countries the female birds incubate by day, the males taking their turn by night, carefully guarding the eggs. In tropical countries the parent birds incubate by turn during the night but leave them by day to the sun’s heat, the eggs being partly or wholly covered with sand or dust. “Actual incubation of the eggs is performed by the heat of the sun.” (<em>The New Funk &amp; Wagnalls Encyclopedia</em>) By leaving her eggs to the earth and by keeping them warm in the dust, she appears to be doing a stupid thing: “She forgets that some foot may crush them or even a wild beast of the field may tread on them.” She may need to leave the eggs uncared-for at the approach of enemies.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Not only is there a difference in the nest location of the ostrich and the stork but also in the way they treat their young. Says John Kitto, in <em>The Pictorial Bible,</em> about storks: “No bird is more famous for its attachment to its young; and, which is more rare among birds, for the kindness to the old and feeble of its own race.” But the ostrich? “She does treat her sons roughly, as if not hers.” Wrote God’s prophet Jeremiah: “The daughter of my people becomes cruel, like ostriches in the wilderness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Lam. 4:3</a>) Commenting on this rough treatment, English traveler Thomas Shaw wrote in <em>Travels in Barbary:</em></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="si">“A very little share of that natural affection, which so strongly exerts itself in most other creatures, is observable in the ostrich. For, upon the least distant noise, or trivial occasion, she forsakes her eggs or her young ones, to which perhaps she never returns; or, if she does, it may be too late. . . .

<strong>Osprey</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One of the “flying creatures” decreed as unclean and not to be eaten, according to the Law covenant. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013270/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Lev. 11:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013270/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Deut. 14:12</a>) Its Hebrew name (<em>peʹres</em>) literally means “the breaker.” Understanding this to refer to the breaking of bones by a bird of prey, the <em>Authorized Version</em> renders <em>peʹres</em> as “ossifrage,” a name deriving from Latin and meaning “bone-breaker.” However, ossifrage in English is rather indefinite, since the name has been variously applied to three distinct birds: the lammergeier or bearded vulture, the giant petrel, and the osprey. The <span id="page1258" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1258" data-before-text="1258"></span>English name osprey, in fact, comes from ossifrage via the Old French <em>osfrai.</em> Others understand the Hebrew name to indicate a bird “tearing its prey” apart, and hence not necessarily denoting a breaker of bones.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The osprey, often called the “fish hawk,” appears to be related to the falcons and hawks but with certain distinct features, including feet with some similarity to those of the owl. The osprey’s head and beak resemble those of the hawk, the body and wings are dark brown above and the underparts are white with streaks of brown. Measuring about two and a half feet (.8 meter) in length, it has a wingspan of nearly six feet (1.8 meters). The osprey is found throughout the world, living near large bodies of water, where it feeds on fish that swim near the surface. The bird glides almost effortlessly above the water, wheeling gracefully and hovering until it locates its prey. Then it plunges swiftly downward, striking the water forcefully feet first, at times disappearing beneath the surface. It is admirably equipped for this type of attack, having dense compact plumage on its underparts to withstand some of the impact of hitting the water, and long, curved, very sharp claws that extend out from rough toes, enabling the bird to get a firm grip on its slippery prey. Observers say that, in flying with the fish to shore to devour it, the osprey always grips the fish so that its head faces forward, thereby reducing air resistance. In Palestine the osprey appears particularly along the Mediterranean coast.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Other suggestions for the bird designated by the Hebrew <em>peʹres</em> include the sea eagle (distinct from the osprey), and the lammergeier, a vulture known to carry bones and tortoises to some height and then drop them on rocks in order to break them open.</p>

<strong>Ostrich</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><strong>‘Forgets Wisdom.’</strong> The ostrich is said to “forget wisdom” and ‘not share in understanding.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003347/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Job 39:17</a>) Modern observers have acknowledged this. The Arabs have a saying “more foolish than an ostrich.” (<em>Soncino Books of the Bible,</em> edited by A. Cohen, London, 1946, Job, p. 205) The ostrich <span id="page563" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="563" data-before-text="563"></span>tends to run in a large curve, which permits its pursuers, if sufficient in number, to surround it. But on a straight course the ostrich’s powerful legs enable it to ‘laugh at the horse and at its rider.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003347/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Job 39:18</a>) When running, its strides lengthen out to cover as much as 3.5 m (11 ft) at a time, and its pace may reach as high as 70 km/​hr (44 mph). The wings, useless for flight, nevertheless help to give balance to the bird’s heavy body as it runs.</p>

However, <em>An Encyclopedia of Bible Animals</em> says: “This is a distraction technique: [ostriches] will make themselves conspicuous and flap their wings to attract the attention of any animal or person who threatens, and thus lead them away from the eggs.”</p>

<strong>The Ostrich and the Stork</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Ostriches, by contrast, are polygamous, and the hens are not overly concerned about their eggs. These are gathered into a communal nest, but some are left outside. When ostriches sense danger, they temporarily abandon their eggs or chicks.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204407/944/0">6/22/1979, p. 22</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>The Ostrich—Largest Bird on Earth</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">The relatively low mentality of ostriches often presents problems when farming with them. For example: A male may take four or five females with him, sectioning off a portion of the veld. However, with so many females, about 35 to 40 eggs will lie scattered about the nest, some inside, others outside. During the day, each female chooses a few and “covers” them. By nightfall, the male probably will select just the center position on the nest and cover those eggs. Hence, many eggs never hatch.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">To add to this problem, the male and the female will desert the nest three or four days after the first chicks have been hatched, regardless of how many eggs remain unhatched. No wonder the Bible indicates that “God has made [the ostrich] forget wisdom, and he has not given her a share in understanding.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101979447/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 39:17</a>) For these and other reasons, to ensure a reasonable degree of success, incubators are used for hatching the eggs, rather than relying on such irresponsible parents.</p>

The above-quoted book says, on pages 24, 25:</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="si">“We have every reason to admit that animals, like human beings, can fear, hate, feel affection and disgust and homesickness, love their native environment, experience anger and terror, possess the social and imitative instincts and feel pleasure, sorrow, joy and depression.”</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"><span id="page19" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>But these emotions are generally only temporary and are not based on reason.

They can look forward to time indefinite, to infinity.

Man builds for the future. He uses the information and discoveries of history to plan his future, and most men would like to continue to pursue their purposes to time indefinite. Men “dread” the end of their lives. They know how life turns out​—first, the aging process toward death, then the leaving of loved ones, being unable to carry out their projected works, the ceasing of all enjoyment and being soon forgotten. But animals do not have that “dread,” just as the Bible says with regard to the ostrich.</p>

Man builds for the future. He uses the information and discoveries of history to plan his future, and most men would like to continue to pursue their purposes to time indefinite. Men “dread” the end of their lives. They know how life turns out​—first, the aging process toward death, then the leaving of loved ones, being unable to carry out their projected works, the ceasing of all enjoyment and being soon forgotten. But animals do not have that “dread,” just as the Bible says with regard to the ostrich.</p>

Measuring about two and a half feet (.8 meter) in length, it has a wingspan of nearly six feet (1.8 meters). The osprey is found throughout the world, living near large bodies of water, where it feeds on fish that swim near the surface. The bird glides almost effortlessly above the water, wheeling gracefully and hovering until it locates its prey. Then it plunges swiftly downward, striking the water forcefully feet first, at times disappearing beneath the surface. It is admirably equipped for this type of attack, having dense compact plumage on its underparts to withstand some of the impact of hitting the water, and long, curved, very sharp claws that extend out from rough toes, enabling the bird to get a firm grip on its slippery prey. Observers say that, in flying with the fish to shore to devour it, the osprey always grips the fish so that its head faces forward, thereby reducing air resistance. In Palestine the osprey appears particularly along the Mediterranean coast.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Other suggestions for the bird designated by the Hebrew <em>peʹres</em> include the sea eagle (distinct from the osprey), and the lammergeier, a vulture known to carry bones and tortoises to some height and then drop them on rocks in order to break them open.</p>

<strong>Ostrich</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><strong>‘Forgets Wisdom.’</strong> The ostrich is said to “forget wisdom” and ‘not share in understanding.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003347/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Job 39:17</a>) Modern observers have acknowledged this. The Arabs have a saying “more foolish than an ostrich.” (<em>Soncino Books of the Bible,</em> edited by A. Cohen, London, 1946, Job, p. 205) The ostrich <span id="page563" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="563" data-before-text="563"></span>tends to run in a large curve, which permits its pursuers, if sufficient in number, to surround it. But on a straight course the ostrich’s powerful legs enable it to ‘laugh at the horse and at its rider.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003347/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Job 39:18</a>) When running, its strides lengthen out to cover as much as 3.5 m (11 ft) at a time, and its pace may reach as high as 70 km/​hr (44 mph). The wings, useless for flight, nevertheless help to give balance to the bird’s heavy body as it runs.</p>

Jehovah told Job of the ostrich, which “laughs at the horse and at its rider.” Indeed, this eight-foot-tall (2.5 m) bird may be flightless, but it can run 40 miles per hour (65 km/​hr), covering up to 15 feet (4.5 m) in a single stride! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002027/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 39:13,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002027/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 18</a>) On the other hand, the albatross spends most of its life in the air over the seas. A natural glider, this bird has a wingspan of some 11 feet (3 m). It may soar for hours at a stretch without flapping its wings. By way of contrast, at only two inches (5 cm) in length, the bee hummingbird is the smallest bird in the world. It may flap its wings up to 80 times in a second! Hummingbirds, glittering like little winged gems, can hover like helicopters and even fly backward.</p>

<strong>“Observe Intently the Birds”</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The Bible makes many references to birds, often to teach valuable lessons. For example, concerning the ostrich and its incredible speed, God said to a man named Job: “When she rises up and flaps her wings, she laughs at the horse and at its rider.”<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/102014285/0">a</a> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102014285/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 39:13,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102014285/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 18</a>) God also asked Job: “Is it by your understanding that the falcon soars, . . . or is it at your order that an eagle flies upward?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102014285/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 39:26, 27</a>) The lesson? Birds perform their feats without any help from us. Their abilities testify to God’s wisdom, not ours.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204407/949/0">7/22/1999, p. 16</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Fleet-Footed, Flightless, and Fascinating—The Ostrich</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Because of its great size and weight, it cannot fly. However, its muscular legs are powerful enough to make it one of the fastest creatures on earth. Running across desert country, it can attain speeds of up to 40 miles <strong>[65 km]</strong> per hour! The ostrich “laughs at the horse and at its rider,” notes the Bible. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101999525/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 39:18</a>) True to that observation, this two-legged speedster’s great swiftness and long-distance stamina allow it to outrun many of the fastest four-legged predators with ease.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204407/950/0">1/8/1987, p. 16</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>The Ostrich and the Stork</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When angered or frightened, however, an ostrich can run as fast as 40 miles per hour (64 km/​hr) with the help of its wings. As the Bible states: “At the time she flaps her wings on high, she laughs at the horse and at its rider.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101987005/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 39:18</a>) One observer watched an ostrich chase a horse, giving it powerful kicks.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204407/951/0">6/22/1979, p. 21</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>The Ostrich—Largest Bird on Earth</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">An ostrich has a narrow, bare neck about three feet (1 m) long. Since its wings are small and its body so heavy, averaging about 240 pounds (109 kg), the ostrich cannot fly. However, respect for the bird grows as one observes its muscular thighs and strong legs. These enable it to run at speeds of about 45 miles (72 km) per hour, faster than a horse. Not without good reason, then, the Bible says that the ostrich “laughs at the horse and at its rider.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101979447/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 39:18</a>.</p>

<strong>Speedsters of Creation</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Though the emu is fast, the ostrich generally is viewed as the swiftest bird on land. The wings of these fleet-footed speedsters, though useless for flight, help to give lift to the bird’s heavy body as it runs, enabling it to reach a top speed of 40 miles an hour! The Creator of the ostrich and all the other speedsters of land, sea and air himself commented on that bird’s speed when he told Job that it ‘flaps its wings on high and laughs at the horse and at its rider.’​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101974124/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 39:18</a>.</p>

<strong>Animal Creation Magnifies Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">It may seem that the ostrich ‘forgets wisdom’ when she detects danger from a predator and appears to run away. However, <em>An Encyclopedia of Bible Animals</em> says: “This is a distraction technique: [ostriches] will make themselves conspicuous and flap their wings to attract the attention of any animal or person who threatens, and thus lead them away from the eggs.”</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">How is it that the ostrich “laughs at the horse and at its rider”? Says <em>The World Book Encyclopedia:</em> “The ostrich cannot fly, but it is known for its speed on the ground. Its long legs can take 15-foot (4.6-meter) steps at speeds up to 40 miles (64 kilometers) per hour.”</p>

<strong>The Prevailing Will of God</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="si">“They are little inferior in size to elephants; they are bulls in their nature, color and figure. Great is their strength and great is their swiftness, neither do they spare man or beast, which they have caught sight of. . . . [They] can not be habituated to man and made tractable, not even when caught very young. The great spread of the horns <span id="page423" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="423" data-before-text="423"></span>as well as the shape and quality of them differ much from the horns of our oxen.”</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Little wonder the psalmist David linked the lion and the wild bull together: “Save me from the mouth of the lion, and from the horns of wild bulls you must answer and save me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 22:21</a>) What farmer would trust this wild bull?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>STORK AND OSTRICH CONTRASTED</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">God next asked Job if he could account for the difference between the stork and the ostrich, which are both birds and yet are so unlike in habits:</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">“Has the wing of the female ostrich flapped joyously, or has she the pinions of a stork and the plumage? For she leaves her eggs to the earth itself and in the dust she keeps them warm, and she forgets that some foot may crush them or even a wild beast of the field may tread on them. She does treat her sons roughly, as if not hers—in vain is her toil because she has no dread. For God has made her forget wisdom, and he has not given her a share in understanding. At the time she flaps her wings on high, she laughs at the horse and at its rider.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 39:13-18</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Has the wing of the ostrich flapped joyously, as that of the stork? No. The stork has powerful wings and flies very high in the air. The Bible speaks of “the stork in the heavens.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jer. 8:7</a>) But the ostrich, though it flaps its wings, cannot do the same. The stork’s pinions are of great breadth and power, the secondaries and tertiaries being as long as the primaries, giving an immense surface to the wing and enabling it to be a bird of lofty and long-continued flight. But can the ostrich flap its wings in such a joyous way?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">What a contrast, too, between the ostrich and the stork as to where they nest and lay their eggs. The female ostrich “leaves her eggs to the earth itself.” It is not said that the female ostrich in the wild necessarily forsakes her eggs. No, but she leaves her eggs to the earth itself rather than trust them to a nest built on a lofty tree, as does the stork. “As for the stork, the juniper trees are its house.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 104:17</a>) The stork’s large and well-compacted nest is usually built in the loftiest places. Not so the ostrich. The earth is her nest. In nontropical countries the female birds incubate by day, the males taking their turn by night, carefully guarding the eggs. In tropical countries the parent birds incubate by turn during the night but leave them by day to the sun’s heat, the eggs being partly or wholly covered with sand or dust. “Actual incubation of the eggs is performed by the heat of the sun.” (<em>The New Funk &amp; Wagnalls Encyclopedia</em>) By leaving her eggs to the earth and by keeping them warm in the dust, she appears to be doing a stupid thing: “She forgets that some foot may crush them or even a wild beast of the field may tread on them.” She may need to leave the eggs uncared-for at the approach of enemies.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Not only is there a difference in the nest location of the ostrich and the stork but also in the way they treat their young. Says John Kitto, in <em>The Pictorial Bible,</em> about storks: “No bird is more famous for its attachment to its young; and, which is more rare among birds, for the kindness to the old and feeble of its own race.” But the ostrich? “She does treat her sons roughly, as if not hers.” Wrote God’s prophet Jeremiah: “The daughter of my people becomes cruel, like ostriches in the wilderness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Lam. 4:3</a>) Commenting on this rough treatment, English traveler Thomas Shaw wrote in <em>Travels in Barbary:</em></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="si">“A very little share of that natural affection, which so strongly exerts itself in most other creatures, is observable in the ostrich. For, upon the least distant noise, or trivial occasion, she forsakes her eggs or her young ones, to which perhaps she never returns; or, if she does, it may be too late. . . . The Arabs meet sometimes with whole nests of <span id="page424" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="424" data-before-text="424"></span>these eggs undisturbed, some of which are sweet and good, others addled and corrupted. . . . They oftener meet a few of the little ones, no bigger than well-grown pullets, half-starved, straggling and moaning about, like so many distressed orphans, for their mothers.”</p>

Others, however, believe that the text describes the bird as turning into the oncoming wind and, by the power of its wings, flying into it, ascending higher and higher. Falcons are said to “rise to a great height, always endeavoring to outsoar any bird of which they may be in pursuit” in order to be able to plummet down with fierce velocity upon the prey below, and in doing so they often “avail themselves of the wind, and by flying against it are borne aloft like a kite.” (<em>Funk and Wagnalls New Standard Encyclopedia,</em> 1931, Vol. XI, pp. 329, 330) Similarly the kestrel is sometimes called the windhover “because it <em>hovers</em> (stays in one place) in the air while it hunts. This bird faces into the wind and beats its wings while watching the ground for prey.”​—<em>The World Book Encyclopedia,</em> 1987, Vol. 11, p. 237.</p>

<strong>Should There Be Faultfinding with God?</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The monuments of antiquity abound with pictorial representations of the warhorse, and the horse is often referred to in the Bible as a symbol for war equipment. Horses were used to draw chariots <span id="page486" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="486" data-before-text="486"></span>in which the driver and one or two fighting men rode or as mounts for the warriors who fought from horseback. Israel for a long time won its battles without horses, but later they became common in Israel and Judah and were used in battle.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Ki. 22:4</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">A war-horse, impatient for the battle, neighs and beats the ground with his hoofs. Jehovah’s description shows that it laughs at dread and does not turn back on account of a sword; and the quiver and spear, the arms of the rider, only intensify its eagerness to go forth to meet the armor of the enemy. Wrote English archaeologist Sir Austin Layard: “Although docile as a lamb, and requiring no other guide than the halter, when the Arab mare hears the war-cry of the tribe, and sees the quivering spear of her rider, her eyes glitter with fire, her blood-red nostrils open wide, her neck is nobly arched, and her tail and mane are raised and spread out to the wind.”</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">When the sound of the horn is heard, the horse can hardly believe what his ears tell him; he cannot believe it for his joy. But when he is certain that it is true, he leaps forward, saying “Aha!” He neighs. He rejoices. Forward he goes, ‘swallowing up the ground,’ which is an expression for prodigious swiftness in use among Arabians to the present day.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Yet this intrepid animal is easily subjected to man and made to obey the voice of the rider.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Has any man created this wonder of beauty and intrepidity and endowed him with these extraordinary qualities? Jehovah is its Creator, and He is the One whom the Bible shows also gives to his enthroned King Jesus Christ and the holy angels of heaven war mounts to charge courageously and swiftly into the war of Armageddon at the sound of the war trumpet, riding forward to God’s victory, as Revelation shows: “I saw the heaven opened, and, look! a white horse. And the one seated upon it is called Faithful and True, and he judges and carries on war in righteousness. Also, the armies that were in heaven were following him on white horses.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rev. 19:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 14</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>THE FALCON AND THE EAGLE</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">With more probing questions to correct Job’s thinking, Jehovah continued: “Is it owing to your understanding that the falcon soars up, that it spreads its wings to the south wind? Or is it at your order that an eagle flies upward and that it builds its nest high up, that on a crag it resides and stays during the night upon the tooth of a crag and an inaccessible place? From there it has to search for food; far into the distance its eyes keep looking. And its young ones themselves keep sipping up blood; and where the slain are, there it is.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 39:26-30</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Is it owing to man’s understanding that the falcon is remarkable for the force with which it flies? No, it is not because of human wisdom that the falcon spreads its wings to the south wind, indicating great strength of wing.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">God now turns his attention to the eagle, sometimes called the king of birds. God had opened the series of questions regarding the animal creation with the lion, the king of beasts. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 38:39</a>) Now, closing this section of his speech, the Almighty asks Job about the king of the birds. Is it due to Job’s order that the eagle is remarkable in four ways?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">First, the height of the eagle’s flight. The eagle “flies upward,” to immense heights. No bird is said to soar as high or to have such strength of wing. This power of flight has come from God.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Then there is the security of the eagle’s nest, because “it builds its nest high up,” even “on a crag it resides . . . upon the <span id="page487" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="487" data-before-text="487"></span>tooth of a crag.” Other birds are content with lower elevations, but the eagle builds on inaccessible heights, and thus sets her young out of reach of danger. Is it at man’s order that this bird makes her nest her castle, building it upon the “tooth of a crag”?</p>

But if God is capable of guiding the stars by natural law, of guiding the birds by instinct, then is he not capable of guiding man by the Bible? “Thy word is a lamp to my feet, and a light on my path.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952044/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 119:105</a>, <em>AT.</em></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Consider a few of the fields in which God’s Word gives sure guidance.

Solomon was one of such. He married women not in the truth, probably reasoning that they were nice girls, and that he could get them into the truth after marriage.

<strong>Falcon</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Some suggest that the Hebrew name for this bird derives from a root word meaning “to shine or sparkle” and that it here represents the flashing speed of the bird; others believe the name describes a “high-flying or soaring” bird. Modern lexicographers believe the term applies to falcons, though some consider it to embrace also hawks, which are very similar to the falcons though classified by ornithologists as in a separate “family” grouping. (The <em>Septuagint Version,</em> the Latin <em>Vulgate,</em> the Syriac <span id="page563" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="563" data-before-text="563"></span><em>Peshitta Version,</em> and the Targums all render <em>nets</em> as hawk.) As predators, eating snakes, lizards, small mammals and other birds, “the falcon according to its kind” (“the hawk in its several species,” <em>AT</em>) was among those birds decreed “unclean” in the Mosaic law.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011444/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Lev. 11:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011444/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Deut. 14:15</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The falcon is generally viewed as being unsurpassed as to its symmetry, power and strong speedy flight. Some of its members vie with the swift as the fastest fliers of the bird family, observers crediting one falcon with a diving speed of 180 miles (290 kilometers) per hour. Among the more common falcons found in Palestine, particularly in the central part, is the peregrine falcon, noted for its dashing qualities. As with other falcons (and also hawks) the female peregrine is larger than the male, measuring some eighteen inches (46 centimeters) in length, with a wingspread of about three feet (c. 1 meter). A rather dull-colored bird, the peregrine’s back and wings are a dusky gray, the underparts a creamy white with brownish black bars and “arrowhead” markings crossing the breast and sides. The tail is somewhat rounded. The hooked beak has a notch or tooth on the cutting edge of the upper mandible, and the short strong legs terminate in unusually large feet with powerful curved talons. Also found in Palestine are the somewhat larger lanner falcons, abundant in the cliffs and rocky gorges from Mount Hermon all the way down the Jordan valley to the Dead Sea area, and the saker falcons, occupying the high forest regions E of the Jordan.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The smaller common kestrel (<em>Falco tinnunculus</em>), about fourteen inches (36 centimeters) long, is also a member of the same “genus” as the falcon, and in the age of British and European royal falconry it was called the “poor man’s falcon.” It resembles the North American “sparrow hawk” (<em>Falco sparverius</em>). It is abundant the year round throughout Palestine’s forests, gorges and gardens, and even nests on larger buildings in the cities.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Falcons differ from hawks in various ways. The falcon’s wings are longer and generally narrower than those of the hawk; the tail is also longer. Unlike the hawk, the falcon is not primarily a gliding bird, flying rather with rapid powerful strokes of its long, pointed wings. Falcon nests, located on cliffs, high trees, or even building ledges, are also usually smaller and barer than the hawk’s, some falcons only scooping out a shallow “scape” on a cliff ledge for a nest.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The hawk is considered as a smaller member of the same family as the eagle, with the same curved beak and viselike talons. It characteristically has rather short, slightly rounded wings, broader than those of the falcon. Like the falcon, it often catches its prey in full flight. The eastern sparrow hawk (<em>Accipiter nisus</em>) is very plentiful throughout Palestine, its diet including, among other things, sparrows (whence its name) and turtledoves. It spends the summer months in Lebanon and upper Galilee and winters in Judea and the Arabah region.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011444/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 39:26</a> describes the falcon’s ‘soaring up and spreading its wings to the south wind,’ and this is understood by some to refer to a southward migration (“spreads his wings to travel south,” <em>JB</em>), which would be true of the lesser kestrel of the falcon family and, to some extent, of the peregrine falcon and the sparrow hawk. Others, however, believe that the text describes the bird as turning into the oncoming wind, and, by the power of its wings, flying into it, ascending higher and higher. Falcons are said to “rise to a great height, always endeavoring to outsoar any bird of which they may be in pursuit” so as to be able to plummet down with fierce velocity upon the prey below, and in doing so they often “avail themselves of the wind, and by flying against it are borne aloft like a kite.” (<em>Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Encyclopedia</em>, 1931, Vol. XI, pp. 329, 330) Similarly the kestrel is often called the “windhover” because of the way it “hovers in the air, heading into the wind, and beating its wings rapidly, while watching the ground for prey.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Both the falcon and the hawk are noted for their keen sight, that of the hawk being rated as about eight times sharper than that of man. Falconry, using falcons, hawks, and even eagles, is usually considered as having been started by the ancient Persians and has been practiced for millenniums throughout the earth. There is no evidence, however, of its practice among the Hebrews, to whom all these birds were “unclean.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011444/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Deut. 14:12-19</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The falcon held a very prominent place in the religion of Egypt. It became the symbol of Horus, the falcon-headed god of Egypt, who, together with Isis and Osiris, formed the principal trinity or “holy family” among Egypt’s gods and goddesses. The falcon symbol was always used in writing the title of the pharaohs, and, in some cases, these rulers were considered to be incarnations of Horus. Of the hundreds of mummified birds found in Egypt, the falcon, particularly the kestrel, is among the most numerous. Herodotus said that anyone killing a falcon in Egypt even though accidentally, was put to death.</p>

<strong>Eagle</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>Lofty Nest and Farsightedness.</strong> The nest-building habits of the eagle are emphasized in God’s questioning of Job at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001235/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 39:27-30</a>. The nest or aerie may be in a high tree or on the crag of a cliff or rocky canyon. Over the years the nest may grow to be as much as 2 m (6.5 ft) high, that of some eagles coming to weigh as much as a ton! The apparent security and inaccessibility of the eagle’s nest were also used figuratively by the prophets in their messages against the lofty kingdom of Edom in the rugged mountains of the Arabah region.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001235/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jer 49:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001235/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Ob 3, 4</a>.</p>

<strong>Animal Creation Magnifies Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Eagles have flown at speeds of over 80 miles per hour <strong>[130 km/hr]</strong>. Job compared the swift passing of life to the speed of an eagle searching for prey. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006045/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Job 9:25, 26</a>) God gives us strength to go on, as if we were on the seemingly tireless wings of the soaring eagle. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006045/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:31</a>) In flight, the eagle takes advantage of columns of rising warm air called thermals. The bird circles within a thermal, which carries it higher and higher. When the eagle attains a certain height, it glides to the next thermal and can stay aloft for hours with a minimal expenditure of energy.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">An eagle “builds its nest high up” on inaccessible heights, placing its young out of danger. Jehovah has made the eagle do this instinctively. And with God-given vision, “far into the distance [the eagle’s] eyes keep looking.” The ability rapidly to change the focus of its eyes enables an eagle to keep its prey or a carcass in sight during a long dive. An eagle may eat the carcasses of dead animals, so that “where the slain are, there it is.” This bird catches small animals and carries them to its young.</p>

<strong>Should There Be Faultfinding with God?</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The monuments of antiquity abound with pictorial representations of the warhorse, and the horse is often referred to in the Bible as a symbol for war equipment. Horses were used to draw chariots <span id="page486" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="486" data-before-text="486"></span>in which the driver and one or two fighting men rode or as mounts for the warriors who fought from horseback. Israel for a long time won its battles without horses, but later they became common in Israel and Judah and were used in battle.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Ki. 22:4</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">A war-horse, impatient for the battle, neighs and beats the ground with his hoofs. Jehovah’s description shows that it laughs at dread and does not turn back on account of a sword; and the quiver and spear, the arms of the rider, only intensify its eagerness to go forth to meet the armor of the enemy. Wrote English archaeologist Sir Austin Layard: “Although docile as a lamb, and requiring no other guide than the halter, when the Arab mare hears the war-cry of the tribe, and sees the quivering spear of her rider, her eyes glitter with fire, her blood-red nostrils open wide, her neck is nobly arched, and her tail and mane are raised and spread out to the wind.”</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">When the sound of the horn is heard, the horse can hardly believe what his ears tell him; he cannot believe it for his joy. But when he is certain that it is true, he leaps forward, saying “Aha!” He neighs. He rejoices. Forward he goes, ‘swallowing up the ground,’ which is an expression for prodigious swiftness in use among Arabians to the present day.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Yet this intrepid animal is easily subjected to man and made to obey the voice of the rider.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Has any man created this wonder of beauty and intrepidity and endowed him with these extraordinary qualities? Jehovah is its Creator, and He is the One whom the Bible shows also gives to his enthroned King Jesus Christ and the holy angels of heaven war mounts to charge courageously and swiftly into the war of Armageddon at the sound of the war trumpet, riding forward to God’s victory, as Revelation shows: “I saw the heaven opened, and, look! a white horse. And the one seated upon it is called Faithful and True, and he judges and carries on war in righteousness. Also, the armies that were in heaven were following him on white horses.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rev. 19:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 14</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>THE FALCON AND THE EAGLE</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">With more probing questions to correct Job’s thinking, Jehovah continued: “Is it owing to your understanding that the falcon soars up, that it spreads its wings to the south wind? Or is it at your order that an eagle flies upward and that it builds its nest high up, that on a crag it resides and stays during the night upon the tooth of a crag and an inaccessible place? From there it has to search for food; far into the distance its eyes keep looking. And its young ones themselves keep sipping up blood; and where the slain are, there it is.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 39:26-30</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Is it owing to man’s understanding that the falcon is remarkable for the force with which it flies? No, it is not because of human wisdom that the falcon spreads its wings to the south wind, indicating great strength of wing.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">God now turns his attention to the eagle, sometimes called the king of birds. God had opened the series of questions regarding the animal creation with the lion, the king of beasts. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 38:39</a>) Now, closing this section of his speech, the Almighty asks Job about the king of the birds. Is it due to Job’s order that the eagle is remarkable in four ways?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">First, the height of the eagle’s flight. The eagle “flies upward,” to immense heights. No bird is said to soar as high or to have such strength of wing. This power of flight has come from God.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Then there is the security of the eagle’s nest, because “it builds its nest high up,” even “on a crag it resides . . . upon the <span id="page487" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="487" data-before-text="487"></span>tooth of a crag.” Other birds are content with lower elevations, but the eagle builds on inaccessible heights, and thus sets her young out of reach of danger. Is it at man’s order that this bird makes her nest her castle, building it upon the “tooth of a crag”?</p>

<strong>Eagle</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Some believe that the Hebrew name derives from a root word meaning “to tear in pieces or lacerate.” Others view it as onomatopoeic (that is, a name whose very sound suggests the thing meant), and believe that <em>ne·sherʹ</em> represents a “rushing sound,” or “gleaming flash,” hence a bird that dives after its prey, plummeting downward with a rushing sound and like flashing light through the <span id="page473" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="473" data-before-text="473"></span>air. In either case, the Hebrew term well describes the eagle, a large bird of prey whose lightning plunge from great heights causes a whining sound as the air rushes through its widespread pinions (the outer wing feathers).

For almost all hunters, such as the skunk, the cougar, and ourselves, the single spot of cones is enough; we look straight ahead and approach directly the object of our gaze. But not so the eagle or the hawk, which, having fixed the rabbit in the grass with its sharp focusing cones, may then approach by a long, slanting dive. This causes the image of the target to move across the back of the eyeball on a curved path.

<strong>Should There Be Faultfinding with God?</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The monuments of antiquity abound with pictorial representations of the warhorse, and the horse is often referred to in the Bible as a symbol for war equipment. Horses were used to draw chariots <span id="page486" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="486" data-before-text="486"></span>in which the driver and one or two fighting men rode or as mounts for the warriors who fought from horseback. Israel for a long time won its battles without horses, but later they became common in Israel and Judah and were used in battle.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Ki. 22:4</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">A war-horse, impatient for the battle, neighs and beats the ground with his hoofs. Jehovah’s description shows that it laughs at dread and does not turn back on account of a sword; and the quiver and spear, the arms of the rider, only intensify its eagerness to go forth to meet the armor of the enemy. Wrote English archaeologist Sir Austin Layard: “Although docile as a lamb, and requiring no other guide than the halter, when the Arab mare hears the war-cry of the tribe, and sees the quivering spear of her rider, her eyes glitter with fire, her blood-red nostrils open wide, her neck is nobly arched, and her tail and mane are raised and spread out to the wind.”</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">When the sound of the horn is heard, the horse can hardly believe what his ears tell him; he cannot believe it for his joy. But when he is certain that it is true, he leaps forward, saying “Aha!” He neighs. He rejoices. Forward he goes, ‘swallowing up the ground,’ which is an expression for prodigious swiftness in use among Arabians to the present day.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Yet this intrepid animal is easily subjected to man and made to obey the voice of the rider.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Has any man created this wonder of beauty and intrepidity and endowed him with these extraordinary qualities? Jehovah is its Creator, and He is the One whom the Bible shows also gives to his enthroned King Jesus Christ and the holy angels of heaven war mounts to charge courageously and swiftly into the war of Armageddon at the sound of the war trumpet, riding forward to God’s victory, as Revelation shows: “I saw the heaven opened, and, look! a white horse. And the one seated upon it is called Faithful and True, and he judges and carries on war in righteousness. Also, the armies that were in heaven were following him on white horses.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rev. 19:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 14</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>THE FALCON AND THE EAGLE</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">With more probing questions to correct Job’s thinking, Jehovah continued: “Is it owing to your understanding that the falcon soars up, that it spreads its wings to the south wind? Or is it at your order that an eagle flies upward and that it builds its nest high up, that on a crag it resides and stays during the night upon the tooth of a crag and an inaccessible place? From there it has to search for food; far into the distance its eyes keep looking. And its young ones themselves keep sipping up blood; and where the slain are, there it is.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 39:26-30</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Is it owing to man’s understanding that the falcon is remarkable for the force with which it flies? No, it is not because of human wisdom that the falcon spreads its wings to the south wind, indicating great strength of wing.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">God now turns his attention to the eagle, sometimes called the king of birds. God had opened the series of questions regarding the animal creation with the lion, the king of beasts. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 38:39</a>) Now, closing this section of his speech, the Almighty asks Job about the king of the birds. Is it due to Job’s order that the eagle is remarkable in four ways?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">First, the height of the eagle’s flight. The eagle “flies upward,” to immense heights. No bird is said to soar as high or to have such strength of wing. This power of flight has come from God.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Then there is the security of the eagle’s nest, because “it builds its nest high up,” even “on a crag it resides . . . upon the <span id="page487" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="487" data-before-text="487"></span>tooth of a crag.” Other birds are content with lower elevations, but the eagle builds on inaccessible heights, and thus sets her young out of reach of danger. Is it at man’s order that this bird makes her nest her castle, building it upon the “tooth of a crag”?</p>

<strong>Eagle</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The farsightedness of the eagle, mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001235/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 39:29</a>, is borne out by Rutherford Platt in his book <em>The River of Life</em> (1956, pp. 215, 216), which also shows the unusual design of the eye of the eagle, testifying to the Creator’s wisdom. The book says:</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">“We find the championship eyes of the whole animal kingdom . . . [in] the eyes of the eagle, the vulture, and the hawk. So keen are they that they can look down from a thousand feet in the air and spot a rabbit or a grouse half hidden in the grass.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">“Sharp eyesight of the hunter eye is caused by the reflection of the object falling on a dense clump of pointed, cone-shaped cells. This tiny spot in the back of the eyeball absorbs light rays from the object through thousands of points, in a special manner which summons up a clear image in the mind. For almost all hunters, such as the skunk, the cougar, and ourselves, the single spot of cones is enough; we look straight ahead and approach directly the object of our gaze. But not so the eagle or the hawk, which, having fixed the rabbit in the grass with its sharp focusing cones, may then approach by a long, slanting dive. This causes the image of the target to move across the back of the eyeball on a curved path. Such a path is precisely plotted for the eagle eye so that instead of a clump of cones the diving bird has a curved path of cones. As the eagle zooms down, the rabbit in the grass is thus held in constant focus.”​—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001235/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Jer 49:22</a>.</p>

<figcaption class="figcaption"><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> Eagle</p></figcaption><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The eagle is mentioned many times in the Bible, and its striking silhouette is a familiar feature of the Promised Land. From its nest high up on a cliff, the eagle “searches for food; its eyes look far into the distance.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016404/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 39:27-29</a>) Its sight is so powerful that the eagle can reportedly spot a rabbit half a mile (1 km) away.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Just as the eagle can “look far into the distance,” Jehovah is able to look far into the future. Thus, Jehovah God declared: “From the beginning I foretell the outcome, and from long ago the things that have not yet been done.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016404/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isaiah 46:10</a>) By heeding Jehovah’s counsel, we can benefit from his matchless wisdom and foresight.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016404/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isaiah 48:17, 18</a>.</p>

<strong>Animal Creation Magnifies Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">An eagle “builds its nest high up” on inaccessible heights, placing its young out of danger. Jehovah has made the eagle do this instinctively. And with God-given vision, “far into the distance [the eagle’s] eyes keep looking.” The ability rapidly to change the focus of its eyes enables an eagle to keep its prey or a carcass in sight during a long dive. An eagle may eat the carcasses of dead animals, so that “where the slain are, there it is.” This bird catches small animals and carries them to its young.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204407/979/0">6/15/1996, p. 9</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Mounting Up With Wings Like Eagles</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The keen eyesight of the eagle has always been proverbial. Although the golden eagle rarely weighs more than ten pounds <strong>[5 kg]</strong>, its eye is actually bigger than a man’s, and its eyesight is much keener. Jehovah himself, describing to Job the eagle’s ability to search out its food, said: “Far into the distance its eyes keep looking.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996442/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 39:27,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996442/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 29</a>) Alice Parmelee, in her book <em>All the Birds of the Bible,</em> reports that “an eagle once spotted a dead fish floating in a lake three miles <strong>[5 km]</strong> away and made a diagonal dive to the exact place. Not only was the eagle able to see a small object at a far greater distance than a man could, but the bird kept the fish in constant focus through its three-mile dive.”</p>

<strong>Should There Be Faultfinding with God?</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The monuments of antiquity abound with pictorial representations of the warhorse, and the horse is often referred to in the Bible as a symbol for war equipment. Horses were used to draw chariots <span id="page486" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="486" data-before-text="486"></span>in which the driver and one or two fighting men rode or as mounts for the warriors who fought from horseback. Israel for a long time won its battles without horses, but later they became common in Israel and Judah and were used in battle.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Ki. 22:4</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">A war-horse, impatient for the battle, neighs and beats the ground with his hoofs. Jehovah’s description shows that it laughs at dread and does not turn back on account of a sword; and the quiver and spear, the arms of the rider, only intensify its eagerness to go forth to meet the armor of the enemy. Wrote English archaeologist Sir Austin Layard: “Although docile as a lamb, and requiring no other guide than the halter, when the Arab mare hears the war-cry of the tribe, and sees the quivering spear of her rider, her eyes glitter with fire, her blood-red nostrils open wide, her neck is nobly arched, and her tail and mane are raised and spread out to the wind.”</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">When the sound of the horn is heard, the horse can hardly believe what his ears tell him; he cannot believe it for his joy. But when he is certain that it is true, he leaps forward, saying “Aha!” He neighs. He rejoices. Forward he goes, ‘swallowing up the ground,’ which is an expression for prodigious swiftness in use among Arabians to the present day.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Yet this intrepid animal is easily subjected to man and made to obey the voice of the rider.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Has any man created this wonder of beauty and intrepidity and endowed him with these extraordinary qualities? Jehovah is its Creator, and He is the One whom the Bible shows also gives to his enthroned King Jesus Christ and the holy angels of heaven war mounts to charge courageously and swiftly into the war of Armageddon at the sound of the war trumpet, riding forward to God’s victory, as Revelation shows: “I saw the heaven opened, and, look! a white horse. And the one seated upon it is called Faithful and True, and he judges and carries on war in righteousness. Also, the armies that were in heaven were following him on white horses.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rev. 19:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 14</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>THE FALCON AND THE EAGLE</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">With more probing questions to correct Job’s thinking, Jehovah continued: “Is it owing to your understanding that the falcon soars up, that it spreads its wings to the south wind? Or is it at your order that an eagle flies upward and that it builds its nest high up, that on a crag it resides and stays during the night upon the tooth of a crag and an inaccessible place? From there it has to search for food; far into the distance its eyes keep looking. And its young ones themselves keep sipping up blood; and where the slain are, there it is.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 39:26-30</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Is it owing to man’s understanding that the falcon is remarkable for the force with which it flies? No, it is not because of human wisdom that the falcon spreads its wings to the south wind, indicating great strength of wing.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">God now turns his attention to the eagle, sometimes called the king of birds. God had opened the series of questions regarding the animal creation with the lion, the king of beasts. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 38:39</a>) Now, closing this section of his speech, the Almighty asks Job about the king of the birds. Is it due to Job’s order that the eagle is remarkable in four ways?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">First, the height of the eagle’s flight. The eagle “flies upward,” to immense heights. No bird is said to soar as high or to have such strength of wing. This power of flight has come from God.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Then there is the security of the eagle’s nest, because “it builds its nest high up,” even “on a crag it resides . . . upon the <span id="page487" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="487" data-before-text="487"></span>tooth of a crag.” Other birds are content with lower elevations, but the eagle builds on inaccessible heights, and thus sets her young out of reach of danger. Is it at man’s order that this bird makes her nest her castle, building it upon the “tooth of a crag”?</p>

Germans have a similar expression (<em>Adlerauge</em>). Not without reason, the eagle’s keen eyesight has been proverbial for centuries. The book of Job, written over three thousand years ago, says of the eagle: “Far into the distance its eyes keep looking.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102002927/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 39:27,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102002927/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 29</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">How far into the distance can an eagle actually see? “Under ideal conditions a golden eagle (<em>Aquila chrysaetos</em>) can detect the slight movements of a rabbit from more than [1 1⁄4 miles] <strong>[2 km]</strong> away,” explains <em>The Guinness Book of Animal Records.</em> Others have estimated that the eagle can see even farther!</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">What gives the eagle such acute vision? First of all, the golden eagle has two huge eyes, which occupy a large portion of the head. The <em>Book of British Birds</em> notes that in the case of the golden eagle, its eyes “are, in fact, as large as they could be without becoming so heavy as to impair flight.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Furthermore, an eagle’s eye has approximately five times the number of light-receptor cells that we have​—some 1,000,000 cones per square millimeter compared to our 200,000. Practically each receptor is connected to a neuron. As a result, the eagle’s optic nerve, which carries messages from the eye to the brain, contains double the number of fibers found in that of a human. Little wonder that these creatures have keen color perception! Finally, birds of prey, like other birds, have eyes equipped with a powerful lens that can change its focus quickly from objects an inch away <strong>[a few centimeters away]</strong> to those at a great distance. Their eyes far outmatch ours in this respect as well.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The eagle’s vision excels during broad daylight, but at night the owls have the advantage. These nocturnal raptors have eyes with abundant light-sensitive rods and a large lens surface. As a result, they can see 100 times better at night than we can. On those rare occasions when there is total darkness, however, owls must depend exclusively on their acute hearing to locate prey.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Who gave these birds such attributes? God asked Job: “Is it at your order that an eagle flies upward?” Obviously, no man can claim credit for this marvel of creation. Job himself humbly admitted: “I have come to know that you [Jehovah] are able to do all things.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102002927/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 39:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102002927/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 42:1, 2</a>) The eye of the eagle is just one more testimony to the wisdom of our Creator.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="se"><strong>[Picture on page 24]</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> Golden eagle</p>

<strong>Eagle</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Some believe that the Hebrew name derives from a root word meaning “to tear in pieces or lacerate.” Others view it as onomatopoeic (that is, a name whose very sound suggests the thing meant), and believe that <em>ne·sherʹ</em> represents a “rushing sound,” or “gleaming flash,” hence a bird that dives after its prey, plummeting downward with a rushing sound and like flashing light through the <span id="page473" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="473" data-before-text="473"></span>air. In either case, the Hebrew term well describes the eagle, a large bird of prey whose lightning plunge from great heights causes a whining sound as the air rushes through its widespread pinions (the outer wing feathers). A bird of prey and a drinker of blood (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011203/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 39:27,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011203/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 30</a>), the eagle was included among those birds listed as “unclean” by the Mosaic law.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011203/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Lev. 11:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011203/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Deut. 14:12</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>PALESTINIAN VARIETIES</strong></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Of the eagles found in Palestine today, the most common are the imperial and the golden eagles, although other varieties, such as the short-toed eagle, are also seen. The golden eagle, named thus because of the golden sheen on its head and nape, winters throughout Palestine and spends the summer months in mountainous Lebanon. An impressive dark-brown bird, it measures about three feet (one meter) in length, with a total wingspan of about four feet (1.2 meters). Eagles characteristically have a rather broad head with a projecting ridge above the eyes, a short, powerful, hooked beak, sturdy legs and sharp, powerful talons.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>‘CARRIED ON WINGS OF EAGLES’</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The Sinai region is called “eagle country,” where the birds soar and glide on their strong, broad wings. So, the liberated Israelites gathered at Mount Sinai could well appreciate the aptness of the picture conveyed by God’s words, that he had carried them out of Egypt “on wings of eagles.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011203/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex. 19:4</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011203/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 12:14</a>.) Nearly forty years later Moses could compare Jehovah’s leading of Israel through the wilderness to that of an eagle that “stirs up its nest, hovers over its fledglings, spreads out its wings, takes them, carries them on its pinions.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011203/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Deut. 32:9-12</a>) When the young eaglets reach the time to begin flying, the parent eagle stirs them up, fluttering and flapping its wings to convey the idea to its young, and then edges or lures them out of the nest so that they try out their wings.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Though some have doubted that the eagle ever actually carries the young on its back, a guide in Scotland is reported by Sir W. B. Thomas as testifying concerning the golden eagle that “the parent birds, after urging and sometimes shoving the youngster into the air, will swoop underneath and rest the struggler for a moment on their wings and back.” An observer in the United States is quoted in the <em>Bulletin of the Smithsonian Institution</em> (Vol. CLXVII, p. 302) as saying: “The mother started from the nest in the crags and, roughly handling the youngster, she allowed him to drop, I should say, about ninety feet; then she would swoop down under him, wings spread, and he would alight on her back. She would soar to the top of the range with him and repeat the process . . . My father and I watched him, spellbound, for over an hour.” G. R. Driver, commenting on these statements, says: “The picture [at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011203/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:11</a>] then is not a mere flight of fancy but is based on actual fact.”—<em>Palestine Exploration Quarterly,</em> Jan.-June 1958, pp. 56, 57.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>NESTS AND FARSIGHTEDNESS</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The nest-building habits of the eagle are emphasized in God’s questioning of Job at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011203/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 39:27-30</a>. The nest or aerie may be in a high tree or on the crag of a cliff or rocky canyon. Over the years the nest may grow to be as much as seven feet (2 meters) high, that of some eagles coming to weigh as much as a ton (.9 metric ton)! The apparent security and inaccessibility of the eagle’s nest were also used figuratively by the prophets in their messages against the lofty kingdom of Edom in the rugged mountains of the Arabah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011203/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jer. 49:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011203/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Obad. 3, 4</a>) The farsightedness of the eagle, mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011203/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 39:29</a>, is borne out by Rutherford Platt in his book <em>The River of Life</em> (1956, pp. 215, 216), which also shows the unusual design of the eye of the eagle, testifying to the Creator’s wisdom. The book says:</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">“We find the championship eyes of the whole animal kingdom . . . [in] the eyes of the eagle, the vulture, and the hawk. So keen are they that they can look down from a thousand feet in the air and spot a rabbit or a grouse half hidden in the grass.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">“Sharp eyesight of the hunter eye is caused by the reflection of the object falling on a dense clump of pointed, cone-shaped cells. This tiny spot in the back of the eyeball absorbs light rays from the object through thousands of points, in a special manner which summons up a clear image in the mind. For almost all hunters, such as the skunk, the cougar, and ourselves, the single spot of cones is enough; we look straight ahead and approach directly the object of our gaze. But not so the eagle or the hawk, which, having fixed the rabbit in the grass with its sharp focusing cones, may then approach by a long, slanting dive. This causes the image of the target to move across the back of the eyeball on a curved path. Such a path is precisely plotted for the eagle eye so that instead of a clump of cones the diving bird has a curved path of cones. As the eagle zooms down, the rabbit in the grass is thus held in constant focus.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011203/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Jer. 49:22</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>FLIGHT ABILITIES</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The eagle’s swiftness is highlighted in many texts.

Solomon warned that wealth “makes wings for itself” like those of a skyward-bound eagle (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011203/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Prov. 23:4, 5</a>), while Job mourned the swiftness of life’s passing, comparing it with the speed of an eagle in search of prey. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011203/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Job 9:25, 26</a>) Yet those trusting in Jehovah receive power to go on, as if mounting up on the seemingly tireless wing of the soaring eagle.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011203/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Isa. 40:31</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Modern scientists have wondered at the “way of an eagle in the heavens,” as did the writer of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011203/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Proverbs 30:19</a>. In the April 1962 issue of <em>Scientific American,</em> Clarence D. Cone, Jr., relates the manner in which observation of the majestic and almost effortless soaring of eagles, hawks and vultures “has helped to lead the way to the discovery of a fundamental mechanism of meteorology.” (P. 131) He then shows the manner in which such large birds utilize to the full the dynamic power of the great “bubbles” of heated air that float up from the land due to the heat of the sun and which are known as thermal shells, as well as demonstrating the way in which the “slotted” wing tips of the eagle and similar soaring birds are so designed aerodynamically as to eliminate air “drag” on the wing.</p>

<strong>Animal Creation Magnifies Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">An eagle “builds its nest high up” on inaccessible heights, placing its young out of danger. Jehovah has made the eagle do this instinctively. And with God-given vision, “far into the distance [the eagle’s] eyes keep looking.” The ability rapidly to change the focus of its eyes enables an eagle to keep its prey or a carcass in sight during a long dive. An eagle may eat the carcasses of dead animals, so that “where the slain are, there it is.” This bird catches small animals and carries them to its young.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204407/983/0">8/15/1962, pp. 485-487</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Should There Be Faultfinding with God?</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The monuments of antiquity abound with pictorial representations of the warhorse, and the horse is often referred to in the Bible as a symbol for war equipment. Horses were used to draw chariots <span id="page486" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="486" data-before-text="486"></span>in which the driver and one or two fighting men rode or as mounts for the warriors who fought from horseback. Israel for a long time won its battles without horses, but later they became common in Israel and Judah and were used in battle.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Ki. 22:4</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">A war-horse, impatient for the battle, neighs and beats the ground with his hoofs. Jehovah’s description shows that it laughs at dread and does not turn back on account of a sword; and the quiver and spear, the arms of the rider, only intensify its eagerness to go forth to meet the armor of the enemy. Wrote English archaeologist Sir Austin Layard: “Although docile as a lamb, and requiring no other guide than the halter, when the Arab mare hears the war-cry of the tribe, and sees the quivering spear of her rider, her eyes glitter with fire, her blood-red nostrils open wide, her neck is nobly arched, and her tail and mane are raised and spread out to the wind.”</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">When the sound of the horn is heard, the horse can hardly believe what his ears tell him; he cannot believe it for his joy. But when he is certain that it is true, he leaps forward, saying “Aha!” He neighs. He rejoices. Forward he goes, ‘swallowing up the ground,’ which is an expression for prodigious swiftness in use among Arabians to the present day.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Yet this intrepid animal is easily subjected to man and made to obey the voice of the rider.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Has any man created this wonder of beauty and intrepidity and endowed him with these extraordinary qualities? Jehovah is its Creator, and He is the One whom the Bible shows also gives to his enthroned King Jesus Christ and the holy angels of heaven war mounts to charge courageously and swiftly into the war of Armageddon at the sound of the war trumpet, riding forward to God’s victory, as Revelation shows: “I saw the heaven opened, and, look! a white horse. And the one seated upon it is called Faithful and True, and he judges and carries on war in righteousness. Also, the armies that were in heaven were following him on white horses.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rev. 19:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 14</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>THE FALCON AND THE EAGLE</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">With more probing questions to correct Job’s thinking, Jehovah continued: “Is it owing to your understanding that the falcon soars up, that it spreads its wings to the south wind? Or is it at your order that an eagle flies upward and that it builds its nest high up, that on a crag it resides and stays during the night upon the tooth of a crag and an inaccessible place? From there it has to search for food; far into the distance its eyes keep looking. And its young ones themselves keep sipping up blood; and where the slain are, there it is.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 39:26-30</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Is it owing to man’s understanding that the falcon is remarkable for the force with which it flies? No, it is not because of human wisdom that the falcon spreads its wings to the south wind, indicating great strength of wing.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">God now turns his attention to the eagle, sometimes called the king of birds. God had opened the series of questions regarding the animal creation with the lion, the king of beasts. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 38:39</a>) Now, closing this section of his speech, the Almighty asks Job about the king of the birds. Is it due to Job’s order that the eagle is remarkable in four ways?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">First, the height of the eagle’s flight. The eagle “flies upward,” to immense heights. No bird is said to soar as high or to have such strength of wing. This power of flight has come from God.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Then there is the security of the eagle’s nest, because “it builds its nest high up,” even “on a crag it resides . . . upon the <span id="page487" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="487" data-before-text="487"></span>tooth of a crag.” Other birds are content with lower elevations, but the eagle builds on inaccessible heights, and thus sets her young out of reach of danger. Is it at man’s order that this bird makes her nest her castle, building it upon the “tooth of a crag”?</p>
