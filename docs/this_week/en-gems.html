<strong>Light</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The Scriptures contain many figurative references to light. Ability to see is meant by the words “the light of my own eyes.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Ps. 38:10</a>) For God to “give light” to someone means that he gives them life or allows them to continue living. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Job 3:20,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/49/1" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> 23</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Psalm 56:13</a>.) “Children that have seen no light” are those who are born dead. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Job 3:16</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Psalm 49:19</a>.) “It is good for the eyes to see the sun” may be understood to mean ‘it is good to be alive.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Eccl. 11:7</a>. <span id="page1068" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1068" data-before-text="1068"></span>Morning light is picturesquely described as ‘taking hold of the ends of the earth and shaking the wicked out of it,’ because dawn disperses evildoers. Darkness is their “light,” for they are accustomed to carry out their evil deeds under its cover and this figurative “light” is taken from them by the literal light of dawn.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Job 38:12-15</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Job 24:15-17</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">As the light of the sun is clearly observable, thus Jehovah’s adverse judgments are obvious. This is alluded to at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Hosea 6:5</a>: “The judgments upon you will be as the light that goes forth.”</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The ‘light of God’s face’ means divine favor. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Ps. 44:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/57/1" data-bid="58-2" class="b"> 89:15</a>) “Lift up the light of your face upon us” is an expression meaning ‘show us favor.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/58/0" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Ps. 4:6</a>) Similarly, the favor of a ruler is referred to as “the light of the king’s face.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Prov. 16:15</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Light may denote brightness or cheerfulness, the opposite of gloom. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/60/0" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Job 30:26</a>) This may explain the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Job (29:24</a>): “The light of my face they would not cast down.” Although others were gloomy and dejected, this did not cause Job to become of like disposition.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">A bright prospect, such as salvation or deliverance, is at times referred to under the figure of light. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/62/0" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Esther 8:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/62/1" data-bid="63-2" class="b"> Ps. 97:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/62/2" data-bid="63-3" class="b"> Isa. 30:26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/62/3" data-bid="63-4" class="b"> Mic. 7:8, 9</a>) Jehovah’s causing his glory to shine forth upon Zion pointed forward to her deliverance from a captive state. As a result Zion was to become a source of enlightenment to the nations. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/63/0" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Isa. 60:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/63/1" data-bid="64-2" class="b"> 19, 20</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Revelation 21:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/64/1" data-bid="65-2" class="b"> 22:5</a>.) On the other hand, for the sun, moon and stars not to give their light would signify calamity.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/65/0" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Isa. 13:10, 11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/65/1" data-bid="66-2" class="b"> Jer. 4:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/65/2" data-bid="66-3" class="b"> Ezek. 32:7, 8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/65/3" data-bid="66-4" class="b"> Matt. 24:29</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Victory over the World Without Armed Conflict</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Did Jesus deserve the world’s hatred for preaching God’s Messianic kingdom? Was he preaching thereby something that would be for the hurt of all mankind? No, but something for their everlasting good. Personal pride and selfishness were the things that induced the world to hate Jesus for proclaiming the Kingdom message that was really good news, Gospel, the Evangel. That the world’s hatred of him was actually for no valid reason, Jesus plainly told his faithful apostles, saying:</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> “If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have no sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.

<strong>The Great Potter Molds Human Vessels</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> The effect that these plagues had upon <span id="page368" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="368" data-before-text="368"></span>various ones further underscores Jehovah’s sovereign role as the Great Potter. Those plagues served His purpose in that they revealed the heart condition of those affected by them. The lifting of the plagues certainly hardened the heart of Pharaoh and those of his people having his spirit. But the fact that the first three plagues also came upon Israel did not make Moses and his people complain. In fact, there was a “vast mixed company” of aliens who learned the lesson from all the plagues that came upon them or else they would not have left Egypt with the Israelites on that memorable night of Nisan 14.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965443/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex. 12:38</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> As previously noted, the record of the ten plagues upon Egypt is of more than mere historical interest to Christians today. It is part of “all the things that were written aforetime . . . for our instruction, that through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope.” Among the ways in which God’s Word serves this purpose is by furnishing prophetic patterns in which certain persons, places and events find a counterpart in our day.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965443/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rom. 15:4</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>PROPHETIC PATTERNS</strong></p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> 5. What may be said about prophetic patterns, and what Scriptural principle governs an understanding of them?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Prophetic patterns generally do not present truths peculiar to themselves but rather corroborate and elucidate truths stated explicitly elsewhere. Thus the prophetic patterns noted at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965443/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Hebrews 7:26 to 10:22</a> serve primarily to corroborate what is stated more clearly in the rest of the Christian Greek Scriptures, regarding the role of Jesus as high priest. And while it would not be wise to be dogmatic regarding prophetic patterns not applied in the Scriptures themselves, it appears that these things have been made understandable by reason of God’s holy spirit, in keeping with <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965443/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 4:18</a>, that “the path of the righteous ones is like the bright light that is getting lighter and lighter until the day is firmly established.”</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"> 6, 7.

Whom does Moses picture? In that he was the great deliverer of his people, he would well picture Jesus Christ, the great Savior and Deliverer. In fact, Moses himself foretold that a prophet like him would appear: “A prophet from your own midst, from your brothers, like me, is what Jehovah your God will raise up for you—to him you people should listen.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965443/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Deut. 18:15</a>) That he foretold the coming of Jesus Christ, the apostle Peter shows at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965443/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 3:22, 23</a>, where he quotes from this prophecy and applies it to Jesus Christ.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> In this particular drama Moses pictures Jesus Christ himself, but at times Jesus Christ may be represented in the members of his congregation, more particularly the remnant of Kingdom heirs living on earth at the time of the fulfillment of this prophetic drama.

Yes, we do, for there David speaks prophetically in the person of Jesus Christ, as when he said: “For sheer zeal for your house has eaten me up, and the very reproaches of those reproaching you have fallen upon me.” Yet in other parts of this same psalm David says: “You yourself have come to know my foolishness, and from you my own guiltiness has not been hidden,” which words could apply only to Christ’s representatives, his congregation, on earth.</p>

<strong>Be Zealous for True Worship</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> One event in Jesus’ life forcefully demonstrated what zeal he had. It was early in his ministry, in the Passover season of 30 C.E. Jesus and his disciples came to Jerusalem and saw in the temple “those selling cattle and sheep and doves and the money brokers in their seats.” What was Jesus’ response, and what impression did it make on his disciples?​—<em>Read</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010922/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><em>John 2:13-17</em></a><em>.</em></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> What Jesus did and said on that occasion fittingly brought to the disciples’ mind the prophetic words of one psalm by David: “Sheer zeal for your house has eaten me up.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010922/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 69:9</a>) Why? Because what Jesus did involved a great deal of risk and danger. After all, the temple authorities​—the priests, the scribes, and others—​were behind the scandalous profit-making business taking place there. To expose and disrupt their scheme, Jesus was pitting himself against the religious establishment of the day. As the disciples correctly assessed the situation, ‘zeal for God’s house,’ or zeal for true <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>worship, was clearly in evidence. What, though, is zeal? Is it different from urgency?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>Urgency and Zeal Compared</strong></p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 9. How may zeal be described?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> One dictionary defines “zeal” as “eagerness and ardent interest in pursuit of something,” and it offers as synonyms such words as passion, fervor, ardor, and enthusiasm. Surely Jesus’ ministry can be characterized by all these expressions. Hence, <em>Today’s English Version</em> renders the verse: “My devotion to your house, O God, burns in me like a fire.” Interestingly, in some Oriental languages, the term for “zeal” is made up of two parts that literally mean “hot heart,” as though the heart were burning. It is no wonder that the disciples recalled David’s words when they saw what Jesus did at the temple. What, though, set Jesus’ heart on fire, as it were, and propelled, or moved, him to act that way?</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu">10. What is the meaning of “zeal” as used in the Bible?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> The word “zeal” in David’s psalm is derived from a Hebrew word that is often translated “jealous” or “jealousy” in other parts of the Bible. The <em>New World Translation</em> sometimes renders it “exacting exclusive devotion.” (<em>Read</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010922/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><em>Exodus 20:5;</em></a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010922/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> <em>34:14;</em></a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010922/16/2" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> <em>Joshua 24:19</em></a><em>.</em>) One Bible dictionary says of this term: “It is often used in connection with the marriage relation . . . Just as jealousy in husband or wife is the forceful assertion of an exclusive right, so God asserts His claim, and vindicates it, on those who are His sole possession.” Thus, zeal in the Biblical sense is more than fervor or enthusiasm for a certain pursuit, such as many fans show for their favorite sport. David’s zeal was jealousy in the positive sense, that is, an intolerance of rivalry or reproach, a strong urge to protect a good name or to correct an injury.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">11. What was it that moved Jesus to exert himself zealously?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Jesus’ disciples were not mistaken in associating David’s words with what they saw Jesus do at the temple. Jesus exerted himself not simply because he had a deadline but because he was zealous​—or jealous—​for his Father’s name and for pure worship. When he saw the reproach and blasphemy heaped upon God’s name, he was rightly zealous, or jealous, and acted to correct the situation. When Jesus saw the humble people oppressed and exploited by the religious leaders, his zeal moved him to bring relief to the people as well as to utter forceful denunciations against the oppressive religious leaders.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010922/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matt. 9:36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010922/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 23:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010922/17/2" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010922/17/3" data-bid="18-4" class="b"> 27, 28,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010922/17/4" data-bid="18-5" class="b"> 33</a>.</p>

Those plagues served His purpose in that they revealed the heart condition of those affected by them. The lifting of the plagues certainly hardened the heart of Pharaoh and those of his people having his spirit. But the fact that the first three plagues also came upon Israel did not make Moses and his people complain. In fact, there was a “vast mixed company” of aliens who learned the lesson from all the plagues that came upon them or else they would not have left Egypt with the Israelites on that memorable night of Nisan 14.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965443/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex. 12:38</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> As previously noted, the record of the ten plagues upon Egypt is of more than mere historical interest to Christians today. It is part of “all the things that were written aforetime . . . for our instruction, that through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope.” Among the ways in which God’s Word serves this purpose is by furnishing prophetic patterns in which certain persons, places and events find a counterpart in our day.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965443/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rom. 15:4</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>PROPHETIC PATTERNS</strong></p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> 5.

Then Jesus turned and, getting a view of them following, he said to them: ‘What are you looking for?’ They said to him: ‘Rabbi, (which means, when translated, Teacher,) where are you staying?’ He said to them: ‘Come, and you will see.’ Accordingly they went and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day; it was about the tenth hour [4 p.m.]. Andrew the brother of Simon Peter was one of the two that heard what John said and followed Jesus.

<strong>Light on Life’s Roadway from the Psalms</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">To begin with, the Psalms eloquently and repeatedly call attention to the fact that Jehovah God created all things: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man?” (8:3, 4) “Before the mountains themselves were born, or you proceeded to bring forth as with labor pains the earth and the productive land, even from time indefinite to time indefinite you are God.” (90:2) “Know that Jehovah is God. It is he that has made us, and not we ourselves.” (100:3) <span id="page550" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="550" data-before-text="550"></span>“I shall laud you because in a fear-inspiring way I am wonderfully made.”—139:14.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Among the earliest instances of God’s dealings with his creatures that the book of Psalms records is that of Jehovah concluding a covenant with Abraham and his making sworn statements to Isaac and Jacob. In fulfillment of these promises Jehovah God “brought out his people with exultation” to the land promised.—105:9, 10, 42-44.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Bringing his people Israel into their Promised Land involved many mighty acts, and these the book of Psalms also features. It tells that Jehovah sent ten plagues upon Egypt, that he split the Red Sea so that they could pass over and that he miraculously sustained them in the wilderness, providing bread, meat and water. Noted also are the striking victories God gained for his people in the days of Barak and Gideon.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalms 78,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 83,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 105,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 106,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/4" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> 135</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Then too, the Psalms record that it was necessary for Jehovah God repeatedly to chastise his people, even to the point of bringing them into Babylonian captivity: “By the rivers of Babylon—there we sat down. We also wept when we remembered Zion.” (137:1-9) And they record also Israel’s return from captivity: “When Jehovah gathered back the captive ones of Zion, we became like those who were dreaming. . . . At that time they proceeded to say among the nations: ‘Jehovah has done a great thing in what he has done with them.’” (126:1, 2) Yes, by recording how Jehovah God dealt with his people in times past and why, the book of Psalms throws much light on life’s roadway, for thereby it acquaints us with God’s attributes and principles.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>THE LIGHT OF PROPHECY</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The book of Psalms also serves as a light on life’s roadway by reason of the prophecies it contains, many of which have already been fulfilled, giving confidence that the rest will also have fulfillment. Among the many prophecies of the Psalms regarding Jesus Christ that the Christian Greek Scriptures show had fulfillment were that he would come in dedication to do God’s will (40:8; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 10:7-9</a>); that zeal for God’s house would eat him up, as it were (69:9; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 2:17</a>); that he would be betrayed by an intimate (41:9; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 13:18</a>); that lots would be cast for his garments (22:18; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 19:24</a>); that not a bone of him would be broken (34:20; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 19:36</a>) and that God would not leave his soul in Sheol or Hades.—16:10; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 2:29-31</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Further, the book of Psalms foretold Jesus’ exaltation to the right hand of his Father, there to await God’s due time for him to go into action against God’s enemies and for God to subject all things under Christ’s feet.—110:1, 2; 8:6; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Heb. 1:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 2:8</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The fulfillment of such prophecies instills faith that the prophecies in the Psalms regarding the blessings of the Messianic reign of the King’s Son, Jesus Christ, will also have fulfillment: “Let him judge the afflicted ones of the people, let him save the sons of the poor one, and let him crush the defrauder. He will descend like the rain upon the mown grass, like copious showers that wet the earth. In his days the righteous one will sprout, and the abundance of peace until the moon is no more. There will come to be plenty of grain on the earth; on the top of the mountains there will be an overflow.”—72:4, 6, 7, 16.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>BIBLE TEACHINGS</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The book of Psalms also throws light on life’s roadway by the various Bible teachings it touches on. Fittingly it stresses the role of Jehovah God as the Universal <span id="page551" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="551" data-before-text="551"></span>Sovereign. Though ‘the rulers of earth mass together as one against Jehovah and his anointed one, Jehovah himself will laugh at them in derision, speak to them in his anger and disturb them in hot displeasure.’ (2:1, 2, 4, 5) He will put them in their place, answering the psalmists’ prayers: “Do arise, O Jehovah! Let not mortal man prove superior in strength. Let the nations be judged before your face. Do put fear into them, O Jehovah, that the nations may know that they are but mortal men.” “Fill their faces with dishonor, that people may search for your name, O Jehovah. That people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.”—9:19, 20; 83:16, 18.</p>

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page54" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="54" data-before-text="54"></span><strong>Zealous Participation in the Ministry</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHEN we study the lives of such men as Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Jehu and Jesus, we are forced to conclude that they were men of extraordinary zeal for Jehovah. These men were entrusted with a ministry and they allowed nothing to hold them back from fully participating in it.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">For example, Ezekiel was sent to “sons insolent of face and hard of heart.” His commission was to repeat the words of Jehovah “whether they will hear or will refrain” from hearing. This was not an easy assignment, yet Ezekiel fulfilled it with exemplary zeal. Jeremiah’s ministry made him “an object of laughter all day long; everyone is holding me in derision,” the prophet said. Still he pressed on, not in silence, but openly and boldly declaring Jehovah’s judgments. Jehu was a man of action. He rode furiously, fulfilling his role as executioner, calling on others to witness his zeal for Jehovah. And of Jesus Christ it is written: “Sheer zeal for your house has eaten me up.” These men exemplified this essential quality of zeal in the service of Jehovah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961046/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezek. 2:4, 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961046/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Jer. 20:7-9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961046/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 2 Ki. 10:1-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961046/0/3" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> Ps. 69:9</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The word “zeal” means boiling; and the zealous, earnest minister of God is, therefore, described in the Scriptures as being hot or ardent with enthusiasm for the service of Jehovah, while unfaithful ones are said to be lukewarm. It is this fiery quality of zeal that has moved men to spread the good news of Christianity to the ends of the earth. Dr. Goodspeed testifies to this effect, saying: “There were men in the early church keenly alive . . . in their zeal to spread the Christian message over that [Graeco-Roman] world, [they] seized upon all the techniques of publication.”</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Christian ministry today calls for a like vigorous, zealous campaign. And, for the most part, dedicated Christians are responding with zeal to the need of the hour. Charles S. Braden, in <em>These Also Believe,</em> says: “It may truly be said that no single religious group in the world displayed more zeal and persistence in the attempt to spread the good news of the Kingdom than the Jehovah’s Witnesses.” Theirs is a ministry of zealous participation, one that says more than simply, “I believe.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Zealous participation means Christians must identify themselves with Jehovah’s organization by actively associating with it, not just occasionally but by regular meeting attendance. The apostle Paul emphasizes this point, saying: “Let us hold fast the public declaration of our hope without wavering, for he is faithful that promised. And let us consider one another to incite to love and right works, not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and all the more so as you behold the day drawing near.” Paul is encouraging an active participation in the ministry by regularly assembling together and inciting one another to love and right works.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961046/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Heb. 10:23-25</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Even more is required in a zealous ministry, which the apostle reveals in these words: “With the heart one exercises faith for righteousness, but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation.” Paul debunks the idea that one can gain salvation by just believing without expressing one’s faith. One must declare the good news about the Christ not only in the presence of believers but among unbelievers as well. A Christian’s faith must carry him from house to house preaching truths concerning <span id="page55" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="55" data-before-text="55"></span>God’s kingdom, even as faith carried the early Christians to the doors of the people.

Among other things, he must keep free from contamination by worldly religion. Since David’s time many new gods and religions have arisen to lead captive the minds and lives of humankind. There is, for example, the religion of Confucius, who is revered by the Chinese. Confucius pronounced the negative principle, “Do not do to others what you would not want them to do to you,” and tied this in with a formal regulation of all the ways and habits of life.

Appreciate the fact that he is the Eternal God, the Almighty, the Most High, who always was, is and is to be; without beginning, without end, who knows the end from the beginning, the source of goodness and life. Learn of his beloved Son, the beginning of all creation, for without him was not anything made that has been made; how he has always been his Father’s delight, and, when sent to earth, he took the form of human flesh wherein he suffered, and by complete obedience, fearlessness, loyalty and love was highly exalted and given a name above every name, for he is King of kings and Lord of lords, the Everlasting Father, and the Prince of Peace. Study God’s Holy Record and be taught of the new world of righteousness and its blessings, in which you may now learn to rejoice. Keep firm your hope to share in these blessings. “Happy the people who know thy festal songs, who live within the sunshine of thy favour!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950202/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 89:15</a>, <em>Moff.</em>) It is good to know about these promises; yes, go beyond merely knowing, memorize them if you will, so that they are always in mind for your comfort and consolation.

Unless properly informed of Satan’s works they will not value the promises of the Almighty’s protection.

David, speaking prophetically for Jesus, said: “For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950202/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 69:9</a>) Jesus did not choose for himself, but pleased first his heavenly Father: “For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, the reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950202/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rom. 15:3</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>EFFECTS OF ACCEPTING TRUTH</strong></p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 7, 8.

The more they seek the truth and companionship <span id="page87" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="87" data-before-text="87"></span>of the brethren, the more it becomes apparent to their former friends and business associates that something has happened in their lives to change the course of conduct, the conversation and forms of relaxation. It may be some will scoff, ridicule and bring various kinds of opposition to bear, or perhaps our secular occupation is in question, and then, if there are Scriptural family responsibilities on us, what will happen? Who will look after them? Former friends may be lost and disesteem be manifested. Also suppose these prophecies are not going to work out as expected? What will then be done? It may be Armageddon will not come as soon as expected! Then what? And, to say the least, one would become the laughingstock of others. All these fears and many more may crowd into the mind.

We shall concern ourselves here mainly with the gates mentioned in the book of Nehemiah, which gives us the most complete description or listing. The gates named in Nehemiah’s record are gates in the wall that was built prior to the eighth century B.C.E. and in the wall surrounding the “second quarter.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">2 Ki. 22:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/42/1" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 34:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/42/2" data-bid="43-3" class="b"> Zeph. 1:10</a>) The “second quarter” was a part of the city bounded on the W and part of the N by Hezekiah’s wall (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:5</a>) and joined by Manasseh’s wall, which continued on the NE and E. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">2 Chron. 33:14</a>) This was N of the earlier city and wall, but apparently did not extend as far W as the earlier wall.—See accompanying map.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong><em>Nehemiah’s wall</em></strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">In his account of the reconstruction of the wall of the city (chap. 3), Nehemiah begins at the Sheep Gate, located in the NE part of the wall encompassing the second quarter, and proceeds in a counterclockwise direction. We shall follow this procedure in our listing below, inserting the gates not mentioned in the reconstruction account but named in the description of the inauguration procession (chap. 12), along with gates spoken of in other scriptures, some of which are merely other names for those in Nehemiah’s record.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong><em>Sheep Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The Sheep Gate was rebuilt by Eliashib the high priest and associate priests.

Its location was probably in the N wall of the second quarter, the part built by Manasseh (see “Fish Gate,” below), at or near the NE corner of the city. This gate may have been so named because through it were brought sheep and goats for sacrifice or perhaps for a market that was located nearby. It may also have been called the “Gate of Benjamin” (which see). The “sheepgate” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">John 5:2</a> is likely this Sheep Gate or a later gate corresponding to it, for it was located in the same vicinity, near the pool Bethzatha.</p>

<strong>Can You Die of a Broken Heart?</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Some say that a broken heart was a factor in the death of Jesus Christ, of whom it was prophesied: “Reproach itself has broken my heart, and the wound is incurable.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101995772/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 69:20</a>) Are these words to be understood literally? Perhaps so, for the hours preceding Jesus’ death were agonizing​—not only physically but also emotionally. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101995772/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 27:46;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101995772/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Luke 22:44;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101995772/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Hebrews 5:7</a>) Furthermore, a broken heart may explain why “blood and water” flowed from a spear wound inflicted on Jesus just after his death. A rupture of the heart or a major blood vessel could discharge blood either into the chest cavity or into the pericardium​—a fluid-​containing membrane that loosely encases the heart. In either location a puncture could cause the flow of what would appear to be “blood and water.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101995772/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 19:34</a>.</p>

Let Him provide him with escape! Let him deliver him, since he has taken delight in him!” We can see the Roman soldiers who stripped Jesus of his clothing before nailing him up throwing dice for the ownership of his inner garment: “They apportion my clothing among themselves, and upon my garment they cast lots.” We can hear Jesus just before his death taking up the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 22:1</a>: “My God, my God, why have you left me? [Why are you] far from saving me, [from] the words of my roaring?” And as he finally breathes his last and a Roman soldier jabs his side with a spear and blood and water stream out, we see fulfilled the words: “Like water I have been poured out, and all my bones have been separated from one another. My heart has become like wax; it has melted deep in my inward parts. My power has dried up just like a fragment of earthenware, and my tongue is made to stick to my gums, and in the dust of death you are setting me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ps. 22:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 14, 15,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/29/2" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> 18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/29/3" data-bid="30-4" class="b"> Matt. 27:43,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/29/4" data-bid="30-5" class="b"> 46;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/29/5" data-bid="30-6" class="b"> John 19:23, 24</a>) Even the gall that they had tried to make him drink, and the vinegar with which the soldiers sponged his mouth to quench his thirst, were foretold: “Reproach itself has broken my heart and [the wound] is incurable.

Having this in mind, Jehovah in the Psalms foretold Jesus’ resurrection from the dead. The dead Jesus was buried in a nearby tomb in a rock and thus his soul, which he had poured out in death, went to Sheol or mankind’s common grave. But Jesus died with full hope of a resurrection, his hope being voiced in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 16:8-11</a>: “I have placed Jehovah in front of me constantly.

You will not allow your man of loving-kindness to see the pit. You will cause me to know the path of life. Rejoicing to the full is with your face; there is pleasantness at your right hand forever.” That this and other prophecies of the Psalms might be carried out, Jehovah God brushed aside the Devil’s preventive efforts and raised Jesus from the dead, delivering him from Sheol on the third day. God rewarded him with a spirit body in place of the sacrificed human body, that he might know again the path of life and know pleasantness at God’s right hand forever.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Acts 2:22-31</a>.</p>

<strong>Poisonous Plant</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Concerning the Messiah, it was foretold that he would be given “a poisonous plant” for food. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003517/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps 69:21</a>) This occurred when Jesus Christ, before his impalement, was offered wine mixed with gall but, upon tasting it, refused the stupefying drink that was probably intended to alleviate his sufferings. In recording the fulfillment of this prophecy, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003517/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew (27:34</a>) employed the Greek word <em>kho·leʹ</em> (gall), the same term found in the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003517/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 69:21</a>. However, Mark’s Gospel account mentions myrrh (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003517/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Mr 15:23</a>), and this has given rise to the view that in this case the “poisonous plant” or “gall” was “myrrh.” Another possibility is that the drugged drink contained both gall and myrrh.</p>

<strong>Plummet</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A plumb line; a cord to the end of which a metal, stone or clay weight was fastened that kept the line straight and made it possible to build walls and other structures that were straight <span id="page1318" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1318" data-before-text="1318"></span>or perpendicular to the horizon. The weight itself is sometimes called the plumb bob or plummet. Carpenters, masons and other craftsmen of ancient times used the plummet.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In connection with the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem, Zerubbabel is represented as having in hand a plummet, literally, “the stone [or, weight], the tin,” according to the Masoretic text. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013434/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Zech. 4:9, 10</a>) As foretold, not only did Zerubbabel lay the temple’s foundation but under his supervision the work was carried to completion.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013434/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezra 3:8-10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013434/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 6:14, 15</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In vision, Amos beheld Jehovah stationed on a wall made with a plummet, and thus one that was originally straight, perpendicular. Jehovah was seen holding a plummet, and the prophet was told that God was setting a plummet in the midst of His people. As Israel did not meet the test of straightness in a spiritual way, not acting in accord with God’s requirements, Jehovah would mete out justice and “no more do any further excusing of it.” Israel’s high places would be laid desolate, her sanctuaries would be devastated, and God would “rise up against the house of Jeroboam with a sword.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013434/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Amos 7:7-9</a>) True to these words, Israel was devastated and Samaria destroyed by the Assyrians in 740 B.C.E.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Ruler from the House of David</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">As foretold by Isaiah, he was “despised and shunned” by the Hebrews. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isa. 53:3</a>, <em>Leeser</em>) They “esteemed him not” because they mistakenly expected the Messiah to come in power and glory in the first century and deliver them from the yoke of Rome. This is confirmed by the <em>Daily Prayer Book,</em> which says on pages 145 and 146: “The rebuilding of Jerusalem as the City of Righteousness would usher in the Messianic era. . . . In that New Jerusalem, the Messianic King would establish his throne. Throughout the days of the Second Temple, this feeling prevailed, and it grew in intensity during the tyranny of the Herods, the Roman puppet-kings of Judea.” The Hebrews failed to see that the humble coming of the Messiah in the first century, which they rejected, was preparatory to <span id="page457" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="457" data-before-text="457"></span>the more glorious coming due in the time future to their day.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">As foretold at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 69:22</a> in the <em>Leeser</em> translation (verse 21 in others), he was given vinegar to drink by his enemies. As foretold at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 22:19</a> in the <em>Leeser</em> translation (verse 18 in others), lots were cast for his garments. As foretold at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Isaiah 53:9</a>, he was buried with the rich by being placed in a rich man’s empty tomb. He and his earthly mother could have no control over these things that happened to him in fulfillment of the prophecies.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">As foretold by <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>, he was a prophet like Moses, and as such he foretold the siege and destruction of Jerusalem. This took place more than thirty-five years later when the Romans burned the temple in 70 C.E. With the destruction of Jerusalem, Jesus Christ was proved a true prophet through whom God spoke. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Luke 21:20-24</a>) He was not God in the flesh, as some persons have mistakenly claimed, for he said: “I am ascending to my Father and your Father and to my God and your God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">John 20:17</a>) Nevertheless, he was the foretold Messiah.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Jesus fulfilled more than a hundred prophecies that were given to identify the Messiah. The chance that one man would fulfill them by accident is infinitesimally small. The fact that Jesus fulfilled them at a time when the genealogical records were in existence that proved his ancestry is further evidence identifying him as the promised Ruler from the house of David.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">The kingdom of Messiah was not established by God in the first century because God’s appointed time for this had not then come. People had to be instructed and shown the need for repentance because of their disobedience to God, just as in Jeremiah’s day. Unlike Jeremiah’s preparatory work, which took forty years and was limited mainly to Judea, the preparatory work for the Messiah’s kingdom was to be done earth-wide. That takes time. When the work is finished, the Messiah will then institute the revolutionary changes that will affect all mankind. As foretold at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Psalm 2:9</a>, he will smash the political governments man has made “like a potter’s vessel,” and he will bless people of all nations with a rule of justice, righteousness and peace, as foretold at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Isaiah 9:5, 6</a> in the <em>Leeser</em> translation (verses 6 and 7 in others).</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">It is during the second presence of the Messiah, when ruling from his glorious heavenly throne, that he will do what Hebrews mistakenly expected him to do in the first century. So the King Messiah is yet to bring to an end wicked rulers, oppression, injustice, wars and human suffering. To benefit from the changes he will bring, you must exercise faith in him and permit yourself to be guided by the preparatory work for his kingdom rule that he began more than 1900 years ago, at which time he fulfilled the prophecies that identify the Messiah. Your exercising faith in this Ruler from the house of David and in his God means eternal life under the righteous rule of his kingdom.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sd">Said a man who was trained at the feet of the famous Jewish Law teacher Gamaliel in the first century C.E.: “So we are declaring to you the good news about the promise made to the forefathers, that God has entirely fulfilled it to us their children in that he resurrected Jesus; even as it is written in the second psalm, ‘You are my son, I have become your Father this day.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964561/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Acts 13:32, 33</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb"></p>

Let Him provide him with escape! Let him deliver him, since he has taken delight in him!” We can see the Roman soldiers who stripped Jesus of his clothing before nailing him up throwing dice for the ownership of his inner garment: “They apportion my clothing among themselves, and upon my garment they cast lots.” We can hear Jesus just before his death taking up the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 22:1</a>: “My God, my God, why have you left me? [Why are you] far from saving me, [from] the words of my roaring?” And as he finally breathes his last and a Roman soldier jabs his side with a spear and blood and water stream out, we see fulfilled the words: “Like water I have been poured out, and all my bones have been separated from one another. My heart has become like wax; it has melted deep in my inward parts. My power has dried up just like a fragment of earthenware, and my tongue is made to stick to my gums, and in the dust of death you are setting me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ps. 22:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 14, 15,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/29/2" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> 18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/29/3" data-bid="30-4" class="b"> Matt. 27:43,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/29/4" data-bid="30-5" class="b"> 46;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/29/5" data-bid="30-6" class="b"> John 19:23, 24</a>) Even the gall that they had tried to make him drink, and the vinegar with which the soldiers sponged his mouth to quench his thirst, were foretold: “Reproach itself has broken my heart and [the wound] is incurable.

But for food they proceeded to give [me] a poisonous plant, and for my thirst they tried to make me drink vinegar.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ps. 69:20, 21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> John 19:28-30</a>) Such fulfillments mark Jesus as the foretold Messiah!</p><p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="qu">19.

Having this in mind, Jehovah in the Psalms foretold Jesus’ resurrection from the dead. The dead Jesus was buried in a nearby tomb in a rock and thus his soul, which he had poured out in death, went to Sheol or mankind’s common grave. But Jesus died with full hope of a resurrection, his hope being voiced in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 16:8-11</a>: “I have placed Jehovah in front of me constantly.

You will not allow your man of loving-kindness to see the pit. You will cause me to know the path of life. Rejoicing to the full is with your face; there is pleasantness at your right hand forever.” That this and other prophecies of the Psalms might be carried out, Jehovah God brushed aside the Devil’s preventive efforts and raised Jesus from the dead, delivering him from Sheol on the third day. God rewarded him with a spirit body in place of the sacrificed human body, that he might know again the path of life and know pleasantness at God’s right hand forever.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Acts 2:22-31</a>.</p>

But loss of power results when hips shake or wobble, perhaps because of fear. In this plea for deliverance, David asked God to deprive his foes of their misapplied strength.</p>

He was commanded to take some of the older men of the people and the priests out the Gate of the Potsherds (or, Gate of the Ash-heaps), located at the SE corner of Jerusalem, to the Valley of Hinnom in the area of Topheth. There he declared Jehovah’s pronouncement: “Look! there are days coming . . . when this place will be called no more Topheth and the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of the killing.” Then, smashing an earthenware flask before their eyes, he continued with Jehovah’s judgment: “In the same way I shall break this people and this city . . . and in Topheth they will bury until there is no more place to bury.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011982/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Jer. 19:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011982/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011982/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 10, 11</a>) In other words, the slaughter, not of sacrificial victims to Molech, but by the sword of God’s judgment, would be so great that some bodies would lie unburied in the valley. This would pollute it to an even greater degree than Josiah had done.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Evidently Jeremiah’s prophetic words do not mean that such sacrifices to Molech were still going on in Jeremiah’s time, so soon after Josiah’s reformation, but that Jehovah would punish the nation for their practices, past as well as present, and for the innocent blood shed by them, particularly the human sacrifices during Manasseh’s reign. The prophet, in another pronouncement, told the nation that they would be punished for what Manasseh had done. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011982/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Jer. 15:4</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011982/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Kings 23:26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011982/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Jeremiah 32:30-35</a>.) Also, Jeremiah’s declaration at chapter 19, verse 3, is parallel to the statement at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011982/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Kings 21:12</a>. In Jeremiah’s day the people certainly were carrying on with idolatries, which gave evidence that they had not repented in the least for the gross sins they shared in during Manasseh’s reign.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The gates in Jerusalem’s wall that were situated on the Valley of Hinnom were, probably, the Corner Gate at the city’s NW corner, the Valley Gate at its SW corner, and the Gate of the Potsherds (Gate of the Ash-heaps) near the point where the Valley of Hinnom joined the Tyropean and Kidron valleys. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011982/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Ki. 14:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011982/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Neh. 2:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011982/12/2" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> 12:31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011982/12/3" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> Jer. 19:2</a>) Along the Valley of Hinnom between the Corner Gate and the Valley Gate the sides are so steep as to make impractical the location of other gates along this portion of Jerusalem’s wall. King Uzziah built towers by the Corner Gate and the Valley Gate, inasmuch as these would be the more vulnerable places along this part of the valley.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011982/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:9</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">It was in this valley to the S of Jerusalem that Nehemiah made his night inspection tour, examining the city wall eastward from the Valley Gate to the Gate of the Ash-heaps, turning up the Kidron for a distance and then back to reenter the city by the Valley Gate.

<strong>The Bible’s Figurative Use of Body Parts</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The Israelites, in preparation for leaving Egypt, were to eat with “hips girded.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967446/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ex. 12:11</a>) They were to be prepared to move on a moment’s notice. Similarly, when sending his servant Gehazi on an important mission, Elisha said to him: “Gird up your loins and take my staff in your hand and go.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967446/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Ki. 4:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967446/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 9:1</a>) And in commissioning his fearful servant Jeremiah, God said: “You should gird up your hips, and you must rise up and speak to <span id="page382" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="382" data-before-text="382"></span>them everything that I myself command you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967446/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Jer. 1:17</a>) Jeremiah was encouraged to acquire strength and prepare for vigorous activity in God’s service.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">A person has strong muscles in the hips or loins. When these muscles are tensed, or braced up, there is tremendous potential power. The Bible proverb speaks of the capable wife as girding “her hips with strength.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967446/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Prov. 31:17</a>) In symbol, therefore, the prophet Nahum tells those who were about to experience an invasion: “Let there be a safeguarding of the fortified place. Watch the way. Strengthen the hips. Reinforce power very much.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967446/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Nah. 2:1</a>) Here hips are used figuratively in connection with strength or power.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">This is also the case in Jehovah’s prophecy regarding the Persian conqueror Cyrus, in which God says: His “right hand I have taken hold of, to subdue before him nations, so that I may ungird even the hips of kings.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967446/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Isa. 45:1</a>) This expression means that God would take away the strength or power of these kings, so that Cyrus would be victorious. Those who have had their power removed and are in a weakened condition are therefore said to have wobbling or shaking hips.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967446/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 69:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967446/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Ezek. 21:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967446/23/2" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> 29:7</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Interestingly, the expression “gird up the loins of your mind” is used by the apostle Peter. However, to make the sense of the expression clear to the modern reader, the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</em> renders the expression: “Hence brace up your minds for activity.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967446/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:13</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>BOSOM AND INTESTINES</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Other parts of the human body also came to be associated with particular qualities and emotions. For example, it was the custom, and still is today, to hold a dearly beloved or cherished one close to one’s bosom or breast. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967446/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ruth 4:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967446/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Song of Sol. 1:13</a>) That place, therefore, came to signify favor or intimacy. Thus, when Jesus is spoken of as in the bosom position with the Father, and Lazarus as in the bosom position with Abraham, it means that they are in a favored position. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967446/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">John 1:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967446/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Luke 16:22, 23</a>) Also, when God is said to carry his lambs in his bosom, it indicates that he cherishes and tenderly cares for them.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967446/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Isa. 40:11</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Consistently, therefore, the expression is used in the Bible, “the wife of thy bosom.” It is so rendered in many Bible translations, including the <em>King James</em> and <em>American Standard</em> versions. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967446/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Deut. 13:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967446/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 28:54,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967446/28/2" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> 56</a>) However, for clarity of understanding, the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</em> at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967446/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 13:6</a> says: “Your cherished wife.”</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">In both the ancient Hebrew and the Greek Scriptures deep feelings and emotions were associated with the intestines or bowels. It was undoubtedly observed that the feeling of deep emotions caused abdominal distress, or at least stirrings in this region of the body. The bad tidings concerning the coming calamity upon Israel caused Jeremiah to exclaim: “My intestines, my intestines! I am in severe pains in the walls of my heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967446/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Jer. 4:19</a>) Later, at Jerusalem’s destruction, the great sorrow that Jeremiah felt caused painful commotion within, causing him to lament: “My very intestines are in a ferment.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967446/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Lam. 1:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967446/31/1" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 2:11</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">That feelings of compassion or pity also affect the intestines is indicated by God’s expression as he contemplated the condition <span id="page383" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="383" data-before-text="383"></span>of the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel, represented by Ephraim: “That is why my intestines have become boisterous for him.

Because he blots them out of the book of the living, he will give them no resurrection from the dead.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963282/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Matt. 10:28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963282/36/1" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> Ps. 145:20</a>.</p><p id="p76" data-pid="76" class="qu">36. How is God’s ability to preserve records of dead souls shown to be most reasonable?</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" data-rel-pid="[76]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="36"><sup>36</sup></span> Talk about preserving records, men today make motion pictures of a person on a film together with a sound track of his voice. This can be reproduced over television. In fact, men today can preserve on a phonograph record the speech and singing of a person. Even on a magnetic tape men can invisibly preserve television pictures and the voice of an actor. If imperfect dying men can do this because man was created in God’s image, what can Almighty God himself do in keeping records, even in his own memory, concerning persons for whom he reserves a resurrection from the dead by means of Jesus Christ? So our record with God is what counts.</p><p id="p77" data-pid="77" class="qu">37. (a) What does each one’s record with God represent? (b) How is it proved that soul according to the pagan Grecian idea is not the seat of intelligence and thought and personality?</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" data-rel-pid="[77]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="37"><sup>37</sup></span> Each one of us makes his own record with God. That record represents <em>you!</em> It tells of your personality. Your personality does not altogether depend upon your physical body. Because of the continual wearing out and repairing of the tissues and organs of our bodies we get a completely new body every seven years or so. Yet our personality remains as an identification of our being the same person. Even our personalities can change, not because our bodies are renewed, but because God’s holy spirit or transforming force acts upon us. Each one develops his own personality pattern, and this is stored up in each one’s brain, also in the blood to some extent. The seat of intelligence, of thought, of memory, or consciousness and of personality is not some pagan Greek idea of a soul or <em>psykhé.</em> Pagans argue that a soul resides in each of us and is the seat of intelligence and personality; but we know that if the physical brain is damaged in anyone, he loses his intelligence or sanity and no so-called soul inside him keeps him intelligent, sane or possessed of memory and thinking ability. This disproves the pagan theory of an immortal soul as the seat of life and thought.</p><p id="p78" data-pid="78" class="qu">38. How will God re-create dead souls, and what does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963282/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 11:3</a> indicate regarding this?</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" data-rel-pid="[78]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="38"><sup>38</sup></span> God knows all this. At his time for resurrecting the earthly dead souls under the kingdom of his Son Jesus Christ, God can consult his records of each one or his own memory of each one. He can give each person resurrected to life on earth a “body just as it has pleased him,” with its distinct type of blood. That body will have a human brain, not made, of course, of identically the same atoms or molecules that the person had in the brain with which he died. Yet it will be the same brain. How? In that God will exactly reproduce the brain that the individual had at death. He will repeat its convolutions and implant in them the record that the individual made of himself in the former life. God will implant the exact impressions and memories of all things that happened during the person’s previous consciousness, his power of recognizing people and scenes and locations, and all his personality traits, and everything that displays his mental growth or retardation. This will be because, when he died as a soul, he experienced no mental or personality changes afterward in death. At what state of attainment his personality and mentality fell in death, there they remained.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963282/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Eccl. 11:3</a>.</p>

<strong>Predestination or Individual Choice—Which?</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><span id="page307" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="307" data-before-text="307"></span><strong>NAMES IN THE BOOK OF LIFE</strong></p><p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="qu">16. How do predestinarians argue concerning the book of life, and how does this boomerang?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[68]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Still another line of argument is pursued by predestinationists. Certain scriptures speak of names in a book of life, and it is argued that the names of these individuals were so recorded before the world began, and this indicates they were predestinated to salvation. As has been shown, however, they cannot correctly use <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953366/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Revelation 13:8</a> or <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953366/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Re 17:8</a> to argue that before the original world began with Adam’s creation some names were written in and others left out of the book of life. As for other texts used, such as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953366/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Luke 10:20 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953366/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Philippians 4:3 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953366/20/2" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> Revelation 21:27</a>, by no clever twisting of matters can they be made to say the names were recorded before the individuals’ birth. Actually, for the predestinationists to hurl the book-of-life argument into the controversy is for them to throw a boomerang. How so? Because if one’s being in the book of life means he is predestinated to salvation, then it can be shown that such predestination fails, and if it fails the doctrine’s very foundation crumbles. To those who prove faithful Jesus promises: “I will by no means blot out his name from the book of life.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953366/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Rev. 3:5</a>, <em>NW</em>) Which indicates names could be blotted out. If such a blotting out were impossible, Jesus’ promise would be meaningless. That it is possible <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953366/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Psalm 69:28</a> (<em>AT</em>) shows: “May they be blotted out from the book of life.” That it is Jehovah’s purpose to blot out those becoming unfaithful was shown when Israel worshiped the golden calf at Sinai. After asking God to forgive Israel Moses said: “But if not, pray blot me out of thy book.” Jehovah’s reply was: “Whoever sins against me, him only I blot out of my book.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953366/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ex. 32:32, 33</a>, <em>AT</em>.</p><p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="qu">17. What observations on names are here appropriate?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[69]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> To say these names are literal ones recorded before the individuals were born is to say Jehovah named all these babies, and not the parents. Some names copy those of demon gods. Did Jehovah give such hated names to predestinated servants of his? We must abandon the narrow view and see that names involve far more than mere literal designations of persons. In the Bible names are meaningful, denoting a person’s circumstances or activities or qualities, and frequently being changed during his lifetime to take on more meaning, to be more descriptive of him as he or his circumstances changed. In this broad sense names stand for certain qualities or principles or actions, and on the basis of such things the names may be good or bad, feared or revered, famous or infamous. It is such names that persons make for themselves during life that determine whether they are found recorded in God’s book of life or not, rather than narrowly viewed literal designations given to them at birth.</p><p id="p70" data-pid="70" class="qu">18. What kind of names are in the book of life?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[70]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Recorded in the book of life are the righteous requirements for gaining life. Therein are described the approved qualities of meekness and humility, justice and uprightness, love and mercy, zeal and faithfulness, patient endurance and obedient service. If we make names for ourselves as moral personalities, integrity keepers, zealous preachers and neighbor lovers we shall be in God’s book of life, for that is where such things are approvingly named. The book of life contains the names and reputations we must live up to if we are to be included in it, if we find ourselves described in it. If by our conduct we have made names that stand for and measure up to the divine requirements the unchanging Jehovah has established from the beginning and gone on record as approving, then such names of ours conform to and are reflected in God’s book of life. If our names stand for the same <span id="page308" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="308" data-before-text="308"></span>things that God’s book of life stands for, then our names are in it. The book of life is not a literal book such as men make and write in, any more so than are the names in it the literal names of men given at their birth. The book of life is Jehovah’s righteous requirements creatures must meet to live, and the names therein are names that stand for and match those requirements.</p>

No. Notice his further words in that psalm: “Jehovah is listening to the poor ones, and he will indeed not despise his very own prisoners,” or “those of his who are prisoners.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 69:33</a>; ftn.) In a broad sense, we may at times feel as if we were prisoners held captive by our distresses or afflictions. It may appear that others do not truly understand our situation​—and perhaps they do not. But like David, we can be comforted in knowing that Jehovah fully understands our distresses.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 34:15</a>.</p>

<strong>Heaven</strong><br/><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">It can be seen from the foregoing that the context must always be considered in determining the sense of these figurative expressions. Thus, when Moses called on “the heavens and the earth” to serve as witnesses to the things that he declared to Israel, it is obvious that he did not mean the inanimate creation but, rather, the intelligent residents inhabiting the heavens and the earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/140/0" data-bid="141-1" class="b">De 4:25, 26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/140/1" data-bid="141-2" class="b"> 30:19</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/141/0" data-bid="142-1" class="b">Eph 1:9, 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/141/1" data-bid="142-2" class="b"> Php 2:9, 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/141/2" data-bid="142-3" class="b"> Re 13:6</a>.) This is also true of the rejoicing by the heavens and earth over Babylon’s fall, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/142/0" data-bid="143-1" class="b">Jeremiah 51:48</a>.

Likewise it must be the spiritual heavens that “trickle with righteousness,” as described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/144/0" data-bid="145-1" class="b">Isaiah 45:8</a>. In other cases the literal heavens are meant but are figuratively described as rejoicing or shouting out loud. At Jehovah’s coming to judge the earth, as described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/145/0" data-bid="146-1" class="b">Psalm 96:11-13</a>, the heavens, along with the earth, sea, and the field, take on a gladsome appearance.

The physical heavens also praise their Creator, in the same way that a beautifully designed product brings praise to the craftsman producing it. In effect, they speak of Jehovah’s power, wisdom, and majesty.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/147/0" data-bid="148-1" class="b">Ps 19:1-4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/147/1" data-bid="148-2" class="b"> 69:34</a>.</p>
