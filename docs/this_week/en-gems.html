It does not mean, of necessity, that Ammonite and Moabite individuals could not associate themselves with or reside among the Israelites and thereby benefit from the divine blessings upon God’s people, and this is evident from the inclusion of Zelek, mentioned earlier, among David’s chief warriors, as well as from the record concerning Ruth the Moabitess.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Ru 1:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/50/1" data-bid="51-2" class="b"> 16-18</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">As to this latter case, Ruth’s marriage to Boaz shows that females of these nations, upon turning to the worship of the true God, could be acceptable for marriage by Jewish males.

Nevertheless, Ezra’s insistence that the Jewish men send away their foreign wives and Nehemiah’s similar attitude, previously mentioned, indicate that the admission of Ammonite and Moabite females into association with Israel was dependent upon their acceptance of true worship.</p>

<strong>Benefiting from the Undeserved Kindness of God</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Of course, there have been instances over the years when I might have wished for greater physical endurance. My physical frailty has at times interrupted my work, and the last interruption nearly brought my service here to an end when it struck hard at my stomach. I was rushed straight to the operating table, but, filled with confidence in Jehovah, I found peace even under those circumstances. The surgeon was a gentleman and, though he could not hold out much hope for me, he was willing to respect my religious view precluding the use of blood, and he did a fine job. To the astonishment of all, my recovery, though it took time, was good. <span id="page509" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="509" data-before-text="509"></span>It makes me feel as the apostle Paul must have felt due to the affliction that he termed a “thorn in the flesh.” He longed to be freed from it, but the Lord said to him: “My undeserved kindness is sufficient for you; for my power is being made perfect in weakness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962607/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Cor. 12:7-9</a>) Even my own infirmity, my own weakness, opened the way for a good witness to the hospital personnel and other patients, all of whom were very kind to me.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Well over forty years have gone by since I came to the Watch Tower Society’s Finnish branch office to work, yet this time has seemed very short. I gave up a career of musical entertainment but I have become convinced that real happiness does not come through seeking material gain or self honor. I have found far greater happiness in singing the praises of God. And my fascination for languages has come to have much more meaning than it ever did when I was a boy, for I have been able to have a part in translating the message of life into the language of the people among whom I serve. It is the undeserved kindness of God that has opened to me all these opportunities, bringing joy to my life and enabling me to devote myself to sharing it with others.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Persia, Persians</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The Greek stories of the end of Xerxes’ reign revolve around marital difficulties, disorders in the harem, and a supposed dominance of Xerxes by certain of his courtiers. These traditional accounts may reflect, though in a very confused and twisted way, some of the basic facts of the book of Esther, including the deposing of Queen Vashti and her replacement by Esther, and also the ascension of Mordecai to a position of great authority in the realm. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Esther 2:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 10:3</a>) According to the secular accounts, Xerxes was assassinated by one of his courtiers. While most secular authorities present 466/465 B.C.E. <span id="page1295" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1295" data-before-text="1295"></span>as the date of his death, thereby giving him a rule of some twenty-one years, an earlier date of 475/474 B.C.E. accords with the Bible record and has creditable testimony in its favor from certain of the ancient secular historians.—See ARTAXERXES No. 3.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong><em>Artaxerxes (Longimanus) to Darius II</em></strong></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">The reign of Xerxes’ successor, Artaxerxes’ (Longimanus), is notable for his authorization of Ezra’s return to Jerusalem with a large contribution for the support of the temple there. This occurred in Artaxerxes, seventh year (469/468 B.C.E. according to the above-mentioned dating). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ezra 7:1-26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 8:24-36</a>) Some have assumed the reference to “a stone wall in Judah and in Jerusalem” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ezra 9:9</a>) to mean that Ezra was commissioned by Artaxerxes to rebuild the city walls. However, the Hebrew term does not necessarily refer to a massive wall, such as surrounded a city, but often describes a wall such as encompassed a vineyard (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Num. 22:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Isa. 5:5</a>) or lined a courtyard. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ezek. 42:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 10</a>) (<em>The Revised Standard Version</em> of this text says “to give us <em>protection</em> in Judea and Jerusalem,” while <em>The Jerusalem Bible</em> reads: “<em>safety and shelter</em> in Judah and in Jerusalem.”) Thus, this protective “wall” evidently refers figuratively to Jehovah’s extension of “loving-kindness before the kings of Persia” on behalf of his people, as mentioned in the same verse.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Thus, it was not until the twentieth year of Artaxerxes that a commission was given to Nehemiah to return to Jerusalem to rebuild the city, including “the wall of the city.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Neh. 2:1-8</a>) Artaxerxes appointed Nehemiah as “governor in the land of Judah,” giving him a military escort for the trip there. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Neh. 2:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 5:14, 15</a>) Nehemiah later returned for a time to the court of Artaxerxes in that king’s thirty-second year. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Neh. 13:6</a>) Historians date Artaxerxes’ death as of 424/423 B.C.E.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">An abortive rule by Xerxes II is considered to fit in between the rule of Artaxerxes and that of Darius II. Darius II, Artaxerxes’ son by a concubine, succeeded to the throne after Xerxes II was murdered. His original name was Ochus but he adopted the name Darius upon becoming king in 423 B.C.E., according to secular history. He seems to be the “Darius” referred to at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Nehemiah 12:22</a>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="ss"><strong><em>Papyrus documents of Biblical significance</em></strong></p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">A considerable number of papyrus documents were written in Aramaic by a Jewish colony in Elephantine, an island in the Nile River near Syene (Aswan) Egypt, and these have been recovered and are dated by secular historians as from the reign of Darius I (beginning about 521 B.C.E.) to at least the reign of Darius II (c. 423-404 B.C.E.). The names “Sanballat” and “Johanan” occur in them and are thought to refer to those persons bearing the same names mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Nehemiah 4:1 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 12:22</a>. These papyri demonstrate the accuracy with which the books of Ezra and Nehemiah depict conditions and official communications during the Persian rule. As Professor Wright states: “Now . . . we are able to see that the Aramaic of Ezra is precisely that of its age, while the government documents are of the general type which we have become accustomed to associate with the Persian regime.” (<em>Biblical Archaeology,</em> p. 208) One document, credited to Darius II, contains a royal order concerning the celebration of the Passover by the Jewish colony in Egypt.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="ss"><strong>DOWN TO THE FALL AND DIVISION OF THE EMPIRE</strong></p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">Following Darius II came Artaxerxes II (called Mnemon), during whose reign Egypt revolted and relations with Greece deteriorated. His reign (dated as from 404 to 358 B.C.E.) was followed by that of his son Artaxerxes III (also called Ochus), who is credited with some twenty-one years of rule (358-338/37 B.C.E.) and is said to be the most bloodthirsty of all the Persian rulers. His major feat was the reconquest of Egypt. Secular history then gives a two-year rule for Arses and a five-year rule for Darius III (Codomannus), during whose reign Philip of Macedonia was murdered (336 B.C.E.) and succeeded by his son Alexander. In 334 B.C.E. Alexander began his attack on the Persian Empire, defeating the Persian forces first at Granicus in the NW corner of Asia Minor and again at Issus at the opposite corner of Asia Minor (333 B.C.E.). Finally, after the Greeks had conquered Phoenicia and Egypt, the Persians’ last stand, at Gaugamela in 331 B.C.E., was crushed and the Persian Empire came to its end.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">Following Alexander’s death and the subsequent division of the empire, Seleucus Nicator obtained control of the major portion of the Asiatic territories with Persia as its central part. The Seleucid dynasty of kings, thus begun, continued until 64 B.C.E. Seleucus Nicator seems to be the one with whom the prophetic figure of the “king of the north” of Daniel’s prophecy first begins to manifest itself, opposing the Ptolemaic line of kings in Egypt, who initially appear to fill the role of the symbolic “king of the south.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Dan. 11:4-6</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">The Seleucid kings were restricted to the western part of their domain by the incursions of the Parthians, who conquered the territory of Persia proper during the third and second centuries B.C.E. They were defeated by the Sasanians in 226 C.E. and the Sasanian rule continued until the Arab conquest in 642.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">The prophecy of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Ezekiel (27:10</a>) includes Persians among the men of war serving in the military force of wealthy Tyre, and contributing to its splendor. Persia is also listed among those nations forming part of the hordes directed by the symbolic “Gog of the land of Magog” against Jehovah’s covenant people.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ezek. 38:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/33/1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 4, 5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/33/2" data-bid="34-3" class="b"> 8, 9</a>.</p>

Why was the choice of a wife no problem for Adam?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[28]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>FOR Adam, the first man, choosing a wife was no problem at all. She was made for him. Man had named the many animals, but for him “there was found no helper as a complement of him.” “Hence,” we are told in the Biblical account, “Jehovah God had a deep sleep fall upon the man and, while he was sleeping, he took one of his ribs and then closed up the flesh over its place. And Jehovah God proceeded to build the rib that he had taken from the man into a woman and to bring her to the man.” Just imagine Adam’s joy at this! He was moved to exclaim: “This is at last bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. This one will be called Woman, because from man this one <span id="page560" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="560" data-before-text="560"></span>was taken.” No wonder man would stick to his wife. In her sinless state, this woman was his perfect complement.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965683/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 2:18-25</a>.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="qu"> 2. Show Scripturally what Jehovah’s will is for Christians who choose to marry.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> Today, among imperfect humans, a problem facing some Christians is that of selecting a marriage mate. In this a devoted servant of Jehovah will wisely heed the apostle Paul’s inspired admonition that dedicated Christians should marry believers, thus marrying “only in the Lord.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965683/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:39</a>) This is Jehovah’s will for Christians who choose to wed. Centuries prior to Paul’s day, when God’s people, the Israelites, were to come in contact with the heathen of Canaanland, they were sternly warned: “You must form no marriage alliance with them. Your daughter you must not give to his son, and his daughter you must not take for your son.” Dire consequences would follow disobedience, as God so clearly stated: “For he will turn your son from following me, and they will certainly serve other gods.” Not only would the son or daughter thus yoked fare badly, but parents arranging such a union would incur Jehovah’s wrath, for it was said: “And Jehovah’s anger will indeed blaze against you, and he will certainly annihilate you in a hurry”!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965683/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Deut. 7:3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu"> 3. What examples from patriarchal times should a Christian parent remember?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> Earlier, in patriarchal times, parents devoted to Jehovah were distressed when a grown son personally made a marriage alliance with pagans. When Esau took Judith and Basemath, Hittite women, as wives, “they were a source of bitterness of spirit to Isaac and Rebekah.” On one occasion Rebekah lamented: “I have come to abhor this life of mine because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob ever takes a wife from the daughters of Heth like these from the daughters of the land, of what good is life to me?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965683/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 26:34, 35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965683/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 27:46</a>) Happily, Jacob entered into no marital union that would embitter a godly parent and displease Jehovah. Before this, when Abraham arranged for the selecting of Isaac’s wife, there was no bad choice of a heathen woman. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965683/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Genesis, chapter 24</a>) Should you, as a Christian parent today, arrange the marriage of your son or daughter? Surely not like some parents have done. Remember the warning to Israel and these fine parental examples from patriarchal days.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 4. How did the Jews of Ezra’s day sin against Jehovah?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> You may be a Christian parent who will arrange a marriage for your son or daughter. Or you may be an adult dedicated servant of Jehovah God who plans to marry. In either case, let the words of faithful Ezra ring in your ears, his earnest supplication at a time of national wrongdoing. The Jews had been delivered from captivity to Babylon. They had the Scriptures and good examples from the past. These they ignored, and great was their guilt before Jehovah. But how had they sinned? This Ezra revealed as he pleaded: “And after all that has come upon us for our bad deeds and our great guiltiness—for you yourself, O our God, have underestimated our error, and you have given us those who have escaped such as these—shall we go breaking your commandments again and forming marriage alliances with the peoples of these detestable things? Will you not get incensed at us to the limit so that there will be none remaining and none escaping? O Jehovah the God of Israel, you are righteous, because we have been left over as an escaped people as at this day. Here we are before you in our guiltiness, for it is impossible to stand before you on account of this.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965683/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezra 9:13-15</a>) The Jews put away their foreign wives in the days of Ezra, in recognition of their great guiltiness before God. Do not forget that they had sinned against <span id="page561" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="561" data-before-text="561"></span>Jehovah by intermarrying with the pagan Canaanites. Never minimize the gravity of disobeying God with respect to wedlock.</p>

<strong>Baldness</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In the Law, one with head leprosy was to shave his head at the beginning of his quarantine period and on the day of purification and again on the seventh day.

Their heads were made bald by the chafing of helmets and their shoulders from the rubbing of materials (for the construction of towers and fortifications). Jehovah through Ezekiel had foretold that “every head was one made bald, and every shoulder was one rubbed bare” as Nebuchadnezzar’s military force performed a “great service” in rendering God’s judgment on Tyre.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010545/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ezek. 26:7-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010545/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 29:17, 18</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In some places in the days of the apostles, such as in the immoral city of Corinth, women caught committing adultery or fornication were punished by having their hair shaved off. Slave girls had their hair clipped short. Paul apparently draws on this circumstance for illustration, showing that a woman in the Christian congregation who would pray or prophesy with her head uncovered, even though she had her hair as a covering, might as well go the whole way and show her shame in disrespecting God’s headship principle by having her hair completely shaved off.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010545/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:3-10</a>; see BEARD.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"></p>

The cold rainy season for Palestine begins in late October and lasts several months. By December Bethlehem, like neighboring Jerusalem, experiences frequent frost at night. And how cold could it be? Concerning Judean King Jehoiakim, we read: “The king was sitting in the winter house, in the ninth month [Chislev, corresponding to November-December], with a brazier burning before him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979921/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Jer. 36:22</a>) He needed such heat to keep warm. Moreover, in postexilic Jerusalem, the people Ezra assembled in the open during that same winter month were “shivering because of the matter [then under consideration] and on account of the showers of rain.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979921/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ezra 10:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979921/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979921/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 13</a>) It is noteworthy that the next month, Tebeth (December-January), saw the lowest temperatures of the year, with occasional snow in the highlands.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Augustus Caesar ordered a registration that, as it turned out, coincided with the time of Jesus’ birth.

Not at all.</p>

<strong>Ammonites</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><strong>Intermarriage With Israelites.</strong> Following the return of the Jews from exile (537 B.C.E.), an Ammonite named Tobiah took a leading part in endeavoring to obstruct the rebuilding of Jerusalem’s walls.

Many of the returned Jewish exiles also had taken wives of Ammonite and other foreign extraction and were severely rebuked for this, resulting in a general dismissal of such wives.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Ezr 9:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/47/1" data-bid="48-2" class="b"> 10:10-19,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/47/2" data-bid="48-3" class="b"> 44;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/47/3" data-bid="48-4" class="b"> Ne 13:23-27</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">After Tobiah’s ejection from the temple grounds, God’s law at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 23:3-6</a> prohibiting the entry of Ammonites and Moabites into the congregation of Israel was read and applied.

It does not mean, of necessity, that Ammonite and Moabite individuals could not associate themselves with or reside among the Israelites and thereby benefit from the divine blessings upon God’s people, and this is evident from the inclusion of Zelek, mentioned earlier, among David’s chief warriors, as well as from the record concerning Ruth the Moabitess.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Ru 1:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/50/1" data-bid="51-2" class="b"> 16-18</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">As to this latter case, Ruth’s marriage to Boaz shows that females of these nations, upon turning to the worship of the true God, could be acceptable for marriage by Jewish males. Because the terms “Ammonite” and “Moabite” in the Hebrew text of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 23:3-6</a> are in the masculine gender, the Jewish Mishnah (<em>Yevamot</em> 8:3) argues that only male Ammonites and Moabites were excluded from Israel. Nevertheless, Ezra’s insistence that the Jewish men send away their foreign wives and Nehemiah’s similar attitude, previously mentioned, indicate that the admission of Ammonite and Moabite females into association with Israel was dependent upon their acceptance of true worship.</p>

According to the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> and Latin <em>Vulgate,</em> Jahzeiah and the others assisted rather than opposed Ezra.

<strong>Seventy Weeks</strong><br/><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="sb">Most English translations do not follow the Masoretic punctuation here, either having a comma after the expression “seven weeks,” or in the wording indicating that the sixty-two weeks follow the seven as part of the seventy, and not denoting that the sixty-two weeks <span id="page1476" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1476" data-before-text="1476"></span>apply to the period of rebuilding Jerusalem.

An editorial note by Professor James Strong in <em>A Commentary on the Holy Scriptures</em> (The Book of the Prophet Daniel, by Dr. Otto Zöckler), page 198, says: “The only justification of this translation, which separates the two periods of seven weeks and sixty-two weeks, assigning the former as the <em>terminus ad quem</em> of the Anointed Prince, and the latter as the time of rebuilding, lies in the Masoretic interpunction, which places the Athnac [stop] between them. . . . and the rendering in question involves a harsh construction of the second member, being without a preposition. It is better, therefore, and simpler, to adhere to the Authorized Version, which follows all the older translations.”</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="sb">Numerous other views, some Messianic and some non-Messianic, have been set forth as to the meaning of the prophecy, attempting to change the order of the time periods of the prophecy, to make some run simultaneously, or denying that they have any actual time fulfillment. Also many efforts have been made to fit the events mentioned into the Maccabean period or even to the final time of the end. But those presenting such views become hopelessly entangled and their attempts to extricate themselves result in absurdity or in outrightly denying the prophecy as inspired or true. Of the latter ones particularly, who raise more problems than they solve, the aforementioned scholar, E. B. Pusey, remarks: “These were the impossible problems for unbelief to solve; it had to solve them for itself, which was, so far, easier; for nothing is impossible for unbelief to believe, except what God reveals.”</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="sb"></p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204404/269/0">7/1/1950, pp. 206-207</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Ezra, Zealous for Pure Worship</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Ezra then carefully weighed and counted the treasure, some four million dollars in value, and, with a solemn injunction, entrusted it to twelve of the chief priests. After a journey taking about four months, Ezra and his band arrived safely in Jerusalem. Again Jehovah had prospered Ezra’s zeal for the pure worship. After offering sacrifices <span id="page207" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="207" data-before-text="207"></span>of bulls, rams, lambs and he-goats for all the twelve tribes of Israel, Ezra learned of the transgression of the people in the matter of taking heathen wives. To one so jealous for the pure worship as was Ezra, this news of the widespread infiltration of pagan worshipers caused the greatest consternation and amazement. “I tore my garment and my mantle, and pulled the hair from my head and my beard, and sat down appalled . . . until the evening oblation.”</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Then falling upon his knees and spreading his hands out to Jehovah he made a moving confession in the presence of the assembled Israelites, “all who trembled at the words of the God of Israel.” Confessing the wrongful course of his people from the days of their fathers to the present time, he recounted the punishment that they had received because of it, and how God had again extended mercy to them by permitting them to return. They had been punished with less than they deserved, and “shall we again break thy commands, and make marriage alliances with the peoples who perform these abominable rites? Wouldst thou not be enraged with us until thou hadst consumed us, until neither remnant nor survivor was left?”</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">On behalf of the people one Shechaniah spoke up and counseled that all enter into a solemn agreement to straighten this matter out, and, urging Ezra, said: “Arise, for it is your task, and we are with you; be strong and act.” Ezra then made all the people swear that they would be submissive to Jehovah’s will in the matter, and they were commanded to return for this purpose within three days. All those refusing to do so were to be banished and their goods confiscated.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950484/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezra 9:3-10:8</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Accordingly all the people came together in Jerusalem on the twentieth day of the ninth month. This was therefore no small assembly. “And all the people sat in the open square in front of the house of God, trembling on account of the occasion itself and also because of the pouring rain.” It was seen that the entire matter could not be taken care of then and there because of the great number that had transgressed, so after instructions’ being given by Ezra arrangements were made to take care of the matter gradually at appointed times. By the end of the next three months all the pagan worshipers had been cleared out.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950484/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezra 10:9-17</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Without doubt this action caused much suffering to all concerned; the overdue remedying of violations of God’s laws often does. Neither is it at all likely that the heathen neighbors round about who were involved particularly welcomed the return of these grass widows, with the added burden of their children, nor that they appreciated the issue of pure worship that was involved. But the servants of Jehovah must decide whether they will be primarily concerned with pleasing Jehovah or with pleasing this world. Ezra was determined to ‘know, teach and do’ God’s will and law regardless of what others thought. The servants of the Lord today likewise cannot be governed in their decisions by whether or not the people of the world appreciate the issue in regard to such questions as the flag salute, military service, or understand God’s will in the matter of blood transfusions, etc. But, back to Ezra.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Thirteen years pass, and it is the first day of the seventh month when we next hear of him. In the meantime Nehemiah had returned, rebuilt the walls of Jerusalem and was serving as governor of the land. Again we see Ezra manifest zeal for the pure worship by instructing the people in the law of Jehovah. We see him stand on a platform that was raised high above the people so that all could see and hear, and after a prayer to Jehovah he reads from the law from day dawn till noon. For that convention the people had gotten up early! As the law or word of the law was written in Hebrew and the people in general no longer understood it but spoke Aramaic, it was necessary that others interpret it for them; hence “they read in the book in the law of God distinctly [that is, gave the Aramaic paraphrase], and gave the sense [by dividing the words according to the sense], and caused them to understand the reading [by giving the traditional pronunciation of the words]”.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950484/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Neh. 8:8</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">As the people heard the words of the law read they wept, but they were told not to weep, but to rejoice, that this was a time of joy and feasting, “for the joy of Jehovah is your strength.” “And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them.” On the next day the people again gathered for Bible education, “even to give attention to the words of the law.” Learning of God’s commandment to celebrate the feast of tabernacles, they immediately went out to the forests and gathered boughs and made themselves booths or tabernacles and dwelt in them. “And there was very great gladness.” Ezra continued to instruct the people: “Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950484/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Neh. 8:9-18</a>, <em>Am. Stan. Ver.</em>) Great as was the joy of the people, Ezra’s joy was, without doubt, still greater; for is it not more blessed to give out the words of God’s law than to receive them?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">In addition to orally instructing the people, Ezra showed his zeal for the pure worship in other ways. He wrote the book bearing his name as well as the two books of Chronicles. Further, there is every reason to believe that Jehovah’s spirit directed his zeal to compile the Hebrew Scripture canon; collating the various books of the Hebrew canon while still in Babylon and then putting them into final form and adding his own writings after he returned to Palestine. The evidence at hand is quite conclusive that the Hebrew canon was complete in his day, with perhaps the single exception of the book of Malachi.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The time of Ezra also saw the making of many copies of the Hebrew Scriptures for the use of the Jews in the synagogues, scattered far and wide. Without doubt Ezra’s zeal for pure worship caused him to pioneer in this work and also to supervise it. Thus in various ways Ezra manifested his zeal for the pure worship of Jehovah, and not only did his contemporary brethren benefit from it but all of Jehovah’s servants since have profited from his resolve to know, teach and do Jehovah’s law. And in this he also set a good example for all servants of Jehovah today.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sd">I will give thanks unto Jehovah with my whole heart; I will show forth all thy marvellous works.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950484/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 9:1</a>, <em>A.S.V.</em></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Benefiting from the Undeserved Kindness of God</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Of course, there have been instances over the years when I might have wished for greater physical endurance. My physical frailty has at times interrupted my work, and the last interruption nearly brought my service here to an end when it struck hard at my stomach. I was rushed straight to the operating table, but, filled with confidence in Jehovah, I found peace even under those circumstances. The surgeon was a gentleman and, though he could not hold out much hope for me, he was willing to respect my religious view precluding the use of blood, and he did a fine job. To the astonishment of all, my recovery, though it took time, was good. <span id="page509" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="509" data-before-text="509"></span>It makes me feel as the apostle Paul must have felt due to the affliction that he termed a “thorn in the flesh.” He longed to be freed from it, but the Lord said to him: “My undeserved kindness is sufficient for you; for my power is being made perfect in weakness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962607/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Cor. 12:7-9</a>) Even my own infirmity, my own weakness, opened the way for a good witness to the hospital personnel and other patients, all of whom were very kind to me.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Well over forty years have gone by since I came to the Watch Tower Society’s Finnish branch office to work, yet this time has seemed very short. I gave up a career of musical entertainment but I have become convinced that real happiness does not come through seeking material gain or self honor. I have found far greater happiness in singing the praises of God. And my fascination for languages has come to have much more meaning than it ever did when I was a boy, for I have been able to have a part in translating the message of life into the language of the people among whom I serve. It is the undeserved kindness of God that has opened to me all these opportunities, bringing joy to my life and enabling me to devote myself to sharing it with others.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"></p>

The word “thigh” is from the Hebrew <em>ya·rekhʹ,</em> which in its appearances in the Hebrew Scriptures is most often translated “thigh,” sometimes “side,” as at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Exodus 40:22,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/47/1" data-bid="48-2" class="b"> 24</a>, and less often “loins,” in which cases it usually is used in a euphemistic sense. It applies to the upper part of the leg from the hip to the knee, in which the femur is located.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">A form of the same Hebrew word is also used in the case of Jacob where the angel “touched the socket of Jacob’s thigh joint by the sinew of the thigh nerve” and left him crippled.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Gen. 32:32</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">We can be sure that there was no phallic connotation in the actions of Abraham and Jacob, as some claim, for all phallic practices were abhorred by the faithful Hebrews. According to the Jewish rabbi Rashbam, this method was used when a superior adjured an inferior, such as a master his servant or a father his son, who also owes him obedience. And according to another Jewish scholar, Abraham Ibn Ezra, it was the custom in those days for a servant to take an oath in this manner, placing his hand under his master’s thigh, the latter sitting upon his hand. This signified that the servant was under his master’s authority.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="ss"><strong>GRIEF, SHAME</strong></p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb"><em>Throwing dust on the head; ripping garments; wearing sackcloth</em>.
