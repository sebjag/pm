<strong>Declare Righteous</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"><strong>Attempts at Proving Oneself Righteous.</strong> Since God alone can declare a man righteous, attempts to prove oneself righteous on the basis of one’s own merit or by acceptance of the judgment of others as to one’s righteousness are of no value. Job was reproved because, though not charging God with any wrong, he was “declaring his own soul righteous rather than God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001142/76/0" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Job 32:1, 2</a>) The man versed in the Law who questioned Jesus about the way to everlasting life was indirectly reproved by Jesus for his attempt to prove himself righteous. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001142/77/0" data-bid="78-1" class="b">Lu 10:25-37</a>) Jesus condemned the Pharisees for seeking to declare themselves righteous before men. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001142/78/0" data-bid="79-1" class="b">Lu 16:15</a>) The apostle Paul, in particular, showed that, because of the imperfect, sinful state of all mankind, none could be declared righteous through trying to establish their own righteousness by works of the Mosaic Law. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001142/79/0" data-bid="80-1" class="b">Ro 3:19-24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001142/79/1" data-bid="80-2" class="b"> Ga 3:10-12</a>) Instead, he stressed faith in Christ Jesus as the true basis for such declaration of righteousness.

<strong>Elihu</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> “The son of Barachel the Buzite of the family of Ram.” As a descendant of Buz, Elihu was evidently a distant relative of Abraham. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001306/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 32:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001306/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001306/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Ge 22:20, 21</a>) Likely Elihu listened carefully to the entire debate between Job and his three would-be comforters. But, out of due respect for their age, he remained silent until all had finished speaking. Though modern critics have labeled Elihu as loquacious, saying that his speeches were long-winded, the statements of Elihu were not those of an impertinent young man. He fully appreciated that wisdom was not the exclusive possession of those advanced in years, but that God’s spirit made one truly wise. Elihu, therefore, leaned heavily on God’s spirit. He was thus able to discern correctly that Job had failed to appreciate that the vindication of Jehovah God is far more important than the vindication of any man and that Job’s three friends had actually pronounced God wicked.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001306/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 32:2-9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001306/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 18</a>.</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994844/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Isaiah 41:8</a>) Elihu showed respect for older men by listening to both sides of the debate. Yet, he spoke courageously concerning matters about which they were wrong. For instance, his anger blazed at Job’s “declaring his own soul righteous rather than God.” Especially was Elihu’s wrath directed against the false comforters. Their statements seemed to exalt God but really reproached him by taking Satan’s side of the controversy. “Full of words” and moved by holy spirit, Elihu was an impartial witness of Jehovah.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994844/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Job 32:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994844/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 18,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994844/19/2" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 21</a>.</p>

<strong>Jehovah’s Witnesses Endure for His Sovereign Godship</strong><br/><p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[71]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> Who, then, was it that finally made a right estimation of these basic matters and published such for the attention of the <span id="page558" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="558" data-before-text="558"></span>anointed ones to set matters straight? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966682/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Isa. 1:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966682/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 2 Tim. 3:16</a>) As it was young Elihu that made the right assessment as to elderly Job in Job’s day so it was the modern young Elihu who brought about the reproving of the 1,900-year-old Job-like anointed ones. Against ancient Job, Elihu’s “anger blazed over his [Job’s] declaring his own soul righteous rather than God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966682/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Job 32:2</a>) The modern Elihu seems well to comprise the spiritual governing body of the anointed remnant of Christ’s body always closely associated with the directors of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania.<a id="footnotesource9" data-fnid="9" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966682/8">i</a> This governing group of anointed ones having become a working unit since the 1870’s makes it young historically in comparison to the 1,900-year-old “faithful and discreet slave,” collectively made up of the faithful anointed ones alive on earth at any given point of time. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966682/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45, 46</a>) The Elihu governing unit has been responsible since 1879 for publishing the <em>Watchtower</em> magazine.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[71]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> When the Elihu of today gained the right estimation of matters it used its instrument, the <em>Watchtower</em> magazine, to counsel the anointed ones progressively. It was <em>The Watchtower</em> that first published that the vindicating of Jehovah’s universal sovereignty was more important than the vindicating of any individual man. In the giving of its advice, like young Elihu of Job’s day, the historically youthful governing group showed more of a youthful reliance upon the spirit of God in rendering spiritual counsel than in looking to age-old human wisdom and philosophy as the clergy were doing. For this reason the modern Elihu through <em>The Watchtower</em> could further take the lead in exposing the 1,600-year-old “man of lawlessness” class, the sectarian clergy. With Christian boldness since 1919 <em>The Watchtower</em> could maintain with a right estimation that Christendom’s clergy have “proceeded to pronounce God wicked” by their agelong preaching of things that were based on anti-Jehovah, Babylonish teachings. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966682/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Job 32:3</a>) In this way a right assessment and the correct estimation of religious developments become progressively available to all righteously inclined individuals by means of <em>The Watchtower.</em></p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="ss"><strong>JOB-LIKE TESTING</strong></p><p id="p72" data-pid="72" class="qu">17.

A period of Babylon-like captivity came to be forced upon them. Ridicule was heaped upon them by the clergy. During World War I they were slanderously branded as “security risks.” This brought governmental opposition <span id="page559" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="559" data-before-text="559"></span>upon them in Canada, the United States and other countries. Their publications became subject to ban. Those taking the lead among them came to be imprisoned. Finally their organized public witness work was crippled by the summer of 1918. Their headquarters in Brooklyn, New York, had to be shut down, with temporary offices maintained back in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Places of their religious meetings were raided and closed. Yes, a spiritually destitute, forsaken condition came upon them. To the faithful anointed ones questions came as to what all this meant and why Jehovah was permitting all this open hostility. Had they not in the name of God and Christ been undertaking a great public witness work among the nations in the thirty-some years before 1914? Did not Jehovah seem to favor that work by granting it continued growth before 1914? The Job-like ones wanted to know: Why now all this adversity and hostility?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966682/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Matt. 24:9, 10</a>.</p>

<strong>Championing Jehovah’s Godship in Spite of Babylonish Hostility</strong><br/><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="ss"><span id="page528" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="528" data-before-text="528"></span><strong>JOB LOOKS INWARD</strong></p><p id="p73" data-pid="73" class="qu">22. How was Job forced to look upon himself, and what did he say?</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[73]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> So by these three lengthy rounds of arguments of materialistic philosophy this unholy trio force Job to defend himself personally and to look inward upon himself to keep declaring his own soul righteous rather than extolling the rightness of the true God in conducting this case as to His Sovereign Godship. Deep down in Job’s heart this jabbing, testing process occurred, with questions and answers flowing from him. “If I have sinned, what can I accomplish against you, the Observer of mankind? Why is it that you have set me as your target, so that I should become a burden to you?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/70/0" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Job 7:20</a>) “I myself well know that my redeemer is alive.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/71/0" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Job 19:25</a>) “O that I had someone listening to me, that according to my signature the Almighty himself would answer me!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/72/0" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Job 31:35</a>) Yes, by means of this long duel under the permitted hand of Satan through his earthly dupes, Job was tested to the very core of his heart, yet his heart proved to be true, clean, full of hope and trusting in God.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="ss"><strong>ELIHU’S ASSESSMENT</strong></p><p id="p74" data-pid="74" class="qu">23. (a) What was Elihu’s assessment of the lengthy religious controversy? (b) How did Jehovah step in, and what was Job’s reaction?</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" data-rel-pid="[74]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> Finally the neutral watcher, Elihu, spoke up and presented the right assessment as to the true and false schools of wisdom that had concluded their arguments. “Against Job his anger blazed over his declaring his own soul righteous rather than God. Also, against his three companions his anger blazed over the fact that they had not found an answer but they proceeded to pronounce God wicked.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/73/0" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Job 32:2, 3</a>) So on the issue of Godship the three false comforters proved to have utterly failed, whereas Job had become sidetracked upon himself although never failing in his integrity to the true God. Then the drama ends with the tremendous display of wisdom from the true God by his speaking out of the windstorm. There Jehovah demonstrated his overwhelming Godship by referring to creation’s marvels and to natural things pertaining to the earth far too wonderful to be grasped by the mind of mortal man. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/74/0" data-bid="75-1" class="b">Job, chapters 38-41</a>) To this amazing shower of heavenly wisdom, Job’s clean heart quickly responds: “I have come to know that you are able to do all things, and there is no idea that is unattainable for you. That is why I make a retraction, and I do repent in dust and ashes.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/75/0" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Job 42:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/75/1" data-bid="76-2" class="b"> 6</a>.</p><p id="p75" data-pid="75" class="qu">24, 25. (a) What was Jehovah’s judgment as to the two sides of the Godship controversy? (b) How does the Job drama conclude? (c) What question arises, and how will it be dealt with?</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" data-rel-pid="[75]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> Then Jehovah confirms Elihu’s reprimand of the three false companions by saying: “My anger has grown hot against you [Eliphaz] and your two companions, for you men have not spoken concerning me what is <em>truthful</em> as has my servant Job. And now take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job, and you men must offer up a burnt sacrifice in your own behalf; and Job my servant will himself pray for you. His face only I shall accept so as not to commit disgraceful folly with you, for you have not spoken concerning me what is <em>truthful,</em> as has my servant Job.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/76/0" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Job 42:7, 8</a>) Thus the apostate religion of these Babylonized wise men became exposed by Jehovah himself, twice declaring them as ‘not truthful.’ Their so-called wisdom turned out to be foolishness. Satan miserably lost the contest resulting from his challenge. The three “companions” had to make a climb-down, reform themselves and submit their lives to the priesthood services of Job by accepting the true religion. As to Job personally, “Jehovah himself turned back the captive condition of Job” and blessed him with twice the material wealth <span id="page529" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="529" data-before-text="529"></span>he had lost at the beginning. As to his family, he came to have seven sons and three beautiful daughters even in the old age of himself and that of his aged wife.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/77/0" data-bid="78-1" class="b">Job 42:10-15</a>.</p>

Job did not possess the knowledge that God was allowing Satan to put his integrity to the test, to see whether he would be faithful to God. Job kept his integrity to God despite his sufferings. Yet, lacking knowledge of the great issue involved, he declared “his own soul righteous rather than God.” And in his distress he said: “I certainly am in the right, but God himself has turned aside the judgment of me.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 32:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 34:5</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">However, Elihu told Job wherein he had not been in the right: “Only you have said in my ears, and the sound of your words I kept hearing, ‘I am pure without transgression; clean I am, and I have no error. Look! Occasions for opposition to me he [God] finds, he takes me for an enemy of his. He puts my feet in the stocks, he watches all my paths.’ Look! In this you have not been in the right.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 33:8-12</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">To give Job a proper understanding of the matter, the Almighty spoke to Job out of the windstorm. In a series of questions the Almighty asked Job how he could account for the wisdom in God’s manifold works of creation. Could he even fathom it all? The many examples drawn from the visible creation, including animals, showed Job that man was utterly incompetent to judge the ways of God. We can benefit by noting God’s questions regarding</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>THE HORSE AND ITS QUALITIES</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“Can you give to the horse mightiness? Can you clothe its neck with a rustling mane? Can you cause it to leap like a locust? The dignity of its snorting is frightful. It paws in the low plain and exults in power; it goes forth to meet armor. It laughs at dread, and is not terrified; nor does it turn back on account of a sword. Against it a quiver rattles, the blade of a spear and a javelin. With pounding and excitement it swallows up the earth, and it does not believe that it is the sound of a horn. As soon as the horn blows it says Aha! And from far off it smells the battle, the uproar of chiefs and the war cry.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 39:19-25</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Did Job endow the horse with these remarkable qualities? Did he give the horse its mightiness or clothe its neck with the rustling mane? Who gave the horse its ability to leap like a locust? Not man. Further, “the dignity of its snorting is frightful”; so much so that <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jeremiah 8:16</a> says: “From Dan has been heard the snorting of his horses. Due to the sound of the neighing of his stallions the whole land has begun to rock.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The monuments of antiquity abound with pictorial representations of the warhorse, and the horse is often referred to in the Bible as a symbol for war equipment.

Against ancient Job, Elihu’s “anger blazed over his [Job’s] declaring his own soul righteous rather than God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966682/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Job 32:2</a>) The modern Elihu seems well to comprise the spiritual governing body of the anointed remnant of Christ’s body always closely associated with the directors of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania.<a id="footnotesource9" data-fnid="9" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966682/8">i</a> This governing group of anointed ones having become a working unit since the 1870’s makes it young historically in comparison to the 1,900-year-old “faithful and discreet slave,” collectively made up of the faithful anointed ones alive on earth at any given point of time.

It was <em>The Watchtower</em> that first published that the vindicating of Jehovah’s universal sovereignty was more important than the vindicating of any individual man. In the giving of its advice, like young Elihu of Job’s day, the historically youthful governing group showed more of a youthful reliance upon the spirit of God in rendering spiritual counsel than in looking to age-old human wisdom and philosophy as the clergy were doing. For this reason the modern Elihu through <em>The Watchtower</em> could further take the lead in exposing the 1,600-year-old “man of lawlessness” class, the sectarian clergy. With Christian boldness since 1919 <em>The Watchtower</em> could maintain with a right estimation that Christendom’s clergy have “proceeded to pronounce God wicked” by their agelong preaching of things that were based on anti-Jehovah, Babylonish teachings. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966682/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Job 32:3</a>) In this way a right assessment and the correct estimation of religious developments become progressively available to all righteously inclined individuals by means of <em>The Watchtower.</em></p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="ss"><strong>JOB-LIKE TESTING</strong></p><p id="p72" data-pid="72" class="qu">17.

A period of Babylon-like captivity came to be forced upon them. Ridicule was heaped upon them by the clergy. During World War I they were slanderously branded as “security risks.” This brought governmental opposition <span id="page559" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="559" data-before-text="559"></span>upon them in Canada, the United States and other countries. Their publications became subject to ban. Those taking the lead among them came to be imprisoned. Finally their organized public witness work was crippled by the summer of 1918. Their headquarters in Brooklyn, New York, had to be shut down, with temporary offices maintained back in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Places of their religious meetings were raided and closed. Yes, a spiritually destitute, forsaken condition came upon them. To the faithful anointed ones questions came as to what all this meant and why Jehovah was permitting all this open hostility. Had they not in the name of God and Christ been undertaking a great public witness work among the nations in the thirty-some years before 1914? Did not Jehovah seem to favor that work by granting it continued growth before 1914? The Job-like ones wanted to know: Why now all this adversity and hostility?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966682/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Matt. 24:9, 10</a>.</p><p id="p73" data-pid="73" class="qu">18.

This restoration has meant great spiritual prosperity and happiness for them in Jehovah’s royal Kingdom service. To add to their joy, a vast crowd of sheeplike persons has been directed to flee from Babylon the Great and to come over into their realm of spiritual favor. Actually in 1934 the “other sheep” were told to get dedicated and baptized and to become the happy spiritual children of the anointed remnant.<a id="footnotesource10" data-fnid="10" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966682/9">j</a> But it was not until 1942 that the fulfillment in complete force of the bringing forth of Job’s ten new children <span id="page560" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="560" data-before-text="560"></span>began to take place.<a id="footnotesource11" data-fnid="11" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966682/10">k</a> From then on by the hundreds of thousands the figurative “ten children” have come to the aid of the modern Job, the anointed remnant.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966682/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Isa. 2:2, 3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966682/35/1" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> Zech. 8:23</a>.</p>

<strong>Championing Jehovah’s Godship in Spite of Babylonish Hostility</strong><br/><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="ss"><span id="page528" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="528" data-before-text="528"></span><strong>JOB LOOKS INWARD</strong></p><p id="p73" data-pid="73" class="qu">22. How was Job forced to look upon himself, and what did he say?</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[73]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> So by these three lengthy rounds of arguments of materialistic philosophy this unholy trio force Job to defend himself personally and to look inward upon himself to keep declaring his own soul righteous rather than extolling the rightness of the true God in conducting this case as to His Sovereign Godship. Deep down in Job’s heart this jabbing, testing process occurred, with questions and answers flowing from him. “If I have sinned, what can I accomplish against you, the Observer of mankind? Why is it that you have set me as your target, so that I should become a burden to you?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/70/0" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Job 7:20</a>) “I myself well know that my redeemer is alive.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/71/0" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Job 19:25</a>) “O that I had someone listening to me, that according to my signature the Almighty himself would answer me!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/72/0" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Job 31:35</a>) Yes, by means of this long duel under the permitted hand of Satan through his earthly dupes, Job was tested to the very core of his heart, yet his heart proved to be true, clean, full of hope and trusting in God.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="ss"><strong>ELIHU’S ASSESSMENT</strong></p><p id="p74" data-pid="74" class="qu">23. (a) What was Elihu’s assessment of the lengthy religious controversy? (b) How did Jehovah step in, and what was Job’s reaction?</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" data-rel-pid="[74]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> Finally the neutral watcher, Elihu, spoke up and presented the right assessment as to the true and false schools of wisdom that had concluded their arguments. “Against Job his anger blazed over his declaring his own soul righteous rather than God. Also, against his three companions his anger blazed over the fact that they had not found an answer but they proceeded to pronounce God wicked.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/73/0" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Job 32:2, 3</a>) So on the issue of Godship the three false comforters proved to have utterly failed, whereas Job had become sidetracked upon himself although never failing in his integrity to the true God. Then the drama ends with the tremendous display of wisdom from the true God by his speaking out of the windstorm. There Jehovah demonstrated his overwhelming Godship by referring to creation’s marvels and to natural things pertaining to the earth far too wonderful to be grasped by the mind of mortal man. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/74/0" data-bid="75-1" class="b">Job, chapters 38-41</a>) To this amazing shower of heavenly wisdom, Job’s clean heart quickly responds: “I have come to know that you are able to do all things, and there is no idea that is unattainable for you. That is why I make a retraction, and I do repent in dust and ashes.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/75/0" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Job 42:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/75/1" data-bid="76-2" class="b"> 6</a>.</p><p id="p75" data-pid="75" class="qu">24, 25.

And now take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job, and you men must offer up a burnt sacrifice in your own behalf; and Job my servant will himself pray for you. His face only I shall accept so as not to commit disgraceful folly with you, for you have not spoken concerning me what is <em>truthful,</em> as has my servant Job.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/76/0" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Job 42:7, 8</a>) Thus the apostate religion of these Babylonized wise men became exposed by Jehovah himself, twice declaring them as ‘not truthful.’ Their so-called wisdom turned out to be foolishness. Satan miserably lost the contest resulting from his challenge. The three “companions” had to make a climb-down, reform themselves and submit their lives to the priesthood services of Job by accepting the true religion. As to Job personally, “Jehovah himself turned back the captive condition of Job” and blessed him with twice the material wealth <span id="page529" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="529" data-before-text="529"></span>he had lost at the beginning. As to his family, he came to have seven sons and three beautiful daughters even in the old age of himself and that of his aged wife.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/77/0" data-bid="78-1" class="b">Job 42:10-15</a>.</p>

Before speaking up in Job’s day, Elihu was filled with the spirit of Jehovah God.

They proved God to be true and that Jesus was the Christ, exalted to heaven.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966644/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Acts 2:22-37</a>.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" data-rel-pid="[100]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="29"><sup>29</sup></span> Another parallel noted is that in Job’s day Jehovah’s voice spoke out of the storm wind whereas in Jesus’ day Jehovah’s voice was heard three times directly from heaven, three being indicative of emphasis, confirming his approval of Jesus as his official representative.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966644/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Matt. 3:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966644/52/1" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> 17:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966644/52/2" data-bid="53-3" class="b"> John 12:28</a>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="ss"><strong>HOSTILITY CLIMAXED—RESTORATION</strong></p><p id="p101" data-pid="101" class="qu">30.

But even to his dying moment on the torture stake outside Jerusalem, Jesus, like Job, “did not sin or ascribe anything improper to God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966644/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Job 1:22</a>) His lips and his heart were sinless when he said: “Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit,” and then: “It has been accomplished,” and finally he expired.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966644/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Luke 23:46;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966644/55/1" data-bid="56-2" class="b"> John 19:30</a>.</p><p id="p102" data-pid="102" class="qu">31, 32.

Only when ‘the words of Job had come to an end’ did Elihu, with due modesty, speak up. “Young I am in days and you men are aged,” he said. “That is why I drew back and was afraid to declare my knowledge to you men.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983162/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 31:40;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983162/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 32:4-7</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">How much more effective and weighty Elihu’s words were because he waited until those older men had their say! Elihu apparently had the key to the problem, whereas they had made it apparent that they did not understand what was involved. And what was involved? The issue of the rightfulness of Jehovah God’s sovereignty and whether He could have people on earth that would prove faithful to Him regardless of what they had to suffer.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983162/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 1:7–2:10</a>.</p>

In this Job pictured the modern-day witnesses of Jehovah, who in a time of testing A.D. 1918 hesitated for a brief season to witness boldly and uncompromisingly in vindication of Jehovah’s great name.

Just as his name means “God is he,” so he was urgent in speaking for God’s vindication. “Look, please! I have to open my mouth; my tongue with my palate has to speak. My sayings are the uprightness of my heart, and knowledge is what my lips do utter sincerely.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961603/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 32:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961603/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 33:2, 3</a>) In prophetic fulfillment, Elihu pictures the governing body in Jehovah’s New World society on earth today.

<strong>The Art of Public Bible Speaking</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Do not overlook the fact that when it comes to illustrations, none are more apt and forceful than those found in the Bible. <span id="page123" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="123" data-before-text="123"></span>Jesus made frequent use of these; so should his modern imitators. Thus also the disciple James in his letter illustrated the points he was making by references to Abraham, Rahab, Job and Elijah. Yes, all “these things went on befalling them as examples and they were written for a warning to us upon whom the accomplished ends of the systems of things have arrived.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961126/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:11</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong>SPEAK WITH ELOQUENCE—FROM THE HEART!</strong></p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Without doubt Jesus was the most eloquent speaker that men ever heard upon this earth. No wonder those police officers sent to arrest Jesus came back without him! This, our final aspect of public Bible speaking to be considered here, requires the utmost in earnestness and sincerity. It makes no allowance for telling jokes or silly stories or otherwise injecting humor merely to get a laugh. The purpose of public Bible speaking is to instruct and build up. As has well been said, Paul ‘did not stoop to conquer with jocular exploit those whom truth and soberness assailed in vain,’ and neither should any of those who would imitate him even as he imitated Christ.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961126/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:1</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Earnestness, conviction, confidence, warmth, feeling and enthusiasm are the very heart of all good Bible speaking. Apollos “was aglow with the spirit,” with enthusiasm. He spoke “with intensity,” and therefore was well described as “an eloquent man.” In fact, all Christians should “be aglow with the spirit,” but especially the public Bible speaker.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961126/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 18:24, 25,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961126/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961126/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Rom. 12:11</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Call to mind how you were stirred at a recent district assembly or at one of the great international assemblies. Why do we like to have tape recordings of those talks and listen to them time and again? Not only because of what was said and who said it, but because of the fire, the enthusiasm, the eloquence manifested. What the speakers had clearly imbedded in their minds they gave out of hearts full of love and appreciation. They felt—and so should we—like Elihu: “I shall declare my knowledge, . . . for I have become full of words . . . Let me speak that it may be a relief to me. I shall open my lips that I may answer.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961126/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 32:17-20</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Surely if anyone has reason for speaking with a full heart, for speaking with earnestness, conviction, confidence, warmth, feeling and enthusiasm, it is the Christian public Bible speaker, who speaks out of love for God and his neighbor and who has such an important and urgent message to give in this evil day. If any work deserves to be done “with sincerity of heart,” and “whole-souled as to Jehovah,” it is public Bible speaking.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961126/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Col. 3:22, 23</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">No question about it, public Bible speaking involves much, and in all its facets Jesus Christ set the perfect example. The speaker must hold the interest of the stranger as well as of the fellow Christian; he must be accurate and give the Bible the chief place; he must keep the negative aspects subordinated to the positive while exercising care not to crowd his talk with too much material. He should make generous yet judicious use of illustrations and, above all, speak from a heart full of love, for Jehovah, for his audience and for his subject. Doing so, he will surely bring honor to Jehovah’s name and build up his listeners as well as himself. And recognizing the high standard Jesus set for him, he will ever keep modest and humble.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sd">As apples of gold in silver carvings is a word spoken at the right time for it.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961126/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Prov. 25:11</a>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Is It Right to Call Men by Titles?</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">DIRECTING his words primarily to suffering Job, the young man Elihu said: “Let me not, please, show partiality to a man; and on an earthling man I shall not bestow a title; for I certainly do not know how I can bestow a title; easily my Maker would carry me away.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101977529/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 32:21, 22</a>) Are we to conclude from this that it is wrong to use titles when addressing men? Or, is the use of titles appropriate under certain circumstances?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It should be noted that Elihu associated the bestowing of a title with the showing of partiality. In his comments to Job, therefore, he did not resort to any form of flattery. Nor did he permit the person of the afflicted Job to sway what he said. Elihu observed the principle of the Law that was later given to Israel: “As for the lowly one, you must not show preference in a controversy of his.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101977529/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ex. 23:3</a>) Also, though young, Elihu did not side with Job’s companions out of regard for their age and position. He presented matters as they really were, not flattering Job’s companions by bestowing a title upon them and then allowing this to influence his speech.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Elihu’s example well illustrates that it would be wrong to originate flattering titles. Such partial treatment results in acting unjustly and incurs God’s disfavor. Elihu recognized this, as is evident from his words: “Easily my Maker would carry me away,” that is, in his wrath.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101977529/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 32:22</a>.</p>

<strong>Conscience and Subjection to Authorities</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[72]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> In saying, “to him who calls for the tribute, the tribute,” Paul does not mean paying verbal tribute or making ascriptions of praise. He means paying something material, financial. The tribute meant was an impost or tax, properly on goods or merchandise. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 17:24-27</a>) This tribute, like the above tax, has no place inside the Christian congregation, but is associated with worldly “superior authorities.” In some lands those authorities do not call for taxes to be paid on congregational or church property but grant exemption to religious organizations of all denominations. It is the privilege of the congregation to take advantage of this provision so as to use all its funds in religious directions. Of course, some worldly groups look upon exemption of churches from taxation <span id="page718" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="718" data-before-text="718"></span>as a form of union of Church and State. But if, in this case, the Christian congregation does not pay taxes on its religious property that is not for commercial uses, it does not violate the apostle Paul’s command. Individually, however, the members of the congregation do have to pay personal tax or tribute on their own properties and goods.</p><p id="p73" data-pid="73" class="qu">21, 22. (a) Does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Romans 13:7</a> call for “fear” of public servants? (b) What kind of fear is this, and to what extent does it go for Christians?</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[73]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> From things owed of a material or financial kind, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Romans 13:7</a> now turns to things of a psychological kind, saying: “To him who calls for fear, such fear.” Does this mean fear of public servants of this world? Yes; for, as verse three says, “those ruling are an object of fear” to bad deeds, and verse four says that if anyone does evil or bad he should be afraid or be in fear.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[73]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> So the fear that we have toward such rulers or public servants is the fear to do evil for which we should incur their wrath or vengeance. We show fear toward them by not doing what is wrong and by being law-abiding subjects or citizens. If fear is to be shown to slaveowners and to husbands and to judges, police and public investigators, then why not to political rulers? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 3:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 3:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/14/3" data-bid="15-4" class="b"> Eph. 5:33</a>) This is not a cowardly fear that would keep us from preaching God’s kingdom, but is a proper regard or a healthy respect for the executional powers that a political authority may have. We have a fear to the extent that their official powers may reach or extend. Outside the area of their powers we do not have to fear them. The limit to which they can go with their powers is to the realm of this life, in this doomed system of things.</p><p id="p74" data-pid="74" class="qu">23. Why does such fear of public servants not take away from our fear of Jehovah with an undivided heart?</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[74]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> So this does not take away from our fearing God with an undivided heart. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 86:11</a>) We have to fear him in far more respects than the respects in which we are to fear the “superior authorities” that God lets exist for a time. In fact, in rendering our relative subjection to them we are really doing it as to God, for this is according to his arrangement. We want to live forever in his new world, where he will not permit the present superior authorities to exist. So we do not want to displease God, for he can cut us off from eternal life in that new world by destroying our souls and refusing us a resurrection from the dead.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 10:28</a>.</p><p id="p75" data-pid="75" class="qu">24. Why is honor owing to public officials, and how did Paul set an example?</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[75]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> Besides fear, something else is also owing. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Romans 13:7</a> says: “To him who calls for honor, such honor.” This honor rendered to public officials is not because of the persons themselves. It is because of what they represent in a public sense. A king represents a nation or an empire; a governor represents a state or province; a mayor, a city. This obligation to render honor where due allows us to address political officials by their titles, and it does not conflict with what the young man Elihu said in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Job 32:21, 22</a>. When before Governor Felix, Governor Festus and King Herod Agrippa II, the apostle Paul rendered them proper honor, either addressing them by their titles or acknowledging good rulership by them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Acts 24:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 26:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/19/2" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 24-29</a>.</p><p id="p76" data-pid="76" class="qu">25. What kind of honor is it that we render to “superior authorities,” and how is honor shown to compare with fear as to weight?</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[76]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"><sup>25</sup></span> It is merely a relative honor that we pay to “superior authorities.” Who wants to be only feared, viewed with dread? They do not. But fear carries more weight than a desire to honor does. The relative weight of fear and honor finds an illustration in what is commanded in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:17</a>: ‘Fear God, honor the king.’ A Christian husband gives honor to his wife as to a weaker vessel, the feminine one; but the wife is under apostolic command to give fear to her husband <span id="page719" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="719" data-before-text="719"></span>as to her head and lord. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 5, 6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/21/2" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> Eph. 5:33</a>) The children must honor their father and mother. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Eph. 6:1-3</a>) The Christian congregation is to honor worthy widows, by making a deserved provision for them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Tim. 5:3</a>) Thus we cannot sidestep rendering honor to those outside or inside the Christian congregation.</p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The <em>King James Version</em> was translated at the express command of King James of England by men who belonged to the Church of England and in which there were officers known as “bishops” and “deacons.” So instead of translating the Greek words <em>epískopos</em> and <em>diákonos</em> according to what they literally mean, <span id="page384" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="384" data-before-text="384"></span>the <em>King James Version</em> translators rendered them as titles.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">However, the <em>New World Translation</em> as well as certain others, such as <em>An American Translation,</em> do not render <em>epískopos</em> and <em>diákonos</em> as titles but according to the meaning of the words, as “overseers” or “superintendents” and as “assistants” or “ministerial servants.” The <em>American Standard Version</em> gives in the footnote the alternate reading of “overseer” in each instance where “bishop” is used in the text. Avoiding such man-made titles is in harmony with the sentiments expressed by faithful Elihu: “Let me not, please, show partiality to a man; and on an earthling man I shall not bestow a title; for I certainly do not know how I can bestow a title; easily my Maker would carry me away.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962446/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 32:21, 22</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"></p>

<strong>“Man” in the Hebrew Scriptures</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Even as <em>adám</em> sets man apart from the lower animals, so it also calls attention to <span id="page58" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="58" data-before-text="58"></span>man’s inferiority to the Creator, Jehovah God. Thus Moses was told that no human could see God and live. Samuel was reminded that a human can see only the outside, but God can see the heart. David prayed that he might not fall into human hands but into God’s hands, for having numbered the fighting men of his nation presumptuously. The temple of Solomon, David said, was to be built, not for humans, but for God. Jehoshaphat counseled the judges to remember that they were judging, not for humans, but for God. Elihu refused to give flattering titles to mere humans.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ex. 33:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 1 Sam. 16:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 1 Chron. 21:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/3" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 29:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/4" data-bid="11-5" class="b"> 2 Chron. 19:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/5" data-bid="11-6" class="b"> Job 32:21</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The psalmist twice asked why the great Creator should take note of mere humans; also, he said that, though certain ones were “gods,” they would die like earthling man. The fear of humans brings a snare, but he that trusts in Jehovah will be safe. Why go down to Egypt for help? The Egyptians are not spirits but mere humans, earthlings. And to highlight the seriousness of the selfishness of the priests in Malachi’s day, God asked: “Will earthling man rob God?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 8:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 144:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 82:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/3" data-bid="12-4" class="b"> Prov. 29:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/4" data-bid="12-5" class="b"> Isa. 31:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/5" data-bid="12-6" class="b"> Mal. 3:8</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>“ENÓSH”</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The thought behind <em>enósh,</em> weak or mortal, shows, for one thing, that the Hebrew Scripture writers had no illusions about man’s being immortal. How could they, since they received their “theology,” not from pagan sources, but from God himself, who made plain man’s mortal nature both by warning him of death in the event he sinned and by sentencing him, after he had sinned, to return to the dust from which man had been taken.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. 2:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 3:19</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><em>Enósh</em> always has an unfavorable connotation and, therefore, is never used in a complimentary sense. Fittingly, it is frequently coupled with <em>adám,</em> human, when man is contrasted with his immortal Maker, Jehovah God. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalms 8:4 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Ps 144:3</a> are typical of this coupling of <em>enósh</em> with <em>adám</em> when contrasting man with God. Thus also Moses wrote: “You make mortal man [<em>enósh</em>] go back to crushed matter, and you say: ‘Go back, you sons of men [<em>adám</em>].’” Because of the wickedness of man God warned that he would make <em>‘enósh</em> scarcer than refined gold and <em>adám</em> scarcer than the gold of Ophir.’ Putting both <em>enósh</em> and <em>adám</em> in their places are the words of Jehovah to Isaiah: “I myself am the One that is comforting you people. Who are you that you should be afraid of a mortal man [<em>enósh</em>] that will die, and of a son of mankind [<em>adám</em>] that will be rendered as mere green grass? And that you should forget Jehovah your Maker, the One stretching out the heavens and laying the foundation of the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 90:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Isa. 13:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 51:12, 13</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Particularly in the book of Job, which features God’s sovereignty in contrast to man’s puniness, is <em>enósh</em> a favorite term when making this point: “How can mortal man be in the right in a case with God?” “What is mortal man that you should rear him, and that you should set your heart upon him?” “Do you [Jehovah] have eyes of flesh, or is it as a mortal man sees that you see? Are your days like the days of mortal man, or your years just like the days of an able-bodied man?” “As one trifles with mortal man will you trifle with [God]? “ “God is much more than mortal man.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Job 9:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 7:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/2" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 10:4, 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/3" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> 13:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/4" data-bid="16-5" class="b"> 33:12</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">From his prayers we can see that David had a like keen appreciation: “Do arise, O Jehovah!

In his comments to Job, therefore, he did not resort to any form of flattery. Nor did he permit the person of the afflicted Job to sway what he said. Elihu observed the principle of the Law that was later given to Israel: “As for the lowly one, you must not show preference in a controversy of his.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101977529/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ex. 23:3</a>) Also, though young, Elihu did not side with Job’s companions out of regard for their age and position. He presented matters as they really were, not flattering Job’s companions by bestowing a title upon them and then allowing this to influence his speech.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Elihu’s example well illustrates that it would be wrong to originate flattering titles. Such partial treatment results in acting unjustly and incurs God’s disfavor. Elihu recognized this, as is evident from his words: “Easily my Maker would carry me away,” that is, in his wrath.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101977529/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 32:22</a>.</p>

<strong>Conscience and Subjection to Authorities</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[72]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> In saying, “to him who calls for the tribute, the tribute,” Paul does not mean paying verbal tribute or making ascriptions of praise. He means paying something material, financial. The tribute meant was an impost or tax, properly on goods or merchandise. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 17:24-27</a>) This tribute, like the above tax, has no place inside the Christian congregation, but is associated with worldly “superior authorities.” In some lands those authorities do not call for taxes to be paid on congregational or church property but grant exemption to religious organizations of all denominations. It is the privilege of the congregation to take advantage of this provision so as to use all its funds in religious directions. Of course, some worldly groups look upon exemption of churches from taxation <span id="page718" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="718" data-before-text="718"></span>as a form of union of Church and State. But if, in this case, the Christian congregation does not pay taxes on its religious property that is not for commercial uses, it does not violate the apostle Paul’s command. Individually, however, the members of the congregation do have to pay personal tax or tribute on their own properties and goods.</p><p id="p73" data-pid="73" class="qu">21, 22. (a) Does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Romans 13:7</a> call for “fear” of public servants? (b) What kind of fear is this, and to what extent does it go for Christians?</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[73]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> From things owed of a material or financial kind, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Romans 13:7</a> now turns to things of a psychological kind, saying: “To him who calls for fear, such fear.” Does this mean fear of public servants of this world? Yes; for, as verse three says, “those ruling are an object of fear” to bad deeds, and verse four says that if anyone does evil or bad he should be afraid or be in fear.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[73]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> So the fear that we have toward such rulers or public servants is the fear to do evil for which we should incur their wrath or vengeance. We show fear toward them by not doing what is wrong and by being law-abiding subjects or citizens. If fear is to be shown to slaveowners and to husbands and to judges, police and public investigators, then why not to political rulers? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 3:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 3:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/14/3" data-bid="15-4" class="b"> Eph. 5:33</a>) This is not a cowardly fear that would keep us from preaching God’s kingdom, but is a proper regard or a healthy respect for the executional powers that a political authority may have. We have a fear to the extent that their official powers may reach or extend. Outside the area of their powers we do not have to fear them. The limit to which they can go with their powers is to the realm of this life, in this doomed system of things.</p><p id="p74" data-pid="74" class="qu">23. Why does such fear of public servants not take away from our fear of Jehovah with an undivided heart?</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[74]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> So this does not take away from our fearing God with an undivided heart. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 86:11</a>) We have to fear him in far more respects than the respects in which we are to fear the “superior authorities” that God lets exist for a time. In fact, in rendering our relative subjection to them we are really doing it as to God, for this is according to his arrangement. We want to live forever in his new world, where he will not permit the present superior authorities to exist. So we do not want to displease God, for he can cut us off from eternal life in that new world by destroying our souls and refusing us a resurrection from the dead.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 10:28</a>.</p><p id="p75" data-pid="75" class="qu">24. Why is honor owing to public officials, and how did Paul set an example?</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[75]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> Besides fear, something else is also owing. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Romans 13:7</a> says: “To him who calls for honor, such honor.” This honor rendered to public officials is not because of the persons themselves. It is because of what they represent in a public sense. A king represents a nation or an empire; a governor represents a state or province; a mayor, a city. This obligation to render honor where due allows us to address political officials by their titles, and it does not conflict with what the young man Elihu said in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Job 32:21, 22</a>. When before Governor Felix, Governor Festus and King Herod Agrippa II, the apostle Paul rendered them proper honor, either addressing them by their titles or acknowledging good rulership by them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Acts 24:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 26:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/19/2" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 24-29</a>.</p><p id="p76" data-pid="76" class="qu">25. What kind of honor is it that we render to “superior authorities,” and how is honor shown to compare with fear as to weight?</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[76]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"><sup>25</sup></span> It is merely a relative honor that we pay to “superior authorities.” Who wants to be only feared, viewed with dread? They do not. But fear carries more weight than a desire to honor does. The relative weight of fear and honor finds an illustration in what is commanded in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962882/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:17</a>: ‘Fear God, honor the king.’ A Christian husband gives honor to his wife as to a weaker vessel, the feminine one; but the wife is under apostolic command to give fear to her husband <span id="page719" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="719" data-before-text="719"></span>as to her head and lord.

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The <em>King James Version</em> was translated at the express command of King James of England by men who belonged to the Church of England and in which there were officers known as “bishops” and “deacons.” So instead of translating the Greek words <em>epískopos</em> and <em>diákonos</em> according to what they literally mean, <span id="page384" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="384" data-before-text="384"></span>the <em>King James Version</em> translators rendered them as titles.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">However, the <em>New World Translation</em> as well as certain others, such as <em>An American Translation,</em> do not render <em>epískopos</em> and <em>diákonos</em> as titles but according to the meaning of the words, as “overseers” or “superintendents” and as “assistants” or “ministerial servants.” The <em>American Standard Version</em> gives in the footnote the alternate reading of “overseer” in each instance where “bishop” is used in the text. Avoiding such man-made titles is in harmony with the sentiments expressed by faithful Elihu: “Let me not, please, show partiality to a man; and on an earthling man I shall not bestow a title; for I certainly do not know how I can bestow a title; easily my Maker would carry me away.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962446/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 32:21, 22</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"></p>

For instance, one of the youths mentioned in paragraph 2 admitted: “To keep peace, we began saying what we knew our parents wanted to hear, but we kept our real feelings inside us.” These teenagers sought help. They were urged by an elder to approach their parents and to imitate the youth Elihu, who said: “I talk straight from my heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986806/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Job 33:3</a>, <em>Beck</em>) After fervently praying, they finally bared their hearts to their parents, explaining their bitter feelings.

<strong>Understanding What the Spirit Is</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Sometimes the word spirit indicates a person’s mental disposition. This is something that cannot be seen, but it manifests itself in a visible way by a person’s expressions or actions. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 34:18</a>, mental disposition is clearly indicated by the word spirit: “Jehovah is near to those that are broken at heart; and those who are crushed in spirit he saves.” As a rock is crushed with a hammer so does a repentant person feel crushed when God’s Word brings home to him the gravity of his sins. He humbly seeks forgiveness as did the people who were “stabbed to the heart” with guilt feelings from what Peter said to them at Pentecost. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 2:37</a>) So “crushed in spirit” indicates the mental disposition of a person who has become <span id="page503" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="503" data-before-text="503"></span>conscious of his sins and of his spiritual need.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Anger is a mental disposition that is, at times, indicated by the word “spirit.” At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Judges 9:23</a> this disposition is referred to by the expression “a bad spirit.” It was used with regard to the bad feelings that arose between Abimelech and the landowners of Shechem. This same disposition of anger is expressed at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 10:4</a> as “the spirit of a ruler” that rises up against a person. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Proverbs 25:28</a> it is indicated by saying: “As a city broken through, without a wall, is the man that has no restraint for his spirit.” Such is the man who fails to control his anger.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">An entirely different meaning for the word “spirit” is encountered in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Timothy 4:1</a>. There it conveys the thought of an inspired expression or utterance. The same is true at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Thessalonians 2:2</a>, where the Greek word <em>pneuʹma</em> appears and is translated as spirit by some Bible versions. Christians are told, Do not be “quickly shaken from your mind, nor yet be troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by epistle as from us.” (<em>AS</em>) The phrase “inspired expression” properly conveys the thought of the word “spirit” here and is so used in the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.</em></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The invisible energizing force that Jehovah God puts into action to accomplish his will can be referred to as his holy spirit. It is this force, active in the work of creation, that <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Genesis 1:2</a> has reference to when it says: “The Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.” (<em>AS</em>) The same is true at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 33:4</a>: “God’s own spirit made me.” It was his powerful force in action that did the work. Saying that it did the work of creating, although God is the Creator, is similar to saying that electricity lifts an elevator, although a motor does the actual work.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Miracles performed by Jesus Christ while he was on earth were done by God’s spirit, his active force. “If it is by means of God’s spirit that I expel the demons, the kingdom of God has really overtaken you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matt. 12:28</a>) It was this same active force that gave Samson the strength to perform astonishing deeds such as the slaying of a thousand men with the jawbone of an ass and the carrying away of the gates of a city. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Judg. 15:14, 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 16:3</a>) By means of it other men, such as the father of John the Baptist, were moved to prophesy. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Luke 1:67</a>) It enveloped 120 disciples of Jesus Christ at Pentecost and made it possible for them to speak with different tongues, heal the sick and raise the dead. God’s spirit was poured out upon them in this fashion, he baptizing them in it. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Acts 2:17</a>) Thus the word “spirit” frequently is used to refer to the mighty invisible active force of God when it is in operation, accomplishing his will.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">As we have seen, the word “spirit” has at least seven distinct meanings. It is used to refer to Jehovah God, to Jesus Christ, to angels, to life force in earthly creatures, to mental disposition, to inspired expressions and to God’s active force. Having these meanings in mind as you read the Scriptures will help you to read with understanding. The wisdom brought by a careful study of God’s Word opens before you a road that leads to many privileges in serving the Creator and ultimately to everlasting life.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matt. 7:14</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sd">We received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that have been kindly given us by God. These things we also speak, not with words taught by human wisdom, but with those taught by the spirit, as we combine spiritual matters with spiritual words.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Cor. 2:12, 13</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"></p>

Do you find keen delight in breathing the fresh air of a woodland or in zipping down a snow-covered mountainside on skis? Are you thrilled at the sight of awe-inspiring scenery? Are you enraptured by the strains of beautiful music? Whatever it is that brings pleasure and delight to you can be enjoyed only because you have life. Without it you could enjoy none of the things that are dear to you. It is your most valuable and, possibly, least appreciated possession.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Because life is commonplace and you have possessed it for many years is no reason to think little of it and put it in jeopardy for the momentary thrill of doing something dangerous. The thrill you may gain is not equal to what you may lose. The same can be said about foolish efforts to rescue a material possession from destruction at the risk of your life. Your life is not like a piece of machinery that can be replaced when it is damaged and ceases to function. It is more valuable than any thrill you could have or any material possession. As far as human efforts are concerned, it is irreplaceable.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">You do not possess life because you earned it or because you were entitled to it. Your parents did not originate it, although they were responsible for your being born. They merely passed on to you the life force that was given to mankind a long time ago. Life is a gift from God. It is because of his free gift that you have a conscious existence today. Acknowledging Jehovah as man’s Life-giver, a Bible writer said: “He himself gives to all persons life and breath and all things. And he made out of one man every nation of men, to dwell upon the entire surface of the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961280/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 17:25, 26</a>) Consider also what Elihu stated: “God’s own spirit made me, and the Almighty’s own breath proceeded to bring me to life.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961280/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 33:4</a>) These men were not ashamed to acknowledge God as the One who gave them life; are you?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">When someone gives you a valuable gift, do you accept it without expressing gratitude for it? Do you later deny before others that he gave it to you? While you may not be such an ingrate regarding gifts from your friends, what about gifts from God? Do you ever express gratitude for them? Do you ever thank him for the <span id="page228" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="228" data-before-text="228"></span>privilege of living and being able to learn about him and the magnificent things he has made? Are you so busy living that you have no time to appreciate your Life-giver and his gifts? Little effort is required on your part to express in prayer your sincere gratitude.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204407/656/0"><em>The Watchtower,</em></a> ]</strong></p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204407/656/0">7/15/1963, pp. 434-436</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Giving Encouragement to Others</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> It is true that at times people are going to fall short or do things that are wrong, and the overseer is the one who must see that the situation is given proper attention. Is this the time to call the <span id="page435" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="435" data-before-text="435"></span>transgressor to account and give him a tongue-lashing? Is that necessary? Perhaps the wrong was unintentional. Note how the Scriptures say to handle the situation: “Brothers, even though a man takes some false step before he is aware of it, you who have spiritual qualifications try to restore such a man in a spirit of mildness, as you each keep an eye on yourself, for fear you also may be tempted.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963523/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Gal. 6:1</a>) The goal is to restore the one who has erred, not to whip him. This calls for a spirit of mildness. The result will be an upbuilding of the one who has erred.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">16. How did Elihu manifest the right viewpoint in counseling Job?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> In this connection, note how Elihu introduced his counsel to Job: “O Job, please hear my words, and to all my speaking do give ear. Look, Please! I have to open my mouth; my tongue with my palate has to speak. My sayings are the uprightness of my heart, and knowledge is what my lips do utter sincerely. . . . If you are able, make reply to me, array words before me; do take your station. Look! I am to the true God just what you are; from the clay I was shaped, I too. Look! No frightfulness in me will terrify you, and no pressure by me will be heavy upon you.” And then he went on to reason on the situation with Job. But note how Elihu approached the problem. He entreated Job. He made it clear that before God he did not feel at all superior to Job and that there was no cause for Job to be terrified at what he was going to say. What a fine way to handle the situation!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963523/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Job 33:1-7</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">17. What advice did the apostle Paul give Timothy on admonishing others, and how was the situation to be handled when a person was found to make a deliberate practice of sin?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> It is just such a manner that Paul recommended to Timothy when he said: “Do not severely criticize an older man. To the contrary, entreat him as a father, younger men as brothers, older women as mothers, younger women as sisters with all chasteness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963523/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Tim. 5:1, 2</a>) Yet when wrongdoers make a practice of sin and show no sincere repentance, what needs to be encouraged is right conduct, not the wrongdoer. When such willful transgression has been thoroughly proved, it is time to apply the counsel found later on in the same chapter, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963523/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Timothy 5:20</a>: “Reprove before all onlookers persons who practice sin, that the rest also may have fear.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963523/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Heb. 12:7-11</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL</strong></p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">18. (a) How many people actually influence the lives of others, so how should that influence be used? (b) When speaking about Christian overseers or to those who are desirous of enlarging their privileges of service, how can we be upbuilding, and what examples show the importance of this?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Whether in the home or elsewhere, whether one is a congregation overseer or not, there are opportunities for all to upbuild and encourage one another. Everyone influences those around him. He can build up or he can tear down; he can stimulate or he can create indifference. Whether he wants to or not, he has influence. Let that influence be for good. Such will be the case with our speech if we follow the fine counsel recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963523/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Colossians 3:8, 9</a>: “Put them all away from you, wrath, anger, injuriousness, abusive speech, and obscene talk out of your mouth. Do not be lying to one another.” If we have taken good things into our minds, if our hearts are filled with wholesome desires, what we speak will be upbuilding; for out of the heart’s abundance the mouth speaks. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963523/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Matt. 12:34, 35</a>) If our hearts are good, we will not speak disrespectfully or slightingly of Christian overseers or of counsel received through Jehovah’s organization, as did Diotrephes, but we will reckon to be “of double honor” those who are faithfully presiding over God’s congregation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963523/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">3 John 9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963523/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 5:17</a>) Nor will we speak discouragingly to those who are desirous of enlarging <span id="page436" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="436" data-before-text="436"></span>their privileges of service, perhaps taking up full-time pioneer service or moving out to some locality where the need for Kingdom ministers is great. We will not be like the faithless spies who discouraged the Israelites with defeatist reports so that they wanted to turn back to Egypt and not go on to the Promised Land. Rather, like faithful Joshua and Caleb, we will urge them to show courage by taking hold of the service privileges that are open to them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963523/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Num. 13:27–14:9</a>.</p>

Thus Moses was told that no human could see God and live. Samuel was reminded that a human can see only the outside, but God can see the heart. David prayed that he might not fall into human hands but into God’s hands, for having numbered the fighting men of his nation presumptuously. The temple of Solomon, David said, was to be built, not for humans, but for God. Jehoshaphat counseled the judges to remember that they were judging, not for humans, but for God. Elihu refused to give flattering titles to mere humans.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ex. 33:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 1 Sam. 16:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 1 Chron. 21:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/3" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 29:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/4" data-bid="11-5" class="b"> 2 Chron. 19:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/5" data-bid="11-6" class="b"> Job 32:21</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The psalmist twice asked why the great Creator should take note of mere humans; also, he said that, though certain ones were “gods,” they would die like earthling man. The fear of humans brings a snare, but he that trusts in Jehovah will be safe. Why go down to Egypt for help? The Egyptians are not spirits but mere humans, earthlings. And to highlight the seriousness of the selfishness of the priests in Malachi’s day, God asked: “Will earthling man rob God?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 8:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 144:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 82:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/3" data-bid="12-4" class="b"> Prov. 29:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/4" data-bid="12-5" class="b"> Isa. 31:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/5" data-bid="12-6" class="b"> Mal. 3:8</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>“ENÓSH”</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The thought behind <em>enósh,</em> weak or mortal, shows, for one thing, that the Hebrew Scripture writers had no illusions about man’s being immortal. How could they, since they received their “theology,” not from pagan sources, but from God himself, who made plain man’s mortal nature both by warning him of death in the event he sinned and by sentencing him, after he had sinned, to return to the dust from which man had been taken.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. 2:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 3:19</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><em>Enósh</em> always has an unfavorable connotation and, therefore, is never used in a complimentary sense. Fittingly, it is frequently coupled with <em>adám,</em> human, when man is contrasted with his immortal Maker, Jehovah God. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalms 8:4 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Ps 144:3</a> are typical of this coupling of <em>enósh</em> with <em>adám</em> when contrasting man with God. Thus also Moses wrote: “You make mortal man [<em>enósh</em>] go back to crushed matter, and you say: ‘Go back, you sons of men [<em>adám</em>].’” Because of the wickedness of man God warned that he would make <em>‘enósh</em> scarcer than refined gold and <em>adám</em> scarcer than the gold of Ophir.’ Putting both <em>enósh</em> and <em>adám</em> in their places are the words of Jehovah to Isaiah: “I myself am the One that is comforting you people. Who are you that you should be afraid of a mortal man [<em>enósh</em>] that will die, and of a son of mankind [<em>adám</em>] that will be rendered as mere green grass? And that you should forget Jehovah your Maker, the One stretching out the heavens and laying the foundation of the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 90:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Isa. 13:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 51:12, 13</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Particularly in the book of Job, which features God’s sovereignty in contrast to man’s puniness, is <em>enósh</em> a favorite term when making this point: “How can mortal man be in the right in a case with God?” “What is mortal man that you should rear him, and that you should set your heart upon him?” “Do you [Jehovah] have eyes of flesh, or is it as a mortal man sees that you see? Are your days like the days of mortal man, or your years just like the days of an able-bodied man?” “As one trifles with mortal man will you trifle with [God]? “ “God is much more than mortal man.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Job 9:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 7:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/2" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 10:4, 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/3" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> 13:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/4" data-bid="16-5" class="b"> 33:12</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">From his prayers we can see that David had a like keen appreciation: “Do arise, O Jehovah!

<strong>What Is This Thing Called “Soul”?</strong><br/><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">The text at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974065/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Job 33:22</a>, written in poetic style, provides a key to understanding these passages. There “soul” and “life” are placed in parallel, so that the two words could be interchanged without changing the sense of the passage. We read: “His <em>soul</em> draws near to the pit, and his <em>life</em> to those inflicting death.” From this parallel we can see that the word “soul” can mean life as a person and, therefore, the departure of the soul can be <span id="page43" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="43" data-before-text="43"></span>understood to refer to the end of life as a person.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb">To illustrate: A man might say that his dog ‘lost its life’ when it was hit by a truck. Does he mean that this animal’s life left the body and continued existing? No, he is simply using a figure of speech indicating that the animal died. The same is true when we speak of a man as ‘losing his life.’ We do not mean that his life exists independently of the body. Similarly, ‘to lose one’s soul’ means to ‘lose one’s life as a soul’ and carries no meaning of continued existence after death. Recognizing this, <em>The Interpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible</em> states:</p>

The great Master Jehovah has shown his favor upon his visible organization by blessing it with the equipment needed to accomplish its tremendous work under the modern circumstances of this perilous epoch.

Yet great ignorance persists as to its teaching. Sectarian confusion is bewildering as to its harmonious teaching. Jehovah’s Word is not of private human interpretation. He is his own Interpreter. He causes light to be shed on one Scripture text by others elsewhere in the Bible bearing on the same subject. He also brings to pass the fulfillment of Bible prophecies by definite events and then he calls the attention of his witnesses to such fulfillments in clarification of prophecy. He has appointed Christ Jesus the Head of his visible organization and his associate interpreter for the organization, “an interpreter, one among a thousand.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950522/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 33:23</a>) So Jehovah’s visible organization under Christ is a channel for bringing the divine interpretation of his Word to his devoted people. What then? An organizational instrument must be provided to help all lovers of truth and life to gain a progressive understanding of God’s Word and for freeing themselves from all the confusing, faith-destroying religious doctrines and creeds of Christendom. Such an educational instrument this journal <em>The Watchtower</em> was meant to be and has proved to be. Not fettered by any man-made religious creed, it has been free to advance in the truth as the divine Interpreter has led the way by Jesus Christ.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 9. How did the Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society develop?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Besides <em>The Watchtower</em> other spiritual food was provided through the pen of Brother Russell. This was regularly spread to all hungry ones by the then available means of distribution. To keep pace with Jehovah’s blessing upon the work Brother Russell organized the Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, at Pittsburgh, Pa., in 1881 (<em>The Watchtower,</em> April, 1881), and three years later, in 1884, this was incorporated under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania. This incorporated Society has since served as part of the equipment God provided for his people to do every kind of good work in both American and foreign fields. He has preserved it to this day. It now has its main offices at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 2, N. Y., but has its registered office still in Pittsburgh, Pa., where its annual meetings for transacting business and electing the Society’s directors are held as required by Pennsylvania law. It is merely an instrument, a legal and publishing servant, of Jehovah’s visible organization, his consecrated witnesses.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu">10. Who was its first president? What was its chartered purpose?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> This Pennsylvania corporation’s first president was Charles Taze Russell, and he was regularly elected to this office by the contributors to the Society till his death, October 31, 1916. The purpose of this legal corporation was well stated in the charter granted it on December 13, 1884: “The purpose for which the corporation is formed is, the dissemination of Bible truths in various languages by means of the publication of tracts, pamphlets, papers and other religious documents, and by the use of all other lawful means which its Board of Directors, duly constituted, shall deem expedient for the furtherance of the purpose stated.” The Christian purpose of the Society was harmonized more with developments and was stated in greater detail in an amendment adopted in 1944 and which altered the above article.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">11. Why is world-wide attention centered on the Brooklyn Society?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> The Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society today is at the heart of a visible organization that has Branches in 63 lands of the earth, besides financing missionary homes and supervising Kingdom-preaching activities in 104 lands. Hence the interest of hundreds of thousands of Bible Christians or witnesses of Jehovah throughout the earth centers upon what is going on at Society Headquarters. They appreciate the spiritual service that the legal Society is rendering them. Their prayers go up daily to the Most High God for his blessing upon it and its work. That is why we here take up a brief account of the Society’s development from its beginning, to show its growth and its use as an instrument of Jehovah God.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu">12.

The sixth of these was published in 1904 by Brother Russell, and the seventh was published in 1917, after his death. For many years, down to April, 1926, those <em>Studies in the Scriptures,</em> translated into many languages and reaching a circulation of millions of copies, served as the textbooks for weekly Bible study by many congregations in all the earth. It was with the first volume of such Scripture Studies that the <span id="page215" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="215" data-before-text="215"></span>house-to-house missionary work, first known as “colporteur work” but now called the “pioneer work”, was begun, in 1886.

<strong>When Old Ones Will Be Young Again</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">WHO of us welcomes the effects of old age​—wrinkled skin, poor eyesight, loss of hearing, and unsteady legs? You may wonder, ‘Why would God create us with the potential to enjoy the vigor of youth only to have us end up dreading the effects of old age?’ The good news is that this is not what God intended for us. Rather, he has lovingly purposed to release us from the aging process! Notice the words spoken to the patriarch Job, found at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011249/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 33:24, 25</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Consider the situation of Job, a loyal man whom Jehovah loved. Unknown to Job, Satan questioned Job’s integrity, saying that he served God only for selfish reasons. Jehovah, with confidence in Job and knowing His own power to undo harm, allowed Satan to test Job. Satan then “struck Job with a malignant boil from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011249/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 2:7</a>) Job’s flesh became covered with maggots, and his skin formed crusts, blackened, and dropped off. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011249/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 7:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011249/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 30:17,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011249/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 30</a>) Can you imagine his agony? Yet, Job remained faithful, saying: “Until I expire I shall not take away my integrity from myself!”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011249/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 27:5</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Job, however, did make a serious mistake. As he seemingly inched closer to death, he became overly concerned with vindicating himself, “declaring his own soul righteous rather than God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011249/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 32:2</a>) God’s spokesman Elihu reproved Job. But Elihu also conveyed to Job a positive message from God: “Let him [Job] off from going down into the pit [the common grave]! I have found a ransom! Let his flesh become fresher than in youth; let him return to the days of his youthful vigor.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011249/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 33:24, 25</a>) Those words must have filled Job with hope. He did not have to continue suffering right down to his death. If Job would repent, God would be pleased to accept a ransom in his behalf and set him free from his calamities.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2011249/0">a</a></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Job humbly accepted correction, and he repented. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011249/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 42:6</a>) Jehovah evidently accepted a ransom in Job’s behalf, allowing it to cover his error and open the way for God to restore and reward him. Jehovah “blessed the end of Job afterward more than his beginning.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011249/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 42:12-17</a>) Imagine Job’s relief when, among other blessings, his loathsome disease cleared up and his flesh, in effect, became “fresher than in youth”!</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The ransom that God accepted in Job’s behalf had limited value, for the man remained imperfect and later died. We have a much better ransom available to us. Jehovah lovingly gave his Son, Jesus, as a ransom for us. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011249/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matthew 20:28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011249/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> John 3:16</a>) All who put faith in that ransom have the prospect of living forever on a paradise earth. In that coming new world, God will release faithful humans from the aging process. Why not learn more about how you may live to see the time when old ones will see their “flesh become fresher than in youth”?</p>

Elihu says: “Then he [God] favors him and says, ‘Let him off from going down into the pit! I have found a ransom! Let his flesh become fresher than in youth; let him return to the days of his youthful vigor.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009601/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Job 33:23-26</a>) Those words indicated God’s willingness to accept “a ransom,” or “covering,” in behalf of repentant humans.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009601/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Job 33:24</a>, ftn.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">12.

Elihu’s words presented the wonderful prospect of everlasting life. The book of Job also shows that there will be a resurrection.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009601/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Job 14:14, 15</a>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">13.

Who was to be that ransom for Job?</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">There was no human ransom sacrifice offered for Job back then, but God did cover, or forgive, Job’s error.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Satan caused Job many troubles, including “a malignant boil from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.” Job’s state was so bad that his wife urged him to “curse God and die.” Even Job mused whether death was better than such suffering.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991131/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 2:7-9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991131/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 3:11</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">When it seemed that Job might die, Elihu assessed Job’s precarious situation and laid the basis for hope, saying: “His flesh wastes away from sight . . . And his soul draws near to the pit, and his life to those inflicting death. If there exists for him a messenger, a spokesman, one out of a thousand, to tell to man his uprightness, then he favors him and says, ‘Let him off from going down into the pit! I have found a ransom! Let his flesh become fresher than in youth.’”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991131/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 33:21-25</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">We know that Jesus Christ gave up his perfect human life as a corresponding ransom for imperfect humans. His sacrifice balanced what Adam had lost, paying the needed price to bring about release from sin. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991131/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Romans 5:12-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991131/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 Timothy 2:5, 6</a>) However, this is not the only use of “ransom” in the Bible. The Hebrew word found at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991131/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 33:24</a> basically means “cover.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991131/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Exodus 25:17</a>) When God was dealing with ancient Israel, he had an arrangement to cover, or atone for, sins​—sacrifices that covered sin, setting matters straight between humans and God.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991131/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Exodus 29:36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991131/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Leviticus 16:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991131/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 15, 16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991131/6/3" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> 17:11</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Earlier, though, God had been willing to accept sacrifices as expressions of thanks or of requests for forgiveness and approval. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991131/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Genesis 4:3, 4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991131/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 8:20, 21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991131/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 12:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991131/7/3" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> 31:54</a>) Job understood the value of such sacrifices. We read: “He got up early in the morning and offered up burnt sacrifices according to the number of all of [his sons]; for, said Job, ‘maybe my sons have sinned and have cursed God in their heart.’ That is the way Job would do always.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991131/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 1:5</a>) Since he tried to please God and obviously had a contrite spirit, his sacrifices had value in God’s sight.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991131/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 32:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991131/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 51:17</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">But Job later suffered sickness that seemed to threaten his life. He also had a wrong view of his righteousness, so he needed correction, which Elihu then provided. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991131/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 32:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991131/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 33:8-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991131/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 35:2-4</a>) Elihu said that Job need not continue in his sad condition right down to death and the pit (Sheol, or the common grave). If Job would repent, “a ransom” could be found.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991131/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Job 33:24-28</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">We need not think that by “ransom” Elihu meant a human back then who would die in Job’s behalf. In view of the sacrifices that true worshipers had been accustomed to offering, the sort of ransom to which Elihu was alluding in Job’s case might have been an animal sacrifice. Interestingly, God later told Job’s three critical companions: “You men must offer up a burnt sacrifice in your own behalf; and Job my servant will himself pray for you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991131/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Job 42:8</a>) Whatever the form of the ransom, Elihu’s main point was that Job could have his error covered and experience resulting benefits.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">That is what happened. Job ‘repented in dust and ashes.’ Then what? “Jehovah himself turned back the captive condition of Job . . . As for Jehovah, he blessed the end of Job afterward more than his beginning . . . And Job continued living after this a hundred and forty years and came to see his sons and his grandsons​—four generations.” Granted, that ransom did not free Job from sin, so in time he died. Yet, the prolonging of his life proves that, effectively, ‘his flesh became fresher than in youth, and he returned to the days of his youthful vigor.’​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991131/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Job 33:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991131/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 42:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991131/13/2" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 10-17</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Those blessings that came from applying a limited ransom to Job serve as a preview of the abundant blessings that will come to believing mankind in the new world. Then, the full benefit of Jesus’ ransom sacrifice will be available, removing forever the disastrous effects of sin and imperfection. What reason we will have for “joyful shouting,” as Elihu mentioned!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991131/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Job 33:26</a>.</p>

I have found a ransom! Let his flesh become fresher than in youth; let him return to the days of his youthful vigor.’ He will make supplication to God that he may take pleasure in him, and he will see his face with joyful shouting, and He will restore His righteousness to mortal man. He will sing to men and say: ‘I have sinned and what is upright I have perverted, and it certainly was not the proper thing for me. He has redeemed my soul from passing into the pit, and my life itself will see the light.’ Look! All these things God performs, two times, three times, in the case of an able-bodied man, to turn his soul back from the pit, that he may be enlightened with the light of those living.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Job 33:22-30</a>.</p><p id="p90" data-pid="90" class="qu">36.

In 1919 he spared them from going into spiritual death. How? By putting his spirit into them to enliven them again in his service, to be his Kingdom witnesses in this “time of the end.”</p><p id="p91" data-pid="91" class="qu">37. How did Elihu end his words in vindication of Jehovah, and what now shows whom Elihu prefigured in the drama of Job?</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" data-rel-pid="[91]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="37"><sup>37</sup></span> Confirmation is thereby given to the words of Elihu, who ended his words in vindication of Jehovah by saying: “As for the Almighty, we have not found him out; he is exalted in power, and justice and abundance of righteousness he will not belittle. Therefore let men fear him. He does not regard any who are wise in [their own] heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Job 37:23, 24</a>) Therefore as a character in the prophetic drama of Job, Elihu seems well to prefigure the spiritual governing body of the anointed remnant of Christ’s body. According to modern history since 1919 this governing body of the “faithful and discreet slave” class brought to the remnant as a whole the enlightening information concerning our vital need of integrity and the supreme issue, namely, the vindication of Jehovah’s universal sovereignty by his kingdom in the hands of Jesus Christ.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="ss"><strong>JEHOVAH’S ANSWER</strong></p><p id="p92" data-pid="92" class="qu">38.

He did. “And Jehovah proceeded to answer Job out of the windstorm and say: ‘Who is this that is obscuring counsel by words without knowledge?’” By what he now said and did to Job he proved that modern critics are wrong, and that he is the same Jehovah as Jehovah the God of the twelve tribes of Israel, and the same Jehovah whose witnesses we are privileged to be before all mankind in this great controversial “time of the end.” In lofty language that agrees with the creation account in the first book of the Bible, Genesis, Jehovah now showed he was above all faithless questions and false charges, for he had created heaven and earth, into the profound wonders of which Job, a mere recent arrival on earth, had not and could not have fully penetrated. Job had no control of the creation and Almighty God could care for his creation without Job’s help. Said Jehovah: “Should there be any contending of a faultfinder with the Almighty? Let the reprover of God himself answer it.” Deeply humiliated, Job confessed he had nothing to say toward his own justification. Jehovah then described the mighty behemoth and the limber leviathan, as creative marvels well known to man.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Job 38:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/42/1" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 40:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/42/2" data-bid="43-3" class="b"> 15</a> to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Job 41:34</a>, <em>margin</em>.</p>

<strong>How Long Can You Live?</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Since Jehovah God had declared that anyone disobeying him would pay the price for his sin by dying, Adam’s descendants appeared to be in a hopeless situation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102006163/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Genesis 2:17</a>) Nevertheless, the inspired Scriptures presented the hope that someone would pay for a release from the aging process. We read: “Let him off from going down into the pit! I have found a ransom! Let his flesh become fresher than in youth; let him return to the days of his youthful vigor.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102006163/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 33:24, 25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102006163/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Isaiah 53:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102006163/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 12</a>) The Bible here presented a wonderful prospect​—that of someone paying a ransom to effect a release from the process of aging!</p>

<strong>When Old Ones Will Be Young Again</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">WHO of us welcomes the effects of old age​—wrinkled skin, poor eyesight, loss of hearing, and unsteady legs? You may wonder, ‘Why would God create us with the potential to enjoy the vigor of youth only to have us end up dreading the effects of old age?’ The good news is that this is not what God intended for us. Rather, he has lovingly purposed to release us from the aging process! Notice the words spoken to the patriarch Job, found at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011249/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 33:24, 25</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Consider the situation of Job, a loyal man whom Jehovah loved. Unknown to Job, Satan questioned Job’s integrity, saying that he served God only for selfish reasons. Jehovah, with confidence in Job and knowing His own power to undo harm, allowed Satan to test Job. Satan then “struck Job with a malignant boil from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011249/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 2:7</a>) Job’s flesh became covered with maggots, and his skin formed crusts, blackened, and dropped off. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011249/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 7:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011249/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 30:17,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011249/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 30</a>) Can you imagine his agony? Yet, Job remained faithful, saying: “Until I expire I shall not take away my integrity from myself!”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011249/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 27:5</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Job, however, did make a serious mistake. As he seemingly inched closer to death, he became overly concerned with vindicating himself, “declaring his own soul righteous rather than God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011249/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 32:2</a>) God’s spokesman Elihu reproved Job. But Elihu also conveyed to Job a positive message from God: “Let him [Job] off from going down into the pit [the common grave]! I have found a ransom! Let his flesh become fresher than in youth; let him return to the days of his youthful vigor.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011249/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 33:24, 25</a>) Those words must have filled Job with hope. He did not have to continue suffering right down to his death. If Job would repent, God would be pleased to accept a ransom in his behalf and set him free from his calamities.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2011249/0">a</a></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Job humbly accepted correction, and he repented. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011249/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 42:6</a>) Jehovah evidently accepted a ransom in Job’s behalf, allowing it to cover his error and open the way for God to restore and reward him. Jehovah “blessed the end of Job afterward more than his beginning.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011249/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 42:12-17</a>) Imagine Job’s relief when, among other blessings, his loathsome disease cleared up and his flesh, in effect, became “fresher than in youth”!</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The ransom that God accepted in Job’s behalf had limited value, for the man remained imperfect and later died. We have a much better ransom available to us. Jehovah lovingly gave his Son, Jesus, as a ransom for us. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011249/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matthew 20:28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011249/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> John 3:16</a>) All who put faith in that ransom have the prospect of living forever on a paradise earth. In that coming new world, God will release faithful humans from the aging process. Why not learn more about how you may live to see the time when old ones will see their “flesh become fresher than in youth”?</p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">When it seemed that Job might die, Elihu assessed Job’s precarious situation and laid the basis for hope, saying: “His flesh wastes away from sight . . . And his soul draws near to the pit, and his life to those inflicting death. If there exists for him a messenger, a spokesman, one out of a thousand, to tell to man his uprightness, then he favors him and says, ‘Let him off from going down into the pit! I have found a ransom! Let his flesh become fresher than in youth.’”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991131/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 33:21-25</a>.</p>

<strong>Man’s “World of Tomorrow” or Christ’s Kingdom Rule, Which?</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="ss"><span id="page167" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="167" data-before-text="167"></span><strong>PERSONAL HAPPINESS ASSURED</strong></p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">The government of this earth by Christ’s kingdom does not rule out the development of equipment and products to reduce man’s labor or lighten the work of woman in the home. Used aright, such things can be a blessing to man and can, indeed, allow more time for increasing his knowledge, developing his talents and, better yet, doing more for those around him by contributing to their enjoyment of life. But under Christ’s Kingdom rule the <em>motive</em> will be the determining factor that will ensure that such things do not lead to a life of indolence, where pleasure-madness eventually produces licentiousness or reverts to boredom. A premium will be placed on knowledge of God’s will, and the carrying out of his purposes for earth and mankind will give true meaning to human living and make all work, study and other endeavors sources of joy.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966201/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Phil. 4:8, 9</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Yes, there will be pleasure in working, even should it be plowing a field of rich, brown earth warmed by the golden sunshine, where the gaze takes in the blue skies and fluffy clouds, or rests on green trees and gaily colored flowers, or watches a squirrel scamper across the field, or notes a robin singing a song of springtime. Craftsmanship, metalworking, the arts, all will reach new heights of expression, beauty and precision, because the motive of those who produce them will be the best: the desire to honor the God they love and to use his gifts to praise him and to bless and delight their companion subjects of his Kingdom rule.—Note the principles in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966201/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966201/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 13:4-7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966201/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 2 Corinthians 9:11-14</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Life forever in vibrant health is also promised for earth’s inhabitants by God’s government through his King Son, Christ Jesus. Not in patched-up bodies with plastic parts or plastic surgery, but in bodies that have been regenerated and restored to perfect health so that a man’s flesh ‘becomes fresher than in youth and he returns to the days of his youthful vigor.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966201/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 33:25</a>) Medical scientists today admit that the greatest healing powers they know of are found, not in their “miracle drugs,” but right within the human body itself. Thus, when divine power, exercised by Christ reverses the aging process and increased cell reproduction, or other healing process, revitalizes all human organs, then ‘mourning, outcry, pain and tears will pass away.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966201/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rev. 21:3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">The basis for this removal of imperfection will be the ransom sacrifice provided by the King, Christ Jesus himself. It will get at the very root of all man’s ills and troubles by removing their source: sin, which is the failure to reach and comply with God’s perfect standards and which is every man’s inheritance. Thus, whereas today in some countries one-third of all hospital facilities are occupied by mental patients, those living under Kingdom rule will all be happy individuals, free from guilt and free from harmful thoughts, anxieties and selfish emotions that upset and block the proper functioning of the human organism.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966201/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966201/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966201/12/2" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> 6:21-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966201/12/3" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> Prov. 14:30</a>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">On that same basis of the ransom, Christ as King will do what no man or human government could dare to offer. He will restore to life earth’s dead millions whose bodies have long since returned to the dusty elements. What prospect could be more thrilling or more heartwarming than that of seeing the fulfillment of the King’s promise that “all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out”? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966201/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29</a>) What could be more interesting than meeting men and women of all ages, getting to know them, and aiding them to learn the principles of truth and righteousness, that they may <span id="page168" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="168" data-before-text="168"></span>qualify for an eternity of life under that Kingdom rule?</p>

Job had no control of the creation and Almighty God could care for his creation without Job’s help. Said Jehovah: “Should there be any contending of a faultfinder with the Almighty? Let the reprover of God himself answer it.” Deeply humiliated, Job confessed he had nothing to say toward his own justification.

<strong>How Long Can You Live?</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Since Jehovah God had declared that anyone disobeying him would pay the price for his sin by dying, Adam’s descendants appeared to be in a hopeless situation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102006163/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Genesis 2:17</a>) Nevertheless, the inspired Scriptures presented the hope that someone would pay for a release from the aging process. We read: “Let him off from going down into the pit! I have found a ransom! Let his flesh become fresher than in youth; let him return to the days of his youthful vigor.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102006163/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 33:24, 25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102006163/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Isaiah 53:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102006163/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 12</a>) The Bible here presented a wonderful prospect​—that of someone paying a ransom to effect a release from the process of aging!</p>

How loving of God to provide for a future that will be free from such things as wrinkles, graying hair or baldness, brittle bones, loss of muscle tone, shortness of breath and all the other things that now come with old age.

<strong>Jehovah Healed His Pain</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>Though his counsel was frank, Elihu remained kind. He spoke of a wonderful hope, that Jehovah would one day restore Job’s health. God would say of his loyal servant: “Let his flesh become fresher than in youth; let him return to the days of his youthful vigor.” Another instance of Elihu’s kindness: Instead of simply lecturing Job, he kindly invited Job to speak, to answer him. “Speak,” he said, “for I want to prove you right.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502019376/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 33:25,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502019376/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 32</a>) But Job did not answer.

Jehovah then described the mighty behemoth and the limber leviathan, as creative marvels well known to man.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Job 38:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/42/1" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 40:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/42/2" data-bid="43-3" class="b"> 15</a> to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Job 41:34</a>, <em>margin</em>.</p>

<strong>Jehovah Healed His Pain</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span>Though his counsel was frank, Elihu remained kind. He spoke of a wonderful hope, that Jehovah would one day restore Job’s health. God would say of his loyal servant: “Let his flesh become fresher than in youth; let him return to the days of his youthful vigor.” Another instance of Elihu’s kindness: Instead of simply lecturing Job, he kindly invited Job to speak, to answer him. “Speak,” he said, “for I want to prove you right.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502019376/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 33:25,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502019376/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 32</a>) But Job did not answer. Perhaps he felt no need to defend himself against such kind, encouraging counsel. Perhaps he wept in relief.</p>
