<strong>How Valuable Are the Superscriptions in the Book of Psalms?</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">As revealed in its superscription, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972046/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 51 sup</a> deals with an entirely different situation. It concerns the time ‘when Nathan the prophet came in to David after he had had relations with Bath-sheba.’ Since David gained Jehovah’s forgiveness, this psalm can be a real source of comfort to those overtaken in serious transgression. It helps one to appreciate what true repentance is and how one should respond to correction such as was given to David by Nathan.

There was hope for his spiritual recovery, however, if God showed him favor according to His loving-kindness, or loyal love. The abundance of God’s past mercies gave the repentant king a basis for faith that his Maker would wipe out his transgressions.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">11.

<strong>What Is the Quality of Your Prayers?</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">As an example, note David’s heartfelt prayer, after he had been reproved by God because of his sin with Bath-sheba. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974162/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Psalm 51</a>) He threw himself wholly on God’s mercy. He was primarily concerned over the reproach on Jehovah’s name.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974162/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps 51 Vs. 5</a>) He asked for cleansing, and a new and steadfast spirit.

<strong>Why Expect God to Listen to Prayer?</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"><span id="page72" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="72" data-before-text="72"></span>When it comes to praying for God’s mercy and forgiveness of sin, God’s servants can use the fact of their inherited sin and imperfection. Thus David pleaded with Jehovah to forgive his sin against Uriah: “Look! With error I was brought forth with birth pains, and in sin my mother conceived me.” King Solomon took note of the same thing in his prayer at the dedication of the temple of Jehovah: “In case they sin against you (for there is no man that does not sin), and you have to be incensed at them and abandon them to the enemy, . . . and they indeed come to their senses . . . and they actually return and make request to you for favor . . . you must forgive your people who had sinned against you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 51:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 1 Ki. 8:46-50</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">In fact, Jehovah himself tells that he takes man’s inherited imperfection into consideration in dealing with him: “Never again shall I call down evil upon the ground on man’s account, because the inclination of the heart of man is bad from his youth up; and never again shall I deal every living thing a blow just as I have done.” God’s servants, therefore, have ample reason for expecting God to listen to their prayers when they ask for mercy and forgiveness on the basis of inherited weakness, because of the original sin of Adam.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Gen. 8:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Rom. 5:12</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>JEHOVAH’S LOVING-KINDNESS</strong></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">And lastly, God’s servants can always plead their cause with Jehovah, that is, expect him to listen to their prayers, on the basis of his being a God of loving-kindness and mercy. Thus, when Jehovah was ready to wipe out the Israelites because of their having rebelled, Moses pleaded, not only on the basis of Jehovah’s name as being involved, but also on the basis of his being a God of loving-kindness: “And now, please, let your power become great, O Jehovah, just as you have spoken, saying, ‘Jehovah, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness, pardoning error and transgression . . . Forgive, please, the error of this people according to the greatness of your loving-kindness.”’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Num. 14:17-19</a>) Yes, Jehovah had told Moses that He is a God of mercy and loving-kindness, when Moses had asked to see his glory, and so now Moses could properly remind Jehovah of that fact. King David pleaded on this basis (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ps. 51:1</a>) and so did the prophet Daniel on behalf of his people: “Incline your ear, O my God, and hear . . . for not according to our righteous acts are we letting our entreaties fall before you, but according to your many mercies.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Dan. 9:18</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">No question about it, the Bible does not reveal an absentee-God such as the deist would have us believe that the great Creator is. No, he is interested in his creatures, and that for good reasons. He therefore invites them, yes, commands them to come to him in prayer, in praise, thanksgiving and with supplications. He welcomes their prayers on the basis of his name and because of their having kept integrity. Furthermore, he lets them plead on the basis of their human imperfection and inherited sin and also on the basis of his glorying in showing loving-kindness.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">The Bible speaks of God as the “Hearer of prayer.” But that does not mean he listens and favorably acts on all prayers, for, as is implicit in the foregoing, one must pray to the one true God and in the right manner and about right things to be heard by Him. Those meeting these conditions will find in their own lives that God is indeed the “Hearer of prayer,” that is, hearing in the sense of listening and answering prayer. Happy are those who thus pray!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 65:2</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Did You Commit the Unforgivable Sin?</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The sin of Judas was likewise unforgivable, being a deliberately selfish one. In fact, his betrayal of his Master was only the culmination of a course of hypocrisy and dishonesty. He had been a thief, robbing the treasury that had been entrusted to his care. When he saw Mary anointing Jesus with very costly perfume, Judas complained, and Jesus silenced him. Then out of selfish spite, Judas went to the rulers and bargained to betray Jesus for thirty pieces of silver. No wonder that Jesus <span id="page509" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="509" data-before-text="509"></span>said it would have been better had Judas never been born, and termed him “the son of destruction.” When Judas saw the consequences of his vile deed he felt remorse, but he was unable to revive himself to repentance because of his continued selfish course and the deliberate willfulness of his act.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 26:6-16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Mark 14:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> John 12:1-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/2/3" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 17:12</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Such unforgivable sins stand in striking contrast to those that God did forgive. Thus the grievous sin of David was forgiven—though not without punishment, let it not be forgotten—because of his long years of faithful service, because his repentance was sincere and because of God’s covenant with him. For similar reasons Peter’s sin of denying his Master was forgiven. He had been honest in his service of his Master—not like Judas—and his sin was due to fleshly weakness and so repentance and forgiveness were also granted him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Sam. 12:7-14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Ps. 51:1-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Matt. 19:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 26:69-75</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>PLEADING FORGIVENESS</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">In view of the foregoing examples of sins that God forgave and those that he did not, the sincerely repentant Christian can come to God and plead with confidence for forgiveness, and that for a number of sound Scriptural reasons:</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">He can plead on the basis of inherited sin even as did David: “Look! . . . in sin my mother conceived me.” He can plead for forgiveness also on the basis of his past record of faithful service. Further, he can plead on the basis of God’s mercy: “You are a God of acts of forgiveness, gracious and merciful.” God’s name is another basis for pleading: “For your name’s sake, O Jehovah, you must even forgive my error, for it is considerable.” Closely related to the foregoing is another plea that David made: “Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God . . . that my tongue may joyfully tell about your righteousness.” And in particular is Jesus’ ransom sacrifice a basis for a Christian’s pleading with God for forgiveness: “By means of him we have the release by ransom through the blood of that one, yes, the forgiveness of our trespasses.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 51:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Neh. 9:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Ps. 25:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/4/3" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 51:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/4/4" data-bid="5-5" class="b"> Eph. 1:7</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">If a Christian who has sinned feels unable to pray because his sin has made him spiritually sick, then what? “Let him call the older men of the congregation to him, and let them pray over him, greasing him with oil in the name of Jehovah. And the prayer of faith will make the indisposed one well, and Jehovah will raise him up. Also, if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jas. 5:14, 15</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Even if the sin is of such a serious nature as to require disfellowshiping, that does not mean that the sin is unforgivable. However, to secure God’s forgiveness one must comply with his rules by also confessing his sin to those in charge of his congregation and willingly submitting to being punished. That such sins are forgivable is apparent from the words of the apostle Paul regarding such an erring one: “This rebuke given by the majority is sufficient for such a man, so that, on the contrary now, you should kindly forgive and comfort him, that somehow such a man may not be swallowed up by his being overly sad.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Cor. 2:6-8</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Often a run-down physical condition, perhaps due to overconscientiousness, is at the bottom of the anxiety of having committed the unforgivable sin. So never let the Devil discourage you so that you give up trying to serve God and doing what is right because of imagining you have committed the unforgivable sin. The ways of Jehovah God are not only just but also wise and, above all, loving. Certainly if he <span id="page510" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="510" data-before-text="510"></span>has no pleasure in the death of the wicked he has none in the loss of a servant of his. So keep feeding on God’s Word, especially such comforting sections as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 103</a>, associate with your Christian brothers and share in God’s work to the extent of your ability and opportunities. Doing so, you will become strong in faith, hope and love and free from any fear of having committed the unforgivable sin.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:13</a>.</p>

<strong>Did You Commit the Unforgivable Sin?</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The sin of Judas was likewise unforgivable, being a deliberately selfish one. In fact, his betrayal of his Master was only the culmination of a course of hypocrisy and dishonesty. He had been a thief, robbing the treasury that had been entrusted to his care. When he saw Mary anointing Jesus with very costly perfume, Judas complained, and Jesus silenced him. Then out of selfish spite, Judas went to the rulers and bargained to betray Jesus for thirty pieces of silver. No wonder that Jesus <span id="page509" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="509" data-before-text="509"></span>said it would have been better had Judas never been born, and termed him “the son of destruction.” When Judas saw the consequences of his vile deed he felt remorse, but he was unable to revive himself to repentance because of his continued selfish course and the deliberate willfulness of his act.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 26:6-16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Mark 14:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> John 12:1-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/2/3" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 17:12</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Such unforgivable sins stand in striking contrast to those that God did forgive. Thus the grievous sin of David was forgiven—though not without punishment, let it not be forgotten—because of his long years of faithful service, because his repentance was sincere and because of God’s covenant with him. For similar reasons Peter’s sin of denying his Master was forgiven. He had been honest in his service of his Master—not like Judas—and his sin was due to fleshly weakness and so repentance and forgiveness were also granted him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Sam. 12:7-14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Ps. 51:1-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Matt. 19:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 26:69-75</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>PLEADING FORGIVENESS</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">In view of the foregoing examples of sins that God forgave and those that he did not, the sincerely repentant Christian can come to God and plead with confidence for forgiveness, and that for a number of sound Scriptural reasons:</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">He can plead on the basis of inherited sin even as did David: “Look! . . . in sin my mother conceived me.” He can plead for forgiveness also on the basis of his past record of faithful service. Further, he can plead on the basis of God’s mercy: “You are a God of acts of forgiveness, gracious and merciful.” God’s name is another basis for pleading: “For your name’s sake, O Jehovah, you must even forgive my error, for it is considerable.” Closely related to the foregoing is another plea that David made: “Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God . . . that my tongue may joyfully tell about your righteousness.” And in particular is Jesus’ ransom sacrifice a basis for a Christian’s pleading with God for forgiveness: “By means of him we have the release by ransom through the blood of that one, yes, the forgiveness of our trespasses.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 51:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Neh. 9:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Ps. 25:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/4/3" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 51:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/4/4" data-bid="5-5" class="b"> Eph. 1:7</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">If a Christian who has sinned feels unable to pray because his sin has made him spiritually sick, then what? “Let him call the older men of the congregation to him, and let them pray over him, greasing him with oil in the name of Jehovah. And the prayer of faith will make the indisposed one well, and Jehovah will raise him up. Also, if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jas. 5:14, 15</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Even if the sin is of such a serious nature as to require disfellowshiping, that does not mean that the sin is unforgivable. However, to secure God’s forgiveness one must comply with his rules by also confessing his sin to those in charge of his congregation and willingly submitting to being punished. That such sins are forgivable is apparent from the words of the apostle Paul regarding such an erring one: “This rebuke given by the majority is sufficient for such a man, so that, on the contrary now, you should kindly forgive and comfort him, that somehow such a man may not be swallowed up by his being overly sad.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Cor. 2:6-8</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Often a run-down physical condition, perhaps due to overconscientiousness, is at the bottom of the anxiety of having committed the unforgivable sin. So never let the Devil discourage you so that you give up trying to serve God and doing what is right because of imagining you have committed the unforgivable sin. The ways of Jehovah God are not only just but also wise and, above all, loving. Certainly if he <span id="page510" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="510" data-before-text="510"></span>has no pleasure in the death of the wicked he has none in the loss of a servant of his. So keep feeding on God’s Word, especially such comforting sections as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 103</a>, associate with your Christian brothers and share in God’s work to the extent of your ability and opportunities. Doing so, you will become strong in faith, hope and love and free from any fear of having committed the unforgivable sin.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:13</a>.</p>

<strong>The God of Love Hates a Divorcing</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Jehovah God hates a divorcing on unscriptural grounds because, first of all, it is sinning against him. He has a vested interest in the institution of marriage and <span id="page19" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>so any who go contrary to his will in regard to it are actually sinning against God. That adultery is sinning against God can be seen from what Joseph told Potiphar’s wife when she tried to seduce him to become party to adultery: “How could I commit this great badness and actually sin against God?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981487/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 39:9</a>) And what did King David say to Jehovah in expressing repentance for his sin of adultery with Uriah’s wife? “Against you, you alone, I have sinned, and what is bad in your eyes I have done.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981487/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 51:4</a>.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1981487/0">a</a></p>

<strong>“Let God Be Found True”</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> We do not overlook the fact that the far greater number of circumcised Jews of that day did not accept the testimony of their own holy writings of prophecy. But did this prove that those sacred pronouncements of God were false? Did it prove that God, the Inspirer of the Holy Bible, was <span id="page678" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="678" data-before-text="678"></span>not true to his part of the covenant that he had made with the Jews through Moses? Was God found to be unreliable, unworthy of faith on our part? Should we therefore throw the Bible away as being found untrue or as being the work of just ordinary human writers who made mistakes and who lie? Should we follow the Jewish course of sticking to the traditions of men rather than to the Holy Scriptures? If we were to let the example of faithless, disobedient, self-righteous men influence us, we would answer Yes to each one of those questions. That is the way many of the 13,016,000 circumcised Jews answer today. But the Christian apostle Paul, who also was a Jew by birth and who was “circumcised the eighth day,” says No! He was not influenced by those who claim to be Jews but who are not true Jews in fact.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 5.

He argues against our misjudging God from looking at his professed people and says: “He is not a Jew who is one on the outside, nor is circumcision that which is on the outside upon the flesh. But he is a Jew who is one on the inside, and his circumcision is that of the heart by spirit, and not by a written code. The praise of that one comes, not from men, but from God. What, then, is the superiority of the Jew, or what is the benefit of the circumcision? A great deal in every way. First of all, because they were entrusted with the sacred pronouncements of God. What, then, is the case? If some did not express faith, will their lack of faith perhaps make the faithfulness of God without effect? Never may that happen! But let God be found true, though every man be found a liar, even as it is written [in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965841/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 51:4</a>]: ‘That you [O God] might be proved righteous in your words and might win when you are being judged.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965841/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rom. 2:28 to 3:4</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 6.

<strong>Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p90" data-pid="90"><strong><em>Why he can deal with imperfect humans.</em></strong> Jehovah’s just standards allowed for his dealing differently with Adam and Eve’s offspring than with their parents. Why? For the reason that Adam’s offspring <em>inherited</em> sin, hence involuntarily started life as imperfect creatures with a built-in inclination toward wrongdoing. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002391/189/0" data-bid="190-1" class="b">Ps 51:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002391/189/1" data-bid="190-2" class="b"> Ro 5:12</a>) Thus, there was basis for mercy toward them. Jehovah’s first prophecy (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002391/190/0" data-bid="191-1" class="b">Ge 3:15</a>), spoken at the time of pronouncing judgment in Eden, showed that the rebellion of his first human children (as well as that of one of his spirit sons) had not embittered Jehovah nor dried up the flow of his love. That prophecy pointed in symbolic terms toward a righting of the situation produced by the rebellion and a restoration of conditions to their original perfection, the full significance being revealed millenniums later.​—Compare the symbolisms of the “serpent,” the “woman,” and the “seed” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002391/191/0" data-bid="192-1" class="b">Re 12:9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002391/191/1" data-bid="192-2" class="b"> 17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002391/191/2" data-bid="192-3" class="b"> Ga 3:16,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002391/191/3" data-bid="192-4" class="b"> 29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002391/191/4" data-bid="192-5" class="b"> 4:26, 27</a>.</p>

Of God, the disciple James rightly said: “With him there is not a variation of the turning of the shadow.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/176/0" data-bid="177-1" class="b">Jas. 1:17</a>) There was no ‘mellowing’ of Jehovah God’s personality during the centuries, for no mellowing was needed.

That prophecy pointed in symbolic terms toward a righting of the situation produced by the rebellion and a restoration of conditions to their original perfection, the full significance being revealed millenniums later.—Compare the symbolisms of the “serpent,” the “woman,” and the “seed” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/182/0" data-bid="183-1" class="b">Revelation 12:9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/182/1" data-bid="183-2" class="b"> 17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/182/2" data-bid="183-3" class="b"> Galatians 3:16,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/182/3" data-bid="183-4" class="b"> 29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/182/4" data-bid="183-5" class="b"> 4:26, 27</a>.</p><p id="p110" data-pid="110" class="sb">Adam’s descendants have been permitted to continue on earth for thousands of years, though imperfect <span id="page893" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="893" data-before-text="893"></span>and in a dying condition, never able to free themselves from sin’s deadly grip.

<strong>Why Do Babies Die?</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">God’s Word points to the underlying cause of death, saying: “Through one man [Adam] sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101971888/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12</a>) But do newborn or very young babies have such death-dealing sin within them? The Bible shows they do. How? By inheritance. As the inspired psalmist expressed it: “Look! with error I was brought forth with birth pains, and in sin my mother conceived me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101971888/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 51:5</a>) Let us see how this works out.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The historical account in Genesis shows that the first man Adam chose to rebel against God’s law. Our first parents’ being cut off from good relationship with their Creator introduced emotions of guilt, anxiety, insecurity and shame. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101971888/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 3:1-13</a>) This inevitably had a damaging effect upon their system, for it was not designed with any ‘built-in tolerance’ for wrongdoing. As is well known, damaging emotions adversely affect the body chemistry. This would be true of the first man and woman. Their organs and bodily functions involved in reproduction may have suffered damage. At any rate, from the start children were born with weaknesses. Sinful from birth, they could not measure up to the standards of perfection that Jehovah had purposed for humans. As faithful Job observed: “Who can produce someone clean out of someone unclean? There is not one.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101971888/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 14:4</a>.</p>

<strong>Why Expect God to Listen to Prayer?</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"><span id="page72" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="72" data-before-text="72"></span>When it comes to praying for God’s mercy and forgiveness of sin, God’s servants can use the fact of their inherited sin and imperfection. Thus David pleaded with Jehovah to forgive his sin against Uriah: “Look! With error I was brought forth with birth pains, and in sin my mother conceived me.” King Solomon took note of the same thing in his prayer at the dedication of the temple of Jehovah: “In case they sin against you (for there is no man that does not sin), and you have to be incensed at them and abandon them to the enemy, . . . and they indeed come to their senses . . . and they actually return and make request to you for favor . . . you must forgive your people who had sinned against you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 51:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 1 Ki. 8:46-50</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">In fact, Jehovah himself tells that he takes man’s inherited imperfection into consideration in dealing with him: “Never again shall I call down evil upon the ground on man’s account, because the inclination of the heart of man is bad from his youth up; and never again shall I deal every living thing a blow just as I have done.” God’s servants, therefore, have ample reason for expecting God to listen to their prayers when they ask for mercy and forgiveness on the basis of inherited weakness, because of the original sin of Adam.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Gen. 8:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Rom. 5:12</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>JEHOVAH’S LOVING-KINDNESS</strong></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">And lastly, God’s servants can always plead their cause with Jehovah, that is, expect him to listen to their prayers, on the basis of his being a God of loving-kindness and mercy. Thus, when Jehovah was ready to wipe out the Israelites because of their having rebelled, Moses pleaded, not only on the basis of Jehovah’s name as being involved, but also on the basis of his being a God of loving-kindness: “And now, please, let your power become great, O Jehovah, just as you have spoken, saying, ‘Jehovah, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness, pardoning error and transgression . . . Forgive, please, the error of this people according to the greatness of your loving-kindness.”’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Num. 14:17-19</a>) Yes, Jehovah had told Moses that He is a God of mercy and loving-kindness, when Moses had asked to see his glory, and so now Moses could properly remind Jehovah of that fact. King David pleaded on this basis (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ps. 51:1</a>) and so did the prophet Daniel on behalf of his people: “Incline your ear, O my God, and hear . . . for not according to our righteous acts are we letting our entreaties fall before you, but according to your many mercies.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Dan. 9:18</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">No question about it, the Bible does not reveal an absentee-God such as the deist would have us believe that the great Creator is. No, he is interested in his creatures, and that for good reasons. He therefore invites them, yes, commands them to come to him in prayer, in praise, thanksgiving and with supplications. He welcomes their prayers on the basis of his name and because of their having kept integrity. Furthermore, he lets them plead on the basis of their human imperfection and inherited sin and also on the basis of his glorying in showing loving-kindness.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">The Bible speaks of God as the “Hearer of prayer.” But that does not mean he listens and favorably acts on all prayers, for, as is implicit in the foregoing, one must pray to the one true God and in the right manner and about right things to be heard by Him. Those meeting these conditions will find in their own lives that God is indeed the “Hearer of prayer,” that is, hearing in the sense of listening and answering prayer. Happy are those who thus pray!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 65:2</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Did You Commit the Unforgivable Sin?</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The sin of Judas was likewise unforgivable, being a deliberately selfish one. In fact, his betrayal of his Master was only the culmination of a course of hypocrisy and dishonesty. He had been a thief, robbing the treasury that had been entrusted to his care. When he saw Mary anointing Jesus with very costly perfume, Judas complained, and Jesus silenced him. Then out of selfish spite, Judas went to the rulers and bargained to betray Jesus for thirty pieces of silver. No wonder that Jesus <span id="page509" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="509" data-before-text="509"></span>said it would have been better had Judas never been born, and termed him “the son of destruction.” When Judas saw the consequences of his vile deed he felt remorse, but he was unable to revive himself to repentance because of his continued selfish course and the deliberate willfulness of his act.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 26:6-16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Mark 14:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> John 12:1-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/2/3" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 17:12</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Such unforgivable sins stand in striking contrast to those that God did forgive. Thus the grievous sin of David was forgiven—though not without punishment, let it not be forgotten—because of his long years of faithful service, because his repentance was sincere and because of God’s covenant with him. For similar reasons Peter’s sin of denying his Master was forgiven. He had been honest in his service of his Master—not like Judas—and his sin was due to fleshly weakness and so repentance and forgiveness were also granted him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Sam. 12:7-14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Ps. 51:1-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Matt. 19:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 26:69-75</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>PLEADING FORGIVENESS</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">In view of the foregoing examples of sins that God forgave and those that he did not, the sincerely repentant Christian can come to God and plead with confidence for forgiveness, and that for a number of sound Scriptural reasons:</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">He can plead on the basis of inherited sin even as did David: “Look! . . . in sin my mother conceived me.” He can plead for forgiveness also on the basis of his past record of faithful service. Further, he can plead on the basis of God’s mercy: “You are a God of acts of forgiveness, gracious and merciful.” God’s name is another basis for pleading: “For your name’s sake, O Jehovah, you must even forgive my error, for it is considerable.” Closely related to the foregoing is another plea that David made: “Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God . . . that my tongue may joyfully tell about your righteousness.” And in particular is Jesus’ ransom sacrifice a basis for a Christian’s pleading with God for forgiveness: “By means of him we have the release by ransom through the blood of that one, yes, the forgiveness of our trespasses.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 51:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Neh. 9:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Ps. 25:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/4/3" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 51:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/4/4" data-bid="5-5" class="b"> Eph. 1:7</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">If a Christian who has sinned feels unable to pray because his sin has made him spiritually sick, then what? “Let him call the older men of the congregation to him, and let them pray over him, greasing him with oil in the name of Jehovah. And the prayer of faith will make the indisposed one well, and Jehovah will raise him up. Also, if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jas. 5:14, 15</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Even if the sin is of such a serious nature as to require disfellowshiping, that does not mean that the sin is unforgivable. However, to secure God’s forgiveness one must comply with his rules by also confessing his sin to those in charge of his congregation and willingly submitting to being punished. That such sins are forgivable is apparent from the words of the apostle Paul regarding such an erring one: “This rebuke given by the majority is sufficient for such a man, so that, on the contrary now, you should kindly forgive and comfort him, that somehow such a man may not be swallowed up by his being overly sad.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Cor. 2:6-8</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Often a run-down physical condition, perhaps due to overconscientiousness, is at the bottom of the anxiety of having committed the unforgivable sin. So never let the Devil discourage you so that you give up trying to serve God and doing what is right because of imagining you have committed the unforgivable sin. The ways of Jehovah God are not only just but also wise and, above all, loving. Certainly if he <span id="page510" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="510" data-before-text="510"></span>has no pleasure in the death of the wicked he has none in the loss of a servant of his.

Doing so, you will become strong in faith, hope and love and free from any fear of having committed the unforgivable sin.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:13</a>.</p>

In his grief over having committed a grave sin, the psalmist David prayed to God: “Look! with error I was brought forth with birth pains, and in sin my mother conceived me. May you purify me from sin with hyssop, that I may be clean; may you wash me, that I may become whiter even than snow.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ps. 51:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 7</a>) Back there King David and other worshipers offered animal sacrifices to Jehovah God for sin, but the psalmist was inspired to say that animal victims, such as rich men could buy and offer in abundance, could not really take away sin and lift from mankind the condemnation to death: “Not one of them can by any means redeem even a brother, nor give to God a ransom for him; (and the redemption price of their soul is so precious that it has ceased to time indefinite) that he should still live forever [and] not see the pit.

This heavenly Son of God was born nineteen centuries ago in the royal family of King David, not in a glorious palace, however, but in a stable in David’s birth city of Bethlehem. A manger was then his bed. He was called Jesus, his name meaning “Jehovah is salvation,” and under this name he was to save his people, Christians, from their sins. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matt. 1:20, 21</a>) No wonder he repeatedly said that he came in his Father’s name. At the age of thirty years he was baptized in the waters of the Jordan River, not in symbol of his being a sinner but as a sign before God and the holy angels and John the Baptizer that he was dedicating himself to the larger service of God his Father. Right after this baptism God anointed Jesus with holy spirit from heaven and he thus had the title “Christ” or Anointed One added to his name; he became Jesus Christ. The perfect Jesus knew that the animal sacrifices of the Jews were not equal to the value of a man and were therefore not able to be a redemption price for mankind; their blood could not wash away the sins of mankind. That was why Jesus, knowing his own human perfection, presented himself as an adequate sacrifice.</p><p id="p76" data-pid="76" class="qu">16.

<strong>The Appeal of Honesty</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">If humans find a person desirable because he is free from deceit, genuinely honest, think how God must look upon such ones. The Bible writer David prayed to Jehovah: “Look! You have taken delight in truthfulness itself in the inward parts; and in the secret self may you cause me to know sheer wisdom.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101974880/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 51:6</a>) Yes, honesty or “truthfulness” must proceed from “the inward parts” or “secret self”; it must be representative of what a person really is. David here admits that even he had to learn to be truly honest from his “inward parts,” for it was not an inborn trait.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">When truthfulness, honesty, earmarks a person’s life, the results are always favorable, bringing about lasting good. Understandably, David wanted this fine trait to reveal itself in a practical way in every aspect of his life and so he also prayed, according to the parallel expression, for “sheer wisdom.” How today can one be transformed to an upright course and be genuinely “wise”?</p>

The idea of purity is also associated with his plea that Jehovah wash him that he might become entirely clean, whiter even than snow that has not gathered soot or other debris. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993202/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Isaiah 1:18</a>) If any of us are now suffering pangs of conscience over some wrongdoing, let us have faith that if we repentantly seek God’s forgiveness, he can purify and cleanse us on the basis of Jesus’ ransom sacrifice.</p>

In his grief over having committed a grave sin, the psalmist David prayed to God: “Look! with error I was brought forth with birth pains, and in sin my mother conceived me. May you purify me from sin with hyssop, that I may be clean; may you wash me, that I may become whiter even than snow.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ps. 51:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 7</a>) Back there King David and other worshipers offered animal sacrifices to Jehovah God for sin, but the psalmist was inspired to say that animal victims, such as rich men could buy and offer in abundance, could not really take away sin and lift from mankind the condemnation to death: “Not one of them can by any means redeem even a brother, nor give to God a ransom for him; (and the redemption price of their soul is so precious that it has ceased to time indefinite) that he should still live forever [and] not see the pit.

This heavenly Son of God was born nineteen centuries ago in the royal family of King David, not in a glorious palace, however, but in a stable in David’s birth city of Bethlehem. A manger was then his bed. He was called Jesus, his name meaning “Jehovah is salvation,” and under this name he was to save his people, Christians, from their sins. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matt. 1:20, 21</a>) No wonder he repeatedly said that he came in his Father’s name. At the age of thirty years he was baptized in the waters of the Jordan River, not in symbol of his being a sinner but as a sign before God and the holy angels and John the Baptizer that he was dedicating himself to the larger service of God his Father. Right after this baptism God anointed Jesus with holy spirit from heaven and he thus had the title “Christ” or Anointed One added to his name; he became Jesus Christ. The perfect Jesus knew that the animal sacrifices of the Jews were not equal to the value of a man and were therefore not able to be a redemption price for mankind; their blood could not wash away the sins of mankind. That was why Jesus, knowing his own human perfection, presented himself as an adequate sacrifice.</p><p id="p76" data-pid="76" class="qu">16.

Burnt offering and sin offering you did not ask for. That being so, I said: ‘Here I have come, in the roll of the book it being written about me. To do your will, O my God, I have delighted, and your law is within my inward parts.’” (<em>Marginal reading;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Heb. 10:5-10</a>) This meant that Jesus had to die sinlessly, sacrificially, in this way giving up forever the perfect human body that Jehovah God had miraculously prepared for him. He must use that sacrifice, not take it back.</p>

He did not even find pleasure in songs of exultation and rejoicing presented by fine singers and skillful musicians. So great was sinful David’s agony over God’s disapproval that he was like a man whose bones had been painfully crushed. He longed for forgiveness, spiritual recovery, and restoration of the joy he had previously experienced. A repentant wrongdoer today also needs Jehovah’s forgiveness so as to regain the joy he had before he did something imperiling his relationship with God. Restoration of “joy of holy spirit” to a repentant person shows that Jehovah has forgiven him and loves him.

<strong>Face</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">To <em>‘conceal the face’</em> has a variety of meanings, depending on the circumstance. Jehovah God’s concealing his face often signifies a withdrawal of his favor or his sustaining power.

<strong>Confession That Leads to Healing</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">After begging for Jehovah’s forgiveness, David requested: “Create in me even a pure heart, O God, and put within me a new spirit, a steadfast one.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001407/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Psalm 51:10</a>) Requesting “a pure heart” and “a new spirit” shows that David was aware of the sinful tendency in him and that he needed God’s help in cleansing his heart and making a new start. Rather than succumbing to self-pity, he was determined to press on with his service to God. He prayed: “O Jehovah, may you open these lips of mine, that my own mouth may tell forth your praise.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001407/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Psalm 51:15</a>.</p>

Well, David pleaded: “Create in me even a pure heart, O God, and put within me a new spirit, a steadfast one.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993203/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 51:10</a>) Apparently, David made this request because he realized that the propensity for gross sin was still in his heart. We may not have been involved in the kinds of sin that ensnared David in connection with Bath-sheba and Uriah, but we need Jehovah’s help to avoid yielding to temptation to engage in any gravely sinful conduct. For that matter, we may personally need divine help to remove from our heart such sinful traits as covetousness and hatred​—crimes akin to theft and murder.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993203/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Colossians 3:5, 6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993203/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 1 John 3:15</a>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 5.

Realizing that he had not displayed such purity, David prayed that God cleanse his heart and bring it into harmony with divine standards. The psalmist also wanted a new, upright spirit, or mental inclination. He needed a spirit that would help him to resist temptation and stick firmly to Jehovah’s laws and principles.</p>

He said: “Create in me even a pure heart, O God, and put within me a new spirit, a steadfast one.” It is evident that on the occasion of his temptation, he did not have a pure and steadfast spirit. Perhaps he had neglected his reading of Jehovah’s Law, and as a result, his spirituality weakened. Or he may have allowed his position and power as king to corrupt his thinking so that he fell prey to lustful desire. Certainly, the force actuating his mind at that time was selfish and sinful. Thus, he came to recognize his need for “a new spirit, a steadfast one.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993125/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Psalm 51:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993125/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>.</p>

It is both comforting and faith-strengthening to know that we, as servants of Jehovah, can have confidence that he will “act quickly” for us. He knows our needs and how to supply them. Our loving heavenly Father is indeed “the Provider of escape” just when we need it. Sometimes, like David, we realize that our own shortcomings have brought us into a bad situation. But, like David, we can approach Jehovah in sincerity, perhaps with “a broken spirit,” confident that He will hear and answer our prayer. We can plead, even as David did: “Create in me even a pure heart, O God, and put within me a new spirit, a steadfast one.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 51:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 17</a>.</p>

The reasonings of the heart deeply affect one’s conscience for good or for bad. So, if we examine our conscience and the way it operates we may also discern the heart’s desires and motives. We will see whether we have a good heart or a bad one.

To be thrown away from before God’s face would mean to lose his favor, comfort, and blessing. If David was to be restored spiritually, he needed Jehovah’s holy spirit. With it resting upon him, the king could prayerfully seek divine direction so as to please Jehovah, could avoid sin, and could rule with wisdom.

Yearning for this, David petitioned God: “Do restore to me the exultation of salvation by you, and may you support me even with a willing spirit.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993203/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 51:12</a>) How wonderful it was to exult in the sure hope of salvation by Jehovah God!

In later times, Jehovah provided for salvation by means of the ransom sacrifice of his Son, Jesus Christ. If we as God’s dedicated servants sin <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>gravely but want to have the joy of salvation restored to us, we need to have a repentant attitude so as to avoid sinning against the holy spirit.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993203/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matthew 12:31, 32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993203/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Hebrews 6:4-6</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 9.

Jehovah God continuously supports his servants and raises up those bowed down by various trials.

Timothy was instructed not to fight when dealing with Christians in the congregations he served, but to ‘instruct with mildness those not favorably disposed’ as God might give them “repentance leading to an accurate knowledge of truth, and they may come back to their proper senses out from the snare of the Devil.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003691/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">2Ti 2:23-26</a>) Hence, the call to repentance may be given inside the congregation of God’s people, as well as outside of it.</p>

Of course, he could use his example to teach others only after he himself had accepted Jehovah’s standards and received His forgiveness, for those refusing to submit to divine requirements have no right to ‘enumerate God’s regulations.’​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993203/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 50:16, 17</a>.</p>

The heart of a dedicated person having a broken spirit is deeply grieved over his sin, is humbled because of sensing God’s disapproval, and is willing to do anything to regain divine favor.

It is both comforting and faith-strengthening to know that we, as servants of Jehovah, can have confidence that he will “act quickly” for us. He knows our needs and how to supply them. Our loving heavenly Father is indeed “the Provider of escape” just when we need it. Sometimes, like David, we realize that our own shortcomings have brought us into a bad situation. But, like David, we can approach Jehovah in sincerity, perhaps with “a broken spirit,” confident that He will hear and answer our prayer. We can plead, even as David did: “Create in me even a pure heart, O God, and put within me a new spirit, a steadfast one.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 51:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 17</a>.</p>

<strong>Did You Commit the Unforgivable Sin?</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The sin of Judas was likewise unforgivable, being a deliberately selfish one. In fact, his betrayal of his Master was only the culmination of a course of hypocrisy and dishonesty. He had been a thief, robbing the treasury that had been entrusted to his care. When he saw Mary anointing Jesus with very costly perfume, Judas complained, and Jesus silenced him. Then out of selfish spite, Judas went to the rulers and bargained to betray Jesus for thirty pieces of silver. No wonder that Jesus <span id="page509" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="509" data-before-text="509"></span>said it would have been better had Judas never been born, and termed him “the son of destruction.” When Judas saw the consequences of his vile deed he felt remorse, but he was unable to revive himself to repentance because of his continued selfish course and the deliberate willfulness of his act.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 26:6-16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Mark 14:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> John 12:1-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/2/3" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 17:12</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Such unforgivable sins stand in striking contrast to those that God did forgive. Thus the grievous sin of David was forgiven—though not without punishment, let it not be forgotten—because of his long years of faithful service, because his repentance was sincere and because of God’s covenant with him. For similar reasons Peter’s sin of denying his Master was forgiven. He had been honest in his service of his Master—not like Judas—and his sin was due to fleshly weakness and so repentance and forgiveness were also granted him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Sam. 12:7-14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Ps. 51:1-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Matt. 19:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 26:69-75</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>PLEADING FORGIVENESS</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">In view of the foregoing examples of sins that God forgave and those that he did not, the sincerely repentant Christian can come to God and plead with confidence for forgiveness, and that for a number of sound Scriptural reasons:</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">He can plead on the basis of inherited sin even as did David: “Look! . . . in sin my mother conceived me.” He can plead for forgiveness also on the basis of his past record of faithful service. Further, he can plead on the basis of God’s mercy: “You are a God of acts of forgiveness, gracious and merciful.” God’s name is another basis for pleading: “For your name’s sake, O Jehovah, you must even forgive my error, for it is considerable.” Closely related to the foregoing is another plea that David made: “Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God . . . that my tongue may joyfully tell about your righteousness.” And in particular is Jesus’ ransom sacrifice a basis for a Christian’s pleading with God for forgiveness: “By means of him we have the release by ransom through the blood of that one, yes, the forgiveness of our trespasses.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 51:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Neh. 9:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Ps. 25:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/4/3" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 51:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/4/4" data-bid="5-5" class="b"> Eph. 1:7</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">If a Christian who has sinned feels unable to pray because his sin has made him spiritually sick, then what? “Let him call the older men of the congregation to him, and let them pray over him, greasing him with oil in the name of Jehovah. And the prayer of faith will make the indisposed one well, and Jehovah will raise him up. Also, if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jas. 5:14, 15</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Even if the sin is of such a serious nature as to require disfellowshiping, that does not mean that the sin is unforgivable. However, to secure God’s forgiveness one must comply with his rules by also confessing his sin to those in charge of his congregation and willingly submitting to being punished. That such sins are forgivable is apparent from the words of the apostle Paul regarding such an erring one: “This rebuke given by the majority is sufficient for such a man, so that, on the contrary now, you should kindly forgive and comfort him, that somehow such a man may not be swallowed up by his being overly sad.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Cor. 2:6-8</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Often a run-down physical condition, perhaps due to overconscientiousness, is at the bottom of the anxiety of having committed the unforgivable sin. So never let the Devil discourage you so that you give up trying to serve God and doing what is right because of imagining you have committed the unforgivable sin. The ways of Jehovah God are not only just but also wise and, above all, loving. Certainly if he <span id="page510" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="510" data-before-text="510"></span>has no pleasure in the death of the wicked he has none in the loss of a servant of his. So keep feeding on God’s Word, especially such comforting sections as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 103</a>, associate with your Christian brothers and share in God’s work to the extent of your ability and opportunities. Doing so, you will become strong in faith, hope and love and free from any fear of having committed the unforgivable sin.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:13</a>.</p>

Nevertheless, let us also pray for others. Though David looked forward to rendering acceptable worship to God once again, his psalm did not selfishly leave others out of the picture. It includes this plea to Jehovah: “In your goodwill do deal well with Zion; may you build the walls of Jerusalem.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993203/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Psalm 51:18</a>.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">18.

However, it was also the humble psalmist’s prayer that ‘in goodwill God would deal well with Zion,’ Israel’s capital city, Jerusalem, where David had hoped to build God’s temple. David’s grave sins had threatened the entire nation, for all the people could have suffered because of the king’s wrongdoing.

<strong>Jehovah Does Not Despise a Broken Heart</strong><br/><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> If Jehovah rebuilt the walls of Zion, what else would happen? David sang: “In that case you [Jehovah] will be delighted with sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt sacrifice and whole offering; in that case bulls will be offered up on your very own altar.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993203/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 51:19</a>) David earnestly desired that he and the nation enjoy Jehovah’s favor so as to be able to worship Him acceptably. Then God would be delighted with their burnt sacrifices and whole offerings. This would be so because these would be sacrifices of righteousness offered by dedicated, sincere, and repentant people enjoying God’s favor. Out of gratitude for Jehovah’s mercy, on his altar they would offer bulls​—the best and most expensive sacrifices. Today, we honor Jehovah by bringing him the best of what we have. And our offerings include “the young bulls of our lips,” sacrifices of praise to our merciful God, Jehovah.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993203/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Hosea 14:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993203/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Hebrews 13:15</a>.</p>

<strong>Walking with God</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> Walking with God also requires us to be organization-minded in our reading habits. God’s visible channel provides us with ever so much reading matter, all of which should be a MUST for Christians. Some imagine they do not have time to read through each issue of <em>The Watchtower,</em> yet the president and vice-president of the Watch Tower Society do. Are you busier or do you have more important work than they do? Or is it a matter of selectivity? Are we wasting time reading other things or watching television when we could be buying out the opportune time reading <em>The Watchtower?</em> Much valuable information and admonition is contained in the so-called “secondary” articles of <em>The Watchtower</em> that help the Christian to <span id="page108" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="108" data-before-text="108"></span>walk in the right way and to “be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:17</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> The same also applies to the <em>Awake!</em> magazine. Reading each issue from cover to cover will not only broaden your mental horizon but also help you to view all things from God’s standpoint. And what about the <em>Yearbook?</em> Do you take time each day to consider the daily text? Are you reading its stimulating and encouraging reports? Doing so will help you in your walking with God.</p><p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="qu">17, 18. What can be said about the value and the working of the holy spirit in our walking with God?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> In addition to his Word and his visible organization, Jehovah God has also provided us with his holy spirit or active force. While today its operation is not as obvious to the natural eye as it was in the days of ancient Israel and in apostolic times, its operation can be clearly seen by the eye of faith. In fact, the great change it works in persons and the great work accomplished in the world today by reason of it can be seen by all even though they do not recognize the cause, the holy spirit. This spirit, however, we do not receive apart from God’s Word, association with his organization and prayer; apart from “a hearing by faith.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Gal. 3:2</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Clearly, not all dedicated and even mature Christians possess the holy spirit to the same measure. There is no doubt that unselfishness, depth of devotion, self-control, humility, mildness of spirit, studiousness as regards God’s Word and zeal in God’s service have a bearing on how much of the holy spirit we have. It also appears that inherited qualities have no small bearing on the extent to which we permit the holy spirit to have a free flow in our lives or tend to obstruct its activity. Thus the more colorful the personality the more difficult for the holy spirit to saturate it fully. The colorful personality has more need of self-control and must in particular guard against the snare of creature worship. Richness of personality seems to work against spiritual-mindedness, as the colorful person tends to lean more on himself, even as those who are rich in material things tend to put their trust in them instead of Jehovah God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 52:7</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong>EXCLUSIVE DEVOTION</strong></p><p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="qu">19.

We must believe that he exists and that he will reward those who do walk with him. We prove that we do have faith when we dedicate ourselves to do God’s will and to follow in the footsteps of Jesus Christ, thereby taking the very first step of walking with our God. As we read: “Will two walk together unless they have met by appointment?” For us to walk with God we must first meet him by appointment, by dedicating ourselves to him and being baptized in water, thus making public confession of our dedication to Jehovah. As has been stressed time and again in this publication, our dedication is not to an impersonal cause, nor even to a society of people, but to a person, the supreme Person of the universe, Jehovah God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Amos 3:3</a>.</p><p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="qu">20.

And what is his goal? The vindication of himself and his name and his word by means of his kingdom, of course. “Jehovah is exclusively devoted to his name. He is a God exacting [the same] exclusive devotion [of others].” “You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your <span id="page109" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="109" data-before-text="109"></span>whole mind and with your whole strength.” That is why Jesus commanded his followers: “Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ex. 34:14</a> (edition of 1953); <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Mark 12:30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Matt. 6:33</a>.</p>

While it has complimentary implications, the way it is used by the Hebrew Scripture writers keeps man cognizant of his inferior relationship to his Maker, Jehovah God. Thus we find that, when at last Jehovah God called patient Job to account because of his mistaken view of things, God twice addressed Job, not as a mere <em>ish,</em> a mere <em>adám</em> or a mere <em>enósh,</em> but he used the term <em>geber:</em> “Gird up your loins, please, like an able-bodied man, and let me question you, and you inform me,” since you were so sure of yourself as not to justify me! How fitting!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 38:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 40:7</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Pharaoh, when beginning to yield under the impact of the plagues, at first only granted permission for the able-bodied men to go into the wilderness to worship.

Thus the psalmist complains: “I have become like an able-bodied man without strength.” It would not have made much of a point had he said he became like a weak mortal, an <em>enósh,</em> because such a one does not have strength to begin with! Making the same point, Solomon observed that it is not good that “an able-bodied man should transgress over a mere piece of bread.” There might be an excuse for an <em>enósh</em> to do so, but certainly not a <em>geber.</em> The bad news he received caused Jeremiah’s bones to shake like “an able-bodied man whom wine has overcome,” hence a violent shaking. He also stressed the wretchedness of the men of Israel by employing this term: “Why is it that I have seen every able-bodied man with his hands upon his loins like a female that is giving birth, and all faces have turned pale?” Yes, this was serious when even able-bodied men, not mere <em>enósh</em> or weak mortals, were affected in this way!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 88:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Prov. 28:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/20/2" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> Jer. 23:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/20/3" data-bid="21-4" class="b"> 30:6</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Logically we are told that “one wise in strength is,” not an <em>adám, ish</em> or <em>enósh,</em> but a <em>geber,</em> “an able-bodied man.” A wise <em>geber</em> trusts not in his own strength but in Jehovah: “Blessed is the able-bodied man who puts his trust in Jehovah, and whose confidence Jehovah has become.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Prov. 24:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Jer. 17:7</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Truly, to note the way “man” is used in the Hebrew Scriptures strengthens our faith and helps us to get God’s view on man.

<strong>What Is the Love of Money?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Apparently the Christians in Laodicea <span id="page134" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="134" data-before-text="134"></span>failed to keep Paul’s warning in mind. By the time John wrote the book of Revelation, a little more than thirty years later, the Laodicean Christians had succumbed to the love of money. Because of it they had lost their spiritual beauty and spiritual riches. Addressing them, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962161/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 3:17</a> says: “You say: ‘I am rich and have acquired riches and do not need anything at all,’ but you do not know you are miserable and pitiable and poor and blind and naked.” They were spiritually poor and falling into spiritual ruin because they were placing a higher value on material wealth than on spiritual riches. Their attitude toward money had become bad.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>POVERTY NOT REQUIRED</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In some non-Christian religions it is thought that religious merit is achieved by seeking a life of poverty. Forsaking all material goods, Buddhist monks, for example, spend their lives in monastic contemplation. Their possessions consist of very little more than a garment, a begging bowl, a needle, a string of 108 beads used as a rosary, a razor and a filter to strain insects from their drinking water.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">A life of poverty is not required of Christians in order for them to receive the approval of the true God. He never instructed his worshipers to practice asceticism. A Christian is free to earn money and to buy necessities, even comforts and luxuries, with that money. He is not forbidden to purchase the material things he can afford.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">If a man with above-average business ability has succeeded in achieving a substantial financial income without succumbing to the dangerous desire to be rich, it would be a mistake to accuse him of being a lover of money. What indicates whether a person is a lover of money or not is not the amount of money he has or the number of possessions he has or the quality of his possessions. It is, instead, his attitude toward such things.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>WRONG ATTITUDE TOWARD MONEY</strong></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">A person can be poor and still be a lover of money because of his greedy desire to be rich and to have things he does not now possess. A person of average means in another country may seem to be rich in the poor man’s eyes, and yet that person may not have the wrong attitude of the poor man. Lovers of money, whether poor or rich, are condemned by the Scriptures because of their wrong attitude.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962161/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jeremiah 9:23</a> it is written: “Let not the wise man brag about himself because of his wisdom, and let not the mighty man brag about himself because of his mightiness. Let not the rich man brag about himself because of his riches.” Jehovah does not say here that a man should not be wise, mighty or rich, but that a man should avoid the wrong attitude toward these things by bragging about them.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The Laodicean Christians of the first century made the mistake of trusting in their riches and thus developed a wrong attitude toward them. They were like the able-bodied man mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962161/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 52:7</a> “that does not put God as his fortress, but that trusts in the abundance of his riches.”</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The folly of trusting in perishable riches is repeatedly stressed in the Scriptures. By greedily reaching out for riches some dedicated servants of God have been, as Paul said, “led astray from the faith.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962161/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:10</a>) They have failed to maintain their Christian innocence and have been swept into the world’s law-defying course. “A man of faithful acts will get many blessings, but he that is hastening to gain riches will not remain innocent.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962161/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Prov. 28:20</a>) The man of faithful acts is the man who is hastening to serve Jehovah and <span id="page135" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="135" data-before-text="135"></span>whose toiling is chiefly for spiritual treasures.</p>

<strong>Twisted, Gnarled, Knotted and Beautiful</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">King David held the olive tree in high esteem when he made this poetic expression: “But I shall be like a luxuriant olive tree in God’s house; I do trust in the loving-kindness of God to time indefinite, even forever.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101979165/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 52:8</a>) This and other figurative Biblical uses of the olive tree help us to see that it was an appropriate symbol of fruitfulness, beauty, dignity and prosperity.</p>

<strong>Know Jehovah—The Personal God</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong>“The Fool” and God</strong></p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">“It never occurred to any writer of the OT [Hebrew Scriptures] to prove or argue the existence of God,” says Dr. James Hastings in <em>A Dictionary of the Bible.</em> “It is not according to the spirit of the ancient world in general to deny the existence of God, or to use arguments to prove it. The belief was one natural to the human mind and common to all men.” This does not mean, of course, that all men at that time were God-fearing. Far from it. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997721/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 14:1 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997721/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 53:1</a> both mention “the senseless one,” or as the <em>King James Version</em> says, “the fool,” who has said in his heart, “There is no Jehovah.”</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">What kind of person is this fool, the man who denies the existence of God? He is not <em>intellectually</em> ignorant. Rather, the Hebrew word <em>na·valʹ</em> points to a <em>moral</em> deficiency. Professor S. R. Driver, in his notes to <em>The Parallel Psalter,</em> says that the fault is “not weakness of reason, but moral and religious insensibility, an invincible lack of sense, or perception.”</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"><span id="page7" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>The psalmist goes on to describe the moral breakdown that is a result of such an attitude: “They have acted ruinously, they have acted detestably in their dealing. There is no one doing good.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997721/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 14:1</a>) Dr. Hastings sums up: “Counting on this absence of God from the world and on impunity, men become corrupt and do abominable deeds.” They openly embrace ungodly principles and discount a personal God to whom they have no wish to be accountable. But such thinking is as foolish and senseless today as it was when the psalmist wrote his words over 3,000 years ago.</p>
