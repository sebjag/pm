<strong>Ahaziah</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">1. Son of Ahab and Jezebel and king of Israel for two years (920-918 B.C.E.). He followed his idolatrous parents in Baal worship. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Ki. 22:51-53</a>) Upon the death of Ahaziah’s father, Moab seized the opportunity to revolt and thereby free itself from the heavy tribute of one hundred thousand lambs and an equal number of male sheep with their wool. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Ki. 1:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 3:4, 5</a>) <span id="page45" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="45" data-before-text="45"></span>This revolt is described by King Mesha of Moab in the Moabite Stone inscription. Perhaps due to his subsequent accident and early death, Ahaziah made no effort to subjugate the Moabites.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Ahaziah did form a maritime alliance with Jehoshaphat of Judah for a shipbuilding enterprise at Ezion-geber on the Gulf of Aqabah. The project was disapproved by God due to Ahaziah’s wickedness, and the ships became wrecked. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Chron. 20:35-37</a>) The account at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Kings 22:48, 49</a> shows that Ahaziah wanted Jehoshaphat’s authorization for Israelite mariners to man the ships jointly along with those of Judah, a request that Jehoshaphat refused. If this request was made prior to the wrecking of the ships it may simply indicate Jehoshaphat’s distrust of Ahaziah and caution against encroachment by the northern kingdom. If the request came after the failure of the fleet, it may have been an insinuation on Ahaziah’s part that Jehoshaphat’s men were lacking in ability and responsible for the wreckage of the ships and hence the suggestion that the ships be refitted and sent out again with Israelite sailors also on board. In that case Jehoshaphat’s refusal may have been in acknowledgment of God’s manifest disapproval of the project.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">A house accident, in which the king fell through a grating (perhaps one covering a daylight shaft) in his roof chamber, left him bedridden and seriously ill. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Ki. 1:2</a>) As if the true God no longer existed, Ahaziah sent messengers to inquire of the Philistine god Baal-zebub (Lord or owner of flies) as to his prospects of recovery. Intercepted by the prophet Elijah, the messengers turned back and delivered the message to the king that his sickbed would become his deathbed. Instead of humbling himself, Ahaziah sent a force of fifty men under their captain to bring Elijah in to him. That force and a second one were both destroyed by fire upon approaching the mountain where Elijah was and giving him the king’s order to “come down.” A third force sent by the stubborn king escaped only by virtue of the captain’s respectful plea that he and his men’s lives “be precious in [Elijah’s] eyes.” Elijah thereafter descended and delivered the death message to Ahaziah’s face. He gradually died and, being sonless, was succeeded by his brother Jehoram.—1:2-17.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">2. Son of Jehoram and Athaliah and listed as king of Judah for one year (905 B.C.E.). During his father’s reign the Philistines and Arabs invaded Judah and took captive all Jehoram’s sons except Jehoahaz (Ahaziah), the youngest. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Chron. 21:16, 17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 22:1</a>) He was a young man of twenty-two years when ascending to the throne and his domineering mother Athaliah, daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, influenced him to wickedness. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Ki. 8:25-27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 22:2-4</a>) He accompanied King Jehoram of Israel (his maternal uncle) in a fight against Syria at Ramoth-gilead, which resulted in Jehoram’s being wounded. Later Ahaziah visited the convalescing Jehoram at Jezreel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Ki. 8:28, 29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 9:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 2 Chron. 22:5, 6</a>) Coordinating the two accounts (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Ki. 9:21-28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 22:7-9</a>), the following evidently took place: Jehu, on nearing Jezreel, met Jehoram and Ahaziah. Jehu struck down Jehoram but Ahaziah fled. At this time Jehu did not pursue Ahaziah, but continued to Jezreel to finish his executional work there. Meanwhile, the fleeing Ahaziah tried to make his way back to Jerusalem; however, he only got as far as Samaria, where he tried to hide himself. Jehu’s men, pursuing Ahaziah, discovered him in Samaria and captured him, and he was brought to Jehu, who was near the town of Ibleam, not far from Jezreel. When Jehu saw Ahaziah, he ordered his men to kill him in his chariot. They struck and wounded him on the way up to Gur, near Ibleam; but Ahaziah was allowed to escape, and he fled to Megiddo, where he died of his wounds. He was then taken to Jerusalem and buried there. As Douglas’ <em>New Bible Dictionary</em> (p. 21) observes: “The accounts of his death . . . are complementary and not contradictory.”</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 22:7</a> points out that Ahaziah’s death “was from God,” and thus Jehu acted as God’s executioner in slaying this man who fellowshiped with the condemned house of Ahab.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Why do the Watch Tower publications state that Matthew wrote his Gospel first in Hebrew, since it is supposed that Hebrew was a dead language in his day?—E. W., United States.</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">There are a number of reasons for believing that Matthew wrote his Gospel first in Hebrew. For one thing, we cannot assume that Hebrew was a dead language, as G. Ernest Wright points out in his work <em>Biblical Archaeology</em> (p. 240): “Roman soldiers and officials might be heard conversing in Latin, while orthodox Jews may well have spoken a late variety of Hebrew with one another, a language that we know to have been neither classical Hebrew nor Aramaic, despite its similarities to both.” Also, in the book <em>Daily Life in Bible Times,</em> Albert Edward Bailey gives a picture of the training of Jewish youths in the time of James, son of Zebedee:</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Boys were trained in piety from their earliest days. This would mean that the boys had a knowledge of the Law, which they showed by being able to read it, write it and explain its obvious meaning. . . . The boys sat on the ground in a half-circle facing the teacher. There James was taught to read the Law in Hebrew beginning with the Book of Leviticus, the contents of which it was necessary for every Jew to know if he was to regulate his life acceptably to God; and he must pronounce the words correctly and reverently. Hebrew was a strange language to him, for at home and at play they spoke Aramaic, and later when he began to do business he would have to speak Greek. Hebrew was only for the synagogue. . . . After learning to read came writing, probably in Hebrew and certainly in Aramaic.”—Pp. 248, 249.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">As to the testimony that Matthew wrote his Gospel first in Hebrew, there is a considerable array of statements from writers of the second through the fourth centuries A.D. A few of them are here given: Papias of the first and second centuries wrote: “Matthew put together the oracles [of the Lord] in the Hebrew language.” (<em>The Ante-Nicene Fathers,</em> Vol. I, p. 155) Origen of the second and third centuries wrote that Matthew’s Gospel was “published for Jewish believers, and composed in Hebrew letters.” (M’Clintock and Strong’s <em>Cyclopædia,</em> Vol. 5, p. 890) Quoted in the same work are the words of Eusebius of the third and fourth centuries who states: “The evangelist Matthew delivered his Gospel in the Hebrew tongue.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Then there is Jerome of the fourth and fifth centuries who said in his <em>Catalogue of Ecclesiastical Writers</em> that Matthew “composed a Gospel of Christ in Judaea in the Hebrew language and characters, for the benefit of those of the circumcision who had believed. . . . Furthermore, the Hebrew itself is preserved to this day in the library at Caesarea which the Martyr Pamphilus so diligently collected.”</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">A statement by a modern Bible scholar, Hugh G. Schonfield, is also of interest. He writes on page 11 of <em>An Old Hebrew Text of St. Matthew’s Gospel:</em> “As far back as the fourth century we hear of a Hebrew Matthew preserved in the Jewish archives at Tiberias.”</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Further reason for believing that Matthew wrote his Gospel first in Hebrew is based on the fact that a careful examination of his quotations from the Hebrew Scriptures shows that he quoted directly from the Hebrew and not from the <em>Septuagint Version.</em> If Matthew had written his Gospel first in Greek, it is likely he would have quoted from the <em>Septuagint.</em></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In view of the testimony of the early writers, the use of Hebrew in synagogues and Matthew’s quotations from the Hebrew, we arrive at this conclusion: It seems reasonable to believe that Matthew first wrote his Gospel in Hebrew, and later he himself most likely translated it into the <em>koine</em> Greek.</p>

<strong>Ahaziah</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">1. Son of Ahab and Jezebel and king of Israel for two years (920-918 B.C.E.). He followed his idolatrous parents in Baal worship. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Ki. 22:51-53</a>) Upon the death of Ahaziah’s father, Moab seized the opportunity to revolt and thereby free itself from the heavy tribute of one hundred thousand lambs and an equal number of male sheep with their wool. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Ki. 1:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 3:4, 5</a>) <span id="page45" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="45" data-before-text="45"></span>This revolt is described by King Mesha of Moab in the Moabite Stone inscription. Perhaps due to his subsequent accident and early death, Ahaziah made no effort to subjugate the Moabites.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Ahaziah did form a maritime alliance with Jehoshaphat of Judah for a shipbuilding enterprise at Ezion-geber on the Gulf of Aqabah. The project was disapproved by God due to Ahaziah’s wickedness, and the ships became wrecked. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Chron. 20:35-37</a>) The account at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Kings 22:48, 49</a> shows that Ahaziah wanted Jehoshaphat’s authorization for Israelite mariners to man the ships jointly along with those of Judah, a request that Jehoshaphat refused. If this request was made prior to the wrecking of the ships it may simply indicate Jehoshaphat’s distrust of Ahaziah and caution against encroachment by the northern kingdom. If the request came after the failure of the fleet, it may have been an insinuation on Ahaziah’s part that Jehoshaphat’s men were lacking in ability and responsible for the wreckage of the ships and hence the suggestion that the ships be refitted and sent out again with Israelite sailors also on board. In that case Jehoshaphat’s refusal may have been in acknowledgment of God’s manifest disapproval of the project.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">A house accident, in which the king fell through a grating (perhaps one covering a daylight shaft) in his roof chamber, left him bedridden and seriously ill. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Ki. 1:2</a>) As if the true God no longer existed, Ahaziah sent messengers to inquire of the Philistine god Baal-zebub (Lord or owner of flies) as to his prospects of recovery. Intercepted by the prophet Elijah, the messengers turned back and delivered the message to the king that his sickbed would become his deathbed. Instead of humbling himself, Ahaziah sent a force of fifty men under their captain to bring Elijah in to him. That force and a second one were both destroyed by fire upon approaching the mountain where Elijah was and giving him the king’s order to “come down.” A third force sent by the stubborn king escaped only by virtue of the captain’s respectful plea that he and his men’s lives “be precious in [Elijah’s] eyes.” Elijah thereafter descended and delivered the death message to Ahaziah’s face. He gradually died and, being sonless, was succeeded by his brother Jehoram.—1:2-17.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">2. Son of Jehoram and Athaliah and listed as king of Judah for one year (905 B.C.E.).

He writes on page 11 of <em>An Old Hebrew Text of St. Matthew’s Gospel:</em> “As far back as the fourth century we hear of a Hebrew Matthew preserved in the Jewish archives at Tiberias.”</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Further reason for believing that Matthew wrote his Gospel first in Hebrew is based on the fact that a careful examination of his quotations from the Hebrew Scriptures shows that he quoted directly from the Hebrew and not from the <em>Septuagint Version.</em> If Matthew had written his Gospel first in Greek, it is likely he would have quoted from the <em>Septuagint.</em></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In view of the testimony of the early writers, the use of Hebrew in synagogues and Matthew’s quotations from the Hebrew, we arrive at this conclusion: It seems reasonable to believe that Matthew first wrote his Gospel in Hebrew, and later he himself most likely translated it into the <em>koine</em> Greek.</p>

<strong>Ahaziah</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">1. Son of Ahab and Jezebel and king of Israel for two years (920-918 B.C.E.). He followed his idolatrous parents in Baal worship. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Ki. 22:51-53</a>) Upon the death of Ahaziah’s father, Moab seized the opportunity to revolt and thereby free itself from the heavy tribute of one hundred thousand lambs and an equal number of male sheep with their wool. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Ki. 1:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 3:4, 5</a>) <span id="page45" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="45" data-before-text="45"></span>This revolt is described by King Mesha of Moab in the Moabite Stone inscription. Perhaps due to his subsequent accident and early death, Ahaziah made no effort to subjugate the Moabites.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Ahaziah did form a maritime alliance with Jehoshaphat of Judah for a shipbuilding enterprise at Ezion-geber on the Gulf of Aqabah. The project was disapproved by God due to Ahaziah’s wickedness, and the ships became wrecked. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Chron. 20:35-37</a>) The account at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Kings 22:48, 49</a> shows that Ahaziah wanted Jehoshaphat’s authorization for Israelite mariners to man the ships jointly along with those of Judah, a request that Jehoshaphat refused. If this request was made prior to the wrecking of the ships it may simply indicate Jehoshaphat’s distrust of Ahaziah and caution against encroachment by the northern kingdom. If the request came after the failure of the fleet, it may have been an insinuation on Ahaziah’s part that Jehoshaphat’s men were lacking in ability and responsible for the wreckage of the ships and hence the suggestion that the ships be refitted and sent out again with Israelite sailors also on board. In that case Jehoshaphat’s refusal may have been in acknowledgment of God’s manifest disapproval of the project.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">A house accident, in which the king fell through a grating (perhaps one covering a daylight shaft) in his roof chamber, left him bedridden and seriously ill. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Ki. 1:2</a>) As if the true God no longer existed, Ahaziah sent messengers to inquire of the Philistine god Baal-zebub (Lord or owner of flies) as to his prospects of recovery. Intercepted by the prophet Elijah, the messengers turned back and delivered the message to the king that his sickbed would become his deathbed. Instead of humbling himself, Ahaziah sent a force of fifty men under their captain to bring Elijah in to him. That force and a second one were both destroyed by fire upon approaching the mountain where Elijah was and giving him the king’s order to “come down.” A third force sent by the stubborn king escaped only by virtue of the captain’s respectful plea that he and his men’s lives “be precious in [Elijah’s] eyes.” Elijah thereafter descended and delivered the death message to Ahaziah’s face. He gradually died and, being sonless, was succeeded by his brother Jehoram.—1:2-17.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">2. Son of Jehoram and Athaliah and listed as king of Judah for one year (905 B.C.E.). During his father’s reign the Philistines and Arabs invaded Judah and took captive all Jehoram’s sons except Jehoahaz (Ahaziah), the youngest. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Chron. 21:16, 17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 22:1</a>) He was a young man of twenty-two years when ascending to the throne and his domineering mother Athaliah, daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, influenced him to wickedness. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Ki. 8:25-27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 22:2-4</a>) He accompanied King Jehoram of Israel (his maternal uncle) in a fight against Syria at Ramoth-gilead, which resulted in Jehoram’s being wounded. Later Ahaziah visited the convalescing Jehoram at Jezreel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Ki. 8:28, 29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 9:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 2 Chron. 22:5, 6</a>) Coordinating the two accounts (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Ki. 9:21-28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 22:7-9</a>), the following evidently took place: Jehu, on nearing Jezreel, met Jehoram and Ahaziah. Jehu struck down Jehoram but Ahaziah fled. At this time Jehu did not pursue Ahaziah, but continued to Jezreel to finish his executional work there. Meanwhile, the fleeing Ahaziah tried to make his way back to Jerusalem; however, he only got as far as Samaria, where he tried to hide himself. Jehu’s men, pursuing Ahaziah, discovered him in Samaria and captured him, and he was brought to Jehu, who was near the town of Ibleam, not far from Jezreel. When Jehu saw Ahaziah, he ordered his men to kill him in his chariot. They struck and wounded him on the way up to Gur, near Ibleam; but Ahaziah was allowed to escape, and he fled to Megiddo, where he died of his wounds. He was then taken to Jerusalem and buried there. As Douglas’ <em>New Bible Dictionary</em> (p. 21) observes: “The accounts of his death . . . are complementary and not contradictory.”</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 22:7</a> points out that Ahaziah’s death “was from God,” and thus Jehu acted as God’s executioner in slaying this man who fellowshiped with the condemned house of Ahab. Ahaziah is also referred to as “Azariah” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 22:6</a> (though here fifteen Hebrew manuscripts read “Ahaziah”), and as “Jehoahaz” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010148/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 21:17</a>, which is simply a case of transposing the divine name (Jah) to serve as a prefix instead of as a suffix.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Jehu</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">On coming out of the house Jehu tried to pass off the matter lightly, as though the prophet had <span id="page896" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="896" data-before-text="896"></span>said nothing of importance. But the men saw from his appearance and manner that something of significance had occurred. On being pressed Jehu revealed that he had been anointed as king of Israel, on which striking pronouncement the army immediately proclaimed him king.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Ki. 9:11-14</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>DESTRUCTION OF THE HOUSE OF AHAB</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Giving orders to keep the matter secret from Jezreel, Jehu rode furiously for that city. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Ki. 9:15, 16</a>) Messengers sent out from Jezreel by Jehoram to inquire “Is there peace?” were sent to the rear of Jehu’s men. As the “heaving mass” of Jehu’s horsemen and chariots came closer, the chariot driving of Jehu “with madness” identified him to the watchman on the tower. Jehoram son of Ahab became suspicious and rode out in his war chariot, reaching Jehu at Naboth’s tract of land. Jehu shot him with an arrow and, recalling the prophecy of Elijah, commanded his adjutant Bidkar to throw his body into the field of Naboth. Then Jehu continued on into the city of Jezreel. Apparently Ahab’s grandson Ahaziah, who had come out of the city with Jehoram, tried to make his way back to his own capital, Jerusalem, but got only as far as Samaria and hid there. He was captured later and taken to Jehu near the town of Ibleam, not far from Jezreel. Jehu ordered his men to kill him in his war chariot. They wounded him mortally, on the way up to Gur, near Ibleam, but he escaped and fled to Megiddo, where he died. Then he was taken to Jerusalem and buried there.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Ki. 9:17-28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 22:6-9</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">On Jehu’s arrival in Jezreel, Ahab’s widow Jezebel called out: “Did it go all right with Zimri the killer of his lord?” (See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Kings 16:8-20</a>.) But Jehu, unmoved by this veiled threat, called upon the court officials to throw her down. They complied. Her blood spattered on the wall and Jehu trampled her under his horses. Possibly giving a further insight into Jehu’s character is the terse statement in the account, “After that he came on in and ate and drank,” then commanded her burial. In the meantime Jezebel had been eaten by the dogs, which circumstance brought back to Jehu’s mind Elijah’s prophetic expression as to the manner of her execution.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Ki. 9:30-37;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 1 Ki. 21:23</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Jehu wasted no time in pursuing the completion of his mission. He challenged the men of Samaria to set one of Ahab’s seventy sons on the throne and fight. But in fear they expressed loyalty to Jehu. Jehu boldly tested their loyalty by saying: “If you belong to me, . . . take the heads of the men that are sons of your lord and come to me tomorrow at this time at Jezreel.” The next day messengers appeared, carrying in baskets the seventy heads, which Jehu commanded to be put in two heaps at the gate of Jezreel until morning. After this Jehu killed all of Ahab’s distinguished men and acquaintances and his priests, and slaughtered forty-two men, the brothers of Ahab’s grandson King Ahaziah of Judah. Thus he destroyed also the sons of Jehoram of Judah, the husband of wicked Jezebel’s daughter Athaliah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Ki. 10:1-14</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Great steps had been taken toward ridding Israel of Baal worship, but Jehu had much yet to do, and he went about it with characteristic promptness and zeal. On his ride to Samaria he encountered Jehonadab, a Rechabite. It may be recalled that the descendants of this man were later commended by Jehovah through the prophet Jeremiah for their faithfulness. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Jer. 35:1-16</a>) Jehonadab expressed himself as being on Jehu’s side in his fight against Baalism and went along, assisting Jehu. All left over of those related to or connected with Ahab in Samaria were destroyed.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Ki. 10:15-17</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>BAAL WORSHIPERS ANNIHILATED</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Next, by the ruse of calling a great gathering for the worship of Baal, Jehu got all Israel’s Baal worshipers to assemble at the house of Baal. After ascertaining that there were no worshipers of Jehovah present, Jehu commanded his men to put to death everyone in the house. They thereafter destroyed the sacred pillars of Baal and pulled down the house, setting it aside for privies, for which the site was used down to the day of Jeremiah, writer of the account in the book of Kings. The record reads: “Thus Jehu annihilated Baal out of Israel.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Ki. 10:18-28</a>) However, later on Baal worship again gave trouble in both Israel and Judah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Ki. 17:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 28:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/20/2" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> Jer. 32:29</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Likely to keep the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel distinct from the kingdom of Judah with its temple of Jehovah at Jerusalem, King Jehu let the calf worship remain in Israel with its centers at Dan and Bethel. “And Jehu himself did not take care to walk in the law of Jehovah the God of Israel with all his heart. He did not turn aside from the sins of Jeroboam with which he caused Israel to sin.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">2 Ki. 10:29,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 31</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Nevertheless, for Jehu’s zealous and thorough work in eradicating Baalism and in executing Jehovah’s judgments on the house of Ahab, Jehovah rewarded Jehu with the promise that four generations of his sons would sit upon the throne of Israel. This was fulfilled in Jehu’s descendants Jehoahaz, Jehoash, Jeroboam II and Zechariah, whose rule ended in his assassination in 791 B.C.E. The dynasty of Jehu therefore reigned over Israel for about 114 years.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">2 Ki. 10:30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 13:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/22/2" data-bid="23-3" class="b"> 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/22/3" data-bid="23-4" class="b"> 14:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/22/4" data-bid="23-5" class="b"> 15:8-12</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="ss"><strong>BLOODGUILT ON JEHU’S HOUSE</strong></p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">However, after Jehu’s day, by the prophet Hosea, Jehovah said: “For yet a little while and I must hold an accounting for the acts of bloodshed of Jezreel against the house of Jehu, and I must cause the royal rule of the house of Israel to cease.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Hos. 1:4</a>) This bloodguilt on Jehu’s house could not be for his carrying out the commission to destroy the house of Ahab, for God commended him for this. Neither could it be because he destroyed Ahaziah of Judah and his brothers. By their family connections, namely, by the marriage of Jehoram of Judah, the son of King Jehoshaphat, to Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, the royal line of Judah was contaminated with an infiltration of the wicked house of Omri.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Rather, the key to the matter seems to lie in the statement that Jehu let calf worship continue in Israel and did not walk in the law of Jehovah with all his heart. This indicates that the motive of Jehu may not have been altogether right in destroying all that belonged to Ahab. He may have done it with at least a measure of selfish interest—to ensure his own position as the new king. For he let calf worship go on, just as Jeroboam had done, perhaps for the same reasons. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Ki. 12:25-30</a>) Jehovah, while being pleased that the blotting out of filthy Baal worship and its adherents was carried out, would consider the whole motive of Jehu, even though he acted as Jehovah’s instrument. Jehu’s case may parallel in some respects the destruction of unfaithful Jerusalem by Babylon. Babylon carried out the execution as God had foretold, but did so from wrong motives—hatred of the Jews and their God Jehovah. Therefore, God brought Babylon to an accounting.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Jer. 25:8, 9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 50:33, 34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/25/2" data-bid="26-3" class="b"> 51:24,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/25/3" data-bid="26-4" class="b"> 34, 35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/25/4" data-bid="26-5" class="b"> Zech. 1:15</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">The real power of the kingdom of Israel was broken when Jehu’s house fell, the kingdom lasting only about fifty years longer. Only Menahem, who struck down Zechariah’s murderer Shallum, had a son succeeding him on the throne. This son, Pekahiah, was assassinated, as was his murderer and successor Pekah. Hoshea, Israel’s last king, went into captivity to the king of Assyria.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">2 Ki. 15:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 13-30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012347/26/2" data-bid="27-3" class="b"> 17:4</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The primary sin of Israel all along was its practice of calf worship. This led to the drawing of the nation away from Jehovah, with consequent deterioration. So the guilt for the “bloodshed of Jezreel” was one of the things, along with murdering, stealing, adultery and other crimes, that really found its root in the <span id="page897" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="897" data-before-text="897"></span>false worship that the rulers permitted the people to indulge in.

<strong>Gate, Gateway</strong><br/><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb">Repair work above the Horse Gate was done by the priests, which implies that its location was near the Temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/76/0" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Neh. 3:28</a>) Some have held that the Horse Gate was one providing communication between two parts of the Temple-palace quarter. They reach this conclusion from the account of Athaliah’s execution, which reports that, on being led out of the Temple by the soldiers, “she came to the entry of the horse gate of the king’s house.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/77/0" data-bid="78-1" class="b">2 Chron. 23:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/77/1" data-bid="78-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 11:16</a>) However, this was likely an entry just to the precincts of the royal palace and not the Horse Gate through which the horses passed in and out of the city itself. Nehemiah definitely includes the Horse Gate in his reconstruction description, indicating that it was a gate in the city wall. It was probably located near the SE corner of the Temple-palace area. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/78/0" data-bid="79-1" class="b">Neh. 3:28</a>) According to Jeremiah, there must have been a <span id="page627" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="627" data-before-text="627"></span>corner of the wall near this gate, probably as the wall turned toward the left as one comes up the Kidron valley, thereby following the valley’s contour (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/79/0" data-bid="80-1" class="b">Jer. 31:40</a>) The Horse Gate is omitted in the inauguration procession account, evidently because the two parts of the procession left off at the Water Gate and the Gate of the Guard, respectively, and did not walk over the section of the wall E of the Temple, where the Horse Gate and the Inspection Gate were located.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/80/0" data-bid="81-1" class="b">Neh. 12:37-40</a>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="ss"><strong><em>Inspection Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">Some call the Inspection Gate (Heb., <em>ham-miph-qadh</em>ʹ) the Muster Gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/81/0" data-bid="82-1" class="b">Neh. 3:31</a>, <em>Ro; RS</em>) At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/82/0" data-bid="83-1" class="b">Ezekiel 43:21</a> <em>miph·qadhʹ</em> (the same Hebrew word without the article <em>ha</em>) is translated “appointed place.” It has been thought to be the same as the Gate of the Guard, or the Gate of Benjamin. Of these possibilities, the Gate of Benjamin is the more likely. (However, see “Sheep Gate,” considered earlier.) Its mention by Nehemiah in his reconstruction account would seem to support the idea that it was a gate in the E wall of the city in front of the Temple area and N of the Horse Gate. Nehemiah’s statement that there was a corner in the wall beyond the Inspection Gate would place this gate in the E wall, S of where the wall turned (likely in a northwestward direction).</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb">The account tells us that the repair work was done “in front of the Inspection Gate.” Some have understood this to refer to a repair work on the city wall in front of a Temple gate by this name. This does not seem to be the correct view, for the same expression is used respecting the Water Gate, which is acknowledged to have been a gate <em>in</em> the city wall. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/83/0" data-bid="84-1" class="b">Neh. 3:26,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/83/1" data-bid="84-2" class="b"> 31</a>) The Inspection Gate is not named in the procession account evidently because the marchers did not traverse the wall E of the Temple.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="ss"><strong><em>Gate of the Guard</em></strong></p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="sb">From this gate (called “prison gate,” <em>AV</em>) the inauguration procession walking SE along the wall left the wall and proceeded to the Temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/84/0" data-bid="85-1" class="b">Neh. 12:39, 40</a>) Some think that this gate is identical with the Inspection Gate, but this does not seem to be a likely probability.—See “Inspection Gate,” above.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="ss"><strong><em>Middle Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sb">When the Babylonians breached Jerusalem’s wall, their military officers sat in the Middle Gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/85/0" data-bid="86-1" class="b">Jer. 39:3</a>) As has been seen, several possibilities are set forth as to the location of this gate. Probably the most likely is that it is identical with the Gate of the Old City, since this gate was at the convergence of the Broad Wall, the N wall of the old city, and the W wall of the second quarter, and would be a central or commanding position. However, some say that the Middle Gate may have been the Gate of Ephraim. Another suggestion is that it was the Fish Gate, another commanding position, because this gate stood at the point where the valley dividing the city into two parts entered the city.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="ss"><strong><em>Gate of Benjamin</em></strong></p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sb">Some identify the Gate of Benjamin with the Sheep Gate. This location would fit the circumstances of Jeremiah’s attempted exit to the territory of Benjamin, evidently toward Anathoth, which lay NE of Jerusalem. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/86/0" data-bid="87-1" class="b">Jer. 37:11-13</a>) However, some believe that the Gate of Benjamin and the Inspection Gate are identical. The latter identification seems less likely, although it would also have been possible for Jeremiah to travel toward his hometown Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin from the Inspection Gate. Another argument for the Sheep Gate as being another name for the Gate of Benjamin is that Zedekiah was sitting in the Gate of Benjamin when approached by Ebed-melech with a plea in Jeremiah’s behalf. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/87/0" data-bid="88-1" class="b">Jer. 38:7, 8</a>) It is suggested that the king would be near the point of greatest concern during the Babylonian siege. The Sheep Gate on the N of the city would be the most seriously threatened by the attacking Babylonians, not the Inspection Gate, which was apparently on the E side of the Temple area, and not in a particularly vulnerable position.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="ss"><strong><em>Other gates mentioned</em></strong></p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sb">When King Zedekiah fled from the Babylonians, he went out “by the way of the gate between the double wall that is by the king’s garden.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/88/0" data-bid="89-1" class="b">Jer. 52:7, 8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/88/1" data-bid="89-2" class="b"> 39:4</a>) There is much uncertainty as to the identity of the “double wall.” However, from present knowledge, either the Gate of the Ash-heaps or the Fountain Gate might fit the circumstances described in the Scriptures, both of these being near the king’s garden. Those supporting the Fountain Gate location say that the exit from the city through this gate led through a fifteen-meter- (c. 49-foot-) long corridor between two strong walls. On the other hand, Dr. J. Simons, who advocates the Gate of the Ash-heaps as Zedekiah’s place of exit, says that the lower part of the Central (Tyropean) valley was enclosed between a supposed SW wall of the city of David and a wall discovered by archaeologist J. Bliss (apparently an old S wall), in which was the Gate of the Ash-heaps. From either of those gates Zedekiah could have fled toward the Arabah and to “the desert plains of Jericho,” where the Babylonians caught him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/89/0" data-bid="90-1" class="b">2 Ki. 25:5</a>.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/90/0" data-bid="91-1" class="b">2 Kings 23:8</a> reference is made to the “high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua, the chief of the city, which was at the left as a person came into the gate of the city.” Here “gate of Joshua” is not the name of a city gate, but evidently is a gate within the city walls leading to the governor’s residence, which was at the left as a person entered the city gate.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="ss"><strong>TEMPLE GATES</strong></p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="sb"><em>East Gate</em>. Nehemiah’s reconstruction account tells us that the keeper of the East Gate shared in the repair work. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/91/0" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Neh. 3:29</a>) Thus the East Gate is not designated as a gate in Jerusalem’s wall, as some have thought.

This plague is transmitted chiefly through bites by fleas that have bitten dying or dead infected rats or other rodents. “A death-dealing confusion” occurred when the Ark was in Ekron, where “the men that did not die had been struck with piles.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013407/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Sam. 5:10-12</a>) Both pile and jerboa images are mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013407/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Samuel 6:4</a>, where the Philistine priests and diviners are quoted as saying, “every one of you and your axis lords have the same scourge.” But this may mean <span id="page1313" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1313" data-before-text="1313"></span>only that the entire nation, the axis lords and people alike, had suffered a common calamity, the, “same scourge,” not necessarily that the rodents and the piles were associated in one epidemic disease or plague.

<strong>Gate, Gateway</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"><strong><em>Horse Gate.</em></strong> Repair work above the Horse Gate was done by the priests, which implies that its location was near the temple.

They reach this conclusion from the account of Athaliah’s execution, which reports that, on being led out of the temple by the soldiers, “she came to the entry of the horse gate of the king’s house.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/78/0" data-bid="79-1" class="b">2Ch 23:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/78/1" data-bid="79-2" class="b"> 2Ki 11:16</a>) However, this was likely an entry just to the precincts of the royal palace and not the Horse Gate through which the horses passed in and out of the city itself. Nehemiah definitely includes the Horse Gate in his reconstruction description, indicating that it was a gate in the city wall. It was probably located SE of the temple area.

<strong>Gate, Gateway</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The Gate of the Old City was located on the NW side of the city between the Fish Gate and the Gate of Ephraim. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Neh. 3:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/51/1" data-bid="52-2" class="b"> 12:39</a>) In Hebrew, the gate is called simply “Gate of the Old,” the word “city” being supplied by some translators. It is suggested that the name was derived from its having been the main N entrance to the old city. It may have been at the junction of the Broad Wall (that formed a N boundary of the old city) and the S end of the W wall of the second quarter. Some think that this gate is identical with the “First Gate” mentioned by Zechariah. He seemingly refers to the E-W limits of the city in saying “from [1] the gate of Benjamin <span id="page626" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="626" data-before-text="626"></span>all the way to the place of [2] the First Gate, all the way to [3] the Corner Gate,” and to the N-S limits in saying “from the Tower of Hananel all the way to the press vats of the king.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Zech. 14:10</a>) If so, this places the First Gate E of the Corner Gate, possibly naming, from E to W, (1) the gate in or near the E corner, (2) the gate at the angle where the walls of the second quarter and the old city meet, and (3) the gate in the NW corner of the old city wall. Hence this would allow for the above-suggested identity of the First Gate with the Gate of the Old City. Others would connect the Gate of the Old City with the “Middle Gate” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Jeremiah 39:3</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong><em>Gate of Ephraim</em></strong></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">The Gate of Ephraim was located in the Broad Wall 400 cubits (c. 583 feet [c. 178 meters]) E of the Corner Gate.

It, too, has been identified by some researchers with the Middle Gate (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Jer. 39:3</a>), by others with the First Gate.

There was a public square near the Gate of Ephraim, in which the people made booths to celebrate the Festival of Booths in Nehemiah’s time. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Neh. 8:16</a>) This gate is not named in Nehemiah’s reconstruction text, evidently because it did not need extensive repairs.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="ss"><strong><em>Corner Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">This gate was evidently located in the NW angle of the city wall, 400 cubits (c. 583 feet [c. 178 meters]) along the Broad Wall W of the Gate of Ephraim.

Uzziah built a tower by this gate; whether or not it was the Tower of the Bake Ovens is not stated.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/60/0" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Jer. 31:38;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/60/1" data-bid="61-2" class="b"> Zech. 14:10</a>) Some think the Corner Gate is the same as the First Gate, but the statement in the book of Zechariah seems to weigh against this view as to its location, for, apparently describing the E-W limits, Zechariah wrote, “from the gate of Benjamin all the way to the place of the First Gate, all the way to the Corner Gate,” thus evidently placing the First Gate E of the Corner Gate.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">There is no other gate described as existing in the W wall from the Corner Gate to the Valley Gate at the S end, this no doubt being because of the steep slope of the Hinnom valley, making any other gate impractical. The Corner Gate does not appear in Nehemiah’s accounts; again the reason may be that it did not need extensive repairs. The account does speak of repairing the Tower of the Bake Ovens, which seems to have been a part of, or near, the Corner Gate.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Neh. 3:11</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="ss"><strong><em>Valley Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">At the SW corner of the city wall, the Valley Gate led to the Valley of Hinnom, and corresponds to the modern Jaffa Gate. Josephus’ “Gate of the Essenes” may have been located here or nearby. Uzziah, in his city-fortification program, built a tower by this gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/62/0" data-bid="63-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:9</a>) It was from the Valley Gate that Nehemiah went out for his inspection of the damaged wall, riding eastward through the Valley of Hinnom and then up the Kidron valley, finally reentering the city by the same gate.

Also, there may have been a potter’s industry near this gate, for there was clay nearby in the Valley of Hinnom as well as a water supply at the mouth of the Tyropean valley and at the spring En-rogel.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/72/0" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Neh. 2:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/72/1" data-bid="73-2" class="b"> 3:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/72/2" data-bid="73-3" class="b"> 12:37</a>) The Fountain Gate would afford convenient exit and access to En-rogel for those living in the City of David, while the Gate of the Ash-heaps, not far to the SW, would also lead out toward En-rogel and would likely be a better exit for the residents of the Tyropean valley and the SW hill of the city.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="ss"><strong><em>Water Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">The name of this gate may have been derived from its proximity, or at least its access, to the Spring of Gihon about midway up the E side of the city. This gate was near Ophel, not far from the Temple area. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/73/0" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Neh. 3:26</a>) The Water Gate was where one of the groups of the inauguration procession left the wall, proceeding from there to the Temple, where they assembled with the other group, apparently not traversing that part of the city wall to the E of the Temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/74/0" data-bid="75-1" class="b">Neh. 12:37-40</a>) There was a public square before this gate in which all the people gathered to hear Ezra read the Law, and where they afterward built booths to celebrate the Festival of Booths.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/75/0" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Neh. 8:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/75/1" data-bid="76-2" class="b"> 16</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="ss"><strong><em>Horse Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb">Repair work above the Horse Gate was done by the priests, which implies that its location was near the Temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/76/0" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Neh. 3:28</a>) Some have held that the Horse Gate was one providing communication between two parts of the Temple-palace quarter. They reach this conclusion from the account of Athaliah’s execution, which reports that, on being led out of the Temple by the soldiers, “she came to the entry of the horse gate of the king’s house.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/77/0" data-bid="78-1" class="b">2 Chron. 23:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/77/1" data-bid="78-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 11:16</a>) However, this was likely an entry just to the precincts of the royal palace and not the Horse Gate through which the horses passed in and out of the city itself. Nehemiah definitely includes the Horse Gate in his reconstruction description, indicating that it was a gate in the city wall. It was probably located near the SE corner of the Temple-palace area. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/78/0" data-bid="79-1" class="b">Neh. 3:28</a>) According to Jeremiah, there must have been a <span id="page627" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="627" data-before-text="627"></span>corner of the wall near this gate, probably as the wall turned toward the left as one comes up the Kidron valley, thereby following the valley’s contour (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/79/0" data-bid="80-1" class="b">Jer. 31:40</a>) The Horse Gate is omitted in the inauguration procession account, evidently because the two parts of the procession left off at the Water Gate and the Gate of the Guard, respectively, and did not walk over the section of the wall E of the Temple, where the Horse Gate and the Inspection Gate were located.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/80/0" data-bid="81-1" class="b">Neh. 12:37-40</a>.</p>

<strong>Contribution</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Some contributions were required under the Law. When Moses took a census of the Israelites, each male 20 years old and upward was to give a ransom for his soul, “a half shekel [probably $1.10] by the shekel of the holy place.” It was “Jehovah’s contribution” in order to make atonement for their souls and “in behalf of the service of the tent of meeting.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001026/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ex 30:11-16</a>) According to the Jewish historian Josephus (<em>The Jewish War,</em> VII, 218 [vi, 6]), this “sacred tax” was thereafter paid annually.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001026/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2Ch 24:6-10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001026/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Mt 17:24</a>; see <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001026/0">TAXATION</a>.</p>

<strong>Taxation</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>Taxes for Maintaining Jehovah’s Sanctuary.</strong> The service of the sanctuary was maintained through taxation. Obligatory tithing provided the major source of maintenance for the Aaronic priests and Levites, and on at least one occasion, they received a share of the war booty in accordance with a tax stipulated by Jehovah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004333/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Nu 18:26-29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004333/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 31:26-47</a>; see <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004333/0">TITHE</a>.) Jehovah also instructed Moses that after he took a census, each person registered was to give a half shekel ($1.10) as “Jehovah’s contribution,” it serving in behalf of the tent of meeting.

<strong>Ministry at the Temple Completed</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Regarding those whom he sends forth as his representatives, Jesus says: “Some of them you will kill and impale, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city; that there may come upon you all the righteous blood spilled on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah [called Jehoiada in 2 Chronicles], whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar.

When at the point of dying, Zechariah cried out: “Let Jehovah see to it and ask it back.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980169/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Chron. 24:21, 22</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Centuries later Jesus Christ evidently referred to this incident, saying: “The wisdom of God also said, ‘I will send forth to them prophets and apostles, and they will kill and persecute some of them, so that the blood of all the prophets spilled from the founding of the world may be required from this generation, from the blood of Abel down to the blood of Zechariah, who was slain between the altar and the house.’”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980169/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Luke 11:49-51</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Retribution did catch up with Jehoash just as it did later with the unfaithful generation of Jews in the first century C.E. Jehovah God withdrew his blessing and protection from this unappreciative king. A small Syrian military force under the command of Hazael successfully invaded Judah, forcing Jehoash to hand over treasures from the sanctuary. When the Syrian army withdrew, the king was a sick and broken man. Finally, two of his own servants assassinated him.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980169/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Ki. 12:17-21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980169/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 24:23-27</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">How different life could have been for Jehoash if he had remained an appreciative servant of Jehovah and had continued to experience divine favor and protection! Life can also be different for us, provided we maintain appreciation for God’s righteous requirements. A spirit of ingratitude can bring only ruin, as it did in the case of Jehoash. May we, therefore, strive to maintain keen appreciation for divine direction.</p>

<strong>Ministry at the Temple Completed</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Regarding those whom he sends forth as his representatives, Jesus says: “Some of them you will kill and impale, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city; that there may come upon you all the righteous blood spilled on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah [called Jehoiada in Second Chronicles], whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar. Truly I say to you, All these things will come upon this generation.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Because Zechariah chastised Israel’s leaders, “they conspired against him and pelted him with stones at the king’s commandment in the courtyard of Jehovah’s house.” But, as Jesus foretells, Israel will pay for all such righteous blood spilled. They pay 37 years later, in 70 C.E., when the Roman armies destroy Jerusalem and over a million Jews perish.</p>

<strong>Barachiah</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">It is generally understood that Jesus here referred to Zechariah “the son of Jehoiada the priest.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000558/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2Ch 24:20-22</a>) This is the most logical conclusion, since Chronicles is listed last in the traditional Jewish canon, thereby making Abel the first and Zechariah the last righteous man recorded in the Hebrew Scriptures as having been murdered. According to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000558/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 24:21</a>, Zechariah was murdered “in the courtyard of Jehovah’s house.” The altar of burnt offering was in the inner courtyard, outside of and in front of the entrance to the sanctuary. This would correspond with Jesus’ location of the incident “between the sanctuary and the altar.”</p>

<strong>Baptism</strong><br/><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">The passage at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010553/77/0" data-bid="78-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:29</a> is variously rendered by translators: “Why are they then baptized for the dead?” (<em>AV</em>); “on behalf of their dead?” (<em>AT</em>); “on behalf of the dead?” (<em>NEB</em>) Some argue that Paul was referring to the custom of vicarious baptism, that is, baptizing living “proxies” in the place of those who died unbaptized. The existence of such a practice by either Christians or apostates in Paul’s day cannot be proved, nor would it be in accord with the Scriptural requirements of <em>personal</em> belief, faith and decision on the part of the individual. The entire verse (29) reads, in the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures:</em> “Otherwise, what will they do who are being baptized for the purpose of being dead ones? If the dead are not to be raised up at all, why are they also being baptized for the purpose of <span id="page189" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="189" data-before-text="189"></span>being such?” Paul’s words following this statement may shed light on the matter. He goes on to say that he and his companions were in peril every hour, and that he himself faced death daily.

The individual does not determine what the will of God is for him, but it is God who makes the decision as to the use of the individual and the placing of such one in the framework of His purposes. For example, in times past, the entire nation of Israel was in special relationship with God; they were Jehovah’s property.

<strong>Barachiah</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Concerning both Abel and Zechariah a reckoning for the shedding of their blood was foretold.

As Zechariah was dying he said: “Let Jehovah see to it and ask it back.” Very soon his prophetic words began to be fulfilled. A small Syrian <span id="page255" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="255" data-before-text="255"></span>force came up, and Jehovah delivered a great military force of Judah into their hand, the princes of Judah being greatly ruined and despoiled.

<strong>Zechariah</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><strong>12.</strong> Son of High Priest Jehoiada. After Jehoiada’s death, King Jehoash turned away from true worship, listening to wrong counsel rather than to Jehovah’s prophets. Zechariah, Jehoash’s cousin (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004681/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2Ch 22:11</a>), sternly warned the people about this, but instead of repenting, they stoned him in the temple courtyard. Zechariah’s dying words were: “Let Jehovah see to it and ask it back.” This prophetic request was granted, for not only did Syria do great damage to Judah but also Jehoash was killed by two of his servants “because of the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest.” The Greek <em>Septuagint</em> and the Latin <em>Vulgate</em> say that Jehoash was killed to avenge the blood of the “son” of Jehoiada. The Masoretic text and the Syriac <em>Peshitta,</em> however, read “sons,” possibly using the plural number to denote the excellence and worth of Jehoiada’s son Zechariah the prophet-priest.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004681/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2Ch 24:17-22,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004681/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 25</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Zechariah the son of Jehoiada is most likely the one whom Jesus had in mind when prophesying that “the blood of all the prophets spilled from the founding of the world” will be required “from this generation [the Jews of the time of Jesus’ earthly ministry], from the blood of Abel down to the blood of Zechariah, who was slain between the altar and the house.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004681/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Lu 11:50, 51</a>) The places mentioned as the site of the slaying correspond. In the first century C.E., Chronicles was the last book in the canon of the Hebrew Scriptures. So Jesus’ phrase, “from Abel . . . to Zechariah,” was similar to our expression, “from Genesis to Revelation.” In the parallel account at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004681/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 23:35</a>, Zechariah is called the son of Barachiah, possibly another name for Jehoiada, unless, by chance, it indicates a generation between Jehoiada and Zechariah or is the name of an earlier ancestor.​—See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004681/0">BARACHIAH</a>.</p>

<strong>Baptism</strong><br/><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">The passage at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010553/77/0" data-bid="78-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:29</a> is variously rendered by translators: “Why are they then baptized for the dead?” (<em>AV</em>); “on behalf of their dead?” (<em>AT</em>); “on behalf of the dead?” (<em>NEB</em>) Some argue that Paul was referring to the custom of vicarious baptism, that is, baptizing living “proxies” in the place of those who died unbaptized. The existence of such a practice by either Christians or apostates in Paul’s day cannot be proved, nor would it be in accord with the Scriptural requirements of <em>personal</em> belief, faith and decision on the part of the individual. The entire verse (29) reads, in the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures:</em> “Otherwise, what will they do who are being baptized for the purpose of being dead ones? If the dead are not to be raised up at all, why are they also being baptized for the purpose of <span id="page189" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="189" data-before-text="189"></span>being such?” Paul’s words following this statement may shed light on the matter. He goes on to say that he and his companions were in peril every hour, and that he himself faced death daily.

The individual does not determine what the will of God is for him, but it is God who makes the decision as to the use of the individual and the placing of such one in the framework of His purposes. For example, in times past, the entire nation of Israel was in special relationship with God; they were Jehovah’s property.

<strong>Zechariah</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><strong>12.</strong> Son of High Priest Jehoiada. After Jehoiada’s death, King Jehoash turned away from true worship, listening to wrong counsel rather than to Jehovah’s prophets. Zechariah, Jehoash’s cousin (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004681/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2Ch 22:11</a>), sternly warned the people about this, but instead of repenting, they stoned him in the temple courtyard. Zechariah’s dying words were: “Let Jehovah see to it and ask it back.” This prophetic request was granted, for not only did Syria do great damage to Judah but also Jehoash was killed by two of his servants “because of the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest.” The Greek <em>Septuagint</em> and the Latin <em>Vulgate</em> say that Jehoash was killed to avenge the blood of the “son” of Jehoiada. The Masoretic text and the Syriac <em>Peshitta,</em> however, read “sons,” possibly using the plural number to denote the excellence and worth of Jehoiada’s son Zechariah the prophet-priest.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004681/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2Ch 24:17-22,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004681/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 25</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Zechariah the son of Jehoiada is most likely the one whom Jesus had in mind when prophesying that “the blood of all the prophets spilled from the founding of the world” will be required “from this generation [the Jews of the time of Jesus’ earthly ministry], from the blood of Abel down to the blood of Zechariah, who was slain between the altar and the house.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004681/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Lu 11:50, 51</a>) The places mentioned as the site of the slaying correspond. In the first century C.E., Chronicles was the last book in the canon of the Hebrew Scriptures. So Jesus’ phrase, “from Abel . . . to Zechariah,” was similar to our expression, “from Genesis to Revelation.” In the parallel account at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004681/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 23:35</a>, Zechariah is called the son of Barachiah, possibly another name for Jehoiada, unless, by chance, it indicates a generation between Jehoiada and Zechariah or is the name of an earlier ancestor.​—See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004681/0">BARACHIAH</a>.</p>

And all that generation too were gathered to their fathers, and another generation began to rise after them.” The gathering of all these to their fathers signifies that they all descended to Sheol, Haʹdes.</p><p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu">28.

Long afterward, on the festival day of Shabuoth (Pentecost) of 33 C.E., David was reported to be still in Sheol or Haʹdes. On that day the Christian apostle Peter reported that Psalm Sixteen <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Ps 16</a> (composed by David) had then been fulfilled in David’s promised descendant, Jesus Christ. As Peter said concerning David: “He saw beforehand and spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he forsaken in Haʹdes nor did his flesh see corruption. This Jesus God resurrected, of which fact we are all witnesses. . . . Actually David did not ascend to the heavens.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Acts 2:1-34</a>) According to Peter’s words David’s resurrection is yet future.</p><p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu">29, 30.

By turning back his people to the law of Jehovah God, Josiah tried to do what he could to prevent national calamity from coming upon them. When he inquired through the prophetess Huldah what the future held for his nation, Josiah was given this promise from God: “Here I am gathering you to your forefathers, and you will certainly be gathered to your own graveyard in peace, and your eyes will not look upon all the calamity that I am bringing upon this place.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">2 Ki. 22:20</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"><sup>30</sup></span> Josiah died from a wound received in battle at Megiddo. So it was not during the terrible calamity that was to come upon Jerusalem. After Josiah was fatally wounded, “his servants took him down from the chariot and had him ride in the second war chariot that was his and brought him to Jerusalem. Thus he died and was buried in the graveyard of his forefathers; and all Judah and Jerusalem were mourning over Josiah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">2 Chron. 35:22-24</a>) Not all the kings of Jerusalem who preceded Josiah were buried in the same place at Jerusalem, in the “burial places of the kings of Israel.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">2 Chron. 28:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/41/1" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> 21:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/41/2" data-bid="42-3" class="b"> 24:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/41/3" data-bid="42-4" class="b"> 32:33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/41/4" data-bid="42-5" class="b"> 16:14</a>.</p><p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">31, 32.

While not bordering directly on the sea, the area assigned to Zebulun was situated between the Sea of Galilee on the E and the Mediterranean on the W and thus gave the Zebulunites easy access to both bodies of water. Hence, the could easily engage in commercial trade, which may be alluded to by Moses’ words of blessing: “Rejoice O Zebulun, in your going out.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014574/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Deut. 33:18</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">At the time the distribution of the Promised Land continued from Shiloh the third lot was drawn for Zebulun.
