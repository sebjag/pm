Why, at least initially, you may feel so numb that you cannot even cry. This is not abnormal.

<strong>Light</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><strong>Other Figurative Uses.</strong> The Scriptures contain many figurative references to light.

<strong>Light</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Light from the sun is a combination of colors, with each color having a different wavelength. The color of an object is determined by the particular portion of the light reflected by its surface. Thus light furnishes the many hues that delight the eye of man. <span id="page1067" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1067" data-before-text="1067"></span>It is also essential for earthly life—plants, animals and man—to continue.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>THE SOURCE OF LIGHT</strong></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jehovah God is the Former of light and the Creator of darkness. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 45:7</a>) It was on the first creative day that he said: “Let light come to be.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 1:3</a>) Earlier he had created the heavens (including the “great lights,” the sun, moon and stars; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 136:7-9</a>) and the earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gen. 1:1</a>) So the bringing of light into existence with reference to the earth apparently involved removing whatever had formerly obstructed the sun’s rays from reaching this planet. And the “division” between light and darkness must have come about through the rotation of the earth as it moved around the sun. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 1:4, 5</a>) Much later Jehovah plagued the sun-worshiping Egyptians with darkness, a darkness that did not affect the Israelites. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ex. 10:21-23</a>) In leading his people out of Egypt, he provided light by means of a pillar of fire.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ex. 13:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 14:19, 20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Ps. 78:14</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The Scriptures repeatedly associate light with its Creator.

There was something like the appearance of the bow that occurs in a cloud mass on the day of a pouring rain. That is how the appearance was of the brightness round about. It was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ezek. 1:27, 28</a>) Centuries earlier, just a partial manifestation of that glory caused Moses’ face to emit rays.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ex. 33:22, 23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 34:29, 30</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“God is light and there is no darkness at all in union with him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 John 1:5</a>) He is righteous, upright and holy (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Deut. 32:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Rev. 4:8</a>), having nothing in common with the degrading and unclean practices commonly linked with darkness.

<strong>“A Time for Silence”</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">It is the course of discretion to guard our lips when in the presence of wicked people. When confronted by ridiculers in our ministry, silence may well be the proper response. Moreover, would it not sometimes be wise to remain silent so as not to convey an impression of approval when our schoolmates or coworkers tell off-color jokes or use vulgar language? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009365/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Eph. 5:3</a>) “I will set a muzzle as a guard to my own mouth,” wrote the psalmist, “as long as anyone wicked is in front of me.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009365/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 39:1</a>.</p>

<strong>Improving Your Answers</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> There may also be times when it is wise to say very little. You may simply wish to throw the burden of proof on the opponents, as the apostle Paul did when on trial. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971067/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 24:10-13</a>) Or you may even decide to be silent. This may be the best course if evil men seek to trip you up or to make sport of you while having no sincere desire to have their questions answered. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971067/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 23:8, 9</a>) Or, you may deem it wise to be silent because they are seeking, through you, to bring harm upon your fellow Witnesses. Said the psalmist David: “I will set a muzzle as a guard to my own mouth, as long as anyone wicked is in front of me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971067/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 39:1, 2</a>) Particularly in lands where there is fierce opposition to true Christianity there is need to be able to distinguish between the “time to keep quiet” and the “time to speak.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971067/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:7</a>.</p>

<strong>Progress Toward Taming the Tongue</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The tongue is but a tool of the mind and heart. Jesus said, “Out of the abundance <span id="page104" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="104" data-before-text="104"></span>of the heart the mouth speaks.” So we must go to the root of the trouble when seeking to tame an unruly tongue. We must work to erase from mind and heart the urges that drive the tongue to make foolish talk. If the mind and heart are filled with what is good, they will not empower the tongue to gossip, lie, flatter, play the hypocrite, and mouth obscenities. The properly filled mind and heart will have no room for such follies.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matt. 12:34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 15:18, 19</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Not only will the Christian mind shut the mouth against sending out meddling talk, but it will close the ears to incoming gossip, and discourage backbiters by meeting them with a displeased countenance. “The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.” Or, “The north wind bringeth forth rain; so doth a backbiting tongue an angry countenance.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Prov. 25:23</a>, <em>m.; AS</em>) The discerning mind knows that criticizing and gossiping about others is an indirect way of exalting and bragging on self. To run down others brings a false and deceptive sense of superiority. Hence the Christian aids both himself and the talebearer by refusing to listen. Without refueling the fire dies out.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps. 141:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Prov. 14:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/25/2" data-bid="26-3" class="b"> 17:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/25/3" data-bid="26-4" class="b"> 20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/25/4" data-bid="26-5" class="b"> 20:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/25/5" data-bid="26-6" class="b"> 26:20, 21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/25/6" data-bid="26-7" class="b"> 28:23</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Recall Jesus’ parable of the sheep and goats. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Matt. 25:31-46</a>) What the goats did to Christ’s brothers was counted as done to him. What we do to those brothers is counted as done to Christ. Would you gossip about your Lord? find fault with him? carry tales against him? Would you try to lie about him or to him? flatter him? play the hypocrite toward him? Or would you feel free to approach him with obscene jests? If you would not do these things with him, do not do them with your brothers. Do not commit the goats’ error!</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">So seek to progress toward taming the tongue by crowding out the evil with the good. “Brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are of serious concern, whatever things are righteous, whatever things are chaste, whatever things are lovable, whatever things are well spoken of, whatever virtue there is and whatever praiseworthy thing there is, continue considering these things.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Phil. 4:8</a>, <em>NW</em>) By studying God’s Word make your mind over, that it may make your unruly tongue over: “Quit being fashioned after this system of things, but be transformed by making your mind over, that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and complete will of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Rom. 12:2</a>, <em>NW</em>) By continual study gain more of such knowledge that will clothe you with a personality imaged after Christ: “Strip off the old personality with its practices, and clothe yourselves with the new personality which through accurate knowledge is being renewed according to the image of the one who created it.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Col. 3:9, 10</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Until such changes occur fully through study and the aid of God’s spirit and allow for complete taming of the tongue, all of us will have to keep close watch over that little member, each looking to his own, keeping its fires banked and controlled. Keep words few and cool when circumstances are unsettling, as counseled: “Where words abound, sin is not wanting: he who controls his tongue is a wise man. He guards his life who guards his lips: he who talks freely—it is ruin to him! A man of sense is sparing of his words; the prudent will keep cool. He who is careful of his lips and tongue will manage to keep clear of trouble.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Prov. 10:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 13:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/30/2" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> 17:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951121/30/3" data-bid="31-4" class="b"> 21:23</a>, <em>Mo</em>) Keep the tongue tamed down and bridled when tempers rise, clamping your hand over your mouth if necessary.

<strong>“Man” in the Hebrew Scriptures</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><em>Ish,</em> together with its plural form <em>anashím</em> (which at times also serves as the plural of <em>enósh</em>), has primarily the thought of “man,” or a person, an individual. It has no such overtones as human, mortal or able-bodied, although inherent in it is the thought of strength as of a male. The word <em>ish</em> does not appear in the Scriptures until after the word for woman, <em>ishsháh</em>—a man with a womb—appears, for in the <span id="page57" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="57" data-before-text="57"></span>strictest sense of the word only then did an <em>ish</em> become apparent; before that he was called the human, <em>adám.</em> When in the Hebrew Scriptures man is mentioned in relation to woman or sexual intercourse, invariably <em>ish</em> is used, some seventy times in all, although the word for “male” is <em>zakhár</em> and occurs seventy-nine times from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 1:27</a> onward. Typical is <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Leviticus, chapter 20</a>, dealing with God’s law regarding sex relations.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><em>Ish,</em> with its emphasis on the person, the individual, is the choice of Bible writers when writing about a “man of God,” and a “man of discernment.” When Nathan confronted King David with his sin, Nathan used this word. Did he say, “You yourself are the”—mortal? human? able-bodied man? No, but, “You yourself are [the one] the man!”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Josh. 14:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Prov. 10:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 2 Sam. 12:7</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">There are times when the other words for “man” simply would not be appropriate. Thus when the psalmist foretold that the names of those of the body of Christ who gain heavenly glory would be known he could use only <em>ish. “‘Each</em> and <em>every one</em> was born in her.’ . . . Jehovah himself will declare, when recording the peoples: ‘This is one who was born there.’” Also Moses, when exulting over Jehovah’s victory at the Red Sea, could not have referred to Jehovah as a weak mortal or a human earthling, and so had to use <em>ish</em> to convey his thought, even as rendered in the <em>New World Translation:</em> “Jehovah is a manly person of war.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 87:5, 6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Ex. 15:3</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss">“<strong>ADÁM”</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn"><em>Adám,</em> the human, the earthling, is the choice whenever Hebrew Scripture writers make reference to the creation of man: “I myself have made the earth and have created even man [the human] upon it.” <em>Adám</em> does not denote maleness any more than <em>human</em> does, and so we read that Adam, that is, the human, earthling man, called the first human pair, the <em>ish</em> and <em>ishsháh,</em> the man and the woman.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isa. 45:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Gen. 5:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 6:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/7/3" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> Deut. 4:32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/7/4" data-bid="8-5" class="b"> Eccl. 7:29</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><em>Adám</em>, the human, is almost without exception also the word preferred when man is mentioned in the same breath with the lower animals or beasts. This coupling appears in the accounts of creation, the Deluge, the plagues of Egypt and the seventy-year desolation. The psalmist praises Jehovah God for preserving both <em>adám</em> (human) and beast. And it is the human that is shown to be like the beast by the Congregator: “For there is an eventuality as respects the sons of mankind [<em>adám</em>] and an eventuality as respects the beast, and they have the same eventuality. As the one dies, so the other dies; and they all have but one spirit, so that there is no superiority of the man [human, <em>adám</em>] over the beast, for everything is vanity.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Gen. 1:26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 6:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Ex. 8:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/8/3" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> Jer. 33:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/8/4" data-bid="9-5" class="b"> Ps. 36:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/8/5" data-bid="9-6" class="b"> Eccl. 3:19-21</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Fittingly, <em>adám</em>, the earthling, human, is also the choice when speaking of the general characteristics of humankind: “The inclination of the heart of <em>man</em> is bad from his youth up.” “There is no <em>man</em> that does not sin.” “<em>Man,</em> born of woman, is short-lived and glutted with agitation.” “Surely every earthling man . . . is nothing but an exhalation,” a breath. “There is no <em>man</em> having power over the spirit to restrain the spirit,” that is, to keep from dying. “I well know, O Jehovah, that to <em>earthling man</em> his way does not belong. It does not belong to man [<em>ish</em>, to one] who is walking even to direct his step.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Gen. 8:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 1 Ki. 8:46;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Job 14:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/9/3" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> Ps. 39:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/9/4" data-bid="10-5" class="b"> Eccl. 8:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/9/5" data-bid="10-6" class="b"> Jer. 10:23</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Even as <em>adám</em> sets man apart from the lower animals, so it also calls attention to <span id="page58" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="58" data-before-text="58"></span>man’s inferiority to the Creator, Jehovah God. Thus Moses was told that no human could see God and live. Samuel was reminded that a human can see only the outside, but God can see the heart. David prayed that he might not fall into human hands but into God’s hands, for having numbered the fighting men of his nation presumptuously. The temple of Solomon, David said, was to be built, not for humans, but for God. Jehoshaphat counseled the judges to remember that they were judging, not for humans, but for God. Elihu refused to give flattering titles to mere humans.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ex. 33:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 1 Sam. 16:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 1 Chron. 21:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/3" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 29:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/4" data-bid="11-5" class="b"> 2 Chron. 19:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/5" data-bid="11-6" class="b"> Job 32:21</a>.</p>
