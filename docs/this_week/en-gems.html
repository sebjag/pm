Even in Judah and Jerusalem, where Jehovah’s temple beckoned to true worship, the Judeans fell away to paganism. However, when Hezekiah ascended to Jehovah’s throne in Jerusalem, in 745 B.C.E., he shone forth like a bright star in the line of Davidic kings. “And in every work that he started in the service of the house <span id="page148" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="148" data-before-text="148"></span>of the true God and in the law and in the commandment to search for his God, it was with all his heart that he acted, and he proved successful.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968164/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Chron. 31:21</a>) What a splendid example for all who worship Jehovah today!</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">3, 4.

Its restoration was planned next in order after the reopening of the temple, and even before the Assyrian made his final, crushing assault on Israel to the north. “And Hezekiah proceeded to send to all Israel and Judah, and even letters he wrote to Ephraim and Manasseh [in Israel], to come to the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem to hold the passover to Jehovah the God of Israel. However, the king and his princes and all the congregation in Jerusalem resolved to hold the passover in the second month; for they had not been able to hold it at that time, because not enough priests, on the one hand, had sanctified themselves and the people, on the other hand, had not gathered themselves to Jerusalem.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968164/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Chron. 30:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> In the fulfillment, also, a preliminary work had to take place. Especially in the spring of 1918 C.E., there came a fiery testing and purging of all of God’s people on earth. The anointed priestly class were cleansed of a fearful heart. Repenting of the measure of compromise they had shown during World War I, they were again gathered to Jehovah’s worship. Now, as expressed in the <em>Watchtower</em> articles entitled “Blessed Are the Fearless,” published in 1919, they were “ready, willing and anxious at all times” to obey fearlessly the directions of their Lord, Jesus Christ. Conditions were right for renewing their sacrifice of praise to Jehovah, on the basis of the sacrifice of “the Lamb of God.”</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>THE CALL TO ASSEMBLE</strong></p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">5, 6.

Did Jehovah startle the earth by a miraculous proclamation through an angel from heaven? No. Jehovah used human couriers. “Accordingly the runners with the letters from the hand of the king and of his princes went throughout all Israel and Judah, even according to the commandment of the king, saying: ‘You sons of Israel, return to Jehovah the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, that he may return to the escaped ones that are left of you out of the palm of the kings of Assyria.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968164/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Chron. 30:6</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Since the year 1919, couriers from the modern-day Christian congregation have gone forth throughout the realm of Christendom, with a joyous call to assemble to Jehovah’s worship. After the pattern of Jesus and his apostles, who “went journeying from city to city and from village to village, preaching and declaring the good news of the kingdom of God,” and telling things profitable “from house to house,” these have appealed to the consciences of honesthearted persons still captive in Christendom’s religious organizations, that they may “return to Jehovah,” for salvation.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968164/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Luke 8:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968164/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Acts 20:20</a>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 7.

Today, as in Hezekiah’s day, that is the vital question. Let all who truly love righteousness turn from divisive nationalism, and from pagan religion and philosophy. Let them un-stiffen their necks, and honor Jehovah, their Creator. “Now do <span id="page149" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="149" data-before-text="149"></span>not stiffen your neck as your forefathers did. Give place to Jehovah and come to his sanctuary that he has sanctified to time indefinite and serve Jehovah your God, that his burning anger may turn back from you. . . . for Jehovah your God is gracious and merciful, and he will not turn away the face from you if you return to him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968164/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Chron. 30:8, 9</a>) Ah, but who will humble themselves before Jehovah? The Jews of the ten-tribe kingdom clung to their Baal worship. And today, the invitation to the unified worship of Jehovah at his temple has met only with mocking contempt by the clergy of Christendom.</p>

<strong>Bible Book Number 14—2 Chronicles</strong><br/><p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[76]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="28"><sup>28</sup></span> A tremendous Passover is planned, but since there is no time to prepare it in the first month, a provision of the Law is taken advantage of, and it is celebrated in the second month of the first year of Hezekiah’s reign. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990075/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">2 Chron. 30:2, 3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990075/39/1" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> Num. 9:10, 11</a>) The king invites not only all Judah to attend but Israel as well, and while some in Ephraim, Manasseh, and Zebulun mock the invitation, others humble themselves and come to Jerusalem along with all Judah. Following the Passover, the Festival of Unfermented Cakes is held. What a joyous seven-day feast it is! So upbuilding, indeed, that all the congregation extends the feast another seven days. There is “great rejoicing in Jerusalem, for from the days of Solomon the son of David the king of Israel there was none like this in Jerusalem.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990075/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">2 Chron. 30:26</a>) The spiritually restored people follow up with a smashing campaign to rid both Judah and Israel of idolatry, while Hezekiah, on his part, restores the material contributions for the Levites and the temple services.</p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">God’s Law to Israel had a special arrangement for someone who was not in a position to partake of the regular Passover meal; the individual could do so a month (30 days) later. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985128/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Numbers 9:10, 11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985128/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 2 Chronicles 30:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985128/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 15</a>) Comparably, in an extreme situation with a spiritual Israelite who absolutely cannot attend or be served the emblems on Nisan 14, he or she could partake 30 days later. This would apply only in the case of an anointed Christian who is under command to partake of the bread and the wine.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985128/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Galatians 6:16</a>.</p>

Its restoration was planned next in order after the reopening of the temple, and even before the Assyrian made his final, crushing assault on Israel to the north. “And Hezekiah proceeded to send to all Israel and Judah, and even letters he wrote to Ephraim and Manasseh [in Israel], to come to the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem to hold the passover to Jehovah the God of Israel. However, the king and his princes and all the congregation in Jerusalem resolved to hold the passover in the second month; for they had not been able to hold it at that time, because not enough priests, on the one hand, had sanctified themselves and the people, on the other hand, had not gathered themselves to Jerusalem.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968164/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Chron. 30:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> In the fulfillment, also, a preliminary work had to take place.

Repenting of the measure of compromise they had shown during World War I, they were again gathered to Jehovah’s worship. Now, as expressed in the <em>Watchtower</em> articles entitled “Blessed Are the Fearless,” published in 1919, they were “ready, willing and anxious at all times” to obey fearlessly the directions of their Lord, Jesus Christ.

<strong>Beer-sheba</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Beer-sheba came to stand for the southernmost point in describing the length of the Promised Land, as expressed in the proverbial phrase “from Dan down to Beer-sheba” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000615/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jg 20:1</a>), or, in a converse direction, “from Beer-sheba to Dan.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000615/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Ch 21:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000615/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2Ch 30:5</a>) After the division of the nation into two kingdoms, Beer-sheba continued to be used to indicate the southern extremity of the kingdom of Judah in the expressions “from Geba as far as Beer-sheba” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000615/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2Ki 23:8</a>) and “from Beer-sheba to the mountainous region of Ephraim” (where the northern kingdom of Israel began). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000615/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2Ch 19:4</a>) In postexilic times the expression was used in a yet more limited form to refer to the area occupied by the repatriated men of Judah, extending from Beer-sheba “clear to the valley of Hinnom.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000615/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ne 11:27,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000615/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 30</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In reality, there were other towns of the Promised Land that lay to the S of Beer-sheba, even as there were Israelite towns N of Dan. However, both Dan and Beer-sheba were situated at natural frontiers of the land. In the case of Beer-sheba, its position was below the mountains of Judah on the edge of the desert. Additionally, it was one of the principal cities of Judah (along with Jerusalem and Hebron), and this was not only because it had an excellent supply of water as compared with the surrounding region, thus allowing for both farming and grazing of herds and flocks, but also because important roads converged on it from several directions. From Egypt an ancient route led up by the “Way of the Wells” through Kadesh-barnea to Beer-sheba, being joined by another road over which traveled the camel caravans from the “Spice Kingdoms” of the Arabian Peninsula, heading for Philistia or Judah. From Ezion-geber, at the head of the Gulf of ʽAqaba, another route led up through the Arabah and then turned W, climbing the Ascent of Akrabbim to Beer-sheba. At Gaza, in the Philistine Plain, a road branching from the highway led SE to Beer-sheba. And, connecting it with the rest of Judah, a road ran from Beer-sheba to the NE, climbing the plateau up into the mountains of Judah to Jerusalem and points farther N.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000615/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ge 22:19</a>.</p>

<strong>‘The Spirit Returns to God’</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Then, too, the way the word “return” is used in the Bible does not require an actual movement from one place to another. For example, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101972572/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 30:6</a> says: “You sons of Israel, return to Jehovah the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, that he may return to the escaped ones.” Israel’s ‘returning’ to Jehovah meant a turning around from a wrong course and again conforming to God’s way. And Jehovah’s ‘returning’ to Israel meant his turning favorable attention to his people once again. The return in both cases involved an attitude, not a literal movement from one location to another.</p>

<strong>Hezekiah</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Since the people’s uncleanness prevented their observance of the Passover at the regular time, Hezekiah took advantage of the law that allowed those who are unclean to celebrate the Passover one month later. He called not only Judah but also Israel by means of letters sent by runners throughout the land from Beer-sheba to Dan. The runners met with derision from many; but individuals, particularly from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun, humbled themselves to come, some from Ephraim and Issachar also attending. Besides this, many non-Israelite worshipers of Jehovah were on hand. It was likely a difficult matter for those in the northern kingdom who stood for true worship to attend. They, like the messengers, would meet opposition and ridicule, inasmuch as the ten-tribe kingdom was in a decadent state, sunk in false worship and harassed by the Assyrian menace.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002011/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2Ch 30:1-20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002011/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Nu 9:10-13</a>.</p>

<strong>Festival of Unfermented Cakes</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In the other two instances the circumstances are outstanding. One is the revival of the observance of the Festival of Unfermented Cakes, after a time of neglect. This revival was during the first year of faithful King Hezekiah’s reign. Interestingly, in this case there was not enough time to prepare for the annual festival on Nisan 15, because the work of cleaning and repairing the temple took until Nisan 16. So, advantage was taken of the Law to celebrate the festival during the second month. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001510/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2Ch 29:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001510/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 30:13,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001510/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 21, 22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001510/8/3" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> Nu 9:10, 11</a>) It was such a joyous occasion and resulted in such a religious revival that the celebration of seven days proved to be just too short, and so another seven days were set aside. King Hezekiah and his princes contributed generously, giving 2,000 bulls and 17,000 sheep to supply food for the multitudes attending.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001510/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2Ch 30:23, 24</a>.</p>

It appears that <em>shoh·pharʹ</em> trumpets were also blown at this time as well as on the other new moons, as indicated by <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011468/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 81:3</a>. Tradition also holds that both kinds were used in the Festival of Trumpets.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">This festival, of course, would be an important one, not only because the month it initiated saw the beginning of a new agricultural and labor year, but also because the Day of Atonement fell on the tenth day of this month and the Festival of Booths began on the fifteenth. The completion of ingathering of the crops of the outgoing year would take place in this month. The crops gathered during this month would include grapes for wine, which makes the heart of man rejoice, and olives, which, among other things, supplied food and oil for light and for use in connection with many of the grain offerings. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011468/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 104:15</a>) Truly this festival marked the start of a month for thankfulness to Jehovah.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Up with the True, Down with the False!</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Who will support Jehovah’s true worship? Today, as in Hezekiah’s day, that is the vital question. Let all who truly love righteousness turn from divisive nationalism, and from pagan religion and philosophy. Let them un-stiffen their necks, and honor Jehovah, their Creator. “Now do <span id="page149" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="149" data-before-text="149"></span>not stiffen your neck as your forefathers did. Give place to Jehovah and come to his sanctuary that he has sanctified to time indefinite and serve Jehovah your God, that his burning anger may turn back from you. . . . for Jehovah your God is gracious and merciful, and he will not turn away the face from you if you return to him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968164/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Chron. 30:8, 9</a>) Ah, but who will humble themselves before Jehovah? The Jews of the ten-tribe kingdom clung to their Baal worship. And today, the invitation to the unified worship of Jehovah at his temple has met only with mocking contempt by the clergy of Christendom.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 8. What has been required of those heeding the call, but what “one heart” have they shown?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> “So the runners continued on, passing along from city to city throughout the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, even to Zebulun; but they were continually speaking in mockery of them and deriding them.” It was left for a small remnant, a few individuals only from the northern tribes, to heed Jehovah’s call. “Only individuals from Asher and Manasseh and from Zebulun humbled themselves so that they came to Jerusalem.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968164/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Chron. 30:10, 11</a>) So, since 1919, only a small number of those professing Christianity have come out for Jehovah’s worship at his cleansed temple. The great religious systems of Christendom have proudly maintained their idolatrous stand as part of the world empire of false religion. But among the energetic praisers of Jehovah there has been “one heart to perform the commandment of the king and the princes in the matter of Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968164/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Chron. 31:12</a>.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> 9. How does the ancient record point to the only way of salvation?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> More than two hundred years before Hezekiah’s day, priests, Levites and others had abandoned the idolatrous northern kingdom at its founding, and had come up to worship Jehovah in Jerusalem. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968164/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Chron. 11:13-16</a>) And now, those who came up out of Asher, Manasseh and Zebulun also placed themselves in the way of salvation. No doubt many of these continued their worship at the place he had chosen, his temple at Jerusalem, until Assyrian nationalism swallowed up Israel. Thus they found salvation with Jehovah’s true worshipers when “Israel went off its own soil into exile in Assyria.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968164/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Ki. 17:23</a>) In this day when nationalism is again on the rampage, may we also cling to true worship for salvation!</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">10. What cleansing work still remained in Jerusalem, and what does this indicate today?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Purification from deep-seated practices of false worship is not accomplished in an instant. Thus, as those Judeans and Israelites celebrated the Passover and the seven-day feast of unfermented cakes that followed, they had to give attention also to cleaning out from Jerusalem the remnants of demon worship. “Then they rose up and removed the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the incense altars they removed and then threw them into the torrent valley of Kidron.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968164/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Chron. 30:14</a>) Onto the rubbish dump with them! Only with this cleansing work accomplished were they in fit condition to celebrate the Passover. This brings clearly home to us today that Jehovah’s true worshipers must free themselves of every last vestige of paganism. Images, religious emblems, altars, pictures depicting religious error—all of these must be gotten out of our affections, out of our homes, out of the New World society of Jehovah’s Christian witnesses!</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">11, 12.

<strong>Festival of Unfermented Cakes</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In the other two instances the circumstances are outstanding. One is the revival of the observance of the Festival of Unfermented Cakes, after a time of neglect. This revival was during the first year of faithful King Hezekiah’s reign. Interestingly, in this case there was not enough time to prepare for the annual festival on Nisan 15, because the work of cleaning and repairing the temple took until Nisan 16. So, advantage was taken of the Law to celebrate the festival during the second month. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001510/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2Ch 29:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001510/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 30:13,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001510/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 21, 22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001510/8/3" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> Nu 9:10, 11</a>) It was such a joyous occasion and resulted in such a religious revival that the celebration of seven days proved to be just too short, and so another seven days were set aside. King Hezekiah and his princes contributed generously, giving 2,000 bulls and 17,000 sheep to supply food for the multitudes attending.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001510/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2Ch 30:23, 24</a>.</p>

<strong>Honey, Honeycomb</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The temptation to sexual immorality that the “strange woman” can bring to bear by her appeal to a man with her use of charm and smooth words is described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012015/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Proverbs, chapters five and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012015/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> seven</a>. It constitutes a fine warning to Christians today. “As a honeycomb the lips of a strange woman keep dripping, and her palate is smoother than oil. But the aftereffect from her is as bitter as wormwood; it <span id="page786" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="786" data-before-text="786"></span>is as sharp as a two-edged sword. Her feet are descending to death,” says the wise man. Her smooth, honeylike words and actions lead the man right up to the immoral act so that “all of a sudden he is going after her, like a bull that comes even to the slaughter.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012015/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Prov. 5:3-5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012015/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 7:21, 22</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>HONEY OF FRUITS</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The Hebrew word <em>d<sup>e</sup>vashʹ</em> can refer also to the juice or syrup of fruits—figs, dates, and so forth.

That bee honey is not meant here is indicated by the next verse, which included the prohibited “honey” as firstfruits. Most of the honey used by the Israelites was wild honey, not a cultivated crop as in the case of grapes, figs, dates and other fruits. For the same reason the “honey” offered as firstfruits when Hezekiah motivated the people to support the priesthood was undoubtedly the juice or syrup of fruits.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012015/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Chron. 31:5</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>A LAND OF MILK AND HONEY</strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The description of Palestine as “a land flowing with milk and honey,” often repeated in the Scriptures, is apt, for not only was the product of bees abundant, but also the syrup of fruits.

It was August of 1961. Just thirty years previously, when my missionary service began in France and Belgium, there was a handful of Jehovah’s people in these countries. It seemed incredible that this huge crowd had become servants of Jehovah in three short decades. What a privilege to have had a share in this great gathering! How I thanked Jehovah for having helped me to remember him from my childhood.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It was shortly before the Armistice in 1918 that my parents were attracted by a poster advertising the lecture “Where Are the Dead?” It was sponsored by the International Bible Students Association. What mother learned at that talk was like a searchlight beam on the Scriptures. She was convinced that here was the truth. My father also decided to look into it, and soon weekly studies were held in our home.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">I was taken out of Sunday school, and mother explained to me that what I had been taught there about the soul, hell and the trinity was untrue. Every Sunday I was taken to the London Tabernacle and gradually I grew in knowledge and faith. It was in 1925 that I began to think seriously about my personal responsibility toward Jehovah. The enthusiasm manifested at the London convention that year made me happy to know the truth and to have my life before me to use to Jehovah’s praise. Though still at school, I decided to dedicate myself to God.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">At the time of my dedication, however, the thought of full-time service as a career did not come to my mind, for I was having much success in my studies and had just obtained a scholarship and grant that would permit me to pursue them further. When mother fell ill a problem confronted me: Should I go on with my studies or quit and look after her? I prayed earnestly for guidance and it was not long before I became convinced of Jehovah’s will for me.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The breakaway from school was not easy, but soon I saw all it could mean. Away from my former associates I was in closer contact with young brothers and sisters who were already in full-time service. The brothers chosen by the president of the Watch Tower Society to go to India and Spain made a very deep impression on me, and I realized how great was the need for workers in many countries.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">It was about this time that I heard a convention talk that I never forgot. It was based on <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963366/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 31:21</a>: “And in every work that [Hezekiah] started in the service of the house of the true God . . . it was with all his heart that he acted, and he proved successful.” If mother regained her health, I determined that my career would be full-time service to Jehovah, and that, like Hezekiah, I would act with all my heart in order to be successful.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The opportunity came first to do what was then called “auxiliary” pioneer work, a preaching activity that brought me much joy. In 1928 I was able to tell the Society <span id="page309" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="309" data-before-text="309"></span>that I could go wherever workers were needed. A little band of us were chosen for business-house work in some of England’s large cities. At first I felt that I could never undertake such a task—it was already a big pull to leave home—but examples like those of Moses and Jeremiah came to my mind and I felt that, if this was what Jehovah was asking me to do, he would help me to accomplish the task if I worked at it wholeheartedly. This he did, and the realization of this fact has often spurred me on when new tasks, beyond my own strength, have been assigned to me.</p>
