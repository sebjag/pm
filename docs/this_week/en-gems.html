<strong>Kiss</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><strong>Figurative Use.</strong> Kissing, as representing a demonstration of respect and devotion, is mentioned in the inspired advice to “serve Jehovah with fear” and “kiss the son, that He may not become incensed and you may not perish from the way.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002635/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ps 2:11, 12</a>) Persons responding favorably and submitting to the one God appoints as King and his Kingdom will realize great blessings when it can be said: “Righteousness and peace​—they have kissed each other,” because the connection of the two will be as evident to all as is the close association of affectionate friends.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002635/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps 85:10</a>.</p>

Suspicion and doubt among persons will give way to “trueness.” Deception and the selfish using of others, which is so evident in today’s world, will be replaced by “righteousness and peace,” which, symbolically speaking, will “kiss each other.”</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">With such qualities filling the hearts of those then living, would it seem to you there would be <em>any</em> loneliness?

<strong>Be “Sound in Mind” as the New Order Draws Near</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Undoubtedly, after the “great tribulation” there will be much home building. And, free from the crushing burden of the present system and its commercial greed, the earthly survivors living in God’s new order will surely be able to build truly pleasant places of residence. What point is being made, then? This: That God’s Word does not set forth in any detail what those homes will be like, as to their size, their modesty or their grandeur. Throughout its pages it leaves this unstated. Why? Because its appeal is not materialistic; it places greater emphasis on other blessings as the important things to focus our prime attention on. Consider, for example, the delightful picture presented us at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973442/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 85:10-13</a>. Showing what God’s favor and blessing can result in for a land and its people, it says:</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">17, 18. (a) How does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973442/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Psalm 85:10-13</a> illustrate this point? (b) What, then, are the features of New Order living that should have the greatest motivating force for us, and why?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> “As for loving-kindness and trueness, they have met each other; righteousness and peace​—they have kissed each other. Trueness itself will sprout out of the very earth, and righteousness itself will look down from the very heavens. Also, Jehovah, for his part, will give what is good, and our own land will give its yield. Before him righteousness itself will walk, and it will make a way by his steppings.”</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Note that this picture draws its beauty primarily from spiritual blessings, with only brief mention of material blessings from the land’s “yield.” The spiritual blessings are what should make us yearn for God’s new order. It is because of these things that we should be willing to work, sacrifice, yes, <em>and even die</em> in order to gain life in God’s new order. For these spiritual things are what the present system has never given and will never give us. In place of “loving-kindness” the present order is at heart cold, greedy, using one as long as one serves its purpose and then casting that one aside as worn out and to be forgotten. It abounds in falsehood, hypocrisy, double-dealing and fraud, not in “trueness.” Righteousness and peace have certainly not “kissed each other” in the present order. But in God’s new order these spiritual blessings will be evident earth wide and will combine in beautiful harmony to make life genuinely delightful​—for those whose hearts are righteous. The old order is capable of granting big homes, even mansions, to people, along with fine food​—in some lands a remarkable number of people have these. But it has not and never will bring the loving-kindness, trueness, peace and righteousness distinguishing God’s new order.</p>

<strong>A Society Without Crime</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Any person that loves righteousness should be sickened by the corrupt state of modern society. He should be revolted at the noisome disease of crime that has spread through it and corrupts it. No wonder that God, through his Word, commanded Christians to have no friendship with the world. To have friendship for it would make one an enemy of God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960120/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jas. 4:4</a>) But because modern society is corrupt, it does not mean that a society without crime is impossible. It does not mean that humans <span id="page100" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="100" data-before-text="100"></span>cannot live in a society that respects Scriptural principles, that is morally clean and upright and that is united in Christian love instead of being divided by hate, envy, maliciousness and strife.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">A society without crime can be a reality, but it cannot be brought about by police efforts or by groups that try to reform criminals. It cannot be produced by politicians or by the united efforts of the world’s governments. The job is too big for any of them. It is a task that only Jehovah God can perform. It requires a completely new system of things—a new world. The change is foretold at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960120/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 John 2:17</a>, which says: “Furthermore, the world is passing away and so is its desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever.”</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">God’s heavenly executioners will root out and destroy all who persist in following unlawful desires. No amount of chicanery on the part of a criminal will bring him escape from the execution of divine judgment. Note how the Bible long ago foretold God’s purging of the wicked from the earth: “But the transgressors themselves will certainly be annihilated together; the future of wicked people will indeed be cut off.” “For the upright are the ones that will reside in the earth, and the blameless are the ones that will be left over in it. As regards the wicked, they will be cut off from the very earth; and as for the treacherous, they will be torn away from it.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960120/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 37:38;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960120/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Prov. 2:21, 22</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Certainly the One who locked in the atom the stupendous energy that man is now tapping in his nuclear reactors and nuclear bombs is capable of locating and destroying every living criminal and every persistent violator of divine law. Although a person may have succeeded in hiding his criminal acts from the eyes of other humans, he cannot hide them from the eyes of God. “There is not a creation that is not manifest to his sight, but all things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of him with whom we have an accounting.” “The sins of some men are publicly manifest, leading immediately to judgment, but as for other men their sins also become manifest later.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960120/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Heb. 4:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960120/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 5:24</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">That a society without crime will follow God’s destruction of the present wicked system of things is assured by the type of government that will rule mankind then and by the type of people that will inhabit the earth. As you will note at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960120/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 John 2:17</a>, previously quoted, “he that does the will of God remains forever.” Those that do the will of God are not the ones that contribute to the corruption of modern society. They are the ones referred to at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960120/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:21</a> as the “upright” and “blameless” that will be left over in the earth after God has cleared it of the wicked. Jesus referred to them in his sermon on the mount when he said: “Happy are the mild-tempered ones, since they will inherit the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960120/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 5:5</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The government that will rule these “mild-tempered ones” that do God’s will is identified in the Bible as the kingdom of God. It is a heavenly government with Christ as King. With all mankind under the Kingdom rule crime will not be able to corrupt that New World society of righteous humans. Then it can be said: “Loving-kindness and trueness themselves have met each other; righteousness and peace themselves have kissed each other. . . . and righteousness itself will look down from the very heavens.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960120/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 85:10, 11</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sd">Let him judge the afflicted ones of the people, let him save the sons of the poor one, and let him crush the defrauded.

These all spoke the “pure language” of truth when on earth. Christ himself came to earth to “bear witness to the truth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974043/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 18:37</a>) And of his 144,000 associate kings, it is written: “No falsehood was found in their mouths.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974043/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Rev. 14:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974043/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Eph. 4:25</a>) In ruling for a thousand years they will see that the “pure language” is maintained by earth’s inhabitants.

And, free from the crushing burden of the present system and its commercial greed, the earthly survivors living in God’s new order will surely be able to build truly pleasant places of residence.

Throughout its pages it leaves this unstated. Why? Because its appeal is not materialistic; it places greater emphasis on other blessings as the important things to focus our prime attention on. Consider, for example, the delightful picture presented us at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973442/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 85:10-13</a>.

It is because of these things that we should be willing to work, sacrifice, yes, <em>and even die</em> in order to gain life in God’s new order. For these spiritual things are what the present system has never given and will never give us. In place of “loving-kindness” the present order is at heart cold, greedy, using one as long as one serves its purpose and then casting that one aside as worn out and to be forgotten. It abounds in falsehood, hypocrisy, double-dealing and fraud, not in “trueness.” Righteousness and peace have certainly not “kissed each other” in the present order. But in God’s new order these spiritual blessings will be evident earth wide and will combine in beautiful harmony to make life genuinely delightful​—for those whose hearts are righteous. The old order is capable of granting big homes, even mansions, to people, along with fine food​—in some lands a remarkable number of people have these. But it has not and never will bring the loving-kindness, trueness, peace and righteousness distinguishing God’s new order.</p>

And, free from the crushing burden of the present system and its commercial greed, the earthly survivors living in God’s new order will surely be able to build truly pleasant places of residence. What point is being made, then? This: That God’s Word does not set forth in any detail what those homes will be like, as to their size, their modesty or their grandeur. Throughout its pages it leaves this unstated. Why? Because its appeal is not materialistic; it places greater emphasis on other blessings as the important things to focus our prime attention on. Consider, for example, the delightful picture presented us at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973442/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 85:10-13</a>.

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page157" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="157" data-before-text="157"></span><strong>Prophesying with God’s Loyal Organization</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE psalmist David was at all times loyal to his God Jehovah. Well could he pray: “O do guard my soul, for I am loyal. Save your servant—you are my God—that is trusting in you. I laud you, O Jehovah my God, with all my heart, and I will glorify your name to time indefinite.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962170/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 86:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962170/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 12</a>.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1962170/0">a</a></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Surely all dedicated Christians want to be minded even as David was, loyal to Jehovah. However, we may not forget that loyalty to God also means being loyal to his organization. Does God have an organization? Yes, even as he had one in the days of ancient Israel and in apostolic times, so it is reasonable to conclude that he would have a visible organization on earth today. In fact, many religious organizations claim to be God’s church or organization. How, then, can we identify which one truly is?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the same way that the Jews in the days of the apostles were able to identify God’s loyal organization. How was that? By its having God’s holy spirit poured out upon it and giving proof of it by all flesh in it prophesying—sons and daughters, men slaves and women slaves. One and all, Luke tells, were speaking about the magnificent things of God as the result of the outpouring of God’s spirit at Pentecost.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962170/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 2:1-18</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Of all that claim to be God’s organization today, which one meets this requirement? There is only one possible answer: the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses. As their 1962 <em>Yearbook</em> shows, they count as their numbers only those who prophesy and that about the “magnificent things of God.” During 1961 there were 884,587 ministers throughout the world in 185 different lands and islands of the sea that shared in prophesying each month, and a peak for the year of 965,169.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Loyalty to God’s organization requires that we prophesy all we can, as effectively as possible and where we can do the most good. We may not hold back in any of these respects. We must take the quality of our prophesying seriously, ever seeking to become more able ministers. Nor may we content ourselves with but one hour a month if we can devote ten hours to prophesying. Ten hours a month is only one hour every three days, and surely we can find that much time for prophesying. And if we can do more, loyalty requires that we do more, even going to places where there is a greater need for witnesses if we are able to do so.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The <em>Yearbook</em> contains many interesting experiences had by Christian ministers as they engaged in prophesying from house to house and on return visits. It also tells of how effective incidental witnessing can be, that is, prophesying as opportunity affords, as at one’s place of business, while in a hospital or when at school. Are we always alert to opportunities, or better, to make opportunities to prophesy about the “magnificent things of God”?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">If we appreciate the great privilege it is to prophesy with God’s loyal organization, we will find ways to do so regardless of what obstacles may face us. Are we bedfast because of illness? Still, we can write letters or, if unable to write, dictate them for someone else to write down and send out as does one arthritic victim in the southern United States who can move nothing but her head. One invalid in Germany who is almost completely paralyzed kept writing letters as her form of prophesying and one day was rewarded by having the pleasure of meeting a stranger who, as the result of her letters, is now a witness of Jehovah. No question about it, all who feel like David, who said, “I will glorify your name to time indefinite,” can find opportunities to do so.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962170/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 86:12</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">As we thus make use of our opportunities to prophesy about the “magnificent things of God” let us remember that loyalty also requires us to make known God’s judgments. We must announce the doom of Christendom regardless of how unpopular it may make us; even though we be called “apostles of hate.” And as the prophet Zechariah foretold, we must make known these judgments even against a member of our own family or a close friend if we find that such a one has erred from the faith and is becoming an apostate.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962170/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Zech. 13:1-6</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Truly many and varied are the ways in which dedicated Christians can, may, should and must show their loyalty to God by prophesying with his loyal organization. During the month of March readers of <em>The Watchtower</em> are urged to share in this prophesying by offering this magazine to others on a subscription basis.</p>

<strong>Loyalty with a Unified Heart</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> In the eighty-sixth Psalm, in which <span id="page587" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="587" data-before-text="587"></span>he tells of being persecuted, David says: “Incline, O Jehovah, your ear. Answer me, for I am afflicted and poor. O do guard my soul, for I am loyal. Save your servant—you are my God—that is trusting in you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 86:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 17</a>) David had loyal love to Jehovah God, in whose kingdom he had been anointed to serve as the chief executive. In harmony with his own loyalty, he trusted in Jehovah God. He expected God to be loyal to him and to those who suffered with him for the kingdom. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 18:25</a> David said to God: “With someone loyal you will act in loyalty.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Sam. 22:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 26</a>) So, if we are dedicated to the interests of God’s kingdom and are seeking it first, then we too, like David, will strive to be loyal to God, whose kingdom it is. In that case we can be sure of God’s loyalty to us. How wonderful it is to think that God is loyal to us! Yet, despite its wonderfulness, we read: “‘I am loyal,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Jer. 3:12</a>) It is right for us to be loyal to God, who is loyal to us.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">13. From what organ does loyalty proceed, and so what must we do as regards loyalty?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> Loyalty is from the heart. We cannot be loyal if our hearts are divided in their affections, their love, their attachment. We cannot be loyal if we fear anyone who opposes the object of our love and devotion and who persecutes us for this reason. Our persecutors and opposers act as servants of Satan the Devil, and their purpose is to break our loyalty to God and his kingdom. If we want to seek first his kingdom and to preach it as Jesus Christ did, it becomes necessary for us to cultivate loyalty and always to nurture it, feed it, and to put away the fear of the enemy. David indicated for us how to do this when he said, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 86:10, 11</a>: “You are God, you alone. Instruct me, O Jehovah, about your way. I shall walk in your truth. Unify my heart to fear your name.”</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">14. (a) What does the expression “Unify my heart” suggest as to the heart condition? (b) Why did King Saul prove disloyal?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> What a singular expression, “Unify my heart”! That suggests that the heart is not in a condition of oneness, that it is divided in itself with regard to its affections and its fears. It seems to confess that there is some fear of man in the heart, which takes away something from the complete fear of God. “Trembling at men is what lays a snare,” says <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Proverbs 29:25</a>; and such a snare means being captured for our death at the hands of those who want to devour or destroy us. David’s persecutor, King Saul, was one who feared men; and because of such fear he forgot his fear of God and overstepped God’s orders and commands. King Saul said to God’s prophet Samuel: “I have sinned; for I have overstepped the order of Jehovah and your words, because I feared the people and so obeyed their voice.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Sam. 15:24</a>) Such fear led to disloyalty to Jehovah God.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">15. When sending out his apostles to preach, what instruction in this regard did Jesus give them, and why?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> David did not want to yield to such fear. When Jesus Christ, the Son of David, sent out his twelve apostles as missionaries to preach, saying: “The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near,” he warned them against such fear of men. It would keep them from boldly preaching the Kingdom. Jesus said: “Do not become fearful of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; but rather be in fear of him that can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 10:5-7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 27, 28</a>) To this One it was therefore correct for David to pray: “O do guard my soul, for I am loyal.”</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">16, 17.

What, then, are we to understand by David’s prayer to Jehovah: <span id="page588" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="588" data-before-text="588"></span>“Unify my heart to fear your name”? What did Jehovah God have to do to answer that prayer? It meant for God to remove all other fear that would divide David’s heart and obstruct his fear of Almighty God, who can destroy both soul and body in the Gehenna of annihilation. It meant to make David’s heart all one in fearing the name of Jehovah. Men of this world may have impressive names or reputations, and the bare mention of their names might strike terror to the heart of anyone who did not know a higher fear. Today men do not tremble at the mention of God. But threateningly mention to them the name of some gangster boss, or some dictator, some witch doctor, and they grow sober; they tremble; they fear for life and body.</p>

I have grown numb and become completely crushed.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002051/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 38:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002051/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 8</a>) David knew how heavy the burden of a guilty conscience could be. But he found comfort for his troubled heart. He understood that while Jehovah hates sin, He does not hate the sinner if that one is truly repentant and rejects his sinful course. With full faith in Jehovah’s willingness to extend mercy to repentant ones, David said: “You, O Jehovah, are . . . ready to forgive.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002051/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 86:5</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> When we sin, we too may carry the crushing burden of a pained conscience. This feeling of remorse is healthy. It can move us to take positive steps to correct our mistakes. There is, however, a danger of becoming overwhelmed by guilt. Our self-condemning heart might insist that Jehovah will not forgive us, no matter how repentant we are. If we become “overwhelmed by excessive sadness,” Satan may try to get us to give up, to feel that Jehovah views us as worthless, unfit to serve him.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002051/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 2:5-11</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> Is that how Jehovah views matters? Not at all! Forgiveness is a facet of Jehovah’s great love. In his Word, he assures us that when we manifest genuine, heartfelt repentance, he is willing to forgive. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002051/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 28:13</a>) So that Jehovah’s forgiveness never seems unattainable to us, let us examine why and how he forgives.</p><h2 id="p6" data-pid="6"><span id="page261" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="261" data-before-text="261"></span><strong>Why Jehovah Is “Ready to Forgive”</strong></h2><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 4.

He does not forget that we are creatures of dust, having frailties, or weaknesses, as a result of imperfection. The expression that he knows “how we are formed” reminds us that the Bible likens Jehovah to a potter and us to the clay vessels he forms. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002051/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jeremiah 18:2-6</a>) The Great Potter tempers his dealings with us according to the frailty of our sinful nature and the way we respond or fail to respond to his guidance.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 5.

His Word describes sin as a potent force that has man in its deadly grip. Just how strong is sin’s hold? In the book of Romans, the apostle Paul explains: We are “under sin,” as soldiers are under their commander (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002051/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Romans 3:9</a>); sin has “ruled” over mankind like a king (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002051/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Romans 5:21</a>); it “resides,” or is “dwelling,” within us (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002051/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Romans 7:17,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002051/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 20</a>); its “law” is continually at work in us, in effect trying to control our course.

He lovingly assures us that when we seek his mercy with a contrite heart, he will extend forgiveness. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002051/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 51:17</a> says: “The sacrifices pleasing to God are a broken spirit; a heart broken and crushed, O God, you will not reject.” Jehovah will never reject, or <span id="page262" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="262" data-before-text="262"></span>turn away, a heart that is “broken and crushed” by the burden of guilt.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Does this mean, though, that we can presume on God’s mercy, using our sinful nature as an excuse to sin? Certainly not! Jehovah is not guided by mere sentiment. His mercy has limits. He will by no means forgive those who hardheartedly practice willful sin, not showing any repentance. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002051/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:26</a>) On the other hand, when he sees a contrite heart, he is ready to forgive. Let us now consider some of the expressive language used in the Bible to describe this marvelous facet of Jehovah’s love.</p><h2 id="p11" data-pid="11"><strong>How Completely Does Jehovah Forgive?</strong></h2><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 8.

When Jehovah forgives our sins, we need not feel that we bear the stain of such sins for the rest of our life.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">11.

According to one source, the idea conveyed may be expressed: “You have made [my sins] as if they had not happened.” Is that not reassuring?</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">12.

Micah’s words thus indicate that when Jehovah forgives, he removes our sins permanently.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">13.

Jesus urged us to pray: “Forgive us our <em>debts.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002051/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Matthew 6:12</a>) Jesus thus likened sins to debts. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002051/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Luke 11:4</a>) When we sin, we become “debtors” to Jehovah. Regarding the meaning of the Greek verb translated “forgive,” one reference work says: “To let go, give up, a debt, by not demanding it.” In <span id="page265" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="265" data-before-text="265"></span>a sense, when Jehovah forgives, he cancels the debt that would otherwise be charged against our account. Repentant sinners can thus take comfort. Jehovah will never demand payment for a debt he has canceled!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002051/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Psalm 32:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">14.

How was this possible? The ink commonly used in ancient times was made of a mixture that included carbon, gum, and water. Soon after working with such ink, a person could take a wet sponge and wipe the writing away. Therein is a beautiful picture of Jehovah’s mercy. When he forgives our sins, it is as though he takes a sponge and wipes them away.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">15. What does Jehovah want us to know about him?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> When we reflect on these varied word pictures, is it not clear that Jehovah wants us to know that he is truly ready to forgive our sins as long as he finds us sincerely repentant? We need not fear that he will hold such sins against us in the future. This is shown by something else that the Bible reveals about Jehovah’s great mercy: When he forgives, he forgets.</p><h2 id="p20" data-pid="20"><strong>“I Will No Longer Remember Their Sin”</strong></h2><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">16, 17.

That could hardly be the case. The Bible tells us <span id="page266" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="266" data-before-text="266"></span>of the sins of many individuals whom Jehovah forgave, including David. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002051/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">2 Samuel 11:1-17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002051/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 12:13</a>) Jehovah is obviously still aware of the errors they committed. The record of their sins, as well as that of their repentance and forgiveness by God, has been preserved for our benefit. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002051/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Romans 15:4</a>) What, then, does the Bible mean when it says that Jehovah does not “remember” the sins of those whom he forgives?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> The Hebrew verb rendered “I will no longer remember” implies more than simply to recall the past. The <em>Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament</em> notes that it includes “the additional implication of taking appropriate action.” So in this sense, to “remember” sin involves <span id="page267" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="267" data-before-text="267"></span>taking action against sinners. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002051/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Hosea 9:9</a>) But when God says “I will no longer remember their sin,” he is assuring us that once he forgives repentant sinners, he will not at some future time act against them because of those sins. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002051/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ezekiel 18:21, 22</a>) Jehovah thus forgets in the sense that he does not bring our sins up again and again in order to accuse or punish us over and over. Is it not comforting to know that our God forgives <em>and forgets?</em></p><h2 id="p23" data-pid="23"><strong>What About the Consequences?</strong></h2><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">18. Why does forgiveness not mean that a repentant sinner is exempted from all consequences of his wrong course?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> Does Jehovah’s readiness to forgive mean that a repentant sinner is exempted from all consequences of his wrong course? Not at all. We cannot sin with impunity. Paul wrote: “Whatever a person is sowing, this he will also reap.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002051/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Galatians 6:7</a>) We may face certain consequences of our actions. This does not mean that after extending forgiveness Jehovah causes adversity to befall us. When troubles arise, a Christian should not feel, ‘Perhaps Jehovah is punishing me for past sins.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002051/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">James 1:13</a>) On the other hand, Jehovah does not shield us from all the effects of our wrong actions. Divorce, unwanted pregnancy, sexually transmitted disease, loss of trust or respect​—all of these may be the sad, unavoidable consequences of sin. Recall that even after forgiving David for his sins in connection with Bath-sheba and Uriah, Jehovah did not protect David from the disastrous consequences that followed.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002051/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">2 Samuel 12:9-12</a>.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">19-21.

The sinner then denies that he is guilty, even being so daring as to swear falsely. It is one person’s word against another’s. Later, however, the offender becomes stricken in conscience and confesses his sin. To gain God’s forgiveness, he has to do three more things: restore what he had taken, pay the victim a fine totaling 20 percent of the value of the stolen items, and provide a ram as a guilt offering. Then, the law says: “The priest will make atonement for him before Jehovah, and he will be forgiven.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002051/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Leviticus 6:1-7</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><strong><sup>20</sup></strong></span> This law was a merciful provision from God. It benefited the victim, whose property was returned and who no doubt felt much relief when the offender finally acknowledged his sin. At the same time, the law benefited the one whose conscience at last moved him to admit his guilt and correct his wrong. Indeed, if he refused to do so, there would be no forgiveness for him from God.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><strong><sup>21</sup></strong></span> Although we are not under the Mosaic Law, that Law gives us insight into Jehovah’s mind, including his thinking on forgiveness.

It may be painful for him to lose for a period of time privileges that were precious to him. Such discipline, however, does not mean that Jehovah has withheld forgiveness. We must remember that discipline from Jehovah is proof of his love for us. Accepting and applying it is in our best interests.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002051/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:5-11</a>.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">23.

Despite the mistakes we may have made, we should never conclude that we are beyond the reach of Jehovah’s mercy. If we truly repent, take steps to right the wrong, and earnestly pray for forgiveness on the basis of Jesus’ shed blood, we can have full confidence that Jehovah will forgive us. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002051/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">1 John 1:9</a>) Let us imitate his forgiveness in our dealings with one another.

He wrote: “My own errors have passed over my head; like a heavy load they are too heavy for me. I have grown numb and become crushed to an extreme degree; I have roared due to the groaning of my heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997883/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 38:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997883/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 8</a>) David, however, found comfort for his troubled heart.

This feeling of remorse is normal, even healthy. It can move us to take positive steps to correct our mistakes. Some Christians, though, have become overwhelmed by guilt. Their self-condemning heart might insist that God will not fully forgive them, no matter how repentant they are. “It is a terrible feeling when you think that Jehovah may not love you anymore,” said one sister, reflecting on a mistake she had made. Even after she repented and accepted helpful counsel from congregation elders, she continued to feel unworthy of God’s forgiveness. She explains: “Not a day passes by when I don’t ask Jehovah for his forgiveness.” If we become “swallowed up” by guilt, Satan may try to get us to give up, to feel that we are not worthy of serving Jehovah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997883/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 2:5-7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997883/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 11</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> But that is not at all how Jehovah views matters!

The expression that <span id="page11" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>he knows “the formation of us” reminds us that the Bible likens Jehovah to a potter and us to the vessels he forms.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1997883/0">a</a> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997883/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jeremiah 18:2-6</a>) A potter handles his clay vessels firmly yet delicately, ever mindful of their nature.

In the book of Romans, the inspired apostle Paul explains this in graphic terms: We are “under sin,” as soldiers are under their commander (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997883/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Romans 3:9</a>); it has “ruled” over mankind like a king (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997883/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Romans 5:21</a>); it “resides,” or is “dwelling,” within us (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997883/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Romans 7:17,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997883/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 20</a>); its “law” is continually at work in us, in effect trying to control our course.

By no means! Jehovah is not guided by mere sentiment. His mercy has limits. He will by no means forgive those who hard-heartedly practice malicious, willful sin with no repentance.

I said: ‘I shall make confession over my transgressions to Jehovah.’ And you yourself <em>pardoned</em> the error of my sins.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997883/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 32:5</a>) The expression “pardoned” translates a Hebrew word that basically means “lift up,” “bear, carry.” Its use here signifies ‘to take away guilt, iniquity, transgression.’ So Jehovah lifted up David’s sins and carried them away, as it were. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997883/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Leviticus 16:20-22</a>.) This no doubt eased the feelings of guilt that David had been carrying.

We too can have full confidence in the God who pardons the sins of those who seek his forgiveness on the basis of their faith in the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ.

For example, Jesus urged us to pray: “Forgive us our debts.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997883/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matthew 6:12</a>) Jesus thus likened “sins” to “debts.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997883/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Luke 11:4</a>) When we sin, we become “debtors” to Jehovah. The Greek verb translated “forgive” can mean “to let go, give up, a debt, by not demanding it.” In a sense, when Jehovah forgives, he cancels the debt that would otherwise be charged against our account. Repentant sinners can thus take comfort. Jehovah will never demand payment for a debt he has canceled!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997883/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Psalm 32:1, 2</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997883/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Matthew 18:23-35</a>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">10, 11.

How was this possible? The ink commonly used in ancient times was made of a mixture that included carbon, gum, and water. Soon after working with such ink, a person could take a wet sponge and wipe the writing away.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Therein is a beautiful picture of the completeness of Jehovah’s forgiveness. When he forgives our sins, it is as though he takes a sponge and wipes them away.

That could hardly be the case. The Bible tells us of the sins of many individuals whom Jehovah forgave, including David.

The record of their sins, as well as that of their repentance and forgiveness by God, has been preserved for our benefit. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997883/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Romans 15:4</a>) What, then, does the Bible mean when it says that Jehovah does not “remember” the sins of those whom he forgives?</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">13.

According to the <em>Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament,</em> it includes “the additional implication of taking appropriate action.” So in this sense, to “remember” sin involves taking action against sinners. When the prophet Hosea said concerning wayward Israelites, “He [Jehovah] will remember their error,” the prophet meant that Jehovah would take action against them for their lack of repentance. Thus, the rest of the verse adds: “He will give attention to their sins.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997883/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Hosea 9:9</a>) On the other hand, when Jehovah says, “Their sin I shall remember no more,” he is assuring us that once he forgives a repentant sinner, he will not act against him for those sins at some future time. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997883/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Ezekiel 18:21, 22</a>) He thus forgets in the sense that he does not bring our sins up again and again in order to accuse or punish us over and over. Jehovah thereby sets a splendid example for us to imitate in our dealings with others. When disagreements arise, it is best not to dredge up past offenses that you previously agreed to forgive.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>What About the Consequences?</strong></p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">14.

Not at all. We cannot sin with impunity. Paul wrote: “Whatever a man is sowing, this he will also reap.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997883/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Galatians 6:7</a>) We may face certain consequences of our action or problems, but after extending forgiveness, Jehovah does not cause adversity to befall us. When troubles arise, a Christian should not feel, ‘Perhaps Jehovah is punishing me for past sins.’ (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997883/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">James 1:13</a>.) On the other hand, Jehovah does not spare us from all the effects of our wrong actions. Divorce, unwanted pregnancy, sexually transmitted disease, loss of trust or respect—all of these may be the sad consequences of sin, and Jehovah will not shield us from them. Recall that even though he forgave David for his sins in connection with Bath-sheba and Uriah, Jehovah did not protect David from the disastrous consequences that followed.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997883/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">2 Samuel 12:9-14</a>.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">15, 16.

The Mosaic Law here addresses the situation wherein a person commits a serious wrong by seizing a fellow Israelite’s goods through robbery, extortion, or fraud. The sinner then denies that he is guilty, even being so daring as to swear falsely. It is one person’s word against another’s. Later, however, the offender becomes stricken in conscience and confesses his sin. To gain God’s forgiveness, he has to do three more things: restore what he had taken, pay the victim a fine of 20 percent, and offer a ram as a guilt offering. Then, the law says: “The priest must make an atonement for him before Jehovah, and so it must be forgiven <span id="page14" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997883/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Leviticus 6:1-7</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997883/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Matthew 5:23, 24</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> This law was a merciful provision from God.

It may be painful to him to lose for a period of time privileges that were precious to him. Such discipline, however, does not mean that he has lost Jehovah’s favor or that Jehovah has withheld forgiveness. In addition, we must remember that discipline from Jehovah is proof of his love for us.

If you feel that your heart is broken and crushed because of past wrongs, do not conclude that you are beyond the reach of Jehovah’s mercy. Despite what mistakes you may have made, if you have truly repented, taken steps to right the wrong, and earnestly prayed for Jehovah’s forgiveness on the basis of Jesus’ shed blood, you can have full confidence that the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997883/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">1 John 1:9</a> apply to you: “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous so as to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> The Bible encourages us to imitate Jehovah’s forgiveness in our dealings with one another. To what extent, however, can we be expected to forgive and forget when others sin against us? This will be discussed in the following article.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/1189/0">8/1/1994, pp. 12,</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Jehovah Is Reasonable!</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>“Ready to Forgive”</strong></p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 9, 10. (a) What does being “ready to forgive” have to do with reasonableness? (b) How did David benefit from Jehovah’s readiness to forgive, and why?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> David wrote: “For you, O Jehovah, are good and ready to forgive; and the loving-kindness to all those calling upon you is abundant.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994563/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 86:5</a>) When the Hebrew Scriptures were translated into Greek, the word for “ready to forgive” was rendered <em>e</em>·<em>pi</em>·<em>ei</em>·<em>kes</em>ʹ<em>,</em> or “reasonable.” Indeed, being ready to forgive and show mercy is perhaps the key way to demonstrate reasonableness.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> David himself was well aware of how reasonable Jehovah is in this regard. When David committed adultery with Bath-sheba and arranged to have her husband killed, both he and Bath-sheba were liable to the death penalty. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994563/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 22:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994563/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 2 Samuel 11:2-27</a>) If rigid human judges had handled the case, both might well have lost their lives. But Jehovah showed reasonableness (<em>e·pi·ei·kesʹ</em>), which, as <em>Vine’s Expository Dictionary of Biblical Words</em> puts it, “expresses that considerateness that looks ‘humanely and reasonably at the facts of a case.’” The facts that influenced Jehovah’s merciful decision likely included the sincere repentance of the wrongdoers and the mercy that David himself had previously shown in behalf of others. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994563/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Samuel 24:4-6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994563/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 25:32-35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994563/12/2" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> 26:7-11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994563/12/3" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> Matthew 5:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994563/12/4" data-bid="13-5" class="b"> James 2:13</a>) However, in line with Jehovah’s description of himself at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994563/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Exodus 34:4-7</a>, it was reasonable that Jehovah would give David correction. He sent the prophet Nathan to David with a strong message, impressing David with the fact that he had despised the word of Jehovah. David repented and so did not die for his sin.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994563/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Samuel 12:1-14</a>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">11.

Manasseh promoted disgusting religious practices in the land, including human sacrifice. He may also have been responsible for having the faithful prophet Isaiah “sawn asunder.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994563/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:37</a>) To punish Manasseh, Jehovah allowed him to be carried off as a captive to Babylon. However, Manasseh repented in prison and pleaded for mercy. In response to this sincere repentance, Jehovah was “ready to forgive”​—even in this extreme case.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994563/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 33:9-13</a>.</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994564/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 86:5</a>) Consider the time when Peter, a close companion, denied Jesus three times on the night of Jesus’ arrest and trial.

No; after His resurrection, Jesus paid Peter a personal visit, no doubt to comfort and reassure this repentant, brokenhearted apostle. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994564/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Luke 24:34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994564/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 15:5</a>) Shortly thereafter, Jesus permitted Peter to have great responsibility.

Yet, when David sincerely repented and acknowledged his error, Jehovah forgave him as well.

Actually there is not one, for “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” It is the wise person, therefore, that recognizes his need of forgiveness, and, in harmony with the instructions of the Lord Jesus, humbly prays to God: “Forgive us our sins.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963521/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 3:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963521/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Luke 11:4</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">But will God hear the confessions of the repentant sinner who is truly sorry for his wrongdoing and desires with all his heart to do what is right? Indeed, he will! David, a man well acquainted with the forgiveness of God, sang: “For you, O Jehovah, are good and ready to forgive; and the loving-kindness to all those calling upon you is abundant.” Years later an assembly of Levites acknowledged: “You are a God of acts of forgiveness, gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963521/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 86:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963521/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Neh. 9:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963521/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Dan. 9:9</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">God’s wonderful disposition to forgive is an invitation to all those who may have strayed into sinful ways. So do not feel that you are beyond recovery, that your sins disqualify you from God’s mercy. Take courage in Jehovah’s large capacity to forgive. Accept the invitation: “Let the wicked man leave his way, and the harmful man his thoughts; and let him return to Jehovah, who will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will forgive in a large way.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963521/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa. 55:7</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">While he was on the earth Jesus magnified this large capacity of his Father to forgive. Especially did he do so on the occasion when the self-righteous scribes and Pharisees ridiculed him, saying: “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.” Jesus responded by giving a series of illustrations in which he vindicated his welcoming of tax collectors and sinners by showing that such ones who repented became beloved by God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963521/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 15:2</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>THE LOST SHEEP AND THE DRACHMA COIN</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">First, he asked which one of those Pharisees would not go searching if one out of his flock of a hundred sheep got lost. He explained that just as there would be great joy on finding that one lost sheep, so there is more joy in heaven over just one sinner that repents than over ninety-nine self-righteous persons who feel no need of repentance. Yes, those that recognize themselves as sinners and who desire to correct their ways make the hearts of God’s heavenly family rejoice.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963521/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 15:3-7</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">To further illustrate the point, Jesus asked: “What woman with ten drachma coins, if she loses one drachma coin, does not light a lamp and sweep her house and search carefully until she finds it?” He explained that, just as her joy is great on finding this one coin, so great joy arises among God’s heavenly family when just one humble sinner repents and takes up His service.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963521/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 15:8-10</a>.</p>

Though first uttered three thousand years ago, it carries a wealth of meaning for all lovers of righteousness today. It extols the One who alone has the solution to the distressing problems of this space age. Hear David’s petition as he pours out his heart to the great God who is worthy of all praise: “For you, O Jehovah, are good and ready to forgive, and the loving-kindness to all those calling upon you is abundant. In the day of my distress I will call upon you, for you will answer me. I laud you, O Jehovah my God, with all my heart, and I will glorify your name to time indefinite, for your loving-kindness is great toward me. . . .

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ex. 17:14</a>) David exulted, not only in the divine promise of an everlasting Kingdom, but in all the other glorious prophecies looking down to our day.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 6.

It is the day to which David looked forward with joy. It is the day in which prophecy upon prophecy is coming to grand fulfillment. In the modern year of 1914 Jehovah established the everlasting kingdom of heaven in the hands of one greater than David, his Son Jesus Christ. In 1919 he brought forth on this earth a New World society to preach “this good news of the kingdom . . . for the purpose of a witness to all the nations.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>) As the nucleus of this New World society, the faithful remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses serve “as signs and as wonders,” to be seen by all men.

Their saber-rattling has brought them not only to the brink of a nuclear “hot war” but more than this, to the brink of terrible and wondrous destruction by the great God, Jehovah. However, within those nations, peace-loving men of good will are awakening to the emptiness of the nationalistic gods of their forefathers. They are fleeing from support of the “sheer falsehood” of the religions of Christendom and heathendom, and dedicating themselves to Jehovah, the true God and Creator of the enduring new world of sanity and peace.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> These are the men of good will that David foresaw at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Psalm 86:9</a>, and who are also described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Jeremiah 16:19, 20</a>: “O Jehovah my strength and my stronghold, and my place for flight in the day of distress, to you the nations themselves will come from the ends of the earth, and they will say: ‘Indeed our forefathers came to possess sheer falsehood, vanity and things in which there was nothing beneficial.’ Can earthling man make for himself gods when they are no gods?” Jehovah’s anger will soon blaze against the false gods of the nations, and concerning this he declares: “At this one time I shall cause them to know my hand and my mightiness, and they will have to know that my name is Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Jer. 16:21</a>.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">18.

The religions of Christendom have bogged down in formalistic creeds for centuries. However, in Jehovah’s New World society, there is not even a momentary standing still.

David, the writer of this inspired psalm, already had a record of devotion in matters of true worship. But he realized that he personally needed to keep progressing spiritually, and this is reflected in what he wrote.</p>

Though first uttered three thousand years ago, it carries a wealth of meaning for all lovers of righteousness today. It extols the One who alone has the solution to the distressing problems of this space age. Hear David’s petition as he pours out his heart to the great God who is worthy of all praise: “For you, O Jehovah, are good and ready to forgive, and the loving-kindness to all those calling upon you is abundant. In the day of my distress I will call upon you, for you will answer me. I laud you, O Jehovah my God, with all my heart, and I will glorify your name to time indefinite, for your loving-kindness is great toward me. . . . You, O Jehovah, are a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and trueness. . . .

Though Buddha, Brahma, Confucius and Christendom’s triune “God” had not yet appeared to add confusion to the religious scene, there were a host of gods to be worshiped in the religions of Philistia, Assyria, Babylon and other nations surrounding Israel. As they went out to war, these nations carried images of their gods on staves, from which also fluttered their national pendants. Some of these gods, such as Molech of Ammon and Chemosh of Moab, were known as “fire gods,” and exacted human sacrifices. Baal of Peor was worshiped with lewd sex rites. David not only maintained separateness from this cruel, immoral world of confused religionists, but he removed their contaminating influence by driving them right out from the God-given land of Israel.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Deut. 11:22-25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2 Sam. 8:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 14</a>.</p>

Your heart can be like that successful team if your thoughts, desires, and emotions are united in serving Jehovah. Remember, Satan would love to divide your heart.

In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 18:25</a> David said to God: “With someone loyal you will act in loyalty.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Sam. 22:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 26</a>) So, if we are dedicated to the interests of God’s kingdom and are seeking it first, then we too, like David, will strive to be loyal to God, whose kingdom it is. In that case we can be sure of God’s loyalty to us. How wonderful it is to think that God is loyal to us! Yet, despite its wonderfulness, we read: “‘I am loyal,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Jer. 3:12</a>) It is right for us to be loyal to God, who is loyal to us.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">13.

We cannot be loyal if our hearts are divided in their affections, their love, their attachment. We cannot be loyal if we fear anyone who opposes the object of our love and devotion and who persecutes us for this reason. Our persecutors and opposers act as servants of Satan the Devil, and their purpose is to break our loyalty to God and his kingdom. If we want to seek first his kingdom and to preach it as Jesus Christ did, it becomes necessary for us to cultivate loyalty and always to nurture it, feed it, and to put away the fear of the enemy. David indicated for us how to do this when he said, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 86:10, 11</a>: “You are God, you alone.

That suggests that the heart is not in a condition of oneness, that it is divided in itself with regard to its affections and its fears. It seems to confess that there is some fear of man in the heart, which takes away something from the complete fear of God. “Trembling at men is what lays a snare,” says <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Proverbs 29:25</a>; and such a snare means being captured for our death at the hands of those who want to devour or destroy us. David’s persecutor, King Saul, was one who feared men; and because of such fear he forgot his fear of God and overstepped God’s orders and commands. King Saul said to God’s prophet Samuel: “I have sinned; for I have overstepped the order of Jehovah and your words, because I feared the people and so obeyed their voice.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Sam. 15:24</a>) Such fear led to disloyalty to Jehovah God.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">15.

When Jesus Christ, the Son of David, sent out his twelve apostles as missionaries to preach, saying: “The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near,” he warned them against such fear of men. It would keep them from boldly preaching the Kingdom. Jesus said: “Do not become fearful of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; but rather be in fear of him that can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 10:5-7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 27, 28</a>) To this One it was therefore correct for David to pray: “O do guard my soul, for I am loyal.”</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">16, 17. (a) What did Jehovah have to do to unify David’s heart to fear His name?

What did Jehovah God have to do to answer that prayer? It meant for God to remove all other fear that would divide David’s heart and obstruct his fear of Almighty God, who can destroy both soul and body in the Gehenna of annihilation. It meant to make David’s heart all one in fearing the name of Jehovah. Men of this world may have impressive names or reputations, and the bare mention of their names might strike terror to the heart of anyone who did not know a higher fear. Today men do not tremble at the mention of God. But threateningly mention to them the name of some gangster boss, or some dictator, some witch doctor, and they grow sober; they tremble; they fear for life and body.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> But not so for David three thousand years ago! Not so for Jehovah’s witnesses today. Let the name of Jehovah God be brought to their mind, let his name be mentioned to them, and they think of all his glory with which he has crowned that name. They call to mind all his marvelous deeds and exploits in the past and all the prophecies that he is causing to come true in these twentieth-century days. The bare mention of his name calls to their minds all the punishments and destructions that he executed in judgment upon his enemies and upon those unfaithful to him. Yes, how he destroyed a whole world of people in Noah’s time. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Pet. 2:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 3:6</a>) Then their fear of Jehovah dominates over all other possible fears. The fear of his name envelops their whole heart as one and directs the unified heart in the way of loyalty to the fear-inspiring God.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">18.

It takes away all indecision as to whether to obey God as ruler rather than men. With a heart unified in its fear of God one is no longer an “indecisive man [literally, a two-souled man], unsteady in all his ways.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Jas. 1:8</a>, margin, <em>NW,</em> 1950 edition) So it is the course of wisdom for us to be wholehearted in our fear of the Most High God.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">19.

What does the Christian thus praying do in harmony with that prayer, to work together with God’s operation? Right before this prayer, David tells us of God’s part in the matter and then of his own part, saying: “For you are great and are doing wondrous things; you are God, you alone. Instruct me, O Jehovah, about your way. I shall walk in your truth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 86:10, 11</a>) It was necessary for Jehovah to give instruction about his way; it was also necessary for David to walk in Jehovah’s way and truth. The same thing is necessary today.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">20.

What a wealth of instruction it contains, instruction that never goes out of date so <span id="page589" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="589" data-before-text="589"></span>that a new religious textbook has to be written for the Christian congregation in this space age!</p>

This is the kind of people Jehovah wants in his new world. Hence this is the kind of people that he promises to preserve alive through the “great and fear-inspiring day of Jehovah,” which is getting closer all the time. So in harmony with his way marked out in the Bible, his organized people, the fearers of his name, are the ones through whom he gives further instruction that throws light upon his written Word and that helps to make the Bible more understandable in many respects. Hence if our prayer for Jehovah to instruct us about his way is sincere, we will be willing to get instruction through his organized people. We will be eager for it.</p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">27.

He immediately adds: “I shall walk in your truth.” In this manner one puts to use the instruction received; one follows it. In this way one walks in God’s truth. One lives the truth. One brings one’s life into harmony with that truth about God and his kingdom. One abandons the lies, traditions, ceremonies, practices and holy days that were received from the false religions of this world. One preaches the truth and bears witness to it by word and action, as Jesus did, this being the purpose for which Jesus was born as a human creature.</p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">28.

The fear of the one “living and true God” comes to control and shape one’s life. It is thus through accepting instruction from Jehovah about his way and then walking in his truth that Jehovah answers our prayer to unify our hearts to fear his name. What a relief, what a freedom, such a unified heart brings into our lives!</p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">29.

It is a fear that marks this as the world’s “time of the end,” or “the conclusion of the system of things.” The state of affairs is as Jesus foretold: “Men become faint out of fear and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Luke 21:25, 26</a>) Such fear and frightful expectation makes the uninstructed people take cover or refuge in human organizations that offer promise of protection, security and preservation. They look about for a competent leadership. So it is not strange that there are men and organizations who take advantage of the desires and fears of the people and who assume the leadership and then demand the loyalty of the people. All this sharpens the question as to whom or to what to give our loyalty without making the mistake of giving our loyalty to the wrong one and suffering for it without remedy.</p><p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu">30, 31.

He continues: <em>“I laud you, O Jehovah my God, with all my heart, and I will glorify your name to time indefinite, for your loving-kindness is great toward me, and you have delivered my soul out of Sheol, its lowest place.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992923/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b"><em>Psalm 86:12, 13</em></a>) For the second time in this psalm, David praises Jehovah for His loving-kindness​—His loyal love. So great is this love that it can save in seemingly impossible situations. When Saul was hounding him in the wilderness, David may have felt like crawling into a corner to die. It was like coming face-to-face with the lowest Sheol​—the depths of the grave. But Jehovah delivered him! In like manner, Jehovah has often brought relief to his modern-day servants in marvelous ways, and he has also sustained integrity keepers who have endured faithfully even to death. All loyal ones will have their reward, even by a resurrection if necessary.​—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992923/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Job 1:6-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992923/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 2:1-6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992923/30/2" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> 9, 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992923/30/3" data-bid="31-4" class="b"> 27:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992923/30/4" data-bid="31-5" class="b"> 42:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992923/30/5" data-bid="31-6" class="b"> Proverbs 27:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992923/30/6" data-bid="31-7" class="b"> Matthew 24:9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992923/30/7" data-bid="31-8" class="b"> 13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992923/30/8" data-bid="31-9" class="b"> Revelation 2:10</a>.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1992923/1">b</a></p>

Well could he pray: “O do guard my soul, for I am loyal. Save your servant—you are my God—that is trusting in you. I laud you, O Jehovah my God, with all my heart, and I will glorify your name to time indefinite.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962170/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 86:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962170/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 12</a>.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1962170/0">a</a></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Surely all dedicated Christians want to be minded even as David was, loyal to Jehovah. However, we may not forget that loyalty to God also means being loyal to his organization. Does God have an organization? Yes, even as he had one in the days of ancient Israel and in apostolic times, so it is reasonable to conclude that he would have a visible organization on earth today. In fact, many religious organizations claim to be God’s church or organization. How, then, can we identify which one truly is?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the same way that the Jews in the days of the apostles were able to identify God’s loyal organization. How was that? By its having God’s holy spirit poured out upon it and giving proof of it by all flesh in it prophesying—sons and daughters, men slaves and women slaves. One and all, Luke tells, were speaking about the magnificent things of God as the result of the outpouring of God’s spirit at Pentecost.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962170/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 2:1-18</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Of all that claim to be God’s organization today, which one meets this requirement? There is only one possible answer: the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses. As their 1962 <em>Yearbook</em> shows, they count as their numbers only those who prophesy and that about the “magnificent things of God.” During 1961 there were 884,587 ministers throughout the world in 185 different lands and islands of the sea that shared in prophesying each month, and a peak for the year of 965,169.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Loyalty to God’s organization requires that we prophesy all we can, as effectively as possible and where we can do the most good. We may not hold back in any of these respects. We must take the quality of our prophesying seriously, ever seeking to become more able ministers. Nor may we content ourselves with but one hour a month if we can devote ten hours to prophesying. Ten hours a month is only one hour every three days, and surely we can find that much time for prophesying. And if we can do more, loyalty requires that we do more, even going to places where there is a greater need for witnesses if we are able to do so.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The <em>Yearbook</em> contains many interesting experiences had by Christian ministers as they engaged in prophesying from house to house and on return visits. It also tells of how effective incidental witnessing can be, that is, prophesying as opportunity affords, as at one’s place of business, while in a hospital or when at school. Are we always alert to opportunities, or better, to make opportunities to prophesy about the “magnificent things of God”?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">If we appreciate the great privilege it is to prophesy with God’s loyal organization, we will find ways to do so regardless of what obstacles may face us. Are we bedfast because of illness? Still, we can write letters or, if unable to write, dictate them for someone else to write down and send out as does one arthritic victim in the southern United States who can move nothing but her head. One invalid in Germany who is almost completely paralyzed kept writing letters as her form of prophesying and one day was rewarded by having the pleasure of meeting a stranger who, as the result of her letters, is now a witness of Jehovah. No question about it, all who feel like David, who said, “I will glorify your name to time indefinite,” can find opportunities to do so.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962170/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 86:12</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">As we thus make use of our opportunities to prophesy about the “magnificent things of God” let us remember that loyalty also requires us to make known God’s judgments. We must announce the doom of Christendom regardless of how unpopular it may make us; even though we be called “apostles of hate.” And as the prophet Zechariah foretold, we must make known these judgments even against a member of our own family or a close friend if we find that such a one has erred from the faith and is becoming an apostate.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962170/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Zech. 13:1-6</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Truly many and varied are the ways in which dedicated Christians can, may, should and must show their loyalty to God by prophesying with his loyal organization. During the month of March readers of <em>The Watchtower</em> are urged to share in this prophesying by offering this magazine to others on a subscription basis.</p>

The literal meaning of the Greek word of which “long-suffering” is the translation is “long-tempered,” the opposite of our familiar expression “short-tempered.” In three Hebrew Scripture passages (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966522/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ex. 34:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966522/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Num. 14:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966522/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Ps. 86:15</a>) the <em>New World Translation</em> substitutes “slow to anger,” a more literal rendering of the Hebrew phrase “length of face or nostrils, where anger flares up,” for the <em>Authorized Version’s</em> “long-suffering.” In many passages, however, such as at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966522/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Nehemiah 9:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966522/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Psalm 103:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966522/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 145:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966522/4/3" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> Jeremiah 15:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966522/4/4" data-bid="5-5" class="b"> Joel 2:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966522/4/5" data-bid="5-6" class="b"> Jonah 4:2 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966522/4/6" data-bid="5-7" class="b"> Nahum 1:3</a>, the two translations are interchangeable. The two expressions “long-suffering” and “slow to anger” are, therefore, seen to be synonymous or of the same meaning.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 3. What is the English meaning of the word “suffer,” and how does this agree with the Scripture definition of the word?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> The English word “suffer,” as used, is given various meanings, among which is: to permit, or tolerate; to hold up, or delay; such as holding up or delaying the execution of a judgment. The Scriptural meaning of the word “suffer” is often the same. It means being slow to express anger, forbearing, disposed to defer, that is, to permit the wicked one to take his own course until God’s due time to act.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 4. What does long-suffering not mean, and why?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Long-suffering does not mean a lowering of the standards of justice regarding right and wrong. We are assured of this fact by the prophet Moses who wrote of Jehovah: “The Rock, perfect is his activity, for all his ways are justice. A God of faithfulness, with whom there is no injustice; righteous and upright is he.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966522/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Deut. 32:4</a>) Those who despise God’s forbearance are ignorant of the purpose for which it is manifested.

That is why it can truthfully be said, Never in human history has there been a happier assembly of so many peaceable people as when the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses convened in New York city, July 27 to August 3, 1958, for never before had so many mild-tempered individuals gathered together at one time. It is utterly impossible for any other group of people to duplicate a convention like this, for only witnesses of Jehovah are able to reflect on earth the peaceableness, mildness and happiness that constantly radiate from the very personality of the Most High God.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="qu"> 2.

Certainly, then, his faithful and loyal witnesses must exhibit these godly qualities at all times and under all circumstances, whether isolated, as many of them are in Communist camps of slavery, or congregated, as more than two hundred thousand of them were at their New York city assembly. Their doing this is not discretionary. It is mandatory, for it is Jehovah’s will.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="qu"> 3, 4.

In fact, he was the most mild and gentle man ever to walk this earth. When inviting others to take upon them his yoke and become his disciples, Jesus said: “I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960081/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 11:29</a>) This one who was so peaceable that he proved fully worthy of the title “Prince of Peace” not only displayed mildness in his personal life and activity but also preached to others that they too should live a life of peace and mildness. Here is how Jesus stated this fundamental Christian principle on one occasion: “I say to you who are listening, Continue to love your enemies, to do good to those hating you, to bless those cursing you, to pray for those who do you injury. To him that strikes you on the one cheek offer the other also.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960081/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 6:27-29</a>) At times Jesus and his traveling companions were exhausted from their walking and talking and they sought a little seclusion and rest. However, the crowds rudely intruded upon their privacy. Instead of harshly rebuking them, Jesus suppressed his own personal feelings and tenderly and compassionately cared for their spiritual and physical needs. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960081/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 14:13-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960081/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Mark 6:31-46</a>) Later, when Jesus peacefully rode into Jerusalem without a fight and presented himself as king, the words of the prophet were fulfilled: “Tell the daughter of Zion, ‘Look! your King is coming to you, <span id="page70" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="70" data-before-text="70"></span>mild-tempered, and mounted upon an ass.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960081/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 21:4, 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960081/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Zech. 9:9</a>, AS.</p>

<strong>A Man Agreeable to Jehovah’s Heart</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Jesse, the father of David and grandson of Ruth and Boaz, was likely a devout man. When David, his seven brothers, and his two sisters were still young, Jesse instructed them in the Law of Moses. In one of his psalms, David refers to himself as the son of Jehovah’s “slave girl.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011652/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 86:16</a>) This has led some to conclude that David’s mother, unnamed in the Bible, also had a positive influence on his spirituality. “It was most likely from her <span id="page27" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span>lips,” says one scholar, “that he first heard the wondrous story of God’s former dealings with his people,” including the history of Ruth and Boaz.</p>

Then, according to the covenant with David, Jehovah especially became a Father to him.

<strong>“Man” in the Hebrew Scriptures</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><em>Ish,</em> together with its plural form <em>anashím</em> (which at times also serves as the plural of <em>enósh</em>), has primarily the thought of “man,” or a person, an individual. It has no such overtones as human, mortal or able-bodied, although inherent in it is the thought of strength as of a male. The word <em>ish</em> does not appear in the Scriptures until after the word for woman, <em>ishsháh</em>—a man with a womb—appears, for in the <span id="page57" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="57" data-before-text="57"></span>strictest sense of the word only then did an <em>ish</em> become apparent; before that he was called the human, <em>adám.</em> When in the Hebrew Scriptures man is mentioned in relation to woman or sexual intercourse, invariably <em>ish</em> is used, some seventy times in all, although the word for “male” is <em>zakhár</em> and occurs seventy-nine times from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 1:27</a> onward. Typical is <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Leviticus, chapter 20</a>, dealing with God’s law regarding sex relations.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><em>Ish,</em> with its emphasis on the person, the individual, is the choice of Bible writers when writing about a “man of God,” and a “man of discernment.” When Nathan confronted King David with his sin, Nathan used this word. Did he say, “You yourself are the”—mortal? human? able-bodied man? No, but, “You yourself are [the one] the man!”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Josh. 14:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Prov. 10:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 2 Sam. 12:7</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">There are times when the other words for “man” simply would not be appropriate. Thus when the psalmist foretold that the names of those of the body of Christ who gain heavenly glory would be known he could use only <em>ish. “‘Each</em> and <em>every one</em> was born in her.’ . . . Jehovah himself will declare, when recording the peoples: ‘This is one who was born there.’” Also Moses, when exulting over Jehovah’s victory at the Red Sea, could not have referred to Jehovah as a weak mortal or a human earthling, and so had to use <em>ish</em> to convey his thought, even as rendered in the <em>New World Translation:</em> “Jehovah is a manly person of war.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 87:5, 6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Ex. 15:3</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss">“<strong>ADÁM”</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn"><em>Adám,</em> the human, the earthling, is the choice whenever Hebrew Scripture writers make reference to the creation of man: “I myself have made the earth and have created even man [the human] upon it.” <em>Adám</em> does not denote maleness any more than <em>human</em> does, and so we read that Adam, that is, the human, earthling man, called the first human pair, the <em>ish</em> and <em>ishsháh,</em> the man and the woman.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isa. 45:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Gen. 5:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 6:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/7/3" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> Deut. 4:32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/7/4" data-bid="8-5" class="b"> Eccl. 7:29</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><em>Adám</em>, the human, is almost without exception also the word preferred when man is mentioned in the same breath with the lower animals or beasts. This coupling appears in the accounts of creation, the Deluge, the plagues of Egypt and the seventy-year desolation. The psalmist praises Jehovah God for preserving both <em>adám</em> (human) and beast.

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page95" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="95" data-before-text="95"></span><strong>Questions From Readers</strong></p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Will the great crowd of “other sheep” who survive Armageddon know whether their companions of the remnant proved faithful and gained the prize of immortality or not?—F. C., United States.</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Yes, it seems reasonable to conclude that just who comprise the 144,000 members of the body of Christ will be common knowledge to those of the “other sheep” living in the post-Armageddon new world. Relevant thereto is <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962090/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 87:5, 6</a>, which reads: “And respecting Zion it will be said: ‘Each and every one was born in her.’ And the Most High himself will firmly establish her. Jehovah himself will declare, when recording the peoples: ‘This is one who was born there.’”</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">That this should be the case is most reasonable. Certainly at the present time we know, because of the Scriptural record, that certain ones received Jehovah’s approval in times of old, which information is encouraging to us. So for those of the post-Armageddon new world to know that certain ones proved faithful and received the glorious reward of immortality would likewise prove an incentive to faithfulness to them. Their faithful devotion would be recalled by those that knew them, in keeping with the principle stated at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962090/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:7</a>: “Remember those who are governing you, who have spoken the word of God to you, and as you contemplate how their conduct turns out imitate their faith.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>● What is the meaning of the following statement, recorded at</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962090/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 10:23</strong></a><strong>: “You will by no means complete the circuit of the cities of Israel until the Son of man arrives”?</strong></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Jesus said that in the year 31 (A.D.). This was when he was sending out his twelve apostles, in twos, to preach in all the cities of Israel. It may have been, as in the case of the seventy evangelizers whom Jesus also sent out to preach, that the apostles were sent in advance of Jesus and that Jesus would later come to the places where they had preached. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962090/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 10:1</a>) This, however, does not appear to be the thing referred to by Jesus in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962090/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 10:23</a>, namely, that he would personally, in the flesh, follow up his twelve apostles in the cities in which they had preached.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">It is evident that when Jesus gave his twelve apostles these preaching instructions, he was doing so for the years that would follow his death, resurrection and ascension to heaven, never to come back again to the earth in the flesh. How is this evident? From the fact that Jesus spoke to the apostles about their being mistreated in the synagogues and being haled before governors and kings “for a witness to them and the nations.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962090/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 10:17, 18</a>) There is no record that such things occurred during the short preaching campaign in which the apostles engaged in Israel exclusively, after which they returned to Jesus and made their reports. At the time that Jesus gave them the above instructions, he plainly told them not to go to the nations or even to the Samaritans on this preaching campaign, but only to the “lost sheep of the house of Israel.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962090/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 10:5, 6</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">So it must have been because he looked ahead to their world-wide preaching among outside nations after his ascension to heaven that Jesus said to the apostles: “You will be objects of hatred by all people [not merely Israelites] on account of my name; but he that has endured to the end is the one that will be saved. When they persecute you in one city, flee to another; for truly I say to you, You will by no means complete the circuit of the cities of Israel until the Son of man arrives.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962090/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 10:22, 23</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">On the occasion of saying those words, Jesus gave the apostles, for the immediate preaching campaign, a local territory assignment. It took in the territory of Israel in Palestine, namely, Judea, Galilee and Peraea, and did not include Samaria. By covering this they would “complete the circuit of the cities of Israel.” So now Jesus used this temporary, limited territory assignment as an illustration of their final complete territory assignment. Before he ascended to heaven the resurrected Jesus made their territory assignment the entire world, for he said: “All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth. Go therefore [everywhere in the earth] and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962090/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 28:18, 19</a>) This enlarged their territory assignment beyond the borders of Israel, yes, beyond the borders of so-called <span id="page96" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="96" data-before-text="96"></span>Christendom and out into the so-called pagan world that does not belong to Christendom. Under Jesus’ instructions, his disciples were to undertake to complete the circuit of the whole inhabited earth, preaching the good news of God’s kingdom to all, to Jewish people, to professed Christian people and to all the pagan peoples.</p>

<strong>Lasting Rule Depends on Promoting True Worship</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">King David was now like a cornerstone laid in Zion on which a royal house of rulers <span id="page541" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="541" data-before-text="541"></span>was to be built to represent the heavenly King, Jehovah. He expressed appreciation in prayer.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Sam. 7:18-29</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">David’s successor was his son named Solomon, meaning “Peaceable.” He was also called by Jehovah Jedidiah, meaning “Beloved of Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Sam. 12:24, 25</a>) What an honor it was for Solomon to be born in Zion! It greatly surpassed the honor of being born in famous Babylon. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 87:2-6</a> describes this honor: “Jehovah is more in love with the gates of Zion than with all the tabernacles of Jacob [Israel]. Glorious things are being spoken about you, O city of the true God. . . . And the Most High himself will firmly establish her. Jehovah himself will declare, when recording the peoples: ‘This is one who was born there.’”</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Solomon could actually be said to be born as king in 1037 B.C.E. Then, according to the covenant with David, Jehovah especially became a Father to him. David had subdued all the nations within the God-ordained boundaries of the Promised Land; so Solomon reigned from the river of Egypt on the south to Kadesh on the Orontes, eighty miles north of Damascus.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:23</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Jehovah gave David inspired plans for building the temple. Besides this, David gathered together much material and great contributions of money by himself and the people. He also contributed the exact piece of land for the temple structure. <em>He realized that the nation’s prosperity depended on God,</em> and that they were really only giving God glory with the things He himself owned and provided for them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:10-16</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The temple plot was more than 2,400 feet above the Mediterranean sea level, on Mount Moriah, where Abraham had built an altar to offer up his son Isaac. A spur extending southward that came to be called “Ophel” connected it with Mount Zion. From any direction the worshipers would have to go <em>up</em> to the temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ps. 122:1-4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Isa. 2:2</a>) At the time that David had bought the plot a plague was on, and Jehovah’s angel had directed the building of an altar there. David offered a sacrifice and said: “This is the house of Jehovah the true God, and this is an altar for burnt offering for Israel.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Chron. 21:14 to 22:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 2 Sam. 24:10-25</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="ss"><strong>WORSHIP OF JEHOVAH EXALTED</strong></p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">David had Solomon anointed as king when David’s fourth son Adonijah planned to take over the throne.

Solomon began to build the temple. Because of David’s advance preparation, the magnificent edifice was constructed with noteworthy ease, taking only seven and a half years to build. But it was not complete in its furnishings until the ark of the covenant was brought into the temple’s Most Holy compartment. The inauguration account reads:</p>

It took in the territory of Israel in Palestine, namely, Judea, Galilee and Peraea, and did not include Samaria. By covering this they would “complete the circuit of the cities of Israel.” So now Jesus used this temporary, limited territory assignment as an illustration of their final complete territory assignment. Before he ascended to heaven the resurrected Jesus made their territory assignment the entire world, for he said: “All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth. Go therefore [everywhere in the earth] and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962090/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 28:18, 19</a>) This enlarged their territory assignment beyond the borders of Israel, yes, beyond the borders of so-called <span id="page96" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="96" data-before-text="96"></span>Christendom and out into the so-called pagan world that does not belong to Christendom. Under Jesus’ instructions, his disciples were to undertake to complete the circuit of the whole inhabited earth, preaching the good news of God’s kingdom to all, to Jewish people, to professed Christian people and to all the pagan peoples.</p>
