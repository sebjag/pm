<strong>Integrity</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong><em>Job.</em></strong> Job, who evidently lived in the period between the death of Joseph and the time of Moses, is described as a man who had “proved to be blameless [Heb., <em>tam</em>] and upright, and fearing God and turning aside from bad.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002182/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 1:1</a>; see <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002182/3">JOB</a>.) That human integrity forms part of the issue between Jehovah God and Satan is clear from God’s questioning his Adversary about Job when Satan appeared during an angelic assembly in the courts of heaven. Satan imputed false motive to Job’s worship of God, alleging that Job served not out of pure devotion but for selfish benefits. He thereby placed in question Job’s integrity to God. Permitted to divest Job of his vast possessions and even of his children, Satan failed to crack Job’s integrity. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002182/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Job 1:6–2:3</a>) He then claimed that Job was selfishly willing to endure the loss of possessions and children as long as he could save his own skin. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002182/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Job 2:4, 5</a>) Thereafter stricken with a painful, consuming disease and subjected to dissuasion from his own wife as well as to disparaging criticism and slurs from companions who misrepresented God’s standards and purposes (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002182/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Job 2:6-13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002182/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 22:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002182/13/2" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 5-11</a>), Job’s response was that he would not deny having been a man of integrity. “Until I expire I shall not take away my integrity from myself! On my justness I have laid hold, and I shall not let it go; my heart will not taunt me for any of my days.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002182/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Job 27:5, 6</a>) His maintaining integrity demonstrated that God’s Adversary was a liar.</p>

<strong>How Can You Be ‘Perfect as Your Heavenly Father Is Perfect’?</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">In his <em>Notes on the Gospels,</em> Albert Barnes, Bible scholar of the nineteenth century, makes somewhat similar observations about the “blamelessness” (or “perfection”) of such men. Of the word “perfect” he says: “Originally it is applied to a piece of mechanism, as a machine that is complete in its parts. Applied to men, it refers to completeness of parts, or <em>perfection,</em> where no part is defective or wanting.

<strong>Installation</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The portion of the ram’s flesh that had not been burned on the altar or given to Moses was now to be boiled and eaten at the entrance of the tent of meeting by Aaron and his sons, along with the cakes remaining in the basket. Any of this food left over was to be burned the next morning. This emphasized the cleanness, and also stressed the completeness, of their sanctification and service (because what was eaten was free from any putrefaction or staleness, and <span id="page836" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="836" data-before-text="836"></span>remainders were <em>completely</em> disposed of). It is notable also that no leaven was in the cakes.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012129/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Lev. 8:31, 32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012129/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Ex. 29:31-34</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>COMPLETION OF THE INSTALLATION</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The installation took seven days, before the end of which the priesthood could not officiate in the fullest sense. On each of the six days succeeding their investiture and ordination through the mediator Moses, sacrifices were to be offered as follows: a young ram in the morning, with a grain offering and a drink offering of wine, and a like sacrifice in the evening, as burnt offerings. During the entire seven days, day and night, the newly ordained priests had to man posts of duty at the entrance of the tent of meeting, keeping “the obligatory watch of Jehovah,” that they might not die.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012129/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Lev. 8:33-36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012129/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Ex. 29:35-42</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">On the eighth day, fully equipped and installed in office, the priesthood officiated (without Moses’ assistance) for the first time, performing an atonement service for the nation of Israel, especially in need of cleansing, not only because of their natural sinfulness, but also because of their recent disobedience in connection with the golden calf, which had brought Jehovah’s displeasure. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012129/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Lev. 9:1-7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012129/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Ex. 32:1-10</a>) At the conclusion of this first service by the newly installed priesthood, Jehovah manifested his approval and confirmation of them in office by sending miraculous fire out from the pillar of cloud above the tabernacle, devouring the remainder of the sacrifice on the altar.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012129/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Lev. 9:23, 24</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The Bible gives no record of an installation ceremony for the successors of Aaron. Evidently the one installation service was sufficient to place the Aaronic house and all its male offspring in their priestly office once and for all, to continue to time indefinite, down until the installation in office of the true and everlasting high priest Jesus Christ.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012129/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Heb. 7:12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012129/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012129/26/2" data-bid="27-3" class="b"> 9:11, 12</a>; see HIGH PRIEST; PRIEST.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"></p>

The Hebrew verb <em>satán</em> means “to resist,” and is first used by Moses at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Numbers 22:22,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 32</a>.<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966643/2">c</a> But at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Job 1:6</a> the Hebrew uses the noun <em>satán</em> with the definite article <em>ha</em> affixed to it, thus reading <em>has-satan</em> or The Satan in English.<a id="footnotesource4" data-fnid="4" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966643/3">d</a> The definite article, therefore, particularizes Satan as a person and makes impossible the view held by many that Satan is abstract evil, resistance or opposition. In this manner Satan is established in the Bible as a definite <span id="page523" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="523" data-before-text="523"></span>personality, with the word “Satan” as one of the proper titles to be used in identifying him.—See also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Zechariah 3:1, 2</a>.</p>

But what can man do about it? He can learn a lesson from God.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">WHEN the Almighty spoke to Job in a series of questions, he contrasted the smallness of man with his own greatness. Jehovah pointed to his inanimate creation, the earth, the sea, its waves, snow and hail, rain, dew, frost and ice, the constellations, clouds, lightnings; he asked Job if he could control them and understand fully the divine laws governing them. Then the Almighty illustrated the superiority of his power and will by pointing to the animal creation. The lions, wild goats, hinds and even the lowly ravens all get along without man’s help. Next, God brought to Job’s attention other wild creatures:</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Who sent forth the zebra free, and who loosened the very bands of the wild ass, whose house I have appointed the desert plain and whose dwelling places the salt country? It laughs at the turmoil of a town; the noises of a stalker it does not hear. It explores mountains for its pasturage and after every sort of green plant it seeks.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 39:5-8</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">What a difference between tame animals and wild ones, even when they are most similar in appearance! Whence this mysterious difference of inward disposition? God says it was his will to send forth “the zebra free” and to loosen “the very bands of the wild ass.” Before the Sabean raid Job had five hundred she-asses, which he could use for burden bearing and plowing. Such domestic asses were noted for their submissiveness. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 1:3</a>) But could Job use the wild ass in a similar way? No, for God had given the wild ass its liberty and had appointed the desert plain as its home. It is not because of man’s will that the wild ass is so nimble and untractable and that even the salt country is its dwelling place, salt being a welcome ingredient to its diet. The wild ass manages to get along without man’s help. “Every sort of green plant it seeks, gnawing even down into the roots. The wild ass migrates restlessly in search of greenery, even exploring mountain areas for pasturage.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">But would the wild ass exchange its freedom for the more easily obtained provisions of the domesticated ass? No, and it would be in vain to entice the wild ass to dwell in busy towns for the sake of more abundant food. “It laughs at the turmoil of a town.” It instinctively avoids places inhabited by man, so “the noises of a stalker it does not hear.” Not that the wild ass cannot hear well; it is exceedingly wary because of its keen senses of hearing, sight and smell. Should a man invade its desolate domain and try to stalk this creature, it will dart off with utmost rapidity. Xenophon, the Greek historian of the fourth and fifth centuries B.C., wrote in his <em>Anabasis:</em></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="si">“The asses, when they were pursued, having gained ground of the horses, stood still (for they exceeded them much in speed); and when these came up with them, they did the same thing again; so that our horsemen could take them by no other means but by dividing themselves into relays, and succeeding one another in the chase.”</p>

<strong>Birthday</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">When Job’s sons “held a banquet at the house of each one on his <em>own day”</em> it should not be supposed that they were celebrating their birthdays. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000749/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 1:4</a>) “Day” in this verse translates the Hebrew word <em>yohm</em> and refers to a period of time from sunrise to sunset. On the other hand, “birthday” is a compound of the two Hebrew words <em>yohm</em> (day) and <em>hul·leʹdheth</em>. The distinction between “day” and one’s birthday may be noted in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000749/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Genesis 40:20</a>, where both expressions appear: “Now on the third day [<em>yohm</em>] it turned out to be Pharaoh’s birthday [literally, “the day (<em>yohm</em>) of the birth (<em>hul·leʹdheth</em>) of Pharaoh”].” So it is certain that <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000749/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 1:4</a> does not refer to a birthday, as is unquestionably the case at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000749/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Genesis 40:20</a>. It would seem that Job’s seven sons held a family gathering (possibly a spring or harvest festival) and as the feasting made the week-long circuit, each son hosted the banquet in his own house “on his own day.”</p>

The seven sons of Job apparently held a seven-day family gathering once a year. As they made the circuit, each son was the host of the banquet held at his house on “his own day.”</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980530/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:12, 13</a>) Jesus shared in a wedding feast. Job’s children held what may have been harvest feasts that occasioned family reunions. Abraham had a feast when Isaac was weaned.

<strong>Bible Translations—Does It Matter Which One?</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">According to <em>The Living Bible,</em> Job’s sons celebrated their birthdays. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979604/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 1:4</a>) Yet the <em>Good News Bible,</em> in full harmony with the original Hebrew, merely speaks of a feast, with no allusion to birthdays at all. The first rendering is a clear case of interpretation. This example also illustrates the extreme variations existing between paraphrased translations.</p>

<strong>Happiness Results from Making the Most of One’s Talents</strong><br/><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">At the annual meeting he had a bad spell shortly after the proxy forms were handed in, and had to be helped out for a while, but he came back and stayed until just before the meeting ended. He was concerned about taking in the whole program so as to be able to give a good report to those of his congregation who had not been able to attend. He was assisted to his room and shortly after went to the Society’s headquarters in Pittsburgh to visit with some friends who were most <span id="page318" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="318" data-before-text="318"></span>happy to see him. He was not able to stay long, however, and upon his return to his hotel room he suffered a bad hemorrhage. This was his condition when he arrived back home in Washington the next day. Nothing further could be done for him by the doctors, and he gradually weakened until his death on November 19, 1967.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">His life had indeed been a full and happy one. He had served as a congregation publisher, pioneer minister, as traveling representative for the Watch Tower Society, at Brooklyn Bethel and in dealings with governmental agencies and business organizations. He traveled far and wide for the Society, both at home and abroad, represented his brothers in court cases and was extremely generous in a material way as well. He certainly had Jehovah’s blessing, as was evident, on the one hand, by his zeal, love for Jehovah and his joy, and, on the other hand, by the fruitfulness of his labors.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">He had the blessing of ‘casting his bread upon the waters and seeing it return to him after many days’ in the form of the love of the brothers whom he had assisted to come to a knowledge of the truth and in other ways.

And though he is missed by his faithful associates, they rejoice to know that to him also the inspired words recorded by the apostle John apply: “Happy are the dead who die in union with the Lord from this time onward.

<strong>Endurance like Job’s in the Time of the End</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> God’s power pulls back the veil of invisibility and we look into the spirit world to see a meeting of angels assembling before the Most High God, to which meeting Jehovah God had ordered Satan to come. At the meeting what took place? Here is the account from the book of Job: “Now it came to be the day when the sons of The [true] God came in to take their station before Jehovah, and even Satan proceeded to come in right among them. Then Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Where do you come from?’ At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘From roving about in the earth and from walking about in it.’ And Jehovah went on to say to Satan: ‘Have you set your heart upon my servant Job, that there is no one like him in the earth, a man of integrity and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad?’ At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘Is it for nothing that Job has feared God? Have not you yourself put up a hedge about him and about his house and about everything that he has all around? The work of his hands you have blessed and his livestock itself has spread abroad in the earth. But, for a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch everything he has [and see] <span id="page595" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="595" data-before-text="595"></span>whether he will not curse you to your very face.’ Accordingly Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Look! everything that he has is in your hand. Only against him himself do not thrust out your hand!’ So Satan went out away from the person of Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 1:6-12</a>.</p><p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu">10. Of what was Job ignorant at the time, and why was no one better qualified than he to furnish the answer to the question raised?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[64]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Job did not know about this meeting in heaven and what the big question was that was put forward and what was to be done about getting the true answer to the question. Here was the thing that caused Job difficulty. He did not know the question that he was picked to prove, namely, that God can raise up the right kind of persons to be his witnesses in the earth, and that they will hold on to their integrity to him despite all the unjust suffering he may allow to test their unselfish worship of him. Job being then the unequaled witness of Jehovah on earth, no one should be better qualified to prove this point in favor of Jehovah than Job.</p><p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu">11. In what office toward God was Job acting in behalf of his family, and why?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Job was acting as priest of Jehovah God for his family. His wife was living and he had seven sons and three daughters. Besides that, he had seven thousand sheep and three thousand camels, making a total of ten thousand together, and also five hundred spans of oxen and five hundred she-asses, along with a very great body of servants. In spite of all these possessions, Job was not a materialistic man. He did not get so deeply buried in his material goods that he forgot about God, who was the real source of all his wealth. He did not try to increase his material wealth by going crooked and violating the laws of God and showing no fear of God. Job wanted his ten children to fear God and stay in God’s favor. So after his seven sons had spread banquets for their three sisters at their seven houses, Job would always act as an intercessor for them with Jehovah. “Job would send and sanctify them, and he got up early in the morning and offered up burnt sacrifices according to the number of all of them, for, said Job, ‘maybe my sons have sinned and have cursed God in their heart.’ That is the way Job would do always.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 1:1-5</a>) At that time Jehovah God had not yet set up his exclusive priesthood in the tribe of Levi, the tribe of Moses the prophet.</p><p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">12. In what way did Jehovah bless Job, and why in this way?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Quite properly Jehovah God blessed Job for his faithful worship as a witness of Jehovah, and quite properly at that time God blessed Job with material goods to be used in a right way. Job could be trusted with them. Long before this God had blessed Job’s granduncle Abraham in this manner, and also Abraham’s son Isaac and his grandson Jacob. So it was nothing new for God to increase the material possessions of his servant Job and to protect them against enemy attack. Certainly God did not bless his servants with material goods just to enrich the thievish enemy. For this reason God kept those goods out of the hands of selfish, greedy evildoers. Neither Job nor Abraham and Isaac and Jacob expected to go to heaven and be rewarded only up there after death. So God was in harmony with their earthly hopes in blessing them upon the earth. Who, then, had a right to object to Job’s having all this material wealth? No one.</p><p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu">13. What test had Job withstood thus far, and so what test did Satan propose, and why?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[67]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> However, Satan the Devil did not want God to have any pleasure out of Job. Hence he accused Job. Let it be noted that Satan did not, even as he could not, accuse Job of acting materialistically and misusing all the material goods with which Jehovah had blessed Job. No; up to that point Job had withstood the test of materialism. All <span id="page596" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="596" data-before-text="596"></span>that was left for Satan to do, then, was to accuse Job’s heart condition. He was at heart materialistic; he was serving Jehovah God only for the material good that he could get out of it, argued Satan the Devil. To show up Job’s heart condition and the weakness of his integrity Satan suggested that Jehovah take away all those material possessions. Of course, Jehovah would not do that himself; but, to permit the question to be answered, he would let Satan the Devil and his crowd on earth take away such material things. Satan had no confidence in Job. God did, and he was not unwilling to prove this.</p>

Evidently not. Professor G. Margoliouth writes in Hastings’ <em>Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics:</em> “The occasion of the feasting referred to in Job 1<sup>4f.</sup> is not clear. As the seven days appear to have been consecutive, they could hardly have been birthdays.” “The mention of the ‘day of our king’ in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101976492/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Hos 7:<sup>5</sup></a> may quite naturally be taken to refer to the anniversary of the king’s accession to the throne.”</p>

<strong>Birth</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Under the Mosaic law a woman giving birth to a boy was ceremonially unclean for seven days, with an additional thirty-three days required for her purification.

Those animals were valuable, likely his livelihood. But Job also used them in worship. After Job had sanctified his children, “he got up early in the morning and offered up burnt sacrifices according to the number of all of them; for, said Job, ‘maybe my sons have sinned and have cursed God in their heart.’ That is the way Job would do always.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009282/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 1:4, 5</a>) Thus, Job sacrificed animals to Jehovah on a regular basis. Once the trials began, that was no longer possible. Job had no “valuable things” with which to honor Jehovah.

<strong>Endurance like Job’s in the Time of the End</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> God’s power pulls back the veil of invisibility and we look into the spirit world to see a meeting of angels assembling before the Most High God, to which meeting Jehovah God had ordered Satan to come. At the meeting what took place? Here is the account from the book of Job: “Now it came to be the day when the sons of The [true] God came in to take their station before Jehovah, and even Satan proceeded to come in right among them. Then Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Where do you come from?’ At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘From roving about in the earth and from walking about in it.’ And Jehovah went on to say to Satan: ‘Have you set your heart upon my servant Job, that there is no one like him in the earth, a man of integrity and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad?’ At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘Is it for nothing that Job has feared God? Have not you yourself put up a hedge about him and about his house and about everything that he has all around? The work of his hands you have blessed and his livestock itself has spread abroad in the earth. But, for a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch everything he has [and see] <span id="page595" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="595" data-before-text="595"></span>whether he will not curse you to your very face.’ Accordingly Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Look! everything that he has is in your hand. Only against him himself do not thrust out your hand!’ So Satan went out away from the person of Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 1:6-12</a>.</p><p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu">10. Of what was Job ignorant at the time, and why was no one better qualified than he to furnish the answer to the question raised?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[64]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Job did not know about this meeting in heaven and what the big question was that was put forward and what was to be done about getting the true answer to the question. Here was the thing that caused Job difficulty. He did not know the question that he was picked to prove, namely, that God can raise up the right kind of persons to be his witnesses in the earth, and that they will hold on to their integrity to him despite all the unjust suffering he may allow to test their unselfish worship of him. Job being then the unequaled witness of Jehovah on earth, no one should be better qualified to prove this point in favor of Jehovah than Job.</p><p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu">11. In what office toward God was Job acting in behalf of his family, and why?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Job was acting as priest of Jehovah God for his family. His wife was living and he had seven sons and three daughters. Besides that, he had seven thousand sheep and three thousand camels, making a total of ten thousand together, and also five hundred spans of oxen and five hundred she-asses, along with a very great body of servants. In spite of all these possessions, Job was not a materialistic man. He did not get so deeply buried in his material goods that he forgot about God, who was the real source of all his wealth. He did not try to increase his material wealth by going crooked and violating the laws of God and showing no fear of God. Job wanted his ten children to fear God and stay in God’s favor. So after his seven sons had spread banquets for their three sisters at their seven houses, Job would always act as an intercessor for them with Jehovah. “Job would send and sanctify them, and he got up early in the morning and offered up burnt sacrifices according to the number of all of them, for, said Job, ‘maybe my sons have sinned and have cursed God in their heart.’ That is the way Job would do always.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 1:1-5</a>) At that time Jehovah God had not yet set up his exclusive priesthood in the tribe of Levi, the tribe of Moses the prophet.</p><p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">12. In what way did Jehovah bless Job, and why in this way?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Quite properly Jehovah God blessed Job for his faithful worship as a witness of Jehovah, and quite properly at that time God blessed Job with material goods to be used in a right way. Job could be trusted with them. Long before this God had blessed Job’s granduncle Abraham in this manner, and also Abraham’s son Isaac and his grandson Jacob. So it was nothing new for God to increase the material possessions of his servant Job and to protect them against enemy attack. Certainly God did not bless his servants with material goods just to enrich the thievish enemy. For this reason God kept those goods out of the hands of selfish, greedy evildoers. Neither Job nor Abraham and Isaac and Jacob expected to go to heaven and be rewarded only up there after death. So God was in harmony with their earthly hopes in blessing them upon the earth. Who, then, had a right to object to Job’s having all this material wealth? No one.</p><p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu">13. What test had Job withstood thus far, and so what test did Satan propose, and why?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[67]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> However, Satan the Devil did not want God to have any pleasure out of Job. Hence he accused Job. Let it be noted that Satan did not, even as he could not, accuse Job of acting materialistically and misusing all the material goods with which Jehovah had blessed Job. No; up to that point Job had withstood the test of materialism. All <span id="page596" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="596" data-before-text="596"></span>that was left for Satan to do, then, was to accuse Job’s heart condition. He was at heart materialistic; he was serving Jehovah God only for the material good that he could get out of it, argued Satan the Devil. To show up Job’s heart condition and the weakness of his integrity Satan suggested that Jehovah take away all those material possessions. Of course, Jehovah would not do that himself; but, to permit the question to be answered, he would let Satan the Devil and his crowd on earth take away such material things. Satan had no confidence in Job. God did, and he was not unwilling to prove this.</p>

<strong>Transforming Human Nature</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The word “Devil” (meaning, “slanderer”) occurs 33 times in the Bible, and “Satan” (meaning, “resister”) 52 times. Most of these references have to do with the same wicked spirit person. Some, though, deny the existence of a personal Satan, preferring to say: “Human nature with its propensity to sin is the devil of Scripture.”<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1990801/1">b</a> Interestingly, though, in the account of Jehovah’s faithful servant Job, the Hebrew text uses the expression <em>has·Sa·tanʹ, the</em> Satan, and at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1990801/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Luke 4:2</a>, we read that it was <em>the</em> Devil (Greek, <em>ho di·aʹbo·los</em>) who tempted Jesus.

<strong>If God Has an Organization, What Is It?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[27]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Thus the One to be feared now in this time for individual decision is the Creator, the Universal Organizer. In the book of Job we are given a glimpse into his heavenly family of angelic sons. The organizer of the worldly system of things since the deluge of Noah’s day, Satan the Devil, was once a member of that family. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981326/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 1:6, 7</a> he is pictured as an intruder into family affairs, for there we read: “Now it came to be the day when the sons of the true God entered to take their station before Jehovah, and even Satan proceeded to enter right among them. Then Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Where do you come from?’ At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘From roving about in the earth and from walking about in it.’” At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981326/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 2:1, 2</a> a similar picture is painted of a later meeting of the sons of the true God in the invisible heavens.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="qu"> 6.

What appropriate word or words come to mind? We leave it for the reader to say. Those meetings were formal ones, with the true God rightfully presiding. Satan’s being admitted to those meetings does not mean that he was still viewed as one of “the sons of the true God” and was still part of God’s heavenly household. His very designation “Satan” indicates he was not, for the name means “Opposer.” So he had no good purpose in moving about in the earth as a spirit invisible to men. He was opposed to any man who tried to keep his integrity toward the true God. With divine permission he made that righteous, God-fearing man named Job of the land of Uz the victim of his attacks. But he failed in his dastardly purpose to bring the universal sovereignty of Jehovah God into contempt before men on earth as well as angels in heaven. Job’s faithful example proved to be a great encouragement to Jehovah’s heavenly family of angelic sons.</p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Satan the Devil was permitted to continue in heaven for millenniums and on certain occasions (evidently for some specific reason) allowed to be present in an assembly of God’s sons.

As evident from the book of Job, Satan maintained that all intelligent creatures were basically selfish and would prove to be unfaithful and disloyal to God if obedience to Him no longer appeared to be a course of material or personal gain. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974766/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 2:4, 5</a>) So that this universally important issue might be settled, Jehovah God permitted Satan to attempt to prove his claim. This allowed Satan to use his influence in trying to persuade other angelic sons to assert their independence, thereby putting them to a test as to their loyalty to God.</p>

Actually there is quite a difference. Not all those who attend these meetings really associate.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">To help appreciate how one can attend meetings and yet not be associating, consider the Bible account at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969687/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 1:6</a>. Here it shows that not only human servants of God attend meetings, but even the spirit sons of God have appointed times to come before Jehovah God. The account says: “Now it came to be the day when the sons of the true God entered to take their station before Jehovah, and even Satan proceeded to enter right among them.” Satan attended that meeting, but was he truly associating with Jehovah God and the faithful spirit sons of God gathered there? Not really.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">To <em>attend</em> means “to be present.” This was the case with Satan in this particular instance. But the word <em>associate</em> means more. It means to “join as a friend, companion, partner or confederate,” or “to unite in company; to be or go together as companions; also, to unite in action; join for a common purpose.”</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Now certainly these terms did not apply to Satan in his attendance at this meeting. He certainly was not joining with Jehovah God. He proved to be no friend of Jehovah. Nor did Satan view the faithful sons of God as his friends or companions. In fact, he called into question their motives for serving God.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">We can appreciate, then, that whether we really associate with others is determined not by our mere presence, but, rather, by our attitude or feeling toward the ones who are present there with us.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>GENUINE BROTHERS</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Jehovah’s witnesses refer to one another as “brother” and “sister.” This denotes the close relationship that should exist among all servants of Jehovah God. The term “brother” literally means son of the same parents. But do we really feel such a close relationship with those who are dedicated servants of our Father, Jehovah God? Or do we merely use the term “brother” because we ‘picked it up,’ because that is what Jehovah’s witnesses call one another?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">It is of interest to observe that the fleshly brothers Cain and Abel claimed to be worshipers of Jehovah, which would make them spiritual brothers as well. On one occasion, the Bible says: “Jehovah said to Cain: ‘Where is Abel your brother?’ and he said: ‘I do not know. Am I my brother’s guardian?’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969687/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 4:9</a>) Cain had recently murdered his brother, but did you notice that he did not hesitate to use the term “brother”?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">This shows that more is required than merely to call another person “brother” or “sister.” Rather, we need to cultivate the close love that really proves us to be <span id="page570" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="570" data-before-text="570"></span>a brother or sister to our Christian associates. It is necessary that we love “neither in word nor with the tongue, but in deed and truth.” The Christian command is “that the one who loves God should be loving his brother also.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969687/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 John 3:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969687/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 4:21</a></p>

Job, a very wealthy man blessed with seven sons and three daughters, lived as a descendant of Uz to the east of the land promised to Job’s distant granduncle Abraham. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 22:20, 21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Job 1:1</a>) Being a servant of the same God, Jehovah, as Abraham worshiped, Job came to prominence some time before his distant cousin Moses became Jehovah’s prophet to the Israelites during their Egyptian captivity in the sixteenth century B.C.E. Properly, then, Jehovah could refer to his witness Job as “the greatest of all the Orientals” or “sons of the East,” saying also, “there is no one like him in the earth,” that is, then contemporaneously living. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 1:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 2:3</a>) Long before Job’s time his forerelative Abraham had made an exodus out of the religiously Babylonized territory of Ur of the Chaldeans. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gen. 11:28,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 31</a>) Behind him Abraham had left the pagan idolatry and apostate religious rituals of Babylon that had saturated Abraham’s hometown of Ur. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 15:7</a>) In fact, in later times, the terms Chaldeans and Babylonians became interchangeable. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ezek. 23:15</a>) Not only had Abraham refused to become Babylonized religiously in his youth but he also had rejected the spell of its thinking and spirit. In order not to share in Babylon’s sins and resultant plagues, Abraham had wisely come out of Babylon’s influence to settle in Canaan, the land of promise, under the direction of Jehovah, the true God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rev. 18:4</a>) Though Job, too, lived in the East where Babylonish religion dominated, he, like his distant granduncle Abraham, also refused to become Babylonized as to religious thinking. In integrity he held his heart fast in support of the Sovereign Godship of the true God, Jehovah.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>TESTING BY SATAN PERMITTED</strong></p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu"> 5.

Angels are drawn up before the true God Jehovah. Strikingly the issue of Godship is dramatized by letting the one entitled “Satan” also be present. It is worthy of note that at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 1:6</a> and thereafter Jehovah’s great resister or adversary, also man’s greatest enemy, is identified as a personality and by title at that. The Hebrew verb <em>satán</em> means “to resist,” and is first used by Moses at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Numbers 22:22,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 32</a>.<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966643/2">c</a> But at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Job 1:6</a> the Hebrew uses the noun <em>satán</em> with the definite article <em>ha</em> affixed to it, thus reading <em>has-satan</em> or The Satan in English.<a id="footnotesource4" data-fnid="4" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966643/3">d</a> The definite article, therefore, particularizes Satan as a person and makes impossible the view held by many that Satan is abstract evil, resistance or opposition. In this manner Satan is established in the Bible as a definite <span id="page523" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="523" data-before-text="523"></span>personality, with the word “Satan” as one of the proper titles to be used in identifying him.—See also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Zechariah 3:1, 2</a>.</p>

<strong>Back to John 1:1, 2</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[68]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="65"><sup>65</sup></span> The late Bishop Westcott, coproducer of the famous Westcott and Hort Greek text of the Christian Scriptures, speaks of the “true humanity of Christ” and yet he argues that Jesus Christ was not “true <span id="page600" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="600" data-before-text="600"></span>humanity” but a mixture, a so-called God-Man. However, note that the Bishop says that the omission of the definite article <em>the</em> before the Greek word <em>theós</em> makes the word <em>theós</em> like an adjective that “describes the nature of the Word” rather than identify his person. This fact accounts for it that some translators render it: “And the Word was divine.” That is not the same as saying that the Word was God and was identical with God. One grammarian would translate the passage: “And the Word was deity,” to bring out his view that the Word was not “all of God.”<a id="footnotesource5" data-fnid="5" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1962726/4">e</a> According to trinitarians the Word was only a third of God, a coequal Second Person in a three-in-one God.

Here is the account from the book of Job: “Now it came to be the day when the sons of The [true] God came in to take their station before Jehovah, and even Satan proceeded to come in right among them. Then Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Where do you come from?’ At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘From roving about in the earth and from walking about in it.’ And Jehovah went on to say to Satan: ‘Have you set your heart upon my servant Job, that there is no one like him in the earth, a man of integrity and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad?’ At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘Is it for nothing that Job has feared God? Have not you yourself put up a hedge about him and about his house and about everything that he has all around?

He did not know the question that he was picked to prove, namely, that God can raise up the right kind of persons to be his witnesses in the earth, and that they will hold on to their integrity to him despite all the unjust suffering he may allow to test their unselfish worship of him.

His wife was living and he had seven sons and three daughters. Besides that, he had seven thousand sheep and three thousand camels, making a total of ten thousand together, and also five hundred spans of oxen and five hundred she-asses, along with a very great body of servants. In spite of all these possessions, Job was not a materialistic man. He did not get so deeply buried in his material goods that he forgot about God, who was the real source of all his wealth. He did not try to increase his material wealth by going crooked and violating the laws of God and showing no fear of God. Job wanted his ten children to fear God and stay in God’s favor. So after his seven sons had spread banquets for their three sisters at their seven houses, Job would always act as an intercessor for them with Jehovah. “Job would send and sanctify them, and he got up early in the morning and offered up burnt sacrifices according to the number of all of them, for, said Job, ‘maybe my sons have sinned and have cursed God in their heart.’ That is the way Job would do always.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 1:1-5</a>) At that time Jehovah God had not yet set up his exclusive priesthood in the tribe of Levi, the tribe of Moses the prophet.</p><p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">12. In what way did Jehovah bless Job, and why in this way?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Quite properly Jehovah God blessed Job for his faithful worship as a witness of Jehovah, and quite properly at that time God blessed Job with material goods to be used in a right way. Job could be trusted with them. Long before this God had blessed Job’s granduncle Abraham in this manner, and also Abraham’s son Isaac and his grandson Jacob. So it was nothing new for God to increase the material possessions of his servant Job and to protect them against enemy attack. Certainly God did not bless his servants with material goods just to enrich the thievish enemy. For this reason God kept those goods out of the hands of selfish, greedy evildoers. Neither Job nor Abraham and Isaac and Jacob expected to go to heaven and be rewarded only up there after death. So God was in harmony with their earthly hopes in blessing them upon the earth. Who, then, had a right to object to Job’s having all this material wealth? No one.</p><p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu">13. What test had Job withstood thus far, and so what test did Satan propose, and why?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[67]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> However, Satan the Devil did not want God to have any pleasure out of Job. Hence he accused Job. Let it be noted that Satan did not, even as he could not, accuse Job of acting materialistically and misusing all the material goods with which Jehovah had blessed Job. No; up to that point Job had withstood the test of materialism. All <span id="page596" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="596" data-before-text="596"></span>that was left for Satan to do, then, was to accuse Job’s heart condition. He was at heart materialistic; he was serving Jehovah God only for the material good that he could get out of it, argued Satan the Devil. To show up Job’s heart condition and the weakness of his integrity Satan suggested that Jehovah take away all those material possessions. Of course, Jehovah would not do that himself; but, to permit the question to be answered, he would let Satan the Devil and his crowd on earth take away such material things. Satan had no confidence in Job. God did, and he was not unwilling to prove this.</p>

<strong>Holy Spirit Active in the Invisible Heavenly Realm</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> Assemblies of those “sons of God” take place from time to time and the Most High God presides over them. He has revealed that fact to us in his written Word. The earliest reports that we find of such heavenly assemblies are recorded in the first two chapters of Job. “Now,” in the earlier part of Job’s life, “it came to be the day when the sons of the true God entered to take their station before Jehovah, and even Satan proceeded to enter right among them. Then Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Where do you come from?’ At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘From roving about in the earth and from walking about in it.’” Some verses later, in the next chapter, a second assembly of Jehovah with his heavenly sons is reported on, and again that spirit person called Satan takes advantage of the opportunity.(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101976032/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 1:6, 7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101976032/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 2:1, 2</a>) Those assemblies, invisible to our sight, are purposeful, and Almighty God maintains order at them. All present have to answer to him as to their whereabouts and their doings. Even the individual called Satan has to be respectful, even though he is what his name brands him to be, the outstanding resister of Jehovah God.</p>

<strong>When Man Was with God in Paradise</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> The time came when God purposed to become a Father. This did not mean to become the Creator of lifeless things, unintelligent things. It meant to give existence to living intelligences, to sons with some likeness to him their Father. Thus he purposed to take upon Himself the responsibility of a family of children. What kind of sons did He purpose to produce first? Not <span id="page27" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span>human sons, for in that case he would have had to produce first an earthly globe upon which they could live. Reasonably, God would produce sons who, like Himself, are heavenly, being spirit just as He is spirit. Thus they would be spirit sons, who could see him and have direct access into His presence and with whom he could communicate directly.</p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu"> 3.

The writer of the Bible book of Job, likely the prophet Moses, speaks of these in the opening chapter of the book, saying: “Now it came to be the day when the sons of the true God entered to take their station before Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974033/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 1:6</a>) A second meeting of those heavenly sons of the true God is called to our notice in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974033/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 2:1</a>. The fact that these spirit sons of God existed in the invisible heavens before the creation of our earth is emphasized when God speaks to the man Job out of the invisible and asks him: “Where did you happen to be when I founded the earth? . . . when the morning stars joyfully cried out together, and all the sons of God began shouting in applause?” Evidently those sons of God, brilliantly shining like morning stars in the heavens, were interested in God’s purpose in creating our earth and admired the way in which he created the earth, “stretching out the north over the empty place, hanging the earth upon nothing” in space.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974033/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 38:4-7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974033/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 26:7</a>.</p>

<strong>Satan the Devil—Personification or a Person?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The earliest direct references to Satan (literally, “the Satan”) in the Bible are found in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101973887/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job, chapters one and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101973887/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> two</a>.

If “Satan” is only the evil in any person, the evil must have been in Jehovah God with whom Satan was speaking. But the Bible describes God as one “in whom there is no unrighteousness.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101973887/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 92:15</a>.</p>

<strong>Appointed Times of the Nations</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The symbolisms used in this prophetic vision are by no means unique. Trees are elsewhere used to represent ruling powers, including that of God’s typical kingdom at Jerusalem. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Judges 9:6-15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Ezekiel 17:1-24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/25/2" data-bid="26-3" class="b"> 31:2-18</a>.) A stump’s being caused to sprout, and the symbol of a “twig” or “sprout” are found a number of times as representing the renewal of rulership in a certain stock or line, particularly in the Messianic prophecies. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Isa. 10:33–11:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 53:2-7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/26/2" data-bid="27-3" class="b"> <span id="page96" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="96" data-before-text="96"></span>Jer. 23:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/26/3" data-bid="27-4" class="b"> Ezek. 17:22-24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/26/4" data-bid="27-5" class="b"> Zech. 6:12, 13</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Job 14:7-9</a>.)

The tree is shown to have an application to Nebuchadnezzar, who at that point in history was the head of the dominant world power, Babylon. Yet, prior to Nebuchadnezzar’s conquest of Jerusalem, the typical kingdom of God ruling out of that city was the agency by which Jehovah expressed his rightful sovereignty toward earth. It thus constituted a divine block or impediment for Nebuchadnezzar in attaining his goal of world domination. By allowing that typical kingdom at Jerusalem to be overthrown, Jehovah permitted his own visible expression of sovereignty through the Davidic dynasty of kings to be cut down. The expression and exercise of world domination in “the kingdom of mankind,” unhindered by any representative kingdom of God, now passed into the hands of the Gentile nations. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Lam. 1:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 2:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/29/2" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> 16, 17</a>) In the light of these facts the “tree” is seen to represent, beyond and above its application to Nebuchadnezzar, world sovereignty or domination by God’s arrangement.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong><em>Renewal of world domination by divine right</em></strong></p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">God, however, here makes clear that he has not forever delivered up such world domination to the Gentile powers. The vision shows that God’s self-restraint (represented by the bands of iron and copper around the “stump” of the tree) would continue until “seven times pass over it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Dan. 4:16,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 23,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/30/2" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> 25</a>) Then, since “the Most High is Ruler in the kingdom of mankind,” God would give world domination “to the one whom he wants to.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Dan. 4:17</a>) The prophetic book of Daniel itself shows that one to be the “son of man” to whom are given “rulership and dignity and kingdom, that the peoples, national groups and languages should all serve even him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Dan. 7:13, 14</a>) Jesus’ own prophecy, in which the reference to the “appointed times of the nations” occurs, points definitely toward Christ Jesus’ exercise of such world domination as God’s chosen king, the heir of the Davidic dynasty. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Matt. 24:30, 31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/33/1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 25:31-34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/33/2" data-bid="34-3" class="b"> Luke 21:27-31,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/33/3" data-bid="34-4" class="b"> 36</a>) Thus, the symbolic “stump,” representing God’s retention of the sovereign right to exercise world domination in the “kingdom of mankind,” was due to sprout again in his Son’s kingdom.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ps. 89:27,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 35-37</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="ss"><strong>SEVEN SYMBOLIC TIMES</strong></p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">In Nebuchadnezzar’s personal experience of the vision’s fulfillment the “seven times” were evidently seven years, during which he admits that he became mad, with symptoms like those of lycanthropy, abandoning his throne to eat grass like a beast in the field. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Dan. 4:33-36</a>) Notably, the Biblical description of the exercise of world domination by the Gentile powers is presented through the figure of beasts, in opposition to the holy people of God and their “Prince of princes.” (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Daniel 7:2-8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/36/1" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/36/2" data-bid="37-3" class="b"> 17-26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/36/3" data-bid="37-4" class="b"> 8:3-12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/36/4" data-bid="37-5" class="b"> 20-25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/36/5" data-bid="37-6" class="b"> Rev. 11:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/36/6" data-bid="37-7" class="b"> 13:1-11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/36/7" data-bid="37-8" class="b"> 17:7-14</a>.) Concerning the word “times” (from Aramaic <em>ʽid·danʹ</em>), as used in Daniel’s prophecy, lexicographers show it here to mean “years.” (See <em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros</em> by Koehler and Baumgartner, p. 1106; <em>A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament</em> by Brown, Driver and Briggs, p. 1105.) The duration of a year as so used is indicated to be 360 days, inasmuch as three and a half times are shown to equal “a thousand two hundred and sixty days” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Revelation 12:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/37/1" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> 14</a>. (Compare also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Revelation 11:2, 3</a>.) “Seven times,” according to this count, would equal 2,520 days. That a specific number of days may be used in the Bible record to represent prophetically an equivalent number of years can be seen by reading the accounts at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Numbers 14:34 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/39/1" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> Ezekiel 4:6</a>. Only by applying the formula there expressed of “a day for a year” to the “seven times” of this prophecy can the vision of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Daniel chapter four</a> have significant fulfillment beyond the now extinct Nebuchadnezzar’s day, as the evidence thus far presented gives reason to expect. They therefore represent 2,520 years.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">It is a historical fact worth noting that, on the basis of the points and evidence above presented, the year 1914 was identified as the time for the close of the “appointed times of the nations” (and the end of the lease of power granted the Gentile rulers) in the March 1880 edition of the <em>Watch Tower</em> magazine. This was some thirty-four years before the arrival of that year and the momentous events it initiated. In the August 30, 1914, edition of <em>The World</em>, a leading New York newspaper at that time, a feature article in the paper’s Sunday magazine section commented on this as follows: “The terrific war outbreak in Europe has fulfilled an extraordinary prophecy. For a quarter of a century past, through preachers and through press, the ‘International Bible Students’ . . . have been proclaiming to the world that the Day of Wrath prophesied in the Bible would dawn in 1914.”</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">The events that took place from and after the fall of the year 1914 C.E. are well-known history to all, beginning with the great war that erupted, the first <em>world</em> war in mankind’s history and the first to be fought over the issue, not of the domination of Europe alone, nor of Africa, nor of Asia, but of <em>the domination of the world</em>.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Luke 21:7-33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/41/1" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> Rev. 11:15-18</a>; see LAST DAYS; PRESENCE.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p76" data-pid="76"><strong><em>Profanation of the name.</em></strong> The evidence is that the divine name was so regarded until events in the garden of Eden brought about its profanation. Satan’s rebellion brought God’s reputation into question. To Eve, he claimed to speak for God in telling her what “God knows,” while at the same time he cast doubt on God’s command, expressed to Adam, concerning the tree of the knowledge of good and bad.

Taking up the issue, Jehovah asked Satan: “Have you set your heart upon my servant Job, that there is no one like him in the earth, a man blameless and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994843/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Job 1:8</a>) Job met divine standards that took his imperfections into account.

The work of his hands you have blessed, and his livestock itself has spread abroad in the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994843/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Job 1:9, 10</a>) The Devil thus slandered Jehovah by implying that nobody loves and worships Him for what He is but that He bribes creatures to serve Him.

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Bible does not provide us with great detail about how Jehovah God communicates with spirit creatures. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986809/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job chapters 1 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986809/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2</a> relate that Satan once appeared “before Jehovah” at an assemblage of angels in heaven. “Then Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Where do you come from?’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986809/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 1:6, 7</a>) In this case, the book of Job does not depict Satan as communicating with Jehovah through an intermediary. Again, the prophet Micaiah had a vision of Jehovah seated upon His throne. The prophet saw an angel communicating with Jehovah, and no intermediary is mentioned. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986809/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Kings 22:19-23</a>) The Logos is left out of the picture in these two cases.

<strong>Love as a “Bond of Union” Proves to Be “Perfect”</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> At his rebellion Satan the Devil was cast out of the universal family of Jehovah God, and later on so were his demons under his fatherhood. At the garden of Eden he presented himself to humankind as the Tempter, and he was permitted, even after that, to go to and fro throughout the earth in his campaign of wickedness and opposition to the truth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982926/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 1:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982926/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2:2</a>) But now, since the foretold “war” after the birth of God’s Kingdom in the heavens, following the end of “the appointed times of the nations” in 1914, Satan the Devil and his demons have been cast out of heaven from immediate contact with the heavenly angels and down to the earth. Never again will they gain entry into the angelic heavens. So we can well understand the rage that Satan has against Jehovah’s universal organization and the loyal members of it. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982926/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 12:1-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982926/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Luke 21:24</a>) This, therefore, is the time of all times for the loving prayer of the apostle Paul, as recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982926/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Colossians 1:2</a>, to be answered in behalf of the loyal adherents to Jehovah’s organization who are now on earth, namely: “May you have undeserved kindness and peace from God our Father.” This prayer for peace among them cannot be realized if there is no unity within their ranks. Peace calls for internal harmony inside the visible organization of the God who gives peace, yes, cohesion of the organization members to one another.</p>

<strong>If God Has an Organization, What Is It?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[27]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Thus the One to be feared now in this time for individual decision is the Creator, the Universal Organizer. In the book of Job we are given a glimpse into his heavenly family of angelic sons. The organizer of the worldly system of things since the deluge of Noah’s day, Satan the Devil, was once a member of that family. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981326/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 1:6, 7</a> he is pictured as an intruder into family affairs, for there we read: “Now it came to be the day when the sons of the true God entered to take their station before Jehovah, and even Satan proceeded to enter right among them. Then Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Where do you come from?’ At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘From roving about in the earth and from walking about in it.’” At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981326/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 2:1, 2</a> a similar picture is painted of a later meeting of the sons of the true God in the invisible heavens.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="qu"> 6. (a) What does such a meeting of the heavenly “sons of the true God,” presided over by Jehovah God, indicate?

What appropriate word or words come to mind? We leave it for the reader to say. Those meetings were formal ones, with the true God rightfully presiding. Satan’s being admitted to those meetings does not mean that he was still viewed as one of “the sons of the true God” and was still part of God’s heavenly household. His very designation “Satan” indicates he was not, for the name means “Opposer.” So he had no good purpose in moving about in the earth as a spirit invisible to men. He was opposed to any man who tried to keep his integrity toward the true God. With divine permission he made that righteous, God-fearing man named Job of the land of Uz the victim of his attacks. But he failed in his dastardly purpose to bring the universal sovereignty of Jehovah God into contempt before men on earth as well as angels in heaven. Job’s faithful example proved to be a great encouragement to Jehovah’s heavenly family of angelic sons.</p>

You may recall that he often spoke of the Devil, and that he called him “the father of the lie” and a “manslayer.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968880/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 8:44</a>) For our own protection in this time when lying and murder are on the increase, we do well to examine this subject.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Many persons, of course, do not believe that there are wicked spirit creatures. Even some who claim to use the Bible say that Satan the Devil is only a quality of evil, not an invisible spirit person. But do the facts agree with their belief?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>IS THE DEVIL REALLY A SPIRIT PERSON?</strong></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">What about Jesus Christ’s own experience when the Devil tempted him? The Bible tells us that the Devil showed Jesus all the kingdoms of the world and said to him: “All these things I will give you if you fall down and do an act of worship to me.” Jesus answered the Devil: “Go away, Satan! For it is written, ‘It is Jehovah your God you must worship.’” Then the Devil left Jesus.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968880/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 4:1-11</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">During that experience, by whom was Jesus Christ tempted? By a real person? or by a mere quality of evil? If he was tempted by a mere quality of evil, in whom did this quality dwell? Was this evil in Jesus Christ? If so, then it could not be true that in him there was no sin. Yet the Bible, God’s Word of truth, makes it very clear that Jesus was “guileless, undefiled, separated from the sinners.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968880/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb. 7:26</a>) The Bible also says: “He committed no sin, nor was deception found in his mouth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968880/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:22</a>) So Jesus could not have been carrying on a conversation with “evil” in his own self. He was talking to a living spirit creature.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In the account about the God-fearing man Job, the Bible tells us that Jehovah talked to Satan. It says: “Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Where do you come from?’ At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘From roving about in the earth and from walking about in it.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968880/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 1:6, 7</a>) Well, now, was Satan on that occasion not a real person, but merely a quality of evil? Then to whom was God talking? To himself? If so, the quality of evil was in God Almighty himself, and that would mean that evil started with Jehovah. Such an idea is in conflict with all the rest of the Holy Bible and is contrary to reason.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968880/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 145:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968880/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Rev. 4:8</a>.</p>

<strong>Unrest—Why So Widespread?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">We can see what the air symbolizes by going to the Bible and also by turning back to the beliefs of ancient religion. According to the ancient Babylonians, the air was the abode of evil spirits and devils. <span id="page761" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="761" data-before-text="761"></span>Of the seven evil spirits whom they feared, the first one was the South Wind, the sixth a whirlwind, and the seventh a storm (hurricane). There were also triads of devils, the demons that caused sickness seeming to form a class by themselves. But each of these devils had a name and was thought to have a monstrous form of some kind. The followers of Pythagoras believed our atmosphere to be peopled with spirits under the control of a chief who held his seat of empire in the air. Such spirits were thought to be powerful but malignant, bent on inciting men to do wickedness.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In the Bible the Greek word for “air,” in which these demon spirits were thought to dwell, is <em>aēr,</em> as in the word aeroplane. Air in motion becomes wind and as such exerts force, driving power. Like air, people breathe in the spirit of this world. So the spirit of this world exerts a force upon people that can be observed in their actions. Who is in control of this force against which God has such great indignation that he pours out the final bowl of his anger upon it? Let us look into the Bible to see.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>WHO CONTROLS THE SPIRIT OF THE WORLD</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The Bible speaks of an invisible realm in which dwell spirit persons, the angels, much more powerful than man, who are able to travel through interstellar space where there is no atmosphere such as we on earth live in and, of course, they are beyond the need of any air such as we breathe and are not under its influence or control. They are as invisible as the air and, if they exert an active force to direct the actions of men and in fact direct their lives, they can be said to have authority in the air. The Bible uses that very expression in regard to Satan the Devil, who is declared to be “the prince of the power of the air” or “the ruler of the authority of the air, the spirit that now operates in the sons of disobedience.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966923/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Eph. 2:2</a>, <em>AV, NW.</em></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">It follows that the spirit of the world, which is against God, is therefore a spirit that is controlled by Satan and is also the spirit of Satan himself, who has opposed God from the beginning of his rebellion. We do not want to deceive ourselves by underrating his powers. He is a mighty angelic creature. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966923/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 2:14</a> he is described as the one having the means to cause death. He gained this power after he induced Adam and Eve to sin in the garden of Eden and thus bring death upon all of their offspring. Since getting mankind under sin, he is able to work on their imperfection to bring about degradation on the part of some; also, he is able to use men under his influence to kill others, especially in warfare. He was given special permission, for the purpose of the test of integrity upon Job, to cause the death of Job’s ten children by a windstorm. The heavenly scene is described in the book of Job, where Satan is shown appearing before God. Since he said in reply to Jehovah’s question as to his activities that he came from roving about in the earth and from walking up and down in it, he most likely had been roving about within earth’s air or atmosphere, carrying on his activities to influence men against God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966923/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 1:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966923/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 18, 19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966923/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 2:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966923/4/3" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 6</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">As the book of Job shows, during the time allowed for settling the issue raised concerning God’s sovereignty and the related question of man’s integrity to God, Jehovah God has permitted Satan to have access to the earth to test His servants. So Satan, having a powerful organization of wicked demons, is called the ruler of the authority of the air. Sons of disobedience among mankind therefore breathe in, as it were, the spirit of Satan the Devil. It is this spirit that motivates them and <span id="page762" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="762" data-before-text="762"></span>causes them to mold their lives according to this system of things of which Satan is the god.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966923/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Eph. 2:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966923/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 4:4</a>.</p>

They purposely wrote in the most effective way for us Bible readers to know and understand that Satan the Devil is a real, corporeal, conscious, intelligent spirit person. They did not violate the laws of language and thus merely deceive us into thinking that Satan the Devil is a true-to-life person instead of simply the “principle of evil” personified. Hence the above-quoted <em>Cyclopædia</em> goes on to say: “But there are other difficulties than those general ones by which the theory of personification is encumbered. This theory supposes the devil to be the <em>principle of evil.</em> Let it [the theory] be applied to the interpretation of two or three passages of Scripture.” Then the <em>Cyclopædia</em> takes up the Scripture passage about the temptation of Jesus Christ in the wilderness of Judea by Satan the Devil, as told by the Christian apostle Matthew, and says:</p><p id="p87" data-pid="87" class="qu">17.

Or was it by the principle of evil? If by the latter, in whom or what did this principle reside? Was it in Jesus? Then it could not be true that in him was no sin. The very principle of sin was in him, which would have made him the tempter of himself. This is bad [science of interpretation], producing worse theology. Let it also be remembered that this principle of evil, in order to be moral evil, must inhere in some conscious moral being.

If so, then to whom was Jehovah God talking? To himself? If so, then Satan, the personified principle of evil, was residing in Jehovah God himself. This would mean, too, that the principle of evil was inherent in God Almighty himself, and that moral evil originated with the only living and true God. Such a blasphemous idea is against all the rest of the Holy Bible.</p><p id="p90" data-pid="90" class="qu">21. Were the theory of the personification of evil principle true, who, then, really accused Job before God, who contradicted himself, and who proved to be a liar in the outcome?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[90]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> Furthermore, God pronounced the man Job to be “a man blameless and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad.” But Satan accused Job of serving Jehovah God just for what earthly benefits he could get out of it. We read: “At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘Is it for nothing that Job has feared God? . . . But, for a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch everything that he has and see whether he will not curse you to your very face.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966281/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 1:8-11</a>) Now, if Satan here were just <span id="page234" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="234" data-before-text="234"></span>the “principle of evil” personified that really was accusing the man Job to God, then Jehovah God himself would be the accuser, and this right after he had pronounced Job to be a good man without an equal in the earth. In that case the principle of evil would be in the Most High God himself, and he would be contradicting himself. Furthermore, when God let Satan test out Job and when Satan was proved to be a liar, then, if Satan was only the principle of evil, God himself was proved to be a liar.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966281/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 1:12-22</a>.</p>

<strong>Endurance like Job’s in the Time of the End</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> God’s power pulls back the veil of invisibility and we look into the spirit world to see a meeting of angels assembling before the Most High God, to which meeting Jehovah God had ordered Satan to come. At the meeting what took place? Here is the account from the book of Job: “Now it came to be the day when the sons of The [true] God came in to take their station before Jehovah, and even Satan proceeded to come in right among them. Then Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Where do you come from?’ At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘From roving about in the earth and from walking about in it.’ And Jehovah went on to say to Satan: ‘Have you set your heart upon my servant Job, that there is no one like him in the earth, a man of integrity and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad?’ At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘Is it for nothing that Job has feared God? Have not you yourself put up a hedge about him and about his house and about everything that he has all around? The work of his hands you have blessed and his livestock itself has spread abroad in the earth. But, for a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch everything he has [and see] <span id="page595" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="595" data-before-text="595"></span>whether he will not curse you to your very face.’ Accordingly Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Look! everything that he has is in your hand. Only against him himself do not thrust out your hand!’ So Satan went out away from the person of Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 1:6-12</a>.</p><p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu">10.

Here was the thing that caused Job difficulty. He did not know the question that he was picked to prove, namely, that God can raise up the right kind of persons to be his witnesses in the earth, and that they will hold on to their integrity to him despite all the unjust suffering he may allow to test their unselfish worship of him. Job being then the unequaled witness of Jehovah on earth, no one should be better qualified to prove this point in favor of Jehovah than Job.</p><p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu">11. In what office toward God was Job acting in behalf of his family, and why?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Job was acting as priest of Jehovah God for his family. His wife was living and he had seven sons and three daughters. Besides that, he had seven thousand sheep and three thousand camels, making a total of ten thousand together, and also five hundred spans of oxen and five hundred she-asses, along with a very great body of servants. In spite of all these possessions, Job was not a materialistic man. He did not get so deeply buried in his material goods that he forgot about God, who was the real source of all his wealth. He did not try to increase his material wealth by going crooked and violating the laws of God and showing no fear of God. Job wanted his ten children to fear God and stay in God’s favor. So after his seven sons had spread banquets for their three sisters at their seven houses, Job would always act as an intercessor for them with Jehovah. “Job would send and sanctify them, and he got up early in the morning and offered up burnt sacrifices according to the number of all of them, for, said Job, ‘maybe my sons have sinned and have cursed God in their heart.’ That is the way Job would do always.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 1:1-5</a>) At that time Jehovah God had not yet set up his exclusive priesthood in the tribe of Levi, the tribe of Moses the prophet.</p><p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">12. In what way did Jehovah bless Job, and why in this way?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Quite properly Jehovah God blessed Job for his faithful worship as a witness of Jehovah, and quite properly at that time God blessed Job with material goods to be used in a right way. Job could be trusted with them. Long before this God had blessed Job’s granduncle Abraham in this manner, and also Abraham’s son Isaac and his grandson Jacob. So it was nothing new for God to increase the material possessions of his servant Job and to protect them against enemy attack. Certainly God did not bless his servants with material goods just to enrich the thievish enemy. For this reason God kept those goods out of the hands of selfish, greedy evildoers. Neither Job nor Abraham and Isaac and Jacob expected to go to heaven and be rewarded only up there after death. So God was in harmony with their earthly hopes in blessing them upon the earth. Who, then, had a right to object to Job’s having all this material wealth? No one.</p><p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu">13. What test had Job withstood thus far, and so what test did Satan propose, and why?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[67]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> However, Satan the Devil did not want God to have any pleasure out of Job. Hence he accused Job. Let it be noted that Satan did not, even as he could not, accuse Job of acting materialistically and misusing all the material goods with which Jehovah had blessed Job. No; up to that point Job had withstood the test of materialism. All <span id="page596" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="596" data-before-text="596"></span>that was left for Satan to do, then, was to accuse Job’s heart condition. He was at heart materialistic; he was serving Jehovah God only for the material good that he could get out of it, argued Satan the Devil. To show up Job’s heart condition and the weakness of his integrity Satan suggested that Jehovah take away all those material possessions. Of course, Jehovah would not do that himself; but, to permit the question to be answered, he would let Satan the Devil and his crowd on earth take away such material things. Satan had no confidence in Job. God did, and he was not unwilling to prove this.</p>

<strong>Why the Struggle to Keep Integrity?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Satan is a force for evil let loose in the earth and heavens and by his evil act he raised an issue, and that issue is: Who is supreme? He is trying to put over his idea that he can get all creatures on <span id="page135" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="135" data-before-text="135"></span>earth to worship him, and that God cannot have creatures on the earth who will be faithful to him, who will serve him, even under a test. The question is, Can Jehovah carry out his original purpose to populate the earth with righteous creatures? So the great issue has come to be one of integrity. Though Satan was disempowered by God, though he was taken away from his position as the covering cherub, cast out legally, still he was not banished from being present in this world. God set a time; he allowed time for the Devil to try to prove the evil challenge. And so Satan has since that time exercised influence over humans and over the development of their civilization.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 5. How does the Bible show Satan takes interest in men and governments on the earth and tries to turn all men away from God?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> We have the key to the understanding of this in the book of Job in the Bible. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953161/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 1:6-12</a> (<em>Mo</em>) we read: “One day the angels came to present themselves before the Eternal [Jehovah, <em>AS</em>], and among them the Adversary [Satan, <em>AS</em>]. ‘Where have you been?’ said the Eternal to the Adversary; and the Adversary answered, ‘Roaming here and there, roving about the earth.’ Then the Eternal said to the Adversary, ‘Have you noticed that there is no one like my servant [Job] on earth, a blameless and an upright man, who reverences God and shuns evil?’ The Adversary answered, ‘But is it for nothing that [Job] reverences God? Have you not hedged him safely in, his house and all he has? You have prospered him in his business, and his flocks are teeming on the land. Only put out your hand, touch whatever he possesses, and see if he will not curse you to your face!’ Then said the Eternal to the Adversary, ‘There! I leave all he has within your power; but lay no hand upon the man himself.’ So away went the Adversary from the presence of the Eternal.” This account in the Scriptures shows clearly that Satan the Devil has earthly interests. At that time he was down dealing with fallen mankind, roaming about the earth. He was the invisible overlord. He had creatures that were serving him. He organized these creatures into different forms of government. Yes, today he has domination over all the governments of the earth. This program he began with Babylon in Nimrod’s time, and the Scriptures tell us he is the “god of this system of things”.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953161/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:4</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 6.

Satan was not able to do anything he wanted to Job, because of the hedge of protection Jehovah put there. God was still in charge and God was going to have this issue settled. God was going to magnify his name throughout all the earth. That is why he did not demonstrate his supreme power immediately by killing Satan, but allowed him to remain. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953161/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ex. 9:16</a>, <em>Mo</em>) From the time of Adam and Eve forward the test of integrity has been going on.

When Jehovah removed the hedge of protection he placed around Job, Job took great losses. He suffered the loss of his livestock; some by storm, others were stolen. He lost his servants, who were slain by marauders. His children, <span id="page136" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="136" data-before-text="136"></span>seven sons and three daughters, were feasting together and a storm was brought on that destroyed their house and they perished.

First, by Satan’s “roaming here and there, roving about the earth” is indicated that he had earthly interests with fallen mankind which required his supervision as an invisible self-constituted overlord. Having made himself independent by what he thought a successful break from theocratic government, from then forward Satan as a mimic sovereign sought to empower many different kinds of governments of his own design over fallen mankind. From his first attempt in establishing a kingdom government at Babylon in Nimrod’s time to the present all the many nontheocratic governments have been of his invention and authorization.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952321/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Gen. 10:8-10</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>WHERE THE NATIONS GET SOVEREIGNTY</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> The facts show that among all the numerous experiments in organizing earthly governments ancient and modern, all the way from absolute monarchies on the right to Communist regimes on the extreme left, each has a record of being harsh, without vision, corrupt, graft-laden, oppressive, beastly, persecuting true worshipers of God, breaking the everlasting covenant as to the sanctity of life and provoking bloody wars.

The sovereign power authorizing such miserable failures as governments could not have been the true Universal Sovereign. Rather, the evidence is overwhelming that it has been Satan, the Dragon, who has attempted to give sovereign power and authority to these ungodly governments.

Satan was not the all-powerful sovereign that he originally thought he was going to be. The fact that <span id="page265" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="265" data-before-text="265"></span>God calls him to question by saying, “Where have you been?” indicates that Jehovah had the upper hand. Satan in fear was being put on the spot, so to speak. The further fact that Satan complains of the “hedge” put around Job indicates that he was nettled at Jehovah’s displays of superior power not only in defense of his true worshipers on earth, but also on special occasions, such as, for example, at the Flood, where with no difficulty God washed away Satan’s angelized earthly civilization; at Babel, where God confused the speech of Satan’s first earthly kingdom; and in Egypt, where Jehovah brought the first world power to its knees to deliver the Israelites with a high hand.

He was taking no chances in needlessly arousing Jehovah’s far superior forces. All this was reducing the sham sovereign to a helpless inferior and demonstrated that his control on earth was not all-embracing. In fact, he merely controlled those parts where he had blinded the inhabitants with his false religions and had kept them in line by means of his various makeshift governments. Never has he enjoyed undisputed control and power over all mankind, because at all times there have been those who have clung to the true worship of Jehovah God and who have looked forward to a restoration of a divine, sovereign-empowered government over all the earth.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952321/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Heb. 11:10</a>.</p>

Then Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Where do you come from?’ At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘From roving about in the earth and from walking about in it.’” Some verses later, in the next chapter, a second assembly of Jehovah with his heavenly sons is reported on, and again that spirit person called Satan takes advantage of the opportunity.(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101976032/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 1:6, 7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101976032/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 2:1, 2</a>) Those assemblies, invisible to our sight, are purposeful, and Almighty God maintains order at them. All present have to answer to him as to their whereabouts and their doings. Even the individual called Satan has to be respectful, even though he is what his name brands him to be, the outstanding resister of Jehovah God.</p>

<strong>Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p77" data-pid="77"><strong><em>The supreme issue a moral one.</em></strong> It is evident that the spirit son who became Satan knew Jehovah as a God of moral standards, not as a capricious, erratic person. Had he known Jehovah as a God given to uncontrolled, violent outbursts, he could only have expected immediate, on-the-spot extermination for the course he took. The issue Satan raised in Eden, therefore, was not simply a test of Jehovah’s mightiness or power to destroy. Rather, it was a moral issue: that of God’s moral right to exercise universal sovereignty and require implicit obedience and devotion of all of his creatures in all places. Satan’s approach to Eve reveals this. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002391/144/0" data-bid="145-1" class="b">Ge 3:1-6</a>) Likewise, the book of Job relates how Jehovah brings out into the open before all his assembled angelic sons the extent of the position taken by his Adversary. Satan made the claim that the loyalty of Job (and, by implication, of any of God’s intelligent creatures) toward Jehovah was not wholehearted, not based on true devotion and genuine love.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002391/145/0" data-bid="146-1" class="b">Job 1:6-22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002391/145/1" data-bid="146-2" class="b"> 2:1-8</a>.</p>

<strong>Integrity</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong><em>Job.</em></strong> Job, who evidently lived in the period between the death of Joseph and the time of Moses, is described as a man who had “proved to be blameless [Heb., <em>tam</em>] and upright, and fearing God and turning aside from bad.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002182/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 1:1</a>; see <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002182/3">JOB</a>.) That human integrity forms part of the issue between Jehovah God and Satan is clear from God’s questioning his Adversary about Job when Satan appeared during an angelic assembly in the courts of heaven. Satan imputed false motive to Job’s worship of God, alleging that Job served not out of pure devotion but for selfish benefits. He thereby placed in question Job’s integrity to God. Permitted to divest Job of his vast possessions and even of his children, Satan failed to crack Job’s integrity. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002182/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Job 1:6–2:3</a>) He then claimed that Job was selfishly willing to endure the loss of possessions and children as long as he could save his own skin.

On my justness I have laid hold, and I shall not let it go; my heart will not taunt me for any of my days.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002182/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Job 27:5, 6</a>) His maintaining integrity demonstrated that God’s Adversary was a liar.</p>

By then Joseph the son of Jacob (Israel) had died (1657 B.C.E.) after he had endured much unjust suffering but had kept his blamelessness toward Jehovah God. Moses had not yet risen up as Jehovah’s prophet to lead the 12 tribes of Israel out of Egyptian slavery. Between Joseph’s death and the time when Moses by his conduct showed himself to be blameless and upright, there was no human with integrity like Job’s. It was likely during this period that the conversations involving Job took place between Jehovah and Satan.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002475/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 1:6-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002475/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 2:1-7</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>Should we understand from</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992568/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Job 1:8</strong></a> <strong>that during the period when Job lived, he was the only human who was faithful to Jehovah?</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">No. That conclusion is not justified by <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992568/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 1:8</a>, which says:</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Jehovah went on to say to Satan: ‘Have you set your heart upon my servant Job, that there is no one like him in the earth, a man blameless and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad?’” God provided a similar assessment at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992568/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 2:3</a>, asking Satan: “Have you set your heart upon my servant Job, that there is no one like him in the earth, a man blameless and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad?”</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The book of Job itself indicates that Job was not the only human alive whom God accepted as faithful. Beginning in chapter 32, we read about Elihu. Though being a younger man, Elihu corrected the error of Job’s outlook and magnified the true God.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992568/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 32:6–33:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992568/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 31-33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992568/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Job 35:1–36:2</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Consequently, God’s comment that ‘there was no one like Job in the earth’ must mean that Job was particularly outstanding as a man of uprightness. Likely Job lived in the interval between the death of Joseph in Egypt and the beginning of Moses’ service as God’s prophet. During that period a large number of Israelites resided in Egypt. There is no reason to think that all of them were unfaithful and unacceptable to God; probably there were many who trusted in Jehovah.

<strong>Job’s Integrity—Why So Remarkable?</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> Job lived in the land of Uz, in what is now Arabia. Although not an Israelite, Job was a worshiper of Jehovah, something that Jehovah drew to Satan’s attention. God’s statement that “there is no one like him in the earth, a man blameless and upright,” reveals that there was no other outstanding servant of God living at that time. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986164/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 1:8</a>) Thus, Job’s testing by Satan must have occurred while his distant cousins, the Israelites, were in slavery in Egypt​—sometime during the years following the death of the outstanding integrity keeper Joseph in 1657 B.C.E. and before Moses entered upon his course of integrity.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 3. Who wrote the book of Job, and why was he able to get the information?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> Moses evidently wrote the book of Job. But how could he have learned about Job’s testing? Well, after Moses was forced to leave Egypt in 1553 B.C.E. he settled in Midian, not far from the land of Uz. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986164/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Exodus 2:15-25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986164/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Acts 7:23-30</a>) <span id="page11" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>At that time, Job was living out the final 140 years of life with which Jehovah blessed him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986164/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 42:16</a>) Later, when the Israelites were near Uz toward the end of their wilderness journey, Moses could have heard about the last years of Job’s life and his death.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>Job’s Limited Knowledge</strong></p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 4.

However, Job would have known something about Jehovah’s dealings with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. This is because Job was evidently a descendant of Abraham’s brother Nahor, through Nahor’s firstborn son Uz. Furthermore, the brother of Uz was Bethuel, the father of Isaac’s wife Rebekah and the great-grandfather of Joseph. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986164/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Genesis 22:20-23</a>) Job no doubt came to treasure whatever knowledge he had of Jehovah’s communications with Abraham and his descendants, and he was anxious to please Jehovah. Thus Job became a man of outstanding integrity, a man blameless and completely devoted to Jehovah.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 5. What, in particular, makes Job’s integrity so outstanding?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Not long after Joseph’s death in Egypt, Job’s integrity became a subject of controversy between Jehovah God and Satan in the invisible heavens. Yet Job had no knowledge of this controversy that centered around his integrity. And it is, in particular, his ignorance regarding why he was suffering that makes his unbreakable integrity so remarkable. For the benefit of all God’s servants afterward, however, Jehovah had Moses record the details of the controversy regarding Job’s integrity.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>The Issue of Job’s Integrity</strong></p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 6.

<strong>How Can You Be ‘Perfect as Your Heavenly Father Is Perfect’?</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>“FAULTLESS,” “BLAMELESS” SERVANTS OF GOD</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Yes, the Bible speaks of Noah as being “faultless among his contemporaries” and of Job as being “blameless and upright.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971684/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Gen. 6:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971684/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Job 1:8</a>) The same Hebrew words translated “faultless” and “blameless” may also be rendered “perfect,” for anything without fault is “perfect.” Obviously this does not mean these persons were without sin, for they were all descended <span id="page566" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="566" data-before-text="566"></span>from the sinner Adam. So, in what sense were they “faultless” and “blameless”?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">They could be spoken of in this way because they measured up <em>fully</em> to what God required of them and God <em>did not require of them more than they could attain.</em> As <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971684/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Micah 6:6-8</a> shows, God does not make unreasonable demands upon his servants. “He has told you, O earthling man, what is good. And what is Jehovah asking back from you but to exercise justice and to love kindness and to be modest in walking with your God?”</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Yes, Jehovah mercifully and reasonably took into account the imperfection and disabilities of his earthly servants. A father would not expect of his young son what he would of a full-grown man, would he? Nor would a potter expect the same quality when molding a vase from ordinary clay as he would when forming one from special refined clay. Jehovah God, who is the Great Potter, takes into consideration the inherent weakness of his human servants. For, “as a father shows mercy to his sons, Jehovah has shown mercy to those fearing him. For he himself well knows the formation of us, remembering that we are dust.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971684/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 103:13, 14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971684/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Isa. 64:8</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">In his <em>Notes on the Gospels,</em> Albert Barnes, Bible scholar of the nineteenth century, makes somewhat similar observations about the “blamelessness” (or “perfection”) of such men. Of the word “perfect” he says: “Originally it is applied to a piece of mechanism, as a machine that is complete in its parts. Applied to men, it refers to completeness of parts, or <em>perfection,</em> where no part is defective or wanting. Thus, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971684/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Job (i. 1</a>.) is said to be perfect; that is, not holy as God, or <em>sinless</em>​—for fault is afterward found with him (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971684/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Job ix. 20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971684/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Job xlii. 6</a>); but his piety was <em>proportionate</em>​—had a completeness of parts—​was consistent and regular.

<strong>Championing Jehovah’s Godship in Spite of Babylonish Hostility</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Our view now shifts to the opening tableau of the book of Job where there is an unfolding of the majestic court scene in heaven. Angels are drawn up before the true God Jehovah. Strikingly the issue of Godship is dramatized by letting the one entitled “Satan” also be present. It is worthy of note that at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 1:6</a> and thereafter Jehovah’s great resister or adversary, also man’s greatest enemy, is identified as a personality and by title at that. The Hebrew verb <em>satán</em> means “to resist,” and is first used by Moses at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Numbers 22:22,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 32</a>.<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966643/2">c</a> But at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Job 1:6</a> the Hebrew uses the noun <em>satán</em> with the definite article <em>ha</em> affixed to it, thus reading <em>has-satan</em> or The Satan in English.<a id="footnotesource4" data-fnid="4" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966643/3">d</a> The definite article, therefore, particularizes Satan as a person and makes impossible the view held by many that Satan is abstract evil, resistance or opposition. In this manner Satan is established in the Bible as a definite <span id="page523" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="523" data-before-text="523"></span>personality, with the word “Satan” as one of the proper titles to be used in identifying him.—See also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Zechariah 3:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu"> 6.

Satan next charges that Job worships Jehovah for what he selfishly gets out of it, namely, wealth, and not because of his integrity of heart nor because of his love for God. “Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘Is it for nothing that Job has feared God? Have not you yourself put up a hedge about him and about his house and about everything that he has all around?<a id="footnotesource5" data-fnid="5" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966643/4">e</a> The work of his hands you have blessed, and his livestock itself has spread abroad in the earth.

The <em>arm</em> figures the ability to generate, develop or amass strength or power. For example, in man’s arm there resides the ability to generate great power, strength or force to hurl an object such as a ball. But it is the <em>hand</em> that pictures applied strength or power. It is the <em>hand</em> that applies the power generated by the <em>arm</em> to certain specific points. In pitching a ball it is the <em>hand</em> that determines how the strength produced by the arm will bring about the curve or path or spin of the ball. Jehovah’s <em>arm</em> of generated strength is described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Isaiah 51:9-11</a>, whereas his <em>hand</em> of arrangements of applied power is referred to at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:6</a>. Now as to Job, Satan proposes that Jehovah reapply his <em>hand</em> of power toward Job in the form of persecution.

Satan of the realm of the invisible next brings about tremendous adversities upon Job. Satan’s <em>hand</em> of applied power is now at work. For some time Satan had Babylonishly trained bands <span id="page524" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="524" data-before-text="524"></span>of agents on earth to become available for deeds of hostility. First, Job’s wealth begins to be slashed by Satan’s dupes, the Sabaean marauders, stealing Job’s large herd of cattle. Incidentally, the Sabaeans were apostate worshipers of heavenly bodies, the sun, moon and stars, deriving such from the Babylonians.<a id="footnotesource6" data-fnid="6" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966643/5">f</a> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Isa. 47:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 13</a>) Job himself was openly opposed to such worship of the sun and moon.

Note that Chaldeans, who were a Babylonish, religiously controlled people, were also agents used by Satan to make war upon Jehovah’s true witness Job. There being “three” bands is early evidence that Babylonish religionists were emphatically anti-Jehovah, three being a numerical symbol of emphasis.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Job 1:13-17</a>.</p>

One of these is by being trusting. As long ago written in that fine essay on love by the apostle Paul: “Love . . . believes all things.” That is, it believes all God says in his Word, though one may not be able fully to grasp all of it and at times it may sound impossible because at present men do not know all the facts and have no scientific explanation for certain things. Paul’s words, however, also state a basic principle, that by nature love is trusting; it is not unduly suspicious of others.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 7</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Since God is love, he is also trusting. Certainly he has trusted his angelic hosts through all the aeons of time since their creation. Likewise God trusted the first human pair, Adam and Eve. He could have looked into the future and seen what they would do, but he did not; he had neither the need nor the desire to do so. Rather, he showered his blessings upon them and gave them the opportunity to express appreciation or ingratitude.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 John 4:8</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">How true this also was of God’s dealings with the nation of Israel! How generous, how trusting he was! Time and again he forgave them and gave them another opportunity to prove themselves. In particular did God show loving trustfulness in the case of Job. God was not quick to believe the Devil’s slanderous charges; he did not attribute ulterior motives to Job’s serving him as did Satan. Lovingly God believed Job to be a keeper of integrity, and the Devil was unable to prove Job otherwise.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 1:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 2:10</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Second only to the example set by God himself is that given by his Son, Jesus Christ. He showed his love for his heavenly Father by wholly trusting him, even to the extent of being willing to die; trusting his Father to resurrect him. Jesus also showed a loving trust in his dealings with his fellowman. He did not suspiciously demand that those coming to him go to great lengths to prove their belief in him before he cured them. Nor did he eye all his twelve apostles with suspicion just because he knew that one of them was destined to betray him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 6:64;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 12:4-6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 17:12</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Love will likewise cause you to trust your heavenly Father, even as a child trusts its parent.

<strong>Why Do the Righteous Suffer?</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">At a meeting of the angelic sons of God in heaven Jehovah asked Satan: “Have you set your heart upon my servant Job, that there is no one like him in the earth, a man blameless and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad?” The fact that God called Job’s faithfulness to Satan’s attention indicates there was a contention as to whether human creatures would keep integrity to God. Satan’s reply proves that there was such an issue, for right away he makes excuses for Job’s faithfulness. He asserts that Job serves God because of the material blessings received and not because he loves him. He suggests: “‘For a change, <span id="page264" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="264" data-before-text="264"></span>thrust out your hand, please, and touch everything he has and see whether he will not curse you to your very face.’ Accordingly Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Look! Everything that he has is in your hand. Only against him himself do not thrust out your hand!’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 1:7-12</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Job maintained a righteous course despite everything the Devil could do; he proved that he served God because he loved him and wanted to be pleasing in his sight. Job believed in the integrity of his course, and so proclaimed to his accusers: “Until I expire I shall not take away my integrity from myself!”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Job 27:5</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Men of integrity have always been willing to suffer for what they believed in. Some have even sacrificed their lives because of love for a person or a country. The Bible records example after example of other persons that have had strong love for Almighty God. Above everything else, they wanted to live a righteous life in order to be an honor to God and thus prove the Devil’s claim that he could turn all human creatures away from God to be a lie. Although pursuing a course of righteousness has resulted in their suffering a great deal, they have maintained a proper attitude.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>PROPER ATTITUDE TOWARD SUFFERING</strong></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">It is true that in itself suffering does not bring happiness; but if one knows that a loved one is benefited or made happy, then he can rejoice even in the suffering. That is why the apostles, after receiving a flogging for preaching the good news of the Kingdom, “went their way from before the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy to be dishonored in behalf of his name.” They were obeying God’s command to preach and they knew that this was pleasing to him. Therefore they were happy, for, as the scripture says, “if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are happy.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Acts 5:40, 41;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 3:14</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">This helps one to appreciate what Jesus meant when he said in the sermon on the mount: “Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing against you for my sake. Rejoice and leap for joy, since your reward is great in the heavens.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 5:10-12</a>) When a Christian keeps integrity to God and suffers because of it he rejoices in the knowledge that he is proving the Devil a liar and is thus making Jehovah’s heart rejoice. Although the suffering does not make him happy, the fact that it contributes to the vindication of God’s name does. Then, too, one can rejoice because of the reward that is promised to the faithful.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Prov. 27:11</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Everyone today is bound to experience suffering because of living amid this wicked system of things and being subject to inherited imperfections due to sin. The righteous can also expect to suffer because of keeping integrity to God. But they can take heart and rejoice, for there is a new world of God’s making that is now so very close at hand. There suffering will be no more, for God promises that “he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be any more.” So never let present suffering embitter you. Look to the future. Yes, place your hope and confidence in God’s promised new world, where there will be no suffering.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Rev. 21:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 2 Pet. 3:13</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Endurance like Job’s in the Time of the End</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><span id="page594" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="594" data-before-text="594"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> But there is more to the matter than merely wanting it to be so. We have to endure; we have to suffer evil, and through it all exercise the patience of Jehovah’s prophets. Moreover, the evil that we suffer must not be for our own willful sins against Jehovah God. His prophets did not suffer all the things that they did suffer because they had done wrong and sinned against God. No; they suffered evil unjustly, and there is where the test of their endurance came in. They suffered because they had faith in God and worshiped him without letup and bore witness to him. Their sufferings did not therefore come upon them from God’s hand, but God let the sufferings come upon them unjustly, to test them and to see whether their suffering undeservedly would cause them to turn away from his worship and service, renouncing him to his face. Enduring to the end of the test of their faithfulness, they would vindicate Jehovah as God and universal Sovereign and he would reward them with a happy outcome, with great tenderness in affection and with compassion. He would thereby prove to all accusers that he was just in letting them suffer for such a purpose, and that he could raise up men out of sinful mankind who would keep their integrity toward him. James specifically names Job’s case as a striking example of how God deals. So as an encouragement to us to endure with a happy outcome, we do well to get acquainted with the book of Job.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>FORCING THE ISSUE OF ENDURANCE</strong></p><p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="qu"> 8. Where did Job live, and at what time was it that he was Jehovah’s witness without equal in the earth?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[62]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Job lived in the land of Uz, in what is now Arabia, and not too far from the Gulf of Aqaba. At that time God himself said concerning Job: “There is no one like him in the earth, a man of integrity and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 1:8</a>) This and other circumstances would locate Job in Uz about the time that his distant cousins, the twelve tribes of Israel, were in slavery down in the land of Egypt. By then Joseph, the son of Israel, had died after he had endured much unjust suffering, but had kept his blamelessness toward Jehovah God. Moses, a distant cousin of Job, had not yet risen up as Jehovah’s prophet to lead the twelve tribes of Israel out of Egyptian slavery. It was therefore fitting that Jehovah God should call attention to Job as his witness, who was then without equal in the earth. How did this occur?</p><p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="qu"> 9. What took place at the first meeting before Jehovah God to which Satan was ordered to come?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> God’s power pulls back the veil of invisibility and we look into the spirit world to see a meeting of angels assembling before the Most High God, to which meeting Jehovah God had ordered Satan to come. At the meeting what took place? Here is the account from the book of Job: “Now it came to be the day when the sons of The [true] God came in to take their station before Jehovah, and even Satan proceeded to come in right among them. Then Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Where do you come from?’ At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘From roving about in the earth and from walking about in it.’ And Jehovah went on to say to Satan: ‘Have you set your heart upon my servant Job, that there is no one like him in the earth, a man of integrity and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad?’ At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘Is it for nothing that Job has feared God? Have not you yourself put up a hedge about him and about his house and about everything that he has all around? The work of his hands you have blessed and his livestock itself has spread abroad in the earth. But, for a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch everything he has [and see] <span id="page595" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="595" data-before-text="595"></span>whether he will not curse you to your very face.’ Accordingly Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Look! everything that he has is in your hand. Only against him himself do not thrust out your hand!’ So Satan went out away from the person of Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 1:6-12</a>.</p><p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu">10. Of what was Job ignorant at the time, and why was no one better qualified than he to furnish the answer to the question raised?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[64]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Job did not know about this meeting in heaven and what the big question was that was put forward and what was to be done about getting the true answer to the question. Here was the thing that caused Job difficulty. He did not know the question that he was picked to prove, namely, that God can raise up the right kind of persons to be his witnesses in the earth, and that they will hold on to their integrity to him despite all the unjust suffering he may allow to test their unselfish worship of him. Job being then the unequaled witness of Jehovah on earth, no one should be better qualified to prove this point in favor of Jehovah than Job.</p><p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu">11. In what office toward God was Job acting in behalf of his family, and why?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Job was acting as priest of Jehovah God for his family. His wife was living and he had seven sons and three daughters. Besides that, he had seven thousand sheep and three thousand camels, making a total of ten thousand together, and also five hundred spans of oxen and five hundred she-asses, along with a very great body of servants. In spite of all these possessions, Job was not a materialistic man. He did not get so deeply buried in his material goods that he forgot about God, who was the real source of all his wealth. He did not try to increase his material wealth by going crooked and violating the laws of God and showing no fear of God. Job wanted his ten children to fear God and stay in God’s favor. So after his seven sons had spread banquets for their three sisters at their seven houses, Job would always act as an intercessor for them with Jehovah. “Job would send and sanctify them, and he got up early in the morning and offered up burnt sacrifices according to the number of all of them, for, said Job, ‘maybe my sons have sinned and have cursed God in their heart.’ That is the way Job would do always.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 1:1-5</a>) At that time Jehovah God had not yet set up his exclusive priesthood in the tribe of Levi, the tribe of Moses the prophet.</p><p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">12. In what way did Jehovah bless Job, and why in this way?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Quite properly Jehovah God blessed Job for his faithful worship as a witness of Jehovah, and quite properly at that time God blessed Job with material goods to be used in a right way. Job could be trusted with them. Long before this God had blessed Job’s granduncle Abraham in this manner, and also Abraham’s son Isaac and his grandson Jacob. So it was nothing new for God to increase the material possessions of his servant Job and to protect them against enemy attack. Certainly God did not bless his servants with material goods just to enrich the thievish enemy. For this reason God kept those goods out of the hands of selfish, greedy evildoers. Neither Job nor Abraham and Isaac and Jacob expected to go to heaven and be rewarded only up there after death. So God was in harmony with their earthly hopes in blessing them upon the earth. Who, then, had a right to object to Job’s having all this material wealth? No one.</p><p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu">13. What test had Job withstood thus far, and so what test did Satan propose, and why?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[67]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> However, Satan the Devil did not want God to have any pleasure out of Job. Hence he accused Job. Let it be noted that Satan did not, even as he could not, accuse Job of acting materialistically and misusing all the material goods with which Jehovah had blessed Job. No; up to that point Job had withstood the test of materialism. All <span id="page596" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="596" data-before-text="596"></span>that was left for Satan to do, then, was to accuse Job’s heart condition. He was at heart materialistic; he was serving Jehovah God only for the material good that he could get out of it, argued Satan the Devil. To show up Job’s heart condition and the weakness of his integrity Satan suggested that Jehovah take away all those material possessions. Of course, Jehovah would not do that himself; but, to permit the question to be answered, he would let Satan the Devil and his crowd on earth take away such material things. Satan had no confidence in Job. God did, and he was not unwilling to prove this.</p>

So, in what sense were they “faultless” and “blameless”?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">They could be spoken of in this way because they measured up <em>fully</em> to what God required of them and God <em>did not require of them more than they could attain.</em> As <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971684/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Micah 6:6-8</a> shows, God does not make unreasonable demands upon his servants. “He has told you, O earthling man, what is good.

Similarly, if he allowed his mind and heart to feed on wrong thoughts, this would lead to entertaining wrong desires and finally bring sin and death.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Jas. 1:14, 15</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Genesis 1:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/46/1" data-bid="47-2" class="b"> Matthew 4:4</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">That the creature’s individual will and choice, rather than physical and mental perfection, are the determining factors readily becomes evident. If we were to insist that a perfect man could not take a wrong course where a moral issue was involved, should we not also logically argue that an <em>imperfect</em> creature could not take a <em>right</em> course where such moral issue was involved? Yet some imperfect creatures <em>do</em> take a right course on moral issues involving obedience to God, even choosing to suffer persecution rather than change from such a course; while at the same time others deliberately engage in doing what they know is wrong. Thus not all wrong actions can be excused by human imperfection. The deciding factors are the individual’s will and choice. In the same way, it was not human perfection alone that would guarantee right action by the first man, but, rather, the exercise of his own free will and choice as motivated by love for his God and for what was right.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Prov. 4:23</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong><em>The first sinner and the king of Tyre</em></strong></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Human sin and imperfection were, of course, preceded by sin and imperfection in the spirit realm, as Jesus’ words at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">John 8:44</a> and the account in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">chapter 3 of Genesis</a> reveal. The dirge recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Ezekiel 28:12-19</a>, though directed to the human “king of Tyre,” evidently draws upon or parallels the course taken by the spirit son of God who first sinned. The pride of the “king of Tyre,” his making himself ‘a god,’ his being called a “cherub,” and the reference to “Eden, the garden of God,” certainly correspond to Biblical information concerning Satan the Devil, who became puffed up with pride, is linked to the serpent in Eden, and is called “the god of this system of things.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">1 Tim. 3:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/51/1" data-bid="52-2" class="b"> Gen. 3:1-5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/51/2" data-bid="52-3" class="b"> 14, 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/51/3" data-bid="52-4" class="b"> Rev. 12:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/51/4" data-bid="52-5" class="b"> 2 Cor. 4:4</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">The anonymous king of Tyre, residing in the city claiming to be “perfect in prettiness,” was himself “full of wisdom and perfect [Heb., <em>k<sup>e</sup>lilʹ</em>] in beauty,” and “faultless [Heb., <em>ta·mim</em>ʹ]” in his ways from his creation onward until unrighteousness was found in him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Ezek. 27:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/52/1" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> 28:12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/52/2" data-bid="53-3" class="b"> 15</a>) The first or direct application of the dirge in Ezekiel may be to the line of Tyrian rulers rather than to any one specific king. (Compare the prophecy directed against the anonymous “king of Babylon” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Isaiah 14:4-20</a>.) In that case, the reference may be to the early course of friendship and cooperation followed by the Tyrian rulership during the reigns of Kings David and Solomon, when Tyre even contributed toward the building of Jehovah’s temple on Mount Moriah. At first, therefore, there was no fault to be found in the official Tyrian attitude toward Jehovah’s people Israel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">1 Ki 5:1-18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/54/1" data-bid="55-2" class="b"> 9:10, 11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/54/2" data-bid="55-3" class="b"> 14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/54/3" data-bid="55-4" class="b"> 2 Chron. 2:3-16</a>) Later kings, however, departed from this “faultless” course and Tyre came in for condemnation by God’s prophets Joel and Amos, as well as Ezekiel.

Since all were descendants of the sinner Adam and hence sinners, it is clear that such men were “faultless” and “blameless” in the sense of measuring up fully to God’s requirements of them, requirements that took into account their imperfection and disability. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/58/0" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Micah 6:8</a>.) Even as a potter would not expect the same quality when molding a vase from common clay as he would when forming one from special refined clay, so Jehovah’s requirements take into consideration the weakness of imperfect humans. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Ps. 103:10-14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/59/1" data-bid="60-2" class="b"> Isa. 64:8</a>) Though committing errors and wrongs due to their fleshly imperfection, such faithful men nevertheless manifested “a complete [Heb., <em>sha·lemʹ</em>] heart” toward Jehovah.

Since God the Judge was pleased with their worship, no human or spirit creature could rightly find fault with their service to Him.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Luke 1:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/61/1" data-bid="62-2" class="b"> Hebrews 11:4-16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/61/2" data-bid="62-3" class="b"> Romans 14:4</a>; see JEHOVAH (Why he can consistently deal with imperfect humans).</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">The Christian Greek Scriptures recognize the inherent imperfection of mankind descended from Adam. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/62/0" data-bid="63-1" class="b">James 3:2</a> shows that one would be “a perfect man, able to bridle . . . his whole body,” if he could bridle his tongue and not stumble in word; but in this “we all stumble many times.” (Compare verse 8.) Nevertheless, certain relative perfections are set forth as attainable by sinful humans. Jesus told his followers: “You must accordingly be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/63/0" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Matt. 5:48</a>) Here his reference was to the matter of love and generosity. He showed that merely to “love those loving you” constituted an incomplete, defective love; hence his followers should perfect their love or bring it to full measure by loving their enemies also, thereby following God’s example. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Matt. 5:43-47</a>) Similarly, the young man who questioned Jesus on the way to gain everlasting life was shown that his worship, which already included obedience to the Law’s commandments, was still lacking in vital points. If he ‘wanted to be perfect’ he must bring his worship to full development (compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/65/0" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Luke 8:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/65/1" data-bid="66-2" class="b"> Isaiah 18:5</a>) by fulfilling these aspects.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/66/0" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Matt. 19:21</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/67/0" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Romans 12:2</a>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">The apostle John shows that God’s love is made perfect in Christians who remain in union with Him, observing the word of his Son and loving one another.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/69/0" data-bid="70-1" class="b">1 John 3:19-22</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/70/0" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/70/1" data-bid="71-2" class="b"> 10:19-22</a>.) The one in whom God’s love reaches full expression can approach his heavenly Father in confidence, not feeling condemned in his heart as if hypocritical or disapproved. He knows he is observing God’s commandments and doing what pleases his Father and is free in his expressions and petitions to Jehovah. He does not feel as if ‘on probation’ by God, under restriction as to what he is privileged to say or ask for. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/71/0" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Numbers 12:10-15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/71/1" data-bid="72-2" class="b"> Job 40:1-5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/71/2" data-bid="72-3" class="b"> Lamentations 3:40-44;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/71/3" data-bid="72-4" class="b"> 1 Peter 3:7</a>.) No morbid fear inhibits him; he does not come to the “day of judgment” as conscious of some ‘black mark’ against him or as desirous of ‘hiding’ certain things. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/72/0" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:27,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/72/1" data-bid="73-2" class="b"> 31</a>.) As a child does not fear to ask his loving parents for anything, so the Christian in whom love is fully developed is sure that “no matter what it is that we ask according to his will, he hears us. Further, if we know he hears us respecting whatever we are asking, we know we are to have the things asked since we have asked them of him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013360/73/0" data-bid="74-1" class="b">1 John 5:14, 15</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">Thus, this ‘perfect love’ does not cast out fear of every kind. It does not eliminate the reverential and filial fear of God, born of deep respect for his position, power and justice.

<strong>Satan</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The Bible, in lifting the veil to give a glimpse into heavenly affairs, reveals that Satan later as a rival god appeared before Jehovah in heaven, challenging Jehovah to His face, saying that he could turn God’s servant Job, and by implication any servant of God, away from Him. He charged God, in effect, with unrighteously giving Job everything, along with full protection, so that he, Satan, could not test Job and show what was really in his heart, which, Satan intimated, was bad. He implied that Job served God primarily for selfish considerations. Satan made this point of his argument clear when he said: “Skin in behalf of skin, and everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul. For a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch as far as his bone and his flesh and see whether he will not curse you to your very face.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Job 1:6-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 2:1-7</a>; see <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/1">SOVEREIGNTY</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In this special case, Jehovah allowed Satan to bring calamity upon Job by not interfering when Satan brought about a raid from Sabean marauders as well as destruction of flocks and shepherds by what Job’s messenger called “the very fire of God” from the heavens; whether this was lightning or other fire is not stated. Satan also brought a raid by three bands of Chaldeans, as well as a windstorm. These things caused the death of all of Job’s children and destroyed his property. Finally, Satan inflicted a loathsome disease upon Job himself.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 1:13-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 2:7, 8</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">These things reveal the might and power of the spirit creature Satan, as well as his vicious, murderous attitude.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">It is important to note, however, that Satan recognized his impotence in the face of God’s express command, for he did not challenge God’s power and authority when God restricted him from taking Job’s life.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 2:6</a>.</p>

By extension, Satan was asserting that no human would love and be loyal to God in the face of suffering. That challenge had global and enduring impact. The issues that Satan raised had to be settled. Thus, God gave Satan freedom to act against Job, and Satan brought those various forms of suffering on the man.</p>

Taking up the issue, Jehovah asked Satan: “Have you set your heart upon my servant Job, that there is no one like him in the earth, a man blameless and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994843/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Job 1:8</a>) Job met divine standards that took his imperfections into account.

In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971322/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Genesis chapter three</a> we find how this issue came up. It was the Devil, using an animal, who spoke to Eve. But notice what he spoke. It helps us to understand what the issue concerns​—what it is about. He said to Eve: “Is it really so that God said you must not eat from every tree of the garden?” Or, he said, in effect: ‘Do you mean to tell me that God has told you <em>that?</em> that he would do that to you? and keep something back from you?’ The Devil did not come out at first and say flatly that God was wrong, because he might have met stiff resistance. No, first, he put this selfish thought, this doubt, into Eve’s mind; then he went on to slander God by saying, ‘God knows that this is not right. He knows that if you eat from the forbidden tree you will get more knowledge.’​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971322/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Gen. 3:1-5</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">12.

What was the issue? Was it a challenge of God’s supremacy? We can say No to that, because if a person is supreme in power, who can challenge him on that point with any hope of success? Notice that, later, the Devil did not challenge the Almighty God’s restriction protecting Job’s life.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971322/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Job 2:6, 7</a>.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">13.

Sovereignty means the right to rule and to delegate authority in government. Did Satan challenge God’s sovereignty? Yes, but not the <em>fact</em>​—the existence—​of God’s sovereignty, because, again, if a person is supreme and almighty he can rule no matter what anyone says.

Well, then, what was it? It did have to do with God’s sovereignty. We can see from what the Devil said that it was the <em>deservedness, rightfulness</em> and <em>righteousness</em> of Jehovah’s sovereignty that was brought into question. God surely was sovereign, but was that sovereignty exercised in a way that was really for the benefit of his creatures? Or was he withholding something from them? When the Devil spoke to God about Job, he craftily put the argument the other way around and said: ‘Look at all Job has. Look at what you have given him. Of course he will serve you, because he gets everything from you.’ So, from another viewpoint, he repeated his challenge of the deservedness or rightfulness of God’s sovereignty.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971322/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Job 1:8-12</a>.</p>

<strong>Right Motive in Serving God</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Just as the psalmist long ago foretold, there are men on the earth today who desire to serve Jehovah whole-souled. David prophesied: “Your people will offer themselves willingly on the day of your military force.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964403/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 110:3</a>) They show a keen interest in learning and studying God’s Word. They are happy to talk about the Scriptures and are moved by a heartfelt desire to serve Jehovah. As a result they dedicate their lives to Jehovah and symbolize it by public baptism. This was the simple, early Christian form of becoming a disciple, and <span id="page336" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="336" data-before-text="336"></span>it is the same method that is practiced by Jehovah’s witnesses today. It is wonderful to see thousands taking this step each year. In fact, during 1963, 62,798 individuals worldwide were baptized in symbol of their dedication of their lives to Jehovah to share in the ministry. They are not serving for financial advantage anymore than the early apostles were. Nor are they deterred by the lack of interest shown by the people generally, but they serve for the joy of representing Jehovah and advancing Kingdom interests. They serve for love of God and love of neighbor. They recognize the truthfulness of Jesus’ words, “You cannot slave for God and for Riches,” and so they put the Kingdom interests and the ministry first in their lives.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964403/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 6:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964403/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 9:18</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 7. Why was Satan’s accusation false?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> From the time of Job it has been Satan’s contention that men serve God for selfish reasons: “Is it for nothing that Job has feared God? Have not you yourself put up a hedge about him and about his house and about everything that he has all around? The work of his hands you have blessed . . . But, for a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch everything he has and see whether he will not curse you to your very face.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964403/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 1:9-11</a>) But Job was not serving God for what he might receive in the way of material comforts or a prosperous way of life. Even when he lost all his possessions, including his sons and daughters, in a series of calamities, still Job said simply: “Jehovah himself has given, and Jehovah himself has taken away. Let the name of Jehovah continue to be blessed.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964403/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 1:21</a>) So Job did not serve Jehovah for material benefits, and neither do Jehovah’s people at this time. They feel as the apostle Paul did regarding his service to God, when he said: “We are not peddlers of the word of God as many men are, but as out of sincerity, yes, as sent from God, under God’s view, in company with Christ, we are speaking.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964403/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Cor. 2:17</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 8. How do Jehovah’s witnesses follow the example of Paul?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> It may be quite startling to many to realize that in the 22,761 congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses worldwide, neither the presiding minister nor his ministerial assistants are serving because they receive a salary or a parish home or retirement benefits or anything like that. Rather, they support themselves as the early Christians did and accept the ministry as a trust from God. In this they follow the example of the apostle Paul. To be no burden on the Christians he served, he worked at his trade as a tentmaker. Therefore he could state: “I have coveted no man’s silver or gold or apparel. You yourselves know that these hands have attended to the needs of me and of those with me.” Paul also emphasized the right motive for sharing in the ministry when he stated: “By thus laboring you must assist those who are weak, and must bear in mind the words of the Lord Jesus, when he himself said, ‘There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.’” So Paul was not in the ministry for some personal advantage, but, rather, for the joy that he gained in helping others and sharing the truth with them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964403/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 18:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964403/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 20:33-35</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>REWARDS AND TRIALS OF SERVICE</strong></p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 9.

This is not a selfish inducement to service, but, rather, an encouragement to faith and perseverance and an evidence of Jehovah’s love. The Scriptures tell how men of faith in ancient times had confidence in the promises Jehovah gave and were encouraged despite fierce <span id="page337" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="337" data-before-text="337"></span>opposition. Thus <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964403/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:6</a> states: “Moreover, without faith it is impossible to please him well, for he that approaches God must believe that he is and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.” We are told that Abraham looked forward to God’s kingdom arrangement, “awaiting the city having real foundations, the builder and creator of which city is God.” Of Moses it is stated: “He esteemed the reproach of the Christ as riches greater than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked intently toward the payment of the reward.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964403/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Heb. 11:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964403/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 26</a>.</p>

<strong>Show Love—Be Trusting</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Love will likewise cause you to trust your heavenly Father, even as a child trusts its parent. It will cause you to take him at his Word and to show this by your course of action. Then you too will put faith in his Word, the Bible, even though you may not fully understand everything you read and even though so-called science, on the basis of incomplete knowledge or <span id="page100" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="100" data-before-text="100"></span>wrong reasoning, may call it into question.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Deut. 7:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Mark 11:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> John 17:17</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">As for trusting your neighbor, why, even the “golden rule” indicates that you should trust him, for do you not want him to trust you? Yes, “just as you want men to do to you, do the same way to them.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 6:31</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In fact, to trust others shows not only love for them but also love for ourselves. How so? Because trusting is a form of generosity, and generosity makes for happiness. As Jesus said on one occasion, “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Especially do members of a family, such as husband and wife, need to show love by being trusting. Love takes faithfulness for granted and is not unduly jealous. It does not make mountains out of molehills. To be distrustful, to be unduly suspicious, is unloving, unkind; it discourages the other person and creates friction. All make slips from time to time, so be generous and give the other the benefit of the doubt, and extend mercy if the other actually is at fault.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Col. 3:12-14</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Remember, the course of being unduly suspicious is the course of Satan himself. He has staked everything on proving that man is not what he claims to be, that God’s servants serve him only for what they get out of it. He holds that no one can be trusted. Surely, he is not the one to imitate!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 1:9-11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Rev. 12:10</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">A notable example in history of one who did imitate Satan in these respects was none other than the American humorist Mark Twain, deceased now some fifty years. In a volume of his works, <em>Letters from the Earth,</em> recently published for the first time, he uses Satan to heap scorn, contempt and slander upon God and the human race. This volume also contains his estimate of the Bible: “It is full of interest. It has some noble poetry in it; and some clever fables; and some blood-drenched history; and some good morals; and a wealth of obscenity; and upwards of a thousand lies.” Unduly suspicious, he read into the Bible what is not there and failed to see in it what actually is.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">He reacted in the same suspicious way toward his fellowman: “Everyone is a moon and has a dark side which he never shows to anybody.” No wonder this great humorist lost his humor and complained, “Be good and you will be lonesome like me.” But not so. Jesus was good, if any man ever was, yet, far from his being lonesome, he could not get away from the crowds, and not just because of his miracles but also because of his words of life.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Mark 6:30-34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Luke 21:37, 38</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Not having any faith in God, Mark Twain let the death of two of his daughters and his wife make him even more bitter and so he “relieved his feelings with scathing articles on public affairs,” according to <em>The Encyclopedia Americana.</em> He had sown suspicion and reaped loneliness, even as Jesus said: “Practice giving, and people will give to you,” and that in like measure.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Luke 6:38;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Gal. 6:7</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">However, the fact that love is trusting does not mean that you should be gullible, naive. Not at all, for God’s Word also says: “Anyone inexperienced puts faith in every word, but the shrewd one considers his steps.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Prov. 14:15</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Then how can you strike a balance between trust and caution?

<strong>Endurance like Job’s in the Time of the End</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> God’s power pulls back the veil of invisibility and we look into the spirit world to see a meeting of angels assembling before the Most High God, to which meeting Jehovah God had ordered Satan to come. At the meeting what took place? Here is the account from the book of Job: “Now it came to be the day when the sons of The [true] God came in to take their station before Jehovah, and even Satan proceeded to come in right among them. Then Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Where do you come from?’ At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘From roving about in the earth and from walking about in it.’ And Jehovah went on to say to Satan: ‘Have you set your heart upon my servant Job, that there is no one like him in the earth, a man of integrity and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad?’ At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘Is it for nothing that Job has feared God? Have not you yourself put up a hedge about him and about his house and about everything that he has all around? The work of his hands you have blessed and his livestock itself has spread abroad in the earth. But, for a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch everything he has [and see] <span id="page595" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="595" data-before-text="595"></span>whether he will not curse you to your very face.’ Accordingly Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Look! everything that he has is in your hand. Only against him himself do not thrust out your hand!’ So Satan went out away from the person of Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 1:6-12</a>.</p><p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu">10.

Here was the thing that caused Job difficulty. He did not know the question that he was picked to prove, namely, that God can raise up the right kind of persons to be his witnesses in the earth, and that they will hold on to their integrity to him despite all the unjust suffering he may allow to test their unselfish worship of him. Job being then the unequaled witness of Jehovah on earth, no one should be better qualified to prove this point in favor of Jehovah than Job.</p><p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu">11. In what office toward God was Job acting in behalf of his family, and why?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Job was acting as priest of Jehovah God for his family. His wife was living and he had seven sons and three daughters. Besides that, he had seven thousand sheep and three thousand camels, making a total of ten thousand together, and also five hundred spans of oxen and five hundred she-asses, along with a very great body of servants. In spite of all these possessions, Job was not a materialistic man. He did not get so deeply buried in his material goods that he forgot about God, who was the real source of all his wealth. He did not try to increase his material wealth by going crooked and violating the laws of God and showing no fear of God. Job wanted his ten children to fear God and stay in God’s favor. So after his seven sons had spread banquets for their three sisters at their seven houses, Job would always act as an intercessor for them with Jehovah. “Job would send and sanctify them, and he got up early in the morning and offered up burnt sacrifices according to the number of all of them, for, said Job, ‘maybe my sons have sinned and have cursed God in their heart.’ That is the way Job would do always.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 1:1-5</a>) At that time Jehovah God had not yet set up his exclusive priesthood in the tribe of Levi, the tribe of Moses the prophet.</p><p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">12. In what way did Jehovah bless Job, and why in this way?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Quite properly Jehovah God blessed Job for his faithful worship as a witness of Jehovah, and quite properly at that time God blessed Job with material goods to be used in a right way. Job could be trusted with them. Long before this God had blessed Job’s granduncle Abraham in this manner, and also Abraham’s son Isaac and his grandson Jacob. So it was nothing new for God to increase the material possessions of his servant Job and to protect them against enemy attack. Certainly God did not bless his servants with material goods just to enrich the thievish enemy. For this reason God kept those goods out of the hands of selfish, greedy evildoers. Neither Job nor Abraham and Isaac and Jacob expected to go to heaven and be rewarded only up there after death. So God was in harmony with their earthly hopes in blessing them upon the earth. Who, then, had a right to object to Job’s having all this material wealth? No one.</p><p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu">13. What test had Job withstood thus far, and so what test did Satan propose, and why?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[67]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> However, Satan the Devil did not want God to have any pleasure out of Job. Hence he accused Job. Let it be noted that Satan did not, even as he could not, accuse Job of acting materialistically and misusing all the material goods with which Jehovah had blessed Job. No; up to that point Job had withstood the test of materialism. All <span id="page596" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="596" data-before-text="596"></span>that was left for Satan to do, then, was to accuse Job’s heart condition. He was at heart materialistic; he was serving Jehovah God only for the material good that he could get out of it, argued Satan the Devil. To show up Job’s heart condition and the weakness of his integrity Satan suggested that Jehovah take away all those material possessions. Of course, Jehovah would not do that himself; but, to permit the question to be answered, he would let Satan the Devil and his crowd on earth take away such material things. Satan had no confidence in Job. God did, and he was not unwilling to prove this.</p>

<strong>Why Does God Allow His Servants to Be Persecuted?</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Scriptural record of a conversation about faithful Job sheds much light on the matter. We read: “Jehovah went on to say to Satan: ‘Have you set your heart upon my servant Job, that there is no one like him in the earth, a man blameless and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad?’ At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘Is it for nothing that Job has feared God? Have not you yourself put up a hedge about him and about his house and about everything that he has all around? The work of his hands you have blessed, and his livestock itself has spread abroad in the earth. But, for a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch everything he has and see whether he will not curse you to your very face.’”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101977650/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 1:8-11</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Here Satan claimed that Job was serving the Most High only for selfish reasons. It was the adversary’s contention that, once the material benefits were removed, Job would prove unfaithful. This really is Satan’s claim regarding all of Jehovah’s loyal servants. That claim also constituted a reproach on God’s holy name. How so? It made it appear that Jehovah’s rulership is of such inferior quality that no one would submit to it if there were no selfish benefits to be gained.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Therefore, as in the case of Job, Jehovah God has not shielded his servants from persecution. This has enabled them to prove their unselfish love for him and their earnest desire to have the good name of their heavenly Father cleared of all reproach. In fact, they have counted it a privilege to suffer for righteousness’ sake and thus to contribute to the vindication of God’s holy name and toward proving Satan’s contention to be a lie.</p>

The truthfulness of God was challenged, and this called into question the rightfulness and righteousness of his rulership. It was suggested that man would be better off making his own decisions as to what is good and what is bad, setting his own standards, acting as his own ruler. The rebellion of Satan and the failure of the first human pair to prove loyal to God raised the question as to what others of God’s intelligent creatures would do. Would anyone remain loyal to God? Later, <span id="page17" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>in the days of the man Job, Satan charged that those who served God did so only because of selfish considerations, not out of love. “Is it for nothing that Job has feared God?” Satan argued. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101975001/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Job 1:9</a>) He implied that no one would maintain integrity to Jehovah’s rulership if he, God’s adversary, were allowed to put him to the test. Not until these issues were settled would mankind ever again enjoy complete security. However, Jehovah knew that those issues could be settled to the full satisfaction of all lovers of righteousness, and he made provisions with that in view.</p>

Although a narrow band of spectral wave lengths forms the foundation, the available variations and combinations of colour to delight the eye of the observer are virtually without limit. Similarly, all of the artistry of music comes to the ear through another small group of frequencies.” (<em>The Encyclopædia Britannica,</em> 1959 ed., Vol. 21, p. 307) Likewise, God’s requirements for the human pair allowed them all the freedom that a righteous heart could desire. There was no need to hem them in with a multitude of laws and regulations. The loving example set for them by their Creator and their respect and love for him would protect them from exceeding the proper bounds of their freedom.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/124/0" data-bid="125-1" class="b">1 Timothy 1:9, 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/124/1" data-bid="125-2" class="b"> Rom. 6:15-18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/124/2" data-bid="125-3" class="b"> 13:8-10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/124/3" data-bid="125-4" class="b"> 2 Cor. 3:17</a>.</p><p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="sb">Jehovah God, therefore, by his very Person, his ways and words, was and is the Supreme Standard for all the universe, the definition and the sum of all goodness.

Satan’s rebellion brought God’s name and reputation into question. To Eve, he claimed to speak for God in telling her what “God knows,” while at the same time casting doubt on God’s command, expressed to Adam, concerning the tree of the knowledge of good and bad.

Had he known Jehovah as a God given to uncontrolled, violent outbursts, he could only have expected immediate, on-the-spot extermination for the course he took. The issue Satan raised in Eden, therefore was not simply a test of Jehovah’s mightiness or power to destroy. Rather, it was a moral issue: that of God’s moral right to exercise universal sovereignty and require implicit obedience and devotion of all his creatures in all places. Satan’s approach to Eve, already considered, reveals this. So does the book of Job. Therein is related Jehovah’s bringing out into the open before all his assembled angelic sons the extent of the position taken by his adversary. Satan made the claim that the loyalty of Job (and, by implication, of any of God’s intelligent creatures) toward Jehovah was not wholehearted, not based on true devotion and genuine love.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/136/0" data-bid="137-1" class="b">Job 1:6-22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/136/1" data-bid="137-2" class="b"> 2:1-8</a>.</p><p id="p95" data-pid="95" class="sb">Thus, the question of integrity on the part of God’s intelligent creatures was a secondary or subsidiary issue arising out of the primary issue of God’s right to universal sovereignty. These questions would require time in order for the veracity or falsity of the charges to be demonstrated, for the heart attitude of God’s creatures to be proved, and thus for the issue to be settled beyond any doubt. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/137/0" data-bid="138-1" class="b">Job 23:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/137/1" data-bid="138-2" class="b"> 31:5, 6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/137/2" data-bid="138-3" class="b"> Ecclesiastes 8:11-13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/137/3" data-bid="138-4" class="b"> Hebrews 5:7-9</a>; see INTEGRITY; WICKEDNESS.) Jehovah thus did not execute judgment immediately upon the rebellious human pair nor upon the spirit son who raised the issue, and so the two foretold ‘seeds,’ representing opposite sides of the issue, would come into existence.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/138/0" data-bid="139-1" class="b">Gen. 3:15</a>.</p><p id="p96" data-pid="96" class="sb">That this issue still remained alive when Jesus Christ was on earth is seen from his confrontation with Satan in the wilderness after Jesus’ forty-day fast. The serpentlike tactics employed by Jehovah’s adversary in his temptation efforts toward God’s Son followed the pattern seen in Eden some four thousand years earlier, and Satan’s offer of rulership over earthly kingdoms made clear that the issue of universal sovereignty had not changed.

Such sanctification would require a cleansing of the Name of all reproach and false charges, that is, a vindicating of it. But, much more than that, it would require the honoring of that name as sacred by all intelligent creatures in heaven and earth. This, in turn, would mean their recognizing and respecting Jehovah’s sovereign position, doing so willingly, wanting to serve him, delighting to do his divine will, because of love for him. David’s prayer to Jehovah at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/142/0" data-bid="143-1" class="b">Psalm 40:5-10</a> well expresses such attitude and true sanctification of Jehovah’s name. (Note the apostle’s application of portions of this psalm to Christ Jesus at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/143/0" data-bid="144-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:5-10</a>.)</p><p id="p99" data-pid="99" class="sb">Upon the sanctification of Jehovah’s name, therefore, depend the good order, peace and well-being of all the universe and its inhabitants. God’s Son showed this, at the same time pointing out Jehovah’s means for accomplishing his purpose, when he taught his disciples to pray to God: “Let your name be sanctified. Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/144/0" data-bid="145-1" class="b">Matt. 6:9, 10</a>) This primary purpose of Jehovah provides the key for understanding the reason behind God’s actions and his dealings with his creatures as set forth in the entire Bible.</p><p id="p100" data-pid="100" class="sb">Thus, we find that the nation of Israel, whose history forms a large part of the Bible record, was selected to be a ‘name people’ for Jehovah.

<strong>Hedge</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Orchards and vineyards were commonly surrounded by hedges, thick rows of thorny plants, to safeguard the area from thieves and the depredations of animals. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001958/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa 5:5</a>) The Scriptures employ the expression “put up a hedge” in a figurative sense to denote the giving of protection.

<strong>Satan</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The Bible, in lifting the veil to give a glimpse into heavenly affairs, reveals that Satan later as a rival god appeared before Jehovah in heaven, challenging Jehovah to His face, saying that he could turn God’s servant Job, and by implication any servant of God, away from Him. He charged God, in effect, with unrighteously giving Job everything, along with full protection, so that he, Satan, could not test Job and show what was really in his heart, which, Satan intimated, was bad. He implied that Job served God primarily for selfish considerations. Satan made this point of his argument clear when he said: “Skin in behalf of skin, and everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul. For a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch as far as his bone and his flesh and see whether he will not curse you to your very face.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Job 1:6-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 2:1-7</a>; see <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/1">SOVEREIGNTY</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In this special case, Jehovah allowed Satan to bring calamity upon Job by not interfering when Satan brought about a raid from Sabean marauders as well as destruction of flocks and shepherds by what Job’s messenger called “the very fire of God” from the heavens; whether this was lightning or other fire is not stated. Satan also brought a raid by three bands of Chaldeans, as well as a windstorm. These things caused the death of all of Job’s children and destroyed his property. Finally, Satan inflicted a loathsome disease upon Job himself.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 1:13-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 2:7, 8</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">These things reveal the might and power of the spirit creature Satan, as well as his vicious, murderous attitude.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">It is important to note, however, that Satan recognized his impotence in the face of God’s express command, for he did not challenge God’s power and authority when God restricted him from taking Job’s life.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 2:6</a>.</p>

Satan replied: “From roving about in the earth and from walking about in it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994843/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 1:7</a>) He had been seeking someone to devour.

Taking up the issue, Jehovah asked Satan: “Have you set your heart upon my servant Job, that there is no one like him in the earth, a man blameless and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994843/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Job 1:8</a>) Job met divine standards that took his imperfections into account.

Have not you yourself put up a hedge about him and about his house and about everything that he has all around? The work of his hands you have blessed, and his livestock itself has spread abroad in the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994843/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Job 1:9, 10</a>) The Devil thus slandered Jehovah by implying that nobody loves and worships Him for what He is but that He bribes creatures to serve Him. Satan alleged that Job served God for selfish advantage, not out of love.</p>

<strong>Breathing This World’s “Air” Is Death-Dealing!</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Regarding his disciples, Jesus prayed: “They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world. I request you, not to take them out of the world, but to watch over them because of the wicked one.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1987683/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">John 17:14, 15</a>) Jehovah will safeguard us, but he does not place “a hedge” around us, nor does he miraculously shield us from this world’s “air.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1987683/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Job 1:9, 10</a>) So our challenge is to be in Satan’s world, yet being no part of it, to be surrounded by its contaminated “air,” yet not breathing it in. When we read secular publications, watch television, or go to places of entertainment, we are likely to be exposed to the world’s “air.” While some contact with worldly people is unavoidable​—at work, at school, and otherwise—​we must be vigilant so as to keep from being sucked back into the death-dealing atmosphere of this world.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1987683/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:33, 34</a>.</p>

<strong>Appreciating Jehovah God and Jesus Christ and What They Have Done for Us</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>THE ISSUE</strong></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">11. How did Satan raise an issue or controversy with God?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> The need for the ransom arose in connection with the issue that came about between God and Satan. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971322/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Genesis chapter three</a> we find how this issue came up. It was the Devil, using an animal, who spoke to Eve. But notice what he spoke. It helps us to understand what the issue concerns​—what it is about. He said to Eve: “Is it really so that God said you must not eat from every tree of the garden?” Or, he said, in effect: ‘Do you mean to tell me that God has told you <em>that?</em> that he would do that to you? and keep something back from you?’ The Devil did not come out at first and say flatly that God was wrong, because he might have met stiff resistance. No, first, he put this selfish thought, this doubt, into Eve’s mind; then he went on to slander God by saying, ‘God knows that this is not right. He knows that if you eat from the forbidden tree you will get more knowledge.’​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971322/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Gen. 3:1-5</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">12. Was the issue over God’s supremacy? Explain.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Thus Satan brought up the issue. What was the issue? Was it a challenge of God’s supremacy? We can say No to that, because if a person is supreme in power, who can challenge him on that point with any hope of success? Notice that, later, the Devil did not challenge the Almighty God’s restriction protecting Job’s life.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971322/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Job 2:6, 7</a>.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">13.

Sovereignty means the right to rule and to delegate authority in government. Did Satan challenge God’s sovereignty? Yes, but not the <em>fact</em>​—the existence—​of God’s sovereignty, because, again, if a person is supreme and almighty he can rule no matter what anyone says. God’s sovereignty was therefore never in danger.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">14.

Well, then, what was it? It did have to do with God’s sovereignty. We can see from what the Devil said that it was the <em>deservedness, rightfulness</em> and <em>righteousness</em> of Jehovah’s sovereignty that was brought into question. God surely was sovereign, but was that sovereignty exercised in a way that was really for the benefit of his creatures? Or was he withholding something from them? When the Devil spoke to God about Job, he craftily put the argument the other way around and said: ‘Look at all Job has. Look at what you have given him. Of course he will serve you, because he gets everything from you.’ So, from another viewpoint, he repeated his challenge of the deservedness or rightfulness of God’s sovereignty.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971322/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Job 1:8-12</a>.</p>

He assumes certain ideas to suit his desires, then arms himself with an attitude or spirit of resistance to other viewpoints. From there he sallies forth in a presumptuous course that leads into injudicious action and eventually to shame. And there is little that can be done to help him, once he begins, because his presumptuousness makes him arrogant, insolent and unreasonable.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">For example, there are those who say there is no God. They would not think of saying that a house has no builder. But when you call to their attention the much more intricate and complicated “nature,” their practical reasoning ends and they assert that there is no Creator, that even the whole structure of natural things, including themselves as intelligent individuals living in it, sprang by the operation of blind forces from unintelligent, inanimate matter.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Yet more presumptuous are clergymen who assume high-sounding titles, even requiring reverence from others, who claim to be religious guides and authorities over their denominational flocks, and at the same time presume to put their words and traditions above the Word of God, the Bible.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965365/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Thess. 2:3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">These persons would be horrified if told that they are in slavery, slavery to a god, and a false god at that, but they are, for the Bible rule is that one is the servant of whomever he serves.

He haughtily charged that no one served Jehovah wholeheartedly, not even the deeply religious man Job. When Jehovah forced the issue toward settlement, the Devil could not present any concrete evidence against Job but, to support his arrogant claim, invented the slander that Job’s right course of action was based on a form of bribery by God and that Job’s heart was just not right. To uphold this presumptuous defamation he took a murderous course and in the end failed utterly and was himself disgraced as a malicious liar.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965365/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 1:8-22</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>BABYLON PRESUMPTUOUS AGAINST GOD</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">However, one of the most impressive examples of the danger of a presumptuous course is that of the ancient city of Babylon, the seat of Satanic false religion after the flood of Noah’s day.

As Jesus said on one occasion, “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Especially do members of a family, such as husband and wife, need to show love by being trusting. Love takes faithfulness for granted and is not unduly jealous. It does not make mountains out of molehills. To be distrustful, to be unduly suspicious, is unloving, unkind; it discourages the other person and creates friction. All make slips from time to time, so be generous and give the other the benefit of the doubt, and extend mercy if the other actually is at fault.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Col. 3:12-14</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Remember, the course of being unduly suspicious is the course of Satan himself. He has staked everything on proving that man is not what he claims to be, that God’s servants serve him only for what they get out of it. He holds that no one can be trusted. Surely, he is not the one to imitate!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 1:9-11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Rev. 12:10</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">A notable example in history of one who did imitate Satan in these respects was none other than the American humorist Mark Twain, deceased now some fifty years. In a volume of his works, <em>Letters from the Earth,</em> recently published for the first time, he uses Satan to heap scorn, contempt and slander upon God and the human race. This volume also contains his estimate of the Bible: “It is full of interest. It has some noble poetry in it; and some clever fables; and some blood-drenched history; and some good morals; and a wealth of obscenity; and upwards of a thousand lies.” Unduly suspicious, he read into the Bible what is not there and failed to see in it what actually is.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">He reacted in the same suspicious way toward his fellowman: “Everyone is a moon and has a dark side which he never shows to anybody.” No wonder this great humorist lost his humor and complained, “Be good and you will be lonesome like me.” But not so. Jesus was good, if any man ever was, yet, far from his being lonesome, he could not get away from the crowds, and not just because of his miracles but also because of his words of life.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Mark 6:30-34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Luke 21:37, 38</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Not having any faith in God, Mark Twain let the death of two of his daughters and his wife make him even more bitter and so he “relieved his feelings with scathing articles on public affairs,” according to <em>The Encyclopedia Americana.</em> He had sown suspicion and reaped loneliness, even as Jesus said: “Practice giving, and people will give to you,” and that in like measure.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Luke 6:38;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Gal. 6:7</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">However, the fact that love is trusting does not mean that you should be gullible, naive. Not at all, for God’s Word also says: “Anyone inexperienced puts faith in every word, but the shrewd one considers his steps.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Prov. 14:15</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Then how can you strike a balance between trust and caution? By loving your neighbor <em>as</em> yourself; not more, by being naïve and simple; and not less, by being unduly suspicious.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963120/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Mark 12:31</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Endurance like Job’s in the Time of the End</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> God’s power pulls back the veil of invisibility and we look into the spirit world to see a meeting of angels assembling before the Most High God, to which meeting Jehovah God had ordered Satan to come. At the meeting what took place? Here is the account from the book of Job: “Now it came to be the day when the sons of The [true] God came in to take their station before Jehovah, and even Satan proceeded to come in right among them. Then Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Where do you come from?’ At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘From roving about in the earth and from walking about in it.’ And Jehovah went on to say to Satan: ‘Have you set your heart upon my servant Job, that there is no one like him in the earth, a man of integrity and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad?’ At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘Is it for nothing that Job has feared God? Have not you yourself put up a hedge about him and about his house and about everything that he has all around? The work of his hands you have blessed and his livestock itself has spread abroad in the earth. But, for a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch everything he has [and see] <span id="page595" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="595" data-before-text="595"></span>whether he will not curse you to your very face.’ Accordingly Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Look! everything that he has is in your hand. Only against him himself do not thrust out your hand!’ So Satan went out away from the person of Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 1:6-12</a>.</p><p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu">10. Of what was Job ignorant at the time, and why was no one better qualified than he to furnish the answer to the question raised?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[64]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Job did not know about this meeting in heaven and what the big question was that was put forward and what was to be done about getting the true answer to the question. Here was the thing that caused Job difficulty. He did not know the question that he was picked to prove, namely, that God can raise up the right kind of persons to be his witnesses in the earth, and that they will hold on to their integrity to him despite all the unjust suffering he may allow to test their unselfish worship of him. Job being then the unequaled witness of Jehovah on earth, no one should be better qualified to prove this point in favor of Jehovah than Job.</p><p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu">11. In what office toward God was Job acting in behalf of his family, and why?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Job was acting as priest of Jehovah God for his family. His wife was living and he had seven sons and three daughters. Besides that, he had seven thousand sheep and three thousand camels, making a total of ten thousand together, and also five hundred spans of oxen and five hundred she-asses, along with a very great body of servants. In spite of all these possessions, Job was not a materialistic man. He did not get so deeply buried in his material goods that he forgot about God, who was the real source of all his wealth. He did not try to increase his material wealth by going crooked and violating the laws of God and showing no fear of God. Job wanted his ten children to fear God and stay in God’s favor. So after his seven sons had spread banquets for their three sisters at their seven houses, Job would always act as an intercessor for them with Jehovah. “Job would send and sanctify them, and he got up early in the morning and offered up burnt sacrifices according to the number of all of them, for, said Job, ‘maybe my sons have sinned and have cursed God in their heart.’ That is the way Job would do always.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 1:1-5</a>) At that time Jehovah God had not yet set up his exclusive priesthood in the tribe of Levi, the tribe of Moses the prophet.</p><p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">12. In what way did Jehovah bless Job, and why in this way?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Quite properly Jehovah God blessed Job for his faithful worship as a witness of Jehovah, and quite properly at that time God blessed Job with material goods to be used in a right way. Job could be trusted with them. Long before this God had blessed Job’s granduncle Abraham in this manner, and also Abraham’s son Isaac and his grandson Jacob. So it was nothing new for God to increase the material possessions of his servant Job and to protect them against enemy attack. Certainly God did not bless his servants with material goods just to enrich the thievish enemy. For this reason God kept those goods out of the hands of selfish, greedy evildoers. Neither Job nor Abraham and Isaac and Jacob expected to go to heaven and be rewarded only up there after death. So God was in harmony with their earthly hopes in blessing them upon the earth. Who, then, had a right to object to Job’s having all this material wealth? No one.</p><p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu">13. What test had Job withstood thus far, and so what test did Satan propose, and why?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[67]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> However, Satan the Devil did not want God to have any pleasure out of Job. Hence he accused Job. Let it be noted that Satan did not, even as he could not, accuse Job of acting materialistically and misusing all the material goods with which Jehovah had blessed Job. No; up to that point Job had withstood the test of materialism. All <span id="page596" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="596" data-before-text="596"></span>that was left for Satan to do, then, was to accuse Job’s heart condition. He was at heart materialistic; he was serving Jehovah God only for the material good that he could get out of it, argued Satan the Devil. To show up Job’s heart condition and the weakness of his integrity Satan suggested that Jehovah take away all those material possessions. Of course, Jehovah would not do that himself; but, to permit the question to be answered, he would let Satan the Devil and his crowd on earth take away such material things. Satan had no confidence in Job. God did, and he was not unwilling to prove this.</p>

It is gleaned from Satan’s complaint, “Have you not hedged him safely in?” This seems to indicate that right from the rebellion Jehovah took independent action as to any interests he had in the earth regardless of Satan, and that he exercised overriding superior authority whenever it pleased him. The facts recorded in the Scriptures support this conclusion. Jehovah took immediate control of the garden of Eden and placed its care in the hands of other mighty cherubs who were loyal to him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952321/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Gen. 3:24</a>) To any of mankind who rendered true worship to him God now arranged to give them special guardianship, not through a theocratic government as he originally had purposed for Adam’s offspring, but by direct angelic protection.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> We know that Jehovah dealt directly with Abel, Enoch and Noah, giving them revelations of his will.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952321/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ex. 14:19</a>) After the days of Israel’s typical theocracy when God’s people were captive in Babylon, Michael, the guardian angel prince of Israel, was on the job safeguarding Jehovah’s interests in the earth.

Referring to Satan, Jesus said, “He has no hold on me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952321/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Col. 1:13 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952321/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> John 14:30</a>, <em>NW</em>) Then there is Peter’s case when he was delivered out of Herod’s murderous hands by Jehovah’s angel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952321/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Acts 12:6-11</a>, <em>NW</em>) Paul says with respect to protecting angels: “Are they not all spirits [angels] for public service, sent forth to minister for those who are going to inherit salvation?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952321/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Heb. 1:14</a>, <em>NW</em>) Thus in spite of Satan’s ironlike governments and their strong powers of persecution Jehovah’s people in all ages have stood apart and survived. It is only those who have shown a lack of faith and who compromised that would take themselves out from under God’s special care. Even today all those who form the nucleus of the new world society, both the anointed remnant and those of the “other sheep”, have in fact come out from Babylonish bondage and have escaped the clutches of Satan. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952321/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Rev. 18:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952321/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 6:15</a>) While Satan has all along sought to make good his side of the issue on sovereignty by forcing all men under his false sovereign control, the following scripture has proved to be true: “The angel of Jehovah encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952321/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ps. 34:7</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">18.

Satan was not the all-powerful sovereign that he originally thought he was going to be. The fact that <span id="page265" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="265" data-before-text="265"></span>God calls him to question by saying, “Where have you been?” indicates that Jehovah had the upper hand. Satan in fear was being put on the spot, so to speak. The further fact that Satan complains of the “hedge” put around Job indicates that he was nettled at Jehovah’s displays of superior power not only in defense of his true worshipers on earth, but also on special occasions, such as, for example, at the Flood, where with no difficulty God washed away Satan’s angelized earthly civilization; at Babel, where God confused the speech of Satan’s first earthly kingdom; and in Egypt, where Jehovah brought the first world power to its knees to deliver the Israelites with a high hand. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952321/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Gen. 7:21-24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952321/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 11:7-9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952321/30/2" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> Ex. 14:8</a>) Finally Jehovah placed a limitation as to how far Satan could go in his testing of Job’s integrity. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952321/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Job 1:12</a>) Notice, too, that Satan displayed due respect for Jehovah’s power by complying with that order. He was taking no chances in needlessly arousing Jehovah’s far superior forces. All this was reducing the sham sovereign to a helpless inferior and demonstrated that his control on earth was not all-embracing. In fact, he merely controlled those parts where he had blinded the inhabitants with his false religions and had kept them in line by means of his various makeshift governments. Never has he enjoyed undisputed control and power over all mankind, because at all times there have been those who have clung to the true worship of Jehovah God and who have looked forward to a restoration of a divine, sovereign-empowered government over all the earth.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952321/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Heb. 11:10</a>.</p>

<strong>Why Does God Allow His Servants to Be Persecuted?</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Scriptural record of a conversation about faithful Job sheds much light on the matter. We read: “Jehovah went on to say to Satan: ‘Have you set your heart upon my servant Job, that there is no one like him in the earth, a man blameless and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad?’ At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘Is it for nothing that Job has feared God? Have not you yourself put up a hedge about him and about his house and about everything that he has all around? The work of his hands you have blessed, and his livestock itself has spread abroad in the earth. But, for a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch everything he has and see whether he will not curse you to your very face.’”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101977650/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 1:8-11</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Here Satan claimed that Job was serving the Most High only for selfish reasons. It was the adversary’s contention that, once the material benefits were removed, Job would prove unfaithful. This really is Satan’s claim regarding all of Jehovah’s loyal servants. That claim also constituted a reproach on God’s holy name. How so? It made it appear that Jehovah’s rulership is of such inferior quality that no one would submit to it if there were no selfish benefits to be gained.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Therefore, as in the case of Job, Jehovah God has not shielded his servants from persecution. This has enabled them to prove their unselfish love for him and their earnest desire to have the good name of their heavenly Father cleared of all reproach. In fact, they have counted it a privilege to suffer for righteousness’ sake and thus to contribute to the vindication of God’s holy name and toward proving Satan’s contention to be a lie.</p>

<strong>Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p76" data-pid="76"><strong><em>Profanation of the name.</em></strong> The evidence is that the divine name was so regarded until events in the garden of Eden brought about its profanation. Satan’s rebellion brought God’s reputation into question. To Eve, he claimed to speak for God in telling her what “God knows,” while at the same time he cast doubt on God’s command, expressed to Adam, concerning the tree of the knowledge of good and bad.

<strong>Satan</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The Bible, in lifting the veil to give a glimpse into heavenly affairs, reveals that Satan later as a rival god appeared before Jehovah in heaven, challenging Jehovah to His face, saying that he could turn God’s servant Job, and by implication any servant of God, away from Him. He charged God, in effect, with unrighteously giving Job everything, along with full protection, so that he, Satan, could not test Job and show what was really in his heart, which, Satan intimated, was bad. He implied that Job served God primarily for selfish considerations. Satan made this point of his argument clear when he said: “Skin in behalf of skin, and everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul. For a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch as far as his bone and his flesh and see whether he will not curse you to your very face.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Job 1:6-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 2:1-7</a>; see <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/1">SOVEREIGNTY</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In this special case, Jehovah allowed Satan to bring calamity upon Job by not interfering when Satan brought about a raid from Sabean marauders as well as destruction of flocks and shepherds by what Job’s messenger called “the very fire of God” from the heavens; whether this was lightning or other fire is not stated. Satan also brought a raid by three bands of Chaldeans, as well as a windstorm. These things caused the death of all of Job’s children and destroyed his property. Finally, Satan inflicted a loathsome disease upon Job himself.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 1:13-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 2:7, 8</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">These things reveal the might and power of the spirit creature Satan, as well as his vicious, murderous attitude.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">It is important to note, however, that Satan recognized his impotence in the face of God’s express command, for he did not challenge God’s power and authority when God restricted him from taking Job’s life.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 2:6</a>.</p>

<strong>Sovereignty</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"><strong><em>God’s servants charged with selfishness.</em></strong> A further expression of the issue is found in Satan’s statement to God about his faithful servant Job. Satan said: “Is it for nothing that Job has feared God? Have not you yourself put up a hedge about him and about his house and about everything that he has all around? The work of his hands you have blessed, and his livestock itself has spread abroad in the earth. But, for a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch everything he has and see whether he will not curse you to your very face.” Again, he charged: “Skin in behalf of skin, and everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Job 1:9-11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/44/1" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> 2:4</a>) Satan therewith charged Job with being not in harmony with God at heart, as serving God obediently only because of selfish considerations, for gain. Satan thereby slandered God as to his sovereignty, and God’s servants as to integrity to that sovereignty. He said, in effect, that no man could be put on earth who would maintain integrity to Jehovah’s sovereignty if he, Satan, was allowed to put him to the test.</p>

<strong>Job Held High the Name of Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> The introductory narrative of the book of Job describes a gathering in heaven where the angels took their station before Jehovah. Satan was also present, and he leveled charges against Job. (<em>Read</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009281/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><em>Job 1:6-11</em></a><em>.</em>) Although Satan mentioned Job’s possessions, he focused his attention on challenging Job’s integrity. The term “integrity” carries the thought of being upright, blameless, righteous, and faultless. As used in the Bible, human integrity denotes a completeness of heart devotion to the person of Jehovah.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204407/89/0">7/15/1962, pp. 419-420</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Have the Endurance of Job Today</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">But did Job get discouraged and quit? Did he follow his wife’s counsel, “Curse God and die”? No, he did not. He endured. And not only did he endure these things, but he held on to his integrity in spite of eight speeches made by those supposed friends of his who turned out to be his enemies, hypocrites in fact. “A true companion is loving all the time, and is a brother that is born for when there is distress.” But these three turned on Job with questions such as this: “Is not your own badness too much already, and will there <span id="page420" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="420" data-before-text="420"></span>be no end to your errors?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 2:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Prov. 17:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Job 22:5</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The record goes on to show that Jehovah God rewarded Job for his endurance, even as James notes, and, though having lived some thirty-five centuries ago, Job stands as a good example for all lovers of righteousness today; especially when these find themselves beset with similar hardship. Loss of one’s material possessions, of loved ones, of health and of friends are still the common lot of man.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 42:10-17</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">What will enable you to endure these evils without becoming resentful, bitter or discouraged? Faith in God and in his promises. Job had such faith. In spite of all his suffering he “did not sin or ascribe anything improper to God.” He kept trusting God ‘even though God would slay him.’ Faith will enable you to endure, to continue “steadfast as seeing the One who is invisible.” Besides, has not God promised that in his due time, which is now very near, all suffering, all sorrow, pain and death will end? Having faith in such promises of God will give you hope, and hope will help you to endure.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 1:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 13:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Heb. 11:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/5/3" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> Rev. 21:4</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Prayer is another great aid to endurance. Job’s words show that his attitude was one of prayer; he pleaded with God, presenting his case to him. So, should adversity come your way, you may pray to have what is needful. Is it illness you have to endure? You may pray for wisdom to cope with your affliction and strength to endure it. Is your hardship persecution? Here also you may pray, not only for strength to endure, but for your persecutors, even as Jesus commanded: “Pray for those persecuting you,” and as he himself did when saying: “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 5:44;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Luke 23:34</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Another aid to your enduring is a knowledge and understanding of God’s purposes. Job did not know why God permitted him to suffer, but we today, by reason of having the account of Job and God’s light upon it, know why God permits the righteous to suffer, namely, to prove to the Devil as well as to all creation that he can have creatures that will remain faithful to him come what may. Job kept integrity without knowing about this reason. Certainly knowledge of it should help all lovers of righteousness to endure.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 1:7-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2:2-8</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">And, above all, love will help you to endure. Love for God will help you to put up with what he permits, not rebelling or even complaining about it. Love will cause you to trust God as Job trusted him, always obeying him, for “this is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments.” And love for your neighbor will also help you to endure, to put up with him, be that neighbor a member of your own family, a member of your congregation or a fellow worker at your place of employment. If you truly love your neighbor you will also want to be setting him a good example by enduring and helping him to endure. “Love is long-suffering and kind. . . . It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 John 5:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 13:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 7</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Yes, among the many things that will aid you to endure are faith, prayer, knowledge and understanding, and love. Endurance is the course of wisdom. There is peace, comfort and an inner joy from knowing that you are enduring, bearing up under adversity because it is the right thing to do. Such endurance assures you of future reward: “He that has endured to the end is the one that will be saved.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 24:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Rom. 5:3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Choosing the Right Form of Worship</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span id="page532" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="532" data-before-text="532"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Especially when one selects a marriage mate it is important to call to mind the counsel: “Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960646/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Cor. 6:14</a>) It may start with an evening of entertainment in company with worldly acquaintances. However, the attraction between the sexes is strong, one’s emotions easily become involved, and emotions can be very effective in regimenting one’s power of reason to work for them, justifying their inclinations instead of correcting them. When the friendship leads to marriage, the believer may feel sure in himself that the marriage mate is of good will and will be helped thereby to come into the truth. That is not the way God tells us to reason on the matter. His command to his covenant people Israel was: “You must form no marriage alliance with [the unbelievers in the land]. Your daughter you must not give to his son, and his daughter you must not take for your son. For he will turn your son from following me and they will certainly serve other gods, and Jehovah’s anger will indeed blaze against you and he will certainly annihilate you in a hurry.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960646/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Deut. 7:3, 4</a>) To Christians the command is given to marry “only in the Lord,” that is, only those persons who have already proved themselves to be in union with the Lord God by making a dedication to serve him. Thus the Bible shows that seeking association with worldly people is a step away from true worship.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960646/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:39</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>RELATION TO SECULAR WORK</strong></p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">11.

In some places where clergy control is strong, a person who wants to leave the church to become one of Jehovah’s witnesses may be threatened with loss of his secular employment. At times the relatives of a person have been threatened with economic reprisals simply because he was studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses. Thus the Devil through his visible agents continues to advance the argument presented in the case of Job. He contends that men will serve God only as long as they prosper materially, but that if their economic security is endangered they will abandon Jehovah’s worship. Yet many are the individuals who refuse to make their worship dependent on economic considerations. They believe that God, who cares for the birds of the air and the beasts of the field, will see that they too have their daily bread if they put their worship of him first.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960646/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Job 1:9-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960646/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Matt. 6:25-34</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">12.

If Riches is our master, our secular employment will govern our lives. It is not necessarily the rich man who is a slave to riches; it is often the one who has to struggle day by day to get enough money to support his family who finds that he has become a slave in the economic treadmill. We are servants of the one we obey. Wisely we must keep secular employment in its place, as the means by which we support ourselves and provide the things needed by our families, but never should we permit our freedom to do the divine will to be choked off by involvement in the “commercial businesses of life.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960646/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Tim. 2:4</a>.</p>

At the meeting what took place? Here is the account from the book of Job: “Now it came to be the day when the sons of The [true] God came in to take their station before Jehovah, and even Satan proceeded to come in right among them. Then Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Where do you come from?’ At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘From roving about in the earth and from walking about in it.’ And Jehovah went on to say to Satan: ‘Have you set your heart upon my servant Job, that there is no one like him in the earth, a man of integrity and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad?’ At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘Is it for nothing that Job has feared God? Have not you yourself put up a hedge about him and about his house and about everything that he has all around?

Only against him himself do not thrust out your hand!’ So Satan went out away from the person of Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 1:6-12</a>.</p><p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu">10.

Here was the thing that caused Job difficulty. He did not know the question that he was picked to prove, namely, that God can raise up the right kind of persons to be his witnesses in the earth, and that they will hold on to their integrity to him despite all the unjust suffering he may allow to test their unselfish worship of him. Job being then the unequaled witness of Jehovah on earth, no one should be better qualified to prove this point in favor of Jehovah than Job.</p><p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu">11. In what office toward God was Job acting in behalf of his family, and why?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Job was acting as priest of Jehovah God for his family. His wife was living and he had seven sons and three daughters. Besides that, he had seven thousand sheep and three thousand camels, making a total of ten thousand together, and also five hundred spans of oxen and five hundred she-asses, along with a very great body of servants. In spite of all these possessions, Job was not a materialistic man. He did not get so deeply buried in his material goods that he forgot about God, who was the real source of all his wealth. He did not try to increase his material wealth by going crooked and violating the laws of God and showing no fear of God. Job wanted his ten children to fear God and stay in God’s favor. So after his seven sons had spread banquets for their three sisters at their seven houses, Job would always act as an intercessor for them with Jehovah. “Job would send and sanctify them, and he got up early in the morning and offered up burnt sacrifices according to the number of all of them, for, said Job, ‘maybe my sons have sinned and have cursed God in their heart.’ That is the way Job would do always.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 1:1-5</a>) At that time Jehovah God had not yet set up his exclusive priesthood in the tribe of Levi, the tribe of Moses the prophet.</p><p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">12. In what way did Jehovah bless Job, and why in this way?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Quite properly Jehovah God blessed Job for his faithful worship as a witness of Jehovah, and quite properly at that time God blessed Job with material goods to be used in a right way. Job could be trusted with them. Long before this God had blessed Job’s granduncle Abraham in this manner, and also Abraham’s son Isaac and his grandson Jacob. So it was nothing new for God to increase the material possessions of his servant Job and to protect them against enemy attack. Certainly God did not bless his servants with material goods just to enrich the thievish enemy. For this reason God kept those goods out of the hands of selfish, greedy evildoers. Neither Job nor Abraham and Isaac and Jacob expected to go to heaven and be rewarded only up there after death. So God was in harmony with their earthly hopes in blessing them upon the earth. Who, then, had a right to object to Job’s having all this material wealth? No one.</p><p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu">13. What test had Job withstood thus far, and so what test did Satan propose, and why?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[67]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> However, Satan the Devil did not want God to have any pleasure out of Job. Hence he accused Job. Let it be noted that Satan did not, even as he could not, accuse Job of acting materialistically and misusing all the material goods with which Jehovah had blessed Job. No; up to that point Job had withstood the test of materialism. All <span id="page596" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="596" data-before-text="596"></span>that was left for Satan to do, then, was to accuse Job’s heart condition. He was at heart materialistic; he was serving Jehovah God only for the material good that he could get out of it, argued Satan the Devil. To show up Job’s heart condition and the weakness of his integrity Satan suggested that Jehovah take away all those material possessions. Of course, Jehovah would not do that himself; but, to permit the question to be answered, he would let Satan the Devil and his crowd on earth take away such material things. Satan had no confidence in Job. God did, and he was not unwilling to prove this.</p>

<strong>If the Creator Cares, Why So Much Suffering?</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">The book of Job helps us to identify the root cause of Job’s suffering and to see why God allowed it. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101998029/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Job Chapters 1 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101998029/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 2</a> reveal what had recently taken place in the invisible heavens, in the spirit realm.

At the mention of Job’s blameless course, Satan challenged: “Is it for nothing that Job has feared God? . . . For a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch everything he has and see whether he will not curse you to your very face.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101998029/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Job 1:9-12</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">In other words, Satan accused God of bribing Job. This defiant spirit creature claimed that if Job was stripped of his wealth and his health, he would curse Jehovah. By extension, Satan was asserting that no human would love and be loyal to God in the face of suffering. That challenge had global and enduring impact. The issues that Satan raised had to be settled. Thus, God gave Satan freedom to act against Job, and Satan brought those various forms of suffering on the man.</p>

<strong>Why Does God Allow His Servants to Be Persecuted?</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Scriptural record of a conversation about faithful Job sheds much light on the matter. We read: “Jehovah went on to say to Satan: ‘Have you set your heart upon my servant Job, that there is no one like him in the earth, a man blameless and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad?’ At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘Is it for nothing that Job has feared God? Have not you yourself put up a hedge about him and about his house and about everything that he has all around? The work of his hands you have blessed, and his livestock itself has spread abroad in the earth. But, for a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch everything he has and see whether he will not curse you to your very face.’”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101977650/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 1:8-11</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Here Satan claimed that Job was serving the Most High only for selfish reasons. It was the adversary’s contention that, once the material benefits were removed, Job would prove unfaithful. This really is Satan’s claim regarding all of Jehovah’s loyal servants. That claim also constituted a reproach on God’s holy name. How so? It made it appear that Jehovah’s rulership is of such inferior quality that no one would submit to it if there were no selfish benefits to be gained.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Therefore, as in the case of Job, Jehovah God has not shielded his servants from persecution. This has enabled them to prove their unselfish love for him and their earnest desire to have the good name of their heavenly Father cleared of all reproach. In fact, they have counted it a privilege to suffer for righteousness’ sake and thus to contribute to the vindication of God’s holy name and toward proving Satan’s contention to be a lie.</p>

<strong>Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p77" data-pid="77"><strong><em>The supreme issue a moral one.</em></strong> It is evident that the spirit son who became Satan knew Jehovah as a God of moral standards, not as a capricious, erratic person. Had he known Jehovah as a God given to uncontrolled, violent outbursts, he could only have expected immediate, on-the-spot extermination for the course he took. The issue Satan raised in Eden, therefore, was not simply a test of Jehovah’s mightiness or power to destroy. Rather, it was a moral issue: that of God’s moral right to exercise universal sovereignty and require implicit obedience and devotion of all of his creatures in all places. Satan’s approach to Eve reveals this.

Although a narrow band of spectral wave lengths forms the foundation, the available variations and combinations of colour to delight the eye of the observer are virtually without limit. Similarly, all of the artistry of music comes to the ear through another small group of frequencies.” (<em>The Encyclopædia Britannica,</em> 1959 ed., Vol. 21, p. 307) Likewise, God’s requirements for the human pair allowed them all the freedom that a righteous heart could desire.

The issue Satan raised in Eden, therefore was not simply a test of Jehovah’s mightiness or power to destroy. Rather, it was a moral issue: that of God’s moral right to exercise universal sovereignty and require implicit obedience and devotion of all his creatures in all places. Satan’s approach to Eve, already considered, reveals this. So does the book of Job. Therein is related Jehovah’s bringing out into the open before all his assembled angelic sons the extent of the position taken by his adversary. Satan made the claim that the loyalty of Job (and, by implication, of any of God’s intelligent creatures) toward Jehovah was not wholehearted, not based on true devotion and genuine love.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/136/0" data-bid="137-1" class="b">Job 1:6-22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/136/1" data-bid="137-2" class="b"> 2:1-8</a>.</p><p id="p95" data-pid="95" class="sb">Thus, the question of integrity on the part of God’s intelligent creatures was a secondary or subsidiary issue arising out of the primary issue of God’s right to universal sovereignty. These questions would require time in order for the veracity or falsity of the charges to be demonstrated, for the heart attitude of God’s creatures to be proved, and thus for the issue to be settled beyond any doubt. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/137/0" data-bid="138-1" class="b">Job 23:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/137/1" data-bid="138-2" class="b"> 31:5, 6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/137/2" data-bid="138-3" class="b"> Ecclesiastes 8:11-13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/137/3" data-bid="138-4" class="b"> Hebrews 5:7-9</a>; see INTEGRITY; WICKEDNESS.) Jehovah thus did not execute judgment immediately upon the rebellious human pair nor upon the spirit son who raised the issue, and so the two foretold ‘seeds,’ representing opposite sides of the issue, would come into existence.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/138/0" data-bid="139-1" class="b">Gen. 3:15</a>.</p><p id="p96" data-pid="96" class="sb">That this issue still remained alive when Jesus Christ was on earth is seen from his confrontation with Satan in the wilderness after Jesus’ forty-day fast. The serpentlike tactics employed by Jehovah’s adversary in his temptation efforts toward God’s Son followed the pattern seen in Eden some four thousand years earlier, and Satan’s offer of rulership over earthly kingdoms made clear that the issue of universal sovereignty had not changed.

Such sanctification would require a cleansing of the Name of all reproach and false charges, that is, a vindicating of it. But, much more than that, it would require the honoring of that name as sacred by all intelligent creatures in heaven and earth. This, in turn, would mean their recognizing and respecting Jehovah’s sovereign position, doing so willingly, wanting to serve him, delighting to do his divine will, because of love for him. David’s prayer to Jehovah at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/142/0" data-bid="143-1" class="b">Psalm 40:5-10</a> well expresses such attitude and true sanctification of Jehovah’s name. (Note the apostle’s application of portions of this psalm to Christ Jesus at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/143/0" data-bid="144-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:5-10</a>.)</p><p id="p99" data-pid="99" class="sb">Upon the sanctification of Jehovah’s name, therefore, depend the good order, peace and well-being of all the universe and its inhabitants. God’s Son showed this, at the same time pointing out Jehovah’s means for accomplishing his purpose, when he taught his disciples to pray to God: “Let your name be sanctified. Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/144/0" data-bid="145-1" class="b">Matt. 6:9, 10</a>) This primary purpose of Jehovah provides the key for understanding the reason behind God’s actions and his dealings with his creatures as set forth in the entire Bible.</p><p id="p100" data-pid="100" class="sb">Thus, we find that the nation of Israel, whose history forms a large part of the Bible record, was selected to be a ‘name people’ for Jehovah.

<strong>Satan</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The Bible, in lifting the veil to give a glimpse into heavenly affairs, reveals that Satan later as a rival god appeared before Jehovah in heaven, challenging Jehovah to His face, saying that he could turn God’s servant Job, and by implication any servant of God, away from Him. He charged God, in effect, with unrighteously giving Job everything, along with full protection, so that he, Satan, could not test Job and show what was really in his heart, which, Satan intimated, was bad. He implied that Job served God primarily for selfish considerations. Satan made this point of his argument clear when he said: “Skin in behalf of skin, and everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul. For a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch as far as his bone and his flesh and see whether he will not curse you to your very face.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Job 1:6-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 2:1-7</a>; see <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/1">SOVEREIGNTY</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In this special case, Jehovah allowed Satan to bring calamity upon Job by not interfering when Satan brought about a raid from Sabean marauders as well as destruction of flocks and shepherds by what Job’s messenger called “the very fire of God” from the heavens; whether this was lightning or other fire is not stated. Satan also brought a raid by three bands of Chaldeans, as well as a windstorm. These things caused the death of all of Job’s children and destroyed his property. Finally, Satan inflicted a loathsome disease upon Job himself.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 1:13-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 2:7, 8</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">These things reveal the might and power of the spirit creature Satan, as well as his vicious, murderous attitude.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">It is important to note, however, that Satan recognized his impotence in the face of God’s express command, for he did not challenge God’s power and authority when God restricted him from taking Job’s life.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 2:6</a>.</p>

<strong>Maintaining Personal Integrity</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> Now let us look further into this perfect law and see that, when we do something wrong, we just cannot always say, ‘It is due to the weakness of the flesh,’ and try to justify our wrong. Paul, in writing to the Corinthians, says: “No temptation has taken you except what is common <span id="page370" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="370" data-before-text="370"></span>to men. But God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear, but along with the temptation he will also make the way out in order for you to be able to endure it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:13</a>) The way out is not the way we think but the way Jehovah God provides. According to Paul, Jehovah is sure to help us so we can keep our uprightness of deportment before him and his people.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">14, 15. (a) How does Jehovah’s theocratic organization help us maintain integrity? (b) Whose conduct can we faithfully imitate?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Another provision that God has supplied in maintaining integrity is his theocratic organization, a wholly devoted, clean, pure organization that gives us personal guidance so that we can maintain our faithful course. In this organization Jehovah has provided mature, properly trained, faithful overseers in every Christian congregation that are willing to help with any problem that we may have that interferes with our worship of God. They are ever ready to offer counsel from the Scriptures on how we should walk and the way we should talk so as to be identified as Jehovah’s integrity-keepers. Let us note what our relationship to these theocratically appointed overseers should be as set forth in Hebrews: “Remember those who are taking the lead among you, who have spoken the word of God to you, and as you contemplate how their conduct turns out imitate their faith.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Heb. 13:7</a>) Overseers must walk circumspectly before God, because Jehovah holds them responsible too. Of him that has much, more will be required.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Luke 12:48</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> We have many examples of men and women who maintained their integrity when put to the test. In their lives we can see illustrated examples of wholeheartedness to Jehovah God. We recognize that a pupil learns faster by having what he hears demonstrated, and that was the way that Christ Jesus taught his apostles and disciples. So if we watch the conduct of our overseers in the organization, then it will help us to maintain our uprightness.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Hebrews chap. 11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Matt. 11:1</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>EXAMPLES ANCIENT AND MODERN</strong></p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">16.

Satan tried to destroy Job’s integrity. Job lost first his material possessions, then his family whom he dearly loved. Finally he was plagued with disease and sickness. But in spite of Job’s losses and the wrong influence brought to bear against him, he endured it and proved Satan the Devil a liar. Job’s attitude was: “Until I expire I shall not take away my integrity from myself!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 27:5</a>) So God blessed him.

In what ways may our integrity be tested today as was Job’s?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> No one will escape having his integrity tested. Do not underrate the Devil. He knows our weakest spot. He knows what may shake our faith. For some it may be the loss of material things, which would cause them to work harder to make more money to regain what they had before or to get as much as someone else. He may strike through loved ones, turning them against you because of your love for Jehovah God. If because of our love for Jehovah we lose the love of those dear to us, it should not affect our pure worship to Jehovah God. It should simply deepen our appreciation of the wonderful promise from God to provide a hundredfold. Jesus said: “Truly I say to you men, No one has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the sake of the good news who will not get a hundredfold.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Mark 10:29, 30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Matt. 10:37</a>.</p>

God has held back from destroying Satan only because of what God said to Satan in the garden of Eden after Adam and Eve had sinned. God said: “I shall put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed. He will bruise you in the head and you will bruise him in the heel.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962842/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Gen. 3:15</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[70]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> Time and freedom of action had to be permitted the Devil in order to settle the newly arisen issue: Who holds the universal sovereignty, Jehovah God or Satan the Devil? Also, since the Seed or Offspring of God’s “woman” was put into the issue, God had to prove this point: In spite of the fall of the first perfect man into sin under pressure by Satan the Devil, Jehovah God is able to put on earth in the midst of the Devil’s world a Seed or Offspring that will remain faithful to God. The subjecting of this Seed to earthly “superior authorities” would not lead this Seed or Offspring to be disloyal to God or break integrity toward God.</p><p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="qu">20.

Under challenge by Satan the Devil, Jehovah God said to him regarding faithful Job: “Look! Everything that he has is in your hand. Only against him himself do not thrust out your hand!” When the unsuccessful Satan challenged God on a second occasion, God said regarding Job: “There he is in your hand! Only watch out for his soul itself!” Job proved Satan the Devil a liar again.

Jesus was then on trial for his human life.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[72]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> When Jesus refused to tell the Roman governor about his heavenly origin, “Pilate said to him: ‘Are you not speaking to me?

<strong>Why Do the Righteous Suffer?</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">At a meeting of the angelic sons of God in heaven Jehovah asked Satan: “Have you set your heart upon my servant Job, that there is no one like him in the earth, a man blameless and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad?” The fact that God called Job’s faithfulness to Satan’s attention indicates there was a contention as to whether human creatures would keep integrity to God. Satan’s reply proves that there was such an issue, for right away he makes excuses for Job’s faithfulness. He asserts that Job serves God because of the material blessings received and not because he loves him. He suggests: “‘For a change, <span id="page264" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="264" data-before-text="264"></span>thrust out your hand, please, and touch everything he has and see whether he will not curse you to your very face.’ Accordingly Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Look! Everything that he has is in your hand. Only against him himself do not thrust out your hand!’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 1:7-12</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Job maintained a righteous course despite everything the Devil could do; he proved that he served God because he loved him and wanted to be pleasing in his sight. Job believed in the integrity of his course, and so proclaimed to his accusers: “Until I expire I shall not take away my integrity from myself!”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Job 27:5</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Men of integrity have always been willing to suffer for what they believed in. Some have even sacrificed their lives because of love for a person or a country. The Bible records example after example of other persons that have had strong love for Almighty God. Above everything else, they wanted to live a righteous life in order to be an honor to God and thus prove the Devil’s claim that he could turn all human creatures away from God to be a lie. Although pursuing a course of righteousness has resulted in their suffering a great deal, they have maintained a proper attitude.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>PROPER ATTITUDE TOWARD SUFFERING</strong></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">It is true that in itself suffering does not bring happiness; but if one knows that a loved one is benefited or made happy, then he can rejoice even in the suffering. That is why the apostles, after receiving a flogging for preaching the good news of the Kingdom, “went their way from before the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy to be dishonored in behalf of his name.” They were obeying God’s command to preach and they knew that this was pleasing to him. Therefore they were happy, for, as the scripture says, “if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are happy.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Acts 5:40, 41;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 3:14</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">This helps one to appreciate what Jesus meant when he said in the sermon on the mount: “Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing against you for my sake. Rejoice and leap for joy, since your reward is great in the heavens.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 5:10-12</a>) When a Christian keeps integrity to God and suffers because of it he rejoices in the knowledge that he is proving the Devil a liar and is thus making Jehovah’s heart rejoice. Although the suffering does not make him happy, the fact that it contributes to the vindication of God’s name does. Then, too, one can rejoice because of the reward that is promised to the faithful.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Prov. 27:11</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Everyone today is bound to experience suffering because of living amid this wicked system of things and being subject to inherited imperfections due to sin. The righteous can also expect to suffer because of keeping integrity to God. But they can take heart and rejoice, for there is a new world of God’s making that is now so very close at hand. There suffering will be no more, for God promises that “he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be any more.” So never let present suffering embitter you. Look to the future. Yes, place your hope and confidence in God’s promised new world, where there will be no suffering.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Rev. 21:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 2 Pet. 3:13</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Endurance like Job’s in the Time of the End</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> God’s power pulls back the veil of invisibility and we look into the spirit world to see a meeting of angels assembling before the Most High God, to which meeting Jehovah God had ordered Satan to come. At the meeting what took place? Here is the account from the book of Job: “Now it came to be the day when the sons of The [true] God came in to take their station before Jehovah, and even Satan proceeded to come in right among them. Then Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Where do you come from?’ At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘From roving about in the earth and from walking about in it.’ And Jehovah went on to say to Satan: ‘Have you set your heart upon my servant Job, that there is no one like him in the earth, a man of integrity and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad?’ At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘Is it for nothing that Job has feared God? Have not you yourself put up a hedge about him and about his house and about everything that he has all around? The work of his hands you have blessed and his livestock itself has spread abroad in the earth. But, for a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch everything he has [and see] <span id="page595" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="595" data-before-text="595"></span>whether he will not curse you to your very face.’ Accordingly Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Look! everything that he has is in your hand. Only against him himself do not thrust out your hand!’ So Satan went out away from the person of Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 1:6-12</a>.</p><p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu">10. Of what was Job ignorant at the time, and why was no one better qualified than he to furnish the answer to the question raised?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[64]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Job did not know about this meeting in heaven and what the big question was that was put forward and what was to be done about getting the true answer to the question. Here was the thing that caused Job difficulty. He did not know the question that he was picked to prove, namely, that God can raise up the right kind of persons to be his witnesses in the earth, and that they will hold on to their integrity to him despite all the unjust suffering he may allow to test their unselfish worship of him. Job being then the unequaled witness of Jehovah on earth, no one should be better qualified to prove this point in favor of Jehovah than Job.</p><p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu">11. In what office toward God was Job acting in behalf of his family, and why?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Job was acting as priest of Jehovah God for his family. His wife was living and he had seven sons and three daughters. Besides that, he had seven thousand sheep and three thousand camels, making a total of ten thousand together, and also five hundred spans of oxen and five hundred she-asses, along with a very great body of servants. In spite of all these possessions, Job was not a materialistic man. He did not get so deeply buried in his material goods that he forgot about God, who was the real source of all his wealth. He did not try to increase his material wealth by going crooked and violating the laws of God and showing no fear of God. Job wanted his ten children to fear God and stay in God’s favor. So after his seven sons had spread banquets for their three sisters at their seven houses, Job would always act as an intercessor for them with Jehovah. “Job would send and sanctify them, and he got up early in the morning and offered up burnt sacrifices according to the number of all of them, for, said Job, ‘maybe my sons have sinned and have cursed God in their heart.’ That is the way Job would do always.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 1:1-5</a>) At that time Jehovah God had not yet set up his exclusive priesthood in the tribe of Levi, the tribe of Moses the prophet.</p><p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">12. In what way did Jehovah bless Job, and why in this way?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Quite properly Jehovah God blessed Job for his faithful worship as a witness of Jehovah, and quite properly at that time God blessed Job with material goods to be used in a right way. Job could be trusted with them. Long before this God had blessed Job’s granduncle Abraham in this manner, and also Abraham’s son Isaac and his grandson Jacob. So it was nothing new for God to increase the material possessions of his servant Job and to protect them against enemy attack. Certainly God did not bless his servants with material goods just to enrich the thievish enemy. For this reason God kept those goods out of the hands of selfish, greedy evildoers. Neither Job nor Abraham and Isaac and Jacob expected to go to heaven and be rewarded only up there after death. So God was in harmony with their earthly hopes in blessing them upon the earth. Who, then, had a right to object to Job’s having all this material wealth? No one.</p><p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu">13. What test had Job withstood thus far, and so what test did Satan propose, and why?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[67]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> However, Satan the Devil did not want God to have any pleasure out of Job. Hence he accused Job. Let it be noted that Satan did not, even as he could not, accuse Job of acting materialistically and misusing all the material goods with which Jehovah had blessed Job. No; up to that point Job had withstood the test of materialism. All <span id="page596" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="596" data-before-text="596"></span>that was left for Satan to do, then, was to accuse Job’s heart condition. He was at heart materialistic; he was serving Jehovah God only for the material good that he could get out of it, argued Satan the Devil. To show up Job’s heart condition and the weakness of his integrity Satan suggested that Jehovah take away all those material possessions. Of course, Jehovah would not do that himself; but, to permit the question to be answered, he would let Satan the Devil and his crowd on earth take away such material things. Satan had no confidence in Job. God did, and he was not unwilling to prove this.</p>

<strong>1914 a Marked Year!</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> There is a final matter to amusingly note from Satan’s brazen conversation with Jehovah as to Job. Satan was not the all-powerful sovereign that he originally thought he was going to be. The fact that <span id="page265" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="265" data-before-text="265"></span>God calls him to question by saying, “Where have you been?” indicates that Jehovah had the upper hand. Satan in fear was being put on the spot, so to speak. The further fact that Satan complains of the “hedge” put around Job indicates that he was nettled at Jehovah’s displays of superior power not only in defense of his true worshipers on earth, but also on special occasions, such as, for example, at the Flood, where with no difficulty God washed away Satan’s angelized earthly civilization; at Babel, where God confused the speech of Satan’s first earthly kingdom; and in Egypt, where Jehovah brought the first world power to its knees to deliver the Israelites with a high hand. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952321/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Gen. 7:21-24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952321/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 11:7-9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952321/30/2" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> Ex. 14:8</a>) Finally Jehovah placed a limitation as to how far Satan could go in his testing of Job’s integrity. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952321/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Job 1:12</a>) Notice, too, that Satan displayed due respect for Jehovah’s power by complying with that order. He was taking no chances in needlessly arousing Jehovah’s far superior forces. All this was reducing the sham sovereign to a helpless inferior and demonstrated that his control on earth was not all-embracing. In fact, he merely controlled those parts where he had blinded the inhabitants with his false religions and had kept them in line by means of his various makeshift governments. Never has he enjoyed undisputed control and power over all mankind, because at all times there have been those who have clung to the true worship of Jehovah God and who have looked forward to a restoration of a divine, sovereign-empowered government over all the earth.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952321/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Heb. 11:10</a>.</p>

<strong>The Prevailing Will of God</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span id="page422" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="422" data-before-text="422"></span>What a strange contrast between the tame and wild asses, which are in appearance so similar! Can man account for this difference or do much about it?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>POWER OF WILD BULL NOT HARNESSED BY MAN</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Then Jehovah God brings up another wild creature whose power man could not harness, the wild bull: “Does a wild bull want to serve you, or will it spend the night by your manger? Will you bind a wild bull fast with its ropes in the furrow, or will it harrow low plains after you? Will you trust in it because its power is abundant, and will you leave your toil to it? Will you rely on it that it will bring back your seed and that it will gather to your threshing floor?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 39:9-12</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The answer to these questions, as well as those previously asked by God, is No. What farmer would dare? The wild bull was not like the cattle used for agricultural purposes, even though similar in appearance. Job once had five hundred spans of cattle, which he used for plowing. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 1:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 14</a>) But he could not harness the greater strength of the wild bull for the same purpose. The pictorial representations on monuments show that the ancient Egyptians bound their oxen to the plow by a cord fastened around the horns and tied to the yoke and the handle. But could any man bind a wild bull fast with its ropes in the furrow? No.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Then the question: “Will you trust in it because its power is abundant?” No, indeed. The greater wonder, then, that man could not avail himself of this strength to do his work. The wild bull was one of the most powerful animals known to the Israelites. The Hebrew word for this animal, <em>reem,</em> is mistranslated in the King James Version Bible as “unicorn”; but the <em>reem</em> was no one-horned mythological beast. It had two horns, “the horns of a wild bull.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962521/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Deut. 33:17</a>) Apparently related to domesticated cattle, the <em>reem</em> was not serving man, plowing his fields or hauling home grain.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The ancients considered the wild bull to be a most formidable creature, an Assyrian king calling it “strong and fierce.” English Orientalist H. C. Rawlinson translated this inscription of an Assyrian king, and it reads: “Four wild bulls, strong and fierce, in the desert . . . with my long arrows tipped with iron, and with heavy blows, I took their lives. Their skin and their horns I brought to my city of Ashur.” And English archaeologist Sir Austen Layard wrote in <em>Nineveh and Its Remains:</em> “The wild bull, from its frequent representation in the bas-reliefs, appears to have been considered scarcely less formidable and notable game than the lion. The king is frequently seen contending with it, and warriors pursue it on horseback and on foot.”</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">What kind of animal was this wild bull? Many present-day naturalists believe that the Hebrew <em>reem</em> must have been the now-extinct aurochs, an oxlike creature that stood six feet at the shoulder. Dr. George C. Goodwin, associate curator of the Department of Mammals of the American Museum of Natural History, states in <em>The Animal Kingdom:</em> “The aurochs was once plentiful in Palestine; it appears to be mentioned in the Bible as the ‘unicorn.’” If this is the wild bull spoken of by God, it was indeed a most powerful animal. The aurochs existed in Gaul (France) down to the time of Julius Caesar, who wrote in his <em>Commentaries</em> (<em>De bello Gallico</em>):</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="si">“They are little inferior in size to elephants; they are bulls in their nature, color and figure. Great is their strength and great is their swiftness, neither do they spare man or beast, which they have caught sight of. . . . [They] can not be habituated to man and made tractable, not even when caught very young. The great spread of the horns <span id="page423" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="423" data-before-text="423"></span>as well as the shape and quality of them differ much from the horns of our oxen.”</p>

<strong>Satan</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In this special case, Jehovah allowed Satan to bring calamity upon Job by not interfering when Satan brought about a raid from Sabean marauders as well as destruction of flocks and shepherds by what Job’s messenger called “the very fire of God” from the heavens; whether this was lightning or other fire is not stated. Satan also brought a raid by three bands of Chaldeans, as well as a windstorm. These things caused the death of all of Job’s children and destroyed his property.

<strong>Would You Avoid Dishonor? Avoid Presumptuousness</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">However, one of the most impressive examples of the danger of a presumptuous course is that of the ancient city of Babylon, the seat of Satanic false religion after the flood of Noah’s day. This is not mere assertion, for the pages of the Bible and of secular history, to which anyone can go for proof, record her fallacious and lofty-minded acts toward God, and their humiliating outcome. (An interesting sidelight <span id="page311" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="311" data-before-text="311"></span>here is the record at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965365/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 1:17</a> of the Devil’s use of the Chaldeans [Babylonians] as a tool in his effort to support his slanderous charge against Jehovah and his servant Job.)</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In his prophecy against Babylon in the Bible <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965365/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">book of Jeremiah, chapter fifty</a>, Jehovah addresses her as “the land of Merathaim” and her citizens as “the inhabitants of Pekod.” “The land of Merathaim” means “the land of double rebellion,” and “the inhabitants of Pekod” means “the inhabitants of the country of punishment.”<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965365/0">a</a> Even by these names he gave to Babylon, how nicely Jehovah describes her presumptuousness and the ruinous end that awaited her.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Why was Babylon a “land of double rebellion”? In the first place, it was built by Nimrod who, when he was deified, was called Merodach. This name is understood by some to mean “great rebel.” Nimrod was a rebel against Jehovah, and Babylon had been doubly so in that she had with fire and sword overthrown the kingdom of Jehovah’s people, destroyed his temple, massacred his people and deported thousands of them to the land of Shinar, from which the Hebrew patriarch had come out at God’s command. And O how elated she was in doing it! So she was more than rebellious. She was twofold rebellious. For this reason she deserved a visitation or punishment from God.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Babylon looked to herself as being the world sovereign. Would not Merodach her god maintain her in that sovereign position? Consequently she presumed against the great Universal Sovereign Jehovah, even going so far as having the boldness and rashness to assault Jehovah’s throne, that is, the throne of the kings of the line of David, and to the extreme presumptuousness of desolating Jehovah’s temple. How her pride was lifting her up for a crash! God’s just decree was:</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="si">“Let there be a massacre and a devoting to destruction close upon them . . . There is the sound of war in the land, and a great breakdown. O how the forge hammer of all the earth [Babylon had destroyed many nations] has been cut down and gets broken! O how Babylon has become a mere object of astonishment among the nations! I have laid a snare for you and you have also been caught, O Babylon, and you yourself did not know it. You were found and also taken hold of, for it was against Jehovah that you excited yourself.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965365/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jer. 50:21-24</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>A SURPRISING CRASH</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The one commanded to cut Babylon down was Cyrus II the Persian, and he did it expertly. The element of surprise caught mighty, sovereign Babylon off guard and nullified her defenses. Cyrus’ forces encountered practically no resistance when they came as if by a miracle out of the Euphrates riverbed through her unlocked, poorly guarded inner gates. It was exactly as if Jehovah had skillfully sprung a snare or trap on her and caught her before she knew what was happening! Babylon was stunned. Why had she been unable to escape? Why, it seemed impossible that such a thing could happen. Ah, but it was not due to the strength of Cyrus’ armies. No, presumptuous Babylon, there was nothing you could have done about it, for “it was against Jehovah that you excited yourself.” Therefore your fall had to be spectacular. Jehovah reveals that he himself directed your astounding collapse:</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">“Jehovah has opened his storehouse, and he brings forth the weapons of his denunciation [his war weapons, particularly the Medes and Persians]. For there is a work that the Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies, has in the land of the Chaldeans. <span id="page312" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="312" data-before-text="312"></span>Come in to her from the farthest part [even as far as Armenia and Mount Ararat]. Open up her granaries. Bank her up, just like those making heaps [heap up her riches outside for the spoilers to take], and devote her to destruction [like something “devoted” to God, no longer for man to use]. May she not come to have any remaining ones [no successors]. Massacre all her young bulls [her imperial leaders]. May they go down to the slaughter. Woe to them, for their day has come, the time for their being given attention!”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965365/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jer. 50:25-27</a>.</p>

<strong>A Bible Theme We Must Learn</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In ancient times Babylon put men in fear of danger for their lives, but modern Babylon the Great puts men in graver danger. How? Jesus said that many will be resurrected: “The hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life, those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965084/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29</a>) He tells us that even the people of such wicked cities as Sodom and Gomorrah, Tyre and Sidon, Nineveh, and the Jewish cities that did not like Jesus’ preaching, namely, Chorazin, <span id="page88" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="88" data-before-text="88"></span>Bethsaida and Capernaum, will come back for the great Judgment Day. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965084/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 10:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965084/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 11:20-24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965084/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 12:41</a>) But those who stay in Babylon the Great and refuse to come out till she is destroyed will lose even all opportunity of a resurrection, for these will go down into everlasting destruction with her.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965084/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rev. 18:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965084/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 21</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">So this Bible theme is of paramount importance to us and we must understand it and its relation to God and his kingdom that now rules, in order to preserve our own lives and in order to help our loved ones and others to gain everlasting life on earth.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>A PREVIEW OF BABYLON’S FALL</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">By understanding the theme of Babylon’s fall we can identify Babylon the Great and also understand what it means to escape before her complete desolation. In a vision given to Isaiah he not only heard about the fall of Babylon, but was actually given a preview of it and its conquerors. He said, under divine inspiration: “The pronouncement against the wilderness of the sea: Like stormwinds in the south in moving onward, from the wilderness it is coming, from a fear-inspiring land. There is a hard vision that has been told to me: The treacherous dealer is dealing treacherously, and the despoiler is despoiling. Go up, O Elam! Lay siege, O Media! All sighing due to her I have caused to cease.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965084/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isa. 21:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The “wilderness of the sea” is an expression referring to the region of ancient Babylon, for Babylon lay across the Euphrates River, the eastern half of the city being between the Euphrates and the Tigris Rivers. When the two rivers overflowed, southern Mesopotamia became a wilderness sea. In order to reduce this recurrent condition, the Babylonians built a grand series of dikes, sluices, canals and catch basins. In the Bible the word “sea” sometimes refers to the west, and here may refer to the country west of the lands of Elam and Persia—Babylonia, which would become a wilderness state.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Now Isaiah saw a terrible storm coming upon Babylon from a fear-inspiring land that lay east of Babylon. The storm began to be stirred up when Cyrus II the Persian<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965084/0">a</a> made himself also king of Media. In his proclamation to the Babylonians Cyrus calls his ancestors, Teispes, Cyrus I and Cambyses I, by the title of “King of Anshan.” This same title is given to Cyrus II himself in the cuneiform inscriptions and in the Chronicle of Nabonidus of Babylon <em>before</em> Cyrus defeated and deposed Astyages, king of Media. Anshan was a district of Elam or Susiana and lay east of the Tigris River. Jeremiah, in 617 B.C.E., foretold a defeat of the Elamites. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965084/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jer. 49:34-39</a>) It is possible that Teispes conquered the district of Anshan (or, Anzan) in 596 B.C.E., to the south of which district the Persians had earlier located themselves. Teispes assumed the title of “Great King, King of the City Anshan.” So there was close association of the Persians with the Elamites as well as the Medes.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Therefore, this symbolic storm that Isaiah saw came from a bad source for Babylon, as from a fear-inspiring wilderness in the south. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965084/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 1:19</a>.) According to Isaiah’s prophecy, Babylon would become a treacherous dealer and a despoiler, especially toward God’s people Israel. Her overthrow would naturally end the sorrow of those whom she despoiled and bring joy to them.</p>

All <span id="page596" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="596" data-before-text="596"></span>that was left for Satan to do, then, was to accuse Job’s heart condition. He was at heart materialistic; he was serving Jehovah God only for the material good that he could get out of it, argued Satan the Devil. To show up Job’s heart condition and the weakness of his integrity Satan suggested that Jehovah take away all those material possessions. Of course, Jehovah would not do that himself; but, to permit the question to be answered, he would let Satan the Devil and his crowd on earth take away such material things. Satan had no confidence in Job. God did, and he was not unwilling to prove this.</p><p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="qu">14.

He went into mourning for his children and proceeded to “bow down and say: ‘Naked I came out of my mother’s belly and naked shall I return there. Jehovah himself has given and Jehovah himself has taken away. Let the name of Jehovah continue to be blessed.’ In all this Job did not sin or ascribe unseemliness to God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 1:20-22</a>) Satan was found to be a liar.</p><p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="qu">15.

Job’s name means “object of hostility.” On earth Jesus Christ was the principal object of Satan’s hostility.

Hence he accused Job. Let it be noted that Satan did not, even as he could not, accuse Job of acting materialistically and misusing all the material goods with which Jehovah had blessed Job. No; up to that point Job had withstood the test of materialism. All <span id="page596" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="596" data-before-text="596"></span>that was left for Satan to do, then, was to accuse Job’s heart condition. He was at heart materialistic; he was serving Jehovah God only for the material good that he could get out of it, argued Satan the Devil. To show up Job’s heart condition and the weakness of his integrity Satan suggested that Jehovah take away all those material possessions. Of course, Jehovah would not do that himself; but, to permit the question to be answered, he would let Satan the Devil and his crowd on earth take away such material things. Satan had no confidence in Job. God did, and he was not unwilling to prove this.</p><p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="qu">14.

He held firm. Deprived of everything but his wife, Job now had to decide whether he would deprive himself of his God. Job refused to part with his God. He went into mourning for his children and proceeded to “bow down and say: ‘Naked I came out of my mother’s belly and naked shall I return there. Jehovah himself has given and Jehovah himself has taken away. Let the name of Jehovah continue to be blessed.’ In all this Job did not sin or ascribe unseemliness to God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 1:20-22</a>) Satan was found to be a liar.</p><p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="qu">15.

Jehovah himself did not touch Job’s vast possessions. He let the malicious Satan do the touching and thus reduce Job from being “the greatest of all the Orientals” to the poorest of them all, even bereaved of his seven sons and three daughters.

<strong>Divine Rulership—Over Mankind at the Start</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> In the case of Job, Jehovah God won out over Satan, for Satan proved to be a liar. How so? As Satan brought trials upon Job, we read, “in all this Job did not sin or ascribe anything improper to God.” When the state of Job seemed desperate and his wife gave up hope concerning him, she said to him: “Are you yet holding fast your integrity? Curse God and die!” But Job said to her: “As one of the senseless women speaks, you speak also. Shall we accept merely what is good from the true God and not accept also what is bad?” Hence the record says: “In all this Job did not sin with his lips.” Finally, before Jehovah reversed the situation for Job, he said to three hypocritical critics of Job: “My anger has grown hot against you and your two companions, for you men have not spoken concerning me what is truthful as has my servant Job.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972801/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 1:1-22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972801/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2:9, 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972801/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 42:7, 8</a>) This, in effect, proved to be a rebuke to Satan, and he was exposed as a slanderer or Devil.</p>

<strong>Have the Endurance of Job Today</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">But did Job get discouraged and quit? Did he follow his wife’s counsel, “Curse God and die”? No, he did not. He endured. And not only did he endure these things, but he held on to his integrity in spite of eight speeches made by those supposed friends of his who turned out to be his enemies, hypocrites in fact. “A true companion is loving all the time, and is a brother that is born for when there is distress.” But these three turned on Job with questions such as this: “Is not your own badness too much already, and will there <span id="page420" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="420" data-before-text="420"></span>be no end to your errors?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 2:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Prov. 17:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Job 22:5</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The record goes on to show that Jehovah God rewarded Job for his endurance, even as James notes, and, though having lived some thirty-five centuries ago, Job stands as a good example for all lovers of righteousness today; especially when these find themselves beset with similar hardship. Loss of one’s material possessions, of loved ones, of health and of friends are still the common lot of man.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 42:10-17</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">What will enable you to endure these evils without becoming resentful, bitter or discouraged? Faith in God and in his promises. Job had such faith. In spite of all his suffering he “did not sin or ascribe anything improper to God.” He kept trusting God ‘even though God would slay him.’ Faith will enable you to endure, to continue “steadfast as seeing the One who is invisible.” Besides, has not God promised that in his due time, which is now very near, all suffering, all sorrow, pain and death will end? Having faith in such promises of God will give you hope, and hope will help you to endure.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 1:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 13:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Heb. 11:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/5/3" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> Rev. 21:4</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Prayer is another great aid to endurance. Job’s words show that his attitude was one of prayer; he pleaded with God, presenting his case to him. So, should adversity come your way, you may pray to have what is needful. Is it illness you have to endure? You may pray for wisdom to cope with your affliction and strength to endure it. Is your hardship persecution? Here also you may pray, not only for strength to endure, but for your persecutors, even as Jesus commanded: “Pray for those persecuting you,” and as he himself did when saying: “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 5:44;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Luke 23:34</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Another aid to your enduring is a knowledge and understanding of God’s purposes. Job did not know why God permitted him to suffer, but we today, by reason of having the account of Job and God’s light upon it, know why God permits the righteous to suffer, namely, to prove to the Devil as well as to all creation that he can have creatures that will remain faithful to him come what may. Job kept integrity without knowing about this reason. Certainly knowledge of it should help all lovers of righteousness to endure.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 1:7-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2:2-8</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">And, above all, love will help you to endure. Love for God will help you to put up with what he permits, not rebelling or even complaining about it. Love will cause you to trust God as Job trusted him, always obeying him, for “this is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments.” And love for your neighbor will also help you to endure, to put up with him, be that neighbor a member of your own family, a member of your congregation or a fellow worker at your place of employment. If you truly love your neighbor you will also want to be setting him a good example by enduring and helping him to endure. “Love is long-suffering and kind. . . . It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 John 5:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 13:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 7</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Yes, among the many things that will aid you to endure are faith, prayer, knowledge and understanding, and love. Endurance is the course of wisdom. There is peace, comfort and an inner joy from knowing that you are enduring, bearing up under adversity because it is the right thing to do. Such endurance assures you of future reward: “He that has endured to the end is the one that will be saved.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 24:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Rom. 5:3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Endurance like Job’s in the Time of the End</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[67]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> However, Satan the Devil did not want God to have any pleasure out of Job. Hence he accused Job. Let it be noted that Satan did not, even as he could not, accuse Job of acting materialistically and misusing all the material goods with which Jehovah had blessed Job. No; up to that point Job had withstood the test of materialism. All <span id="page596" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="596" data-before-text="596"></span>that was left for Satan to do, then, was to accuse Job’s heart condition. He was at heart materialistic; he was serving Jehovah God only for the material good that he could get out of it, argued Satan the Devil. To show up Job’s heart condition and the weakness of his integrity Satan suggested that Jehovah take away all those material possessions. Of course, Jehovah would not do that himself; but, to permit the question to be answered, he would let Satan the Devil and his crowd on earth take away such material things. Satan had no confidence in Job. God did, and he was not unwilling to prove this.</p><p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="qu">14. How was Satan found to be a liar in this first part of Job’s test?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[68]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> What was the outcome of the first part of Job’s test? He held firm. Deprived of everything but his wife, Job now had to decide whether he would deprive himself of his God. Job refused to part with his God. He went into mourning for his children and proceeded to “bow down and say: ‘Naked I came out of my mother’s belly and naked shall I return there. Jehovah himself has given and Jehovah himself has taken away. Let the name of Jehovah continue to be blessed.’ In all this Job did not sin or ascribe unseemliness to God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 1:20-22</a>) Satan was found to be a liar.</p><p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="qu">15. What does Job’s name mean, and whom, principally, did he therefore foreshadow?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[69]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> In this first part of the prophetic drama of Job we can see a foreshadowing of the trial that came upon Jesus Christ nineteen centuries ago. Job’s name means “object of hostility.” On earth Jesus Christ was the principal object of Satan’s hostility. He was the promised seed of God’s woman, concerning whom Jehovah had told Satan the Devil in the garden of Eden: “I shall put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed. He will bruise you in the head and you will bruise him in the heel.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Gen. 3:15</a>) From this Satan knew that Almighty God would at least let him and his wicked seed bruise Jesus Christ “in the heel.”</p><p id="p70" data-pid="70" class="qu">16. How was Jesus Christ on earth like Job in having such material possessions and children?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[70]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Satan the Devil insulted Jesus by questioning Jesus to his face whether he was the Son of God who had laid aside heavenly glory and come to deliver mankind from Satan’s death-dealing rule. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 4:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 6</a>) By being born as a perfect human Jesus was deserving to have all that Jehovah God had bestowed upon the perfect man Adam in the garden of Eden. When Jesus was anointed with God’s spirit to be the chosen King for God’s new world Jesus held ownership to the earth and all its wealth and animals. God did not give him a human earthly wife, but did give him what was equal to children. He gave him “children” in the form of faithful disciples, loyal footstep followers, whom he could teach and take care of, just as an earthly father does his children. The prophet Isaiah had foretold these spiritual children of Jesus when he said: “Bind thou up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples. Behold, I and the children whom Jehovah hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from Jehovah of hosts, who dwelleth in mount Zion.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Isa. 8:16,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 18</a>, <em>AS;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Heb. 2:5-8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 13</a>) Twelve of such spiritual children were apostles of Jesus Christ.</p><p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="qu">17. How did Jesus, like Job, become bereft of such things, and without violating his integrity?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[71]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> As in Job’s case, Satan the Devil tried to strip Jesus forever of these things. He found he could not do it by tempting Jesus to materialism or to false worship or to the fear of men or devils. Satan did turn one of Jesus’ apostolic children to materialism. For thirty pieces of silver this traitor, Judas, betrayed Jesus into the hands of his enemies, only to commit suicide by hanging not many hours afterward. When Jesus yielded himself over to the crowd led <span id="page597" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="597" data-before-text="597"></span>by Judas the eleven other apostles got scared and fled, leaving Jesus alone to his bloodthirsty enemies. Not much later one of these eleven denied Jesus three times. Jesus was not reunited to all these eleven apostles and other disciples until after his resurrection from the dead on the third day. For the time that Jesus lay dead in another man’s tomb he was indeed bereft of everything—children and possessions—at the instance of Satan, the bruiser of his heel. But even to his dying moment on the torture stake outside Jerusalem, Jesus, like Job, “did not sin or ascribe unseemliness to God.” His lips and his heart were sinless when he said: “Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit,” and then: “It has been accomplished,” and finally expired.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Luke 23:46;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> John 19:30</a>.</p>

<strong>Approach to God</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>Sanctity of God’s Presence.</strong> Although Paul stated in Athens that God “is not far off from each one of us” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000317/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ac 17:27</a>), and his accessibility is presented throughout his Word the Bible, the one approaching Him must also meet definite requirements and have His divine permission or approval. Daniel’s vision of the majestic heavenly court of “the Ancient of Days” to whom the “son of man” “gained access” and was “brought . . . up close even before that One,” illustrates the dignity, respect, and order associated with the presence of the Sovereign Ruler of the universe.

<strong>If God Has an Organization, What Is It?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[27]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Thus the One to be feared now in this time for individual decision is the Creator, the Universal Organizer. In the book of Job we are given a glimpse into his heavenly family of angelic sons. The organizer of the worldly system of things since the deluge of Noah’s day, Satan the Devil, was once a member of that family. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981326/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 1:6, 7</a> he is pictured as an intruder into family affairs, for there we read: “Now it came to be the day when the sons of the true God entered to take their station before Jehovah, and even Satan proceeded to enter right among them. Then Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Where do you come from?’ At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘From roving about in the earth and from walking about in it.’” At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981326/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 2:1, 2</a> a similar picture is painted of a later meeting of the sons of the true God in the invisible heavens.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="qu"> 6. (a) What does such a meeting of the heavenly “sons of the true God,” presided over by Jehovah God, indicate? (b) How were those “sons of the true God” encouraged by the example furnished to them by Job?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[28]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> What do those two gatherings of the sons of Jehovah God indicate, and what would it be proper for those making up that family group to be called? What appropriate word or words come to mind? We leave it for the reader to say. Those meetings were formal ones, with the true God rightfully presiding. Satan’s being admitted to those meetings does not mean that he was still viewed as one of “the sons of the true God” and was still part of God’s heavenly household. His very designation “Satan” indicates he was not, for the name means “Opposer.” So he had no good purpose in moving about in the earth as a spirit invisible to men. He was opposed to any man who tried to keep his integrity toward the true God. With divine permission he made that righteous, God-fearing man named Job of the land of Uz the victim of his attacks. But he failed in his dastardly purpose to bring the universal sovereignty of Jehovah God into contempt before men on earth as well as angels in heaven. Job’s faithful example proved to be a great encouragement to Jehovah’s heavenly family of angelic sons.</p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Satan the Devil was permitted to continue in heaven for millenniums and on certain occasions (evidently for some specific reason) allowed to be present in an assembly of God’s sons. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974766/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 1:6, 7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974766/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 2:1</a>) But it was only because of a moral issue needing settlement that Jehovah God tolerated Satan’s presence in the heavens. As evident from the book of Job, Satan maintained that all intelligent creatures were basically selfish and would prove to be unfaithful and disloyal to God if obedience to Him no longer appeared to be a course of material or personal gain. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974766/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 2:4, 5</a>) So that this universally important issue might be settled, Jehovah God permitted Satan to attempt to prove his claim. This allowed Satan to use his influence in trying to persuade other angelic sons to assert their independence, thereby putting them to a test as to their loyalty to God.</p>

<strong>Back to John 1:1, 2</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[68]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="65"><sup>65</sup></span> The late Bishop Westcott, coproducer of the famous Westcott and Hort Greek text of the Christian Scriptures, speaks of the “true humanity of Christ” and yet he argues that Jesus Christ was not “true <span id="page600" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="600" data-before-text="600"></span>humanity” but a mixture, a so-called God-Man. However, note that the Bishop says that the omission of the definite article <em>the</em> before the Greek word <em>theós</em> makes the word <em>theós</em> like an adjective that “describes the nature of the Word” rather than identify his person. This fact accounts for it that some translators render it: “And the Word was divine.” That is not the same as saying that the Word was God and was identical with God. One grammarian would translate the passage: “And the Word was deity,” to bring out his view that the Word was not “all of God.”<a id="footnotesource5" data-fnid="5" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1962726/4">e</a> According to trinitarians the Word was only a third of God, a coequal Second Person in a three-in-one God. However, our consideration of all that John has written has proved how false such a teaching is, a teaching that even the trinitarians themselves cannot understand or explain. The Word is the Son of God, not the Second Person of God.</p><p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="qu">66, 67.

<strong>Endurance like Job’s in the Time of the End</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[76]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> However, Satan struck Job with a disease that seemed to mean certain death, so that Job himself said: “The graveyard is for me.” It also looked like a punishment from the true God in the eyes of the people of the Middle East. His own brothers kept their distance from him; his acquaintances turned aside from him, quit him; those whom he well knew forgot him as if dead; he became like a foreigner to sojourners and slaves in his own house, who refused to obey him. His breath became sickening to his wife; his body became foul-smelling to his own brothers; young men no longer paid him respect in word or conduct; intimate associates detested him, and those whom he had loved grew cold toward him. His body became wasted to the bone, and, to explain how he was still living, Job said: “I escape with the skin of my teeth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Job 17:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 19:13-20</a>) Persuaded now that Jehovah had openly renounced Job, his own wife paid him a compliment and yet said it was hopeless. “Are you yet holding fast your integrity?” she said. “Curse God and die!” Still believing in his own integrity, Job sustained this cruel blow from the wife of his love and gave her this deserved correction: “As <span id="page599" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="599" data-before-text="599"></span>one of the senseless women speaks you speak also. Shall we accept merely what is good from The [true] God and not accept also what is bad?” This reaction of Job branded Satan a slanderous liar before God, for God’s record says: “In all this Job did not sin with his lips.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Job 2:1-10</a>.</p><p id="p77" data-pid="77" class="qu">23.

Each of them can say with the apostle Paul: “I in my turn am filling up what is lacking of the tribulations of the Christ in my flesh on behalf of his body, which is the congregation”! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Col. 1:24</a>) During the years of World War I they had many spiritual associates who, like themselves, were engaged to be married to the heavenly Bridegroom in the “first resurrection” from the dead; but under the heavy persecutions that the nations heaped upon Jehovah’s witnesses with the approval of the religious leaders these associates rebelled against having to suffer with the faithful remnant. They said that God had rejected the organization of the remnant and they broke off their ties with the remnant and set up their own religious organization. This was a very painful experience for the faithful remnant, as when Job had his wife turn against him as if a God-forsaken man. But from the Scriptures this Joblike remnant pointed out the senseless course of the rebellious, self-seeking quitters, and declared they were determined to undergo the persecution that Almighty God permitted to come upon them to prove their love and devotion to Him. In the eyes of the religious sects of Christendom that joined in persecuting Jehovah’s witnesses the remnant were spiritually just as diseased and stricken of God as Job was and they abandoned these to destruction at the hands of Satan’s political governments and their military machine. But true to the prophetic drama of Job, the faithful remnant endured all this, though wondering what it all meant.</p><p id="p78" data-pid="78" class="qu">24.

In the spring of 1919 he revived them from their deathlike spiritual condition. He set them to work in proclaiming the good news about God’s kingdom that had been born in the heavens at the close of the “appointed times of the nations” in the fall of 1914. But their trials on earth were not over, as Satan’s further mistreatment of Job prophetically portrayed. An extended period of religious controversy was due, also a period of being misjudged, misrepresented and condemned, this to be offset by consoling enlightenment from God.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="ss"><strong>JOB’S THREE FALSE FRIENDS</strong></p><p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="qu">25.

Knowing this, Satan maneuvered three companions of Job’s to come together by appointment and launch a combined triple-blow assault on Job’s integrity, to ruin it if possible. Eliphaz from the land of Teman, Bildad, a descendant of Shuah, and Zophar from Naamah did not recognize the disease-wasted Job at first sight. They put on quite a scene of loud, demonstrative mourning over him. Silently they sat observing him for seven days, opening their minds to Satan’s suggestions as to what Job’s condition indicated. Job at last broke the silence by calling down evil on the day of his birth and expressing wonderment as to why God kept him alive.

In the first two debates all three men strongly stated what they thought, and Job defended himself against each one in turn. In the third debate Zophar the Naamathite failed to take part, likely thinking it was useless or having nothing further to say, being put to silence with his two companions.</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101973887/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 1:6-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101973887/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2:1-7</a>) This alone presents difficulties for any who, while professing belief in the Bible, claim that Satan is simply a personification of evil in someone. If “Satan” is only the evil in any person, the evil must have been in Jehovah God with whom Satan was speaking. But the Bible describes God as one “in whom there is no unrighteousness.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101973887/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 92:15</a>.</p>

<strong>Appointed Times of the Nations</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The symbolisms used in this prophetic vision are by no means unique. Trees are elsewhere used to represent ruling powers, including that of God’s typical kingdom at Jerusalem. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Judges 9:6-15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Ezekiel 17:1-24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/25/2" data-bid="26-3" class="b"> 31:2-18</a>.) A stump’s being caused to sprout, and the symbol of a “twig” or “sprout” are found a number of times as representing the renewal of rulership in a certain stock or line, particularly in the Messianic prophecies. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Isa. 10:33–11:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 53:2-7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/26/2" data-bid="27-3" class="b"> <span id="page96" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="96" data-before-text="96"></span>Jer. 23:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/26/3" data-bid="27-4" class="b"> Ezek. 17:22-24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/26/4" data-bid="27-5" class="b"> Zech. 6:12, 13</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Job 14:7-9</a>.) Jesus spoke of himself as both “the root and the offspring of David.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Rev. 5:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 22:16</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">The fact is evident that the key point of the vision is Jehovah God’s exercise of irresistible sovereignty in the “kingdom of mankind,” and this provides the guide to the full meaning of the vision. The tree is shown to have an application to Nebuchadnezzar, who at that point in history was the head of the dominant world power, Babylon. Yet, prior to Nebuchadnezzar’s conquest of Jerusalem, the typical kingdom of God ruling out of that city was the agency by which Jehovah expressed his rightful sovereignty toward earth. It thus constituted a divine block or impediment for Nebuchadnezzar in attaining his goal of world domination. By allowing that typical kingdom at Jerusalem to be overthrown, Jehovah permitted his own visible expression of sovereignty through the Davidic dynasty of kings to be cut down. The expression and exercise of world domination in “the kingdom of mankind,” unhindered by any representative kingdom of God, now passed into the hands of the Gentile nations. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Lam. 1:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 2:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/29/2" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> 16, 17</a>) In the light of these facts the “tree” is seen to represent, beyond and above its application to Nebuchadnezzar, world sovereignty or domination by God’s arrangement.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong><em>Renewal of world domination by divine right</em></strong></p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">God, however, here makes clear that he has not forever delivered up such world domination to the Gentile powers. The vision shows that God’s self-restraint (represented by the bands of iron and copper around the “stump” of the tree) would continue until “seven times pass over it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Dan. 4:16,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 23,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/30/2" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> 25</a>) Then, since “the Most High is Ruler in the kingdom of mankind,” God would give world domination “to the one whom he wants to.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Dan. 4:17</a>) The prophetic book of Daniel itself shows that one to be the “son of man” to whom are given “rulership and dignity and kingdom, that the peoples, national groups and languages should all serve even him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Dan. 7:13, 14</a>) Jesus’ own prophecy, in which the reference to the “appointed times of the nations” occurs, points definitely toward Christ Jesus’ exercise of such world domination as God’s chosen king, the heir of the Davidic dynasty. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Matt. 24:30, 31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/33/1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 25:31-34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/33/2" data-bid="34-3" class="b"> Luke 21:27-31,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/33/3" data-bid="34-4" class="b"> 36</a>) Thus, the symbolic “stump,” representing God’s retention of the sovereign right to exercise world domination in the “kingdom of mankind,” was due to sprout again in his Son’s kingdom.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ps. 89:27,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 35-37</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="ss"><strong>SEVEN SYMBOLIC TIMES</strong></p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">In Nebuchadnezzar’s personal experience of the vision’s fulfillment the “seven times” were evidently seven years, during which he admits that he became mad, with symptoms like those of lycanthropy, abandoning his throne to eat grass like a beast in the field. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Dan. 4:33-36</a>) Notably, the Biblical description of the exercise of world domination by the Gentile powers is presented through the figure of beasts, in opposition to the holy people of God and their “Prince of princes.” (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Daniel 7:2-8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/36/1" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/36/2" data-bid="37-3" class="b"> 17-26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/36/3" data-bid="37-4" class="b"> 8:3-12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/36/4" data-bid="37-5" class="b"> 20-25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/36/5" data-bid="37-6" class="b"> Rev. 11:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/36/6" data-bid="37-7" class="b"> 13:1-11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/36/7" data-bid="37-8" class="b"> 17:7-14</a>.) Concerning the word “times” (from Aramaic <em>ʽid·danʹ</em>), as used in Daniel’s prophecy, lexicographers show it here to mean “years.” (See <em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros</em> by Koehler and Baumgartner, p. 1106; <em>A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament</em> by Brown, Driver and Briggs, p. 1105.) The duration of a year as so used is indicated to be 360 days, inasmuch as three and a half times are shown to equal “a thousand two hundred and sixty days” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Revelation 12:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/37/1" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> 14</a>. (Compare also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Revelation 11:2, 3</a>.) “Seven times,” according to this count, would equal 2,520 days. That a specific number of days may be used in the Bible record to represent prophetically an equivalent number of years can be seen by reading the accounts at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Numbers 14:34 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/39/1" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> Ezekiel 4:6</a>. Only by applying the formula there expressed of “a day for a year” to the “seven times” of this prophecy can the vision of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Daniel chapter four</a> have significant fulfillment beyond the now extinct Nebuchadnezzar’s day, as the evidence thus far presented gives reason to expect. They therefore represent 2,520 years.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">It is a historical fact worth noting that, on the basis of the points and evidence above presented, the year 1914 was identified as the time for the close of the “appointed times of the nations” (and the end of the lease of power granted the Gentile rulers) in the March 1880 edition of the <em>Watch Tower</em> magazine. This was some thirty-four years before the arrival of that year and the momentous events it initiated. In the August 30, 1914, edition of <em>The World</em>, a leading New York newspaper at that time, a feature article in the paper’s Sunday magazine section commented on this as follows: “The terrific war outbreak in Europe has fulfilled an extraordinary prophecy. For a quarter of a century past, through preachers and through press, the ‘International Bible Students’ . . . have been proclaiming to the world that the Day of Wrath prophesied in the Bible would dawn in 1914.”</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">The events that took place from and after the fall of the year 1914 C.E. are well-known history to all, beginning with the great war that erupted, the first <em>world</em> war in mankind’s history and the first to be fought over the issue, not of the domination of Europe alone, nor of Africa, nor of Asia, but of <em>the domination of the world</em>.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Luke 21:7-33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010320/41/1" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> Rev. 11:15-18</a>; see LAST DAYS; PRESENCE.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Love as a “Bond of Union” Proves to Be “Perfect”</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> At his rebellion Satan the Devil was cast out of the universal family of Jehovah God, and later on so were his demons under his fatherhood. At the garden of Eden he presented himself to humankind as the Tempter, and he was permitted, even after that, to go to and fro throughout the earth in his campaign of wickedness and opposition to the truth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982926/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 1:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982926/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2:2</a>) But now, since the foretold “war” after the birth of God’s Kingdom in the heavens, following the end of “the appointed times of the nations” in 1914, Satan the Devil and his demons have been cast out of heaven from immediate contact with the heavenly angels and down to the earth. Never again will they gain entry into the angelic heavens. So we can well understand the rage that Satan has against Jehovah’s universal organization and the loyal members of it. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982926/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 12:1-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982926/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Luke 21:24</a>) This, therefore, is the time of all times for the loving prayer of the apostle Paul, as recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982926/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Colossians 1:2</a>, to be answered in behalf of the loyal adherents to Jehovah’s organization who are now on earth, namely: “May you have undeserved kindness and peace from God our Father.” This prayer for peace among them cannot be realized if there is no unity within their ranks. Peace calls for internal harmony inside the visible organization of the God who gives peace, yes, cohesion of the organization members to one another.</p>

<strong>If God Has an Organization, What Is It?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[27]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Thus the One to be feared now in this time for individual decision is the Creator, the Universal Organizer. In the book of Job we are given a glimpse into his heavenly family of angelic sons. The organizer of the worldly system of things since the deluge of Noah’s day, Satan the Devil, was once a member of that family. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981326/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 1:6, 7</a> he is pictured as an intruder into family affairs, for there we read: “Now it came to be the day when the sons of the true God entered to take their station before Jehovah, and even Satan proceeded to enter right among them. Then Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Where do you come from?’ At that Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘From roving about in the earth and from walking about in it.’” At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981326/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 2:1, 2</a> a similar picture is painted of a later meeting of the sons of the true God in the invisible heavens.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="qu"> 6. (a) What does such a meeting of the heavenly “sons of the true God,” presided over by Jehovah God, indicate? (b) How were those “sons of the true God” encouraged by the example furnished to them by Job?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[28]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> What do those two gatherings of the sons of Jehovah God indicate, and what would it be proper for those making up that family group to be called? What appropriate word or words come to mind? We leave it for the reader to say. Those meetings were formal ones, with the true God rightfully presiding. Satan’s being admitted to those meetings does not mean that he was still viewed as one of “the sons of the true God” and was still part of God’s heavenly household. His very designation “Satan” indicates he was not, for the name means “Opposer.” So he had no good purpose in moving about in the earth as a spirit invisible to men. He was opposed to any man who tried to keep his integrity toward the true God. With divine permission he made that righteous, God-fearing man named Job of the land of Uz the victim of his attacks. But he failed in his dastardly purpose to bring the universal sovereignty of Jehovah God into contempt before men on earth as well as angels in heaven. Job’s faithful example proved to be a great encouragement to Jehovah’s heavenly family of angelic sons.</p>

<strong>Unrest—Why So Widespread?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">We can see what the air symbolizes by going to the Bible and also by turning back to the beliefs of ancient religion. According to the ancient Babylonians, the air was the abode of evil spirits and devils. <span id="page761" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="761" data-before-text="761"></span>Of the seven evil spirits whom they feared, the first one was the South Wind, the sixth a whirlwind, and the seventh a storm (hurricane). There were also triads of devils, the demons that caused sickness seeming to form a class by themselves. But each of these devils had a name and was thought to have a monstrous form of some kind. The followers of Pythagoras believed our atmosphere to be peopled with spirits under the control of a chief who held his seat of empire in the air. Such spirits were thought to be powerful but malignant, bent on inciting men to do wickedness.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In the Bible the Greek word for “air,” in which these demon spirits were thought to dwell, is <em>aēr,</em> as in the word aeroplane. Air in motion becomes wind and as such exerts force, driving power. Like air, people breathe in the spirit of this world. So the spirit of this world exerts a force upon people that can be observed in their actions. Who is in control of this force against which God has such great indignation that he pours out the final bowl of his anger upon it? Let us look into the Bible to see.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>WHO CONTROLS THE SPIRIT OF THE WORLD</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The Bible speaks of an invisible realm in which dwell spirit persons, the angels, much more powerful than man, who are able to travel through interstellar space where there is no atmosphere such as we on earth live in and, of course, they are beyond the need of any air such as we breathe and are not under its influence or control. They are as invisible as the air and, if they exert an active force to direct the actions of men and in fact direct their lives, they can be said to have authority in the air. The Bible uses that very expression in regard to Satan the Devil, who is declared to be “the prince of the power of the air” or “the ruler of the authority of the air, the spirit that now operates in the sons of disobedience.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966923/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Eph. 2:2</a>, <em>AV, NW.</em></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">It follows that the spirit of the world, which is against God, is therefore a spirit that is controlled by Satan and is also the spirit of Satan himself, who has opposed God from the beginning of his rebellion. We do not want to deceive ourselves by underrating his powers. He is a mighty angelic creature. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966923/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 2:14</a> he is described as the one having the means to cause death. He gained this power after he induced Adam and Eve to sin in the garden of Eden and thus bring death upon all of their offspring. Since getting mankind under sin, he is able to work on their imperfection to bring about degradation on the part of some; also, he is able to use men under his influence to kill others, especially in warfare. He was given special permission, for the purpose of the test of integrity upon Job, to cause the death of Job’s ten children by a windstorm. The heavenly scene is described in the book of Job, where Satan is shown appearing before God. Since he said in reply to Jehovah’s question as to his activities that he came from roving about in the earth and from walking up and down in it, he most likely had been roving about within earth’s air or atmosphere, carrying on his activities to influence men against God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966923/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 1:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966923/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 18, 19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966923/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 2:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966923/4/3" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 6</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">As the book of Job shows, during the time allowed for settling the issue raised concerning God’s sovereignty and the related question of man’s integrity to God, Jehovah God has permitted Satan to have access to the earth to test His servants. So Satan, having a powerful organization of wicked demons, is called the ruler of the authority of the air. Sons of disobedience among mankind therefore breathe in, as it were, the spirit of Satan the Devil. It is this spirit that motivates them and <span id="page762" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="762" data-before-text="762"></span>causes them to mold their lives according to this system of things of which Satan is the god.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966923/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Eph. 2:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966923/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 4:4</a>.</p>

His own brothers kept their distance from him; his acquaintances turned aside from him, quit him; those whom he well knew forgot him as if dead; he became like a foreigner to sojourners and slaves in his own house, who refused to obey him. His breath became sickening to his wife; his body became foul-smelling to his own brothers; young men no longer paid him respect in word or conduct; intimate associates detested him, and those whom he had loved grew cold toward him. His body became wasted to the bone, and, to explain how he was still living, Job said: “I escape with the skin of my teeth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Job 17:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 19:13-20</a>) Persuaded now that Jehovah had openly renounced Job, his own wife paid him a compliment and yet said it was hopeless. “Are you yet holding fast your integrity?” she said. “Curse God and die!” Still believing in his own integrity, Job sustained this cruel blow from the wife of his love and gave her this deserved correction: “As <span id="page599" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="599" data-before-text="599"></span>one of the senseless women speaks you speak also. Shall we accept merely what is good from The [true] God and not accept also what is bad?” This reaction of Job branded Satan a slanderous liar before God, for God’s record says: “In all this Job did not sin with his lips.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Job 2:1-10</a>.</p><p id="p77" data-pid="77" class="qu">23.

Each of them can say with the apostle Paul: “I in my turn am filling up what is lacking of the tribulations of the Christ in my flesh on behalf of his body, which is the congregation”! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Col. 1:24</a>) During the years of World War I they had many spiritual associates who, like themselves, were engaged to be married to the heavenly Bridegroom in the “first resurrection” from the dead; but under the heavy persecutions that the nations heaped upon Jehovah’s witnesses with the approval of the religious leaders these associates rebelled against having to suffer with the faithful remnant. They said that God had rejected the organization of the remnant and they broke off their ties with the remnant and set up their own religious organization. This was a very painful experience for the faithful remnant, as when Job had his wife turn against him as if a God-forsaken man. But from the Scriptures this Joblike remnant pointed out the senseless course of the rebellious, self-seeking quitters, and declared they were determined to undergo the persecution that Almighty God permitted to come upon them to prove their love and devotion to Him. In the eyes of the religious sects of Christendom that joined in persecuting Jehovah’s witnesses the remnant were spiritually just as diseased and stricken of God as Job was and they abandoned these to destruction at the hands of Satan’s political governments and their military machine. But true to the prophetic drama of Job, the faithful remnant endured all this, though wondering what it all meant.</p><p id="p78" data-pid="78" class="qu">24. What had Jehovah restrained the enemy from doing to the Joblike remnant, and yet why were their trials on earth not then over?</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[78]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> World War I ended in November, 1918, but God had restrained the violent hands of Satan’s political and religious agents from taking away the soul of his faithful remnant. In the spring of 1919 he revived them from their deathlike spiritual condition. He set them to work in proclaiming the good news about God’s kingdom that had been born in the heavens at the close of the “appointed times of the nations” in the fall of 1914. But their trials on earth were not over, as Satan’s further mistreatment of Job prophetically portrayed. An extended period of religious controversy was due, also a period of being misjudged, misrepresented and condemned, this to be offset by consoling enlightenment from God.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="ss"><strong>JOB’S THREE FALSE FRIENDS</strong></p><p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="qu">25.

Knowing this, Satan maneuvered three companions of Job’s to come together by appointment and launch a combined triple-blow assault on Job’s integrity, to ruin it if possible. Eliphaz from the land of Teman, Bildad, a descendant of Shuah, and Zophar from Naamah did not recognize the disease-wasted Job at first sight. They put on quite a scene of loud, demonstrative mourning over him. Silently they sat observing him for seven days, opening their minds to Satan’s suggestions as to what Job’s condition indicated. Job at last broke the silence by calling down evil on the day of his birth and expressing wonderment as to why God kept him alive. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Job <span id="page600" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="600" data-before-text="600"></span>2:11 to 3:26</a>) This led to a series of three debates. In the first two debates all three men strongly stated what they thought, and Job defended himself against each one in turn. In the third debate Zophar the Naamathite failed to take part, likely thinking it was useless or having nothing further to say, being put to silence with his two companions.</p>

<strong>Why Has God Allowed Suffering on Earth?</strong><br/><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[76]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> The book of Job reveals that a heavenly angel of God was the promoter of the challenge. He appeared before the Most High, insolently accusing God’s devoted servant Job, saying that his loyalty to God was based solely on selfishness. God allowed this spirit son to bring a test of great adversity upon Job. Even though Job proved faithful under the test, the rebel still accused Job of having a bad heart. Jehovah said to him: “Have you set your heart upon my servant Job, that there is no one like him in the earth, a man blameless and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad? Even yet he is holding fast his integrity [blamelessness, faithfulness to God], although <span id="page55" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="55" data-before-text="55"></span>you incite me against him to swallow him up without cause.” The angel answered: “Skin in behalf of skin, and everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul.

<strong>In What Ways Can We “Become Imitators of God”?</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> It may surprise you to what extent Jesus Christ emphasized that we need to be like God. In his Sermon on the Mount he said: “You must accordingly be <em>perfect,</em> as your heavenly Father is perfect.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974166/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 5:48</a>) But can we imperfect creatures be perfect? Yes, because in the Scriptures, even as in our everyday conversation, the word “perfect” is used in a relative sense. Thus it might be said that a thing is perfect if it completely or fully serves the purpose for which it is intended. Because this is so, we find that such servants of God as Noah and Job were spoken of as being “perfect.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974166/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 6:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974166/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Job 2:3</a>, <em>Authorized Version, Leeser Version</em>) The Hebrew and Greek words here translated “perfect” have the sense of being ‘complete, fully developed, intact,’ even as the English word “perfect” also is defined as “complete, sound, flawless.”</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">3, 4.

They pleased God; they did what he rightly expected of them. Thus they were faultless, blameless, perfect in that sense.</p>

Job, a very wealthy man blessed with seven sons and three daughters, lived as a descendant of Uz to the east of the land promised to Job’s distant granduncle Abraham. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 22:20, 21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Job 1:1</a>) Being a servant of the same God, Jehovah, as Abraham worshiped, Job came to prominence some time before his distant cousin Moses became Jehovah’s prophet to the Israelites during their Egyptian captivity in the sixteenth century B.C.E. Properly, then, Jehovah could refer to his witness Job as “the greatest of all the Orientals” or “sons of the East,” saying also, “there is no one like him in the earth,” that is, then contemporaneously living. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 1:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 2:3</a>) Long before Job’s time his forerelative Abraham had made an exodus out of the religiously Babylonized territory of Ur of the Chaldeans. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gen. 11:28,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 31</a>) Behind him Abraham had left the pagan idolatry and apostate religious rituals of Babylon that had saturated Abraham’s hometown of Ur. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 15:7</a>) In fact, in later times, the terms Chaldeans and Babylonians became interchangeable. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ezek. 23:15</a>) Not only had Abraham refused to become Babylonized religiously in his youth but he also had rejected the spell of its thinking and spirit. In order not to share in Babylon’s sins and resultant plagues, Abraham had wisely come out of Babylon’s influence to settle in Canaan, the land of promise, under the direction of Jehovah, the true God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rev. 18:4</a>) Though Job, too, lived in the East where Babylonish religion dominated, he, like his distant granduncle Abraham, also refused to become Babylonized as to religious thinking. In integrity he held his heart fast in support of the Sovereign Godship of the true God, Jehovah.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>TESTING BY SATAN PERMITTED</strong></p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu"> 5.

And not only did he endure these things, but he held on to his integrity in spite of eight speeches made by those supposed friends of his who turned out to be his enemies, hypocrites in fact. “A true companion is loving all the time, and is a brother that is born for when there is distress.” But these three turned on Job with questions such as this: “Is not your own badness too much already, and will there <span id="page420" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="420" data-before-text="420"></span>be no end to your errors?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 2:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Prov. 17:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Job 22:5</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The record goes on to show that Jehovah God rewarded Job for his endurance, even as James notes, and, though having lived some thirty-five centuries ago, Job stands as a good example for all lovers of righteousness today; especially when these find themselves beset with similar hardship. Loss of one’s material possessions, of loved ones, of health and of friends are still the common lot of man.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 42:10-17</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">What will enable you to endure these evils without becoming resentful, bitter or discouraged? Faith in God and in his promises. Job had such faith. In spite of all his suffering he “did not sin or ascribe anything improper to God.” He kept trusting God ‘even though God would slay him.’ Faith will enable you to endure, to continue “steadfast as seeing the One who is invisible.” Besides, has not God promised that in his due time, which is now very near, all suffering, all sorrow, pain and death will end? Having faith in such promises of God will give you hope, and hope will help you to endure.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 1:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 13:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Heb. 11:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/5/3" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> Rev. 21:4</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Prayer is another great aid to endurance. Job’s words show that his attitude was one of prayer; he pleaded with God, presenting his case to him. So, should adversity come your way, you may pray to have what is needful. Is it illness you have to endure? You may pray for wisdom to cope with your affliction and strength to endure it. Is your hardship persecution? Here also you may pray, not only for strength to endure, but for your persecutors, even as Jesus commanded: “Pray for those persecuting you,” and as he himself did when saying: “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 5:44;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Luke 23:34</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Another aid to your enduring is a knowledge and understanding of God’s purposes. Job did not know why God permitted him to suffer, but we today, by reason of having the account of Job and God’s light upon it, know why God permits the righteous to suffer, namely, to prove to the Devil as well as to all creation that he can have creatures that will remain faithful to him come what may. Job kept integrity without knowing about this reason. Certainly knowledge of it should help all lovers of righteousness to endure.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 1:7-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2:2-8</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">And, above all, love will help you to endure. Love for God will help you to put up with what he permits, not rebelling or even complaining about it. Love will cause you to trust God as Job trusted him, always obeying him, for “this is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments.” And love for your neighbor will also help you to endure, to put up with him, be that neighbor a member of your own family, a member of your congregation or a fellow worker at your place of employment. If you truly love your neighbor you will also want to be setting him a good example by enduring and helping him to endure. “Love is long-suffering and kind. . . . It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 John 5:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 13:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 7</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Yes, among the many things that will aid you to endure are faith, prayer, knowledge and understanding, and love. Endurance is the course of wisdom. There is peace, comfort and an inner joy from knowing that you are enduring, bearing up under adversity because it is the right thing to do. Such endurance assures you of future reward: “He that has endured to the end is the one that will be saved.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 24:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Rom. 5:3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Deliverance for Integrity Toward God</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> This first couple, Adam and Eve, did not keep their integrity toward God. They spoiled their perfection by breaking his law and thus sinning. From them we were <span id="page749" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="749" data-before-text="749"></span>all born imperfect and inclined toward sin. This is what has made integrity such a problem for all of us. Sixteen hundred years before the Christian era, at the time that Egypt was becoming a world power, God watched the human family, looking for men of integrity. Over in the Middle East or the southwestern part of Asia, he saw a man of this kind. The man’s name was Job. So God said to his chief enemy, Satan the Devil: “Have you set your heart upon my servant Job, that there is no one like him in the earth, a man of integrity and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad? Even yet he is holding fast his integrity, although you incite me against him to swallow him up without cause.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 2:3</a>) Despite all that Satan the Devil did to God’s servant Job, this man kept his integrity, his blamelessness of life, his completeness of devotion, toward God. In reward God delivered Job from the persecutions of Satan the Devil. Hence Job is an encouraging example of how God can and does deliver men from the wicked god of this old world, Satan the Devil, in reward for their integrity toward their Creator, Jehovah God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jas. 5:11</a>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 5. What kind of ruler does God put in the New World government, and what picture did he give of such a chosen ruler?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Since Jehovah God has purposed to establish a government to rule his righteous new world, we should expect him to put a ruler of integrity on the throne of that New World government. He has sworn to do so. About three thousand years ago he gave us a picture of this. In the Middle East, at the crossroads between Asia and Africa, he set up a pictorial kingdom and put a man of proved integrity on its throne. A song tells about God’s choosing of this man who was once a shepherd boy, and it says: “He chose David his servant and took him from the pens of the flock. From following the females giving suck he brought him in to be a shepherd over Jacob his people and over Israel his possession. And he began to shepherd them according to the integrity of his heart, and with the skillfulness of his hands he began leading them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 78:70-72</a>) As ruler of God’s chosen nation King David always tried to keep his heart pure, loyal and faithful toward God our Creator. For this reason David was a good ruler. As such he was used to picture the One whom God makes ruler of the government of the righteous New World, God’s heavenly Son Jesus Christ.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 6, 7. (a) What did David try hard to do respecting him? (b) Why was David eager to be judged by God, and what was his determination?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> For being faithful to God, David had many enemies, men who were bad at heart, hypocritical men who loved untruth. These evildoers felt insulted because King David did not choose to keep company with them and make himself like them. Hence they tried hard to turn him from the path of blamelessness and innocence toward God, so that King David would go over to the worship of the wicked god of this old world. But David knew within himself that he was true and honest in his efforts to walk in faultlessness toward God.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> He was therefore willing to appear before God’s judgment throne and be examined as to his pure, honest intentions and his faithful efforts to worship Jehovah alone as God and to serve Him only as the Supreme Sovereign over all the universe. This eagerness to <span id="page750" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="750" data-before-text="750"></span>be judged by the divine court shows itself in these words of David: “Judge me, O Jehovah, for I myself have walked in my own integrity, and in Jehovah I have trusted, that I may not wobble. Examine me, O Jehovah, and put me to the test; refine my kidneys [or, my deepest emotions] and my heart. For your loving-kindness is in front of my eyes, and I have walked in your truth.” Regardless of what other men did, regardless of the opposition and persecution by his enemies, King David was bent on going ahead in his wholeheartedness toward Jehovah God. Prayerfully he said: “As for me, in my integrity I shall walk. O redeem me and show me favor. My own foot will certainly stand on a level place; among the congregated throngs I shall bless Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 26:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 11, 12</a>, <em>margin</em>.</p>

<strong>Endurance like Job’s in the Time of the End</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[76]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> However, Satan struck Job with a disease that seemed to mean certain death, so that Job himself said: “The graveyard is for me.” It also looked like a punishment from the true God in the eyes of the people of the Middle East. His own brothers kept their distance from him; his acquaintances turned aside from him, quit him; those whom he well knew forgot him as if dead; he became like a foreigner to sojourners and slaves in his own house, who refused to obey him. His breath became sickening to his wife; his body became foul-smelling to his own brothers; young men no longer paid him respect in word or conduct; intimate associates detested him, and those whom he had loved grew cold toward him. His body became wasted to the bone, and, to explain how he was still living, Job said: “I escape with the skin of my teeth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Job 17:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 19:13-20</a>) Persuaded now that Jehovah had openly renounced Job, his own wife paid him a compliment and yet said it was hopeless. “Are you yet holding fast your integrity?” she said. “Curse God and die!” Still believing in his own integrity, Job sustained this cruel blow from the wife of his love and gave her this deserved correction: “As <span id="page599" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="599" data-before-text="599"></span>one of the senseless women speaks you speak also. Shall we accept merely what is good from The [true] God and not accept also what is bad?” This reaction of Job branded Satan a slanderous liar before God, for God’s record says: “In all this Job did not sin with his lips.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Job 2:1-10</a>.</p><p id="p77" data-pid="77" class="qu">23. How did the remnant suffer an experience like that of Job with his wife?</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[77]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> How well this part of Job’s test of integrity prophetically dramatized what has come upon the remnant of Christ’s anointed followers! Each of them can say with the apostle Paul: “I in my turn am filling up what is lacking of the tribulations of the Christ in my flesh on behalf of his body, which is the congregation”! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Col. 1:24</a>) During the years of World War I they had many spiritual associates who, like themselves, were engaged to be married to the heavenly Bridegroom in the “first resurrection” from the dead; but under the heavy persecutions that the nations heaped upon Jehovah’s witnesses with the approval of the religious leaders these associates rebelled against having to suffer with the faithful remnant. They said that God had rejected the organization of the remnant and they broke off their ties with the remnant and set up their own religious organization. This was a very painful experience for the faithful remnant, as when Job had his wife turn against him as if a God-forsaken man. But from the Scriptures this Joblike remnant pointed out the senseless course of the rebellious, self-seeking quitters, and declared they were determined to undergo the persecution that Almighty God permitted to come upon them to prove their love and devotion to Him. In the eyes of the religious sects of Christendom that joined in persecuting Jehovah’s witnesses the remnant were spiritually just as diseased and stricken of God as Job was and they abandoned these to destruction at the hands of Satan’s political governments and their military machine. But true to the prophetic drama of Job, the faithful remnant endured all this, though wondering what it all meant.</p><p id="p78" data-pid="78" class="qu">24. What had Jehovah restrained the enemy from doing to the Joblike remnant, and yet why were their trials on earth not then over?</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[78]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> World War I ended in November, 1918, but God had restrained the violent hands of Satan’s political and religious agents from taking away the soul of his faithful remnant. In the spring of 1919 he revived them from their deathlike spiritual condition. He set them to work in proclaiming the good news about God’s kingdom that had been born in the heavens at the close of the “appointed times of the nations” in the fall of 1914. But their trials on earth were not over, as Satan’s further mistreatment of Job prophetically portrayed. An extended period of religious controversy was due, also a period of being misjudged, misrepresented and condemned, this to be offset by consoling enlightenment from God.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="ss"><strong>JOB’S THREE FALSE FRIENDS</strong></p><p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="qu">25. What course of action did Satan now maneuver three friends of Job to take, and what series of debates developed?</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[79]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"><sup>25</sup></span> Misguided friends, with misdirected persuasiveness, can prove to be a searching test of our integrity toward Jehovah God. Knowing this, Satan maneuvered three companions of Job’s to come together by appointment and launch a combined triple-blow assault on Job’s integrity, to ruin it if possible. Eliphaz from the land of Teman, Bildad, a descendant of Shuah, and Zophar from Naamah did not recognize the disease-wasted Job at first sight. They put on quite a scene of loud, demonstrative mourning over him. Silently they sat observing him for seven days, opening their minds to Satan’s suggestions as to what Job’s condition indicated. Job at last broke the silence by calling down evil on the day of his birth and expressing wonderment as to why God kept him alive. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Job <span id="page600" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="600" data-before-text="600"></span>2:11 to 3:26</a>) This led to a series of three debates. In the first two debates all three men strongly stated what they thought, and Job defended himself against each one in turn. In the third debate Zophar the Naamathite failed to take part, likely thinking it was useless or having nothing further to say, being put to silence with his two companions.</p>

<strong>Integrity</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong><em>Job.</em></strong> Job, who evidently lived in the period between the death of Joseph and the time of Moses, is described as a man who had “proved to be blameless [Heb., <em>tam</em>] and upright, and fearing God and turning aside from bad.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002182/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 1:1</a>; see <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002182/3">JOB</a>.) That human integrity forms part of the issue between Jehovah God and Satan is clear from God’s questioning his Adversary about Job when Satan appeared during an angelic assembly in the courts of heaven. Satan imputed false motive to Job’s worship of God, alleging that Job served not out of pure devotion but for selfish benefits. He thereby placed in question Job’s integrity to God. Permitted to divest Job of his vast possessions and even of his children, Satan failed to crack Job’s integrity. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002182/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Job 1:6–2:3</a>) He then claimed that Job was selfishly willing to endure the loss of possessions and children as long as he could save his own skin.

Satan’s rebellion brought God’s reputation into question. To Eve, he claimed to speak for God in telling her what “God knows,” while at the same time he cast doubt on God’s command, expressed to Adam, concerning the tree of the knowledge of good and bad.

<strong>Satan</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The Bible, in lifting the veil to give a glimpse into heavenly affairs, reveals that Satan later as a rival god appeared before Jehovah in heaven, challenging Jehovah to His face, saying that he could turn God’s servant Job, and by implication any servant of God, away from Him. He charged God, in effect, with unrighteously giving Job everything, along with full protection, so that he, Satan, could not test Job and show what was really in his heart, which, Satan intimated, was bad. He implied that Job served God primarily for selfish considerations. Satan made this point of his argument clear when he said: “Skin in behalf of skin, and everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul. For a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch as far as his bone and his flesh and see whether he will not curse you to your very face.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Job 1:6-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 2:1-7</a>; see <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/1">SOVEREIGNTY</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In this special case, Jehovah allowed Satan to bring calamity upon Job by not interfering when Satan brought about a raid from Sabean marauders as well as destruction of flocks and shepherds by what Job’s messenger called “the very fire of God” from the heavens; whether this was lightning or other fire is not stated. Satan also brought a raid by three bands of Chaldeans, as well as a windstorm. These things caused the death of all of Job’s children and destroyed his property. Finally, Satan inflicted a loathsome disease upon Job himself.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 1:13-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 2:7, 8</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">These things reveal the might and power of the spirit creature Satan, as well as his vicious, murderous attitude.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">It is important to note, however, that Satan recognized his impotence in the face of God’s express command, for he did not challenge God’s power and authority when God restricted him from taking Job’s life.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 2:6</a>.</p>

<strong>Sovereignty</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"><strong><em>God’s servants charged with selfishness.</em></strong> A further expression of the issue is found in Satan’s statement to God about his faithful servant Job. Satan said: “Is it for nothing that Job has feared God? Have not you yourself put up a hedge about him and about his house and about everything that he has all around? The work of his hands you have blessed, and his livestock itself has spread abroad in the earth. But, for a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch everything he has and see whether he will not curse you to your very face.” Again, he charged: “Skin in behalf of skin, and everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Job 1:9-11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004195/44/1" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> 2:4</a>) Satan therewith charged Job with being not in harmony with God at heart, as serving God obediently only because of selfish considerations, for gain. Satan thereby slandered God as to his sovereignty, and God’s servants as to integrity to that sovereignty. He said, in effect, that no man could be put on earth who would maintain integrity to Jehovah’s sovereignty if he, Satan, was allowed to put him to the test.</p>

<strong>Abuse Endured Results in Glory</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The reason for intense hatred of God’s true servants is that the rest of mankind is controlled by another god, Satan the Devil. The Bible tells us: “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976047/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 John 5:19</a>) In connection with God’s faithful servant Job, that “wicked one” claimed: “Everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976047/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 2:4</a>) This is really the Devil’s contention respecting all who want to serve Jehovah God. Satan maintains that none are moved by love but that all, being motivated by selfish interests, can eventually be induced to turn their backs on the Creator. Jehovah God has permitted Satan to have time to prove his claim. Persecution, including the threat of violent death, has been one of the means by which the adversary has tried to break the integrity of God’s servants.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">By remaining faithful despite persecution, God’s people have shared in proving the adversary to be a liar. Yes, their appreciating the real issue involved and their <span id="page59" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="59" data-before-text="59"></span>looking to Jehovah to strengthen them have enabled them to maintain integrity. They know that even though they may be killed, men can never prevent their being restored to life. This has aided them, with the help of God’s spirit, to act in harmony with Jesus’ words: “He that is fond of his soul destroys it, but he that hates his soul in this world will safeguard it for everlasting life.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976047/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 12:25</a>.</p>

<strong>What Protection for God’s People?</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>GOD’S DEALINGS ARE PURPOSEFUL</strong></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Whenever Jehovah God does something, it is purposeful. So it is not without good reason that Jehovah has permitted his servants to undergo bitter persecution and some even to suffer a violent death. That reason involves an issue of universal importance. Satan the Devil, in effect, claimed that none of God’s intelligent creatures served him out of love but that all were prompted by selfish considerations. He further maintained that when such selfish considerations were removed, they would quit being God’s loyal servants. With reference to Job, Satan said to God: “Skin in behalf of skin, and everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul. For a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch as far as his bone and his flesh and see whether he will not curse you to your very face.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974203/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 2:4, 5</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Time was needed to settle the issue that Satan had raised. And Jehovah God gave Satan time to try to prove his claim and also permitted him to bring pressure upon all intelligent creatures. Hence, in the course of history, there has been no kind of trial or suffering that some of God’s servants have not undergone. Often Jehovah has allowed the testing to go as far as death. Appreciating the rightness of God’s side of the issue, many have been willing to die for it. They have considered it a privilege to share in the vindication of God’s name and thereby prove the Devil’s claim to be false. The apostle Paul, who loyally served God as a disciple of Jesus Christ, said: “I am ready not only to be bound but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974203/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 21:13</a>.</p>

<strong>Does the God of Justice Care?</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The fact that Adam and Eve joined Satan in a course of disobedience raised yet another question or issue: Would all other intelligent creatures become unfaithful and disloyal to God when obedience brought no seeming gain? Satan’s claim, made centuries later regarding faithful Job, implied that​—if loss be suffered—​they would stop serving God. Satan said: “Skin in behalf of skin, and everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul. For a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch as far as his bone and his flesh and see whether he will not curse you to your very face.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973240/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 2:4, 5</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The immediate destruction of Satan would not have settled these issues that had been raised. Time was needed to prove that submission to God’s rule is righteous and in the best interests of all intelligent creation. And time was needed to prove that Satan was wrong in maintaining that all who served God did so merely for selfish reasons.</p>

Satan of the realm of the invisible next brings about tremendous adversities upon Job. Satan’s <em>hand</em> of applied power is now at work. For some time Satan had Babylonishly trained bands <span id="page524" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="524" data-before-text="524"></span>of agents on earth to become available for deeds of hostility. First, Job’s wealth begins to be slashed by Satan’s dupes, the Sabaean marauders, stealing Job’s large herd of cattle.

There being “three” bands is early evidence that Babylonish religionists were emphatically anti-Jehovah, three being a numerical symbol of emphasis.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Job 1:13-17</a>.</p><p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="qu">10, 11.

<strong>Using Life in Harmony with the Will of God</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> What do these facts mean in the case of a Christian who has suffered severe blood loss and is in need of treatment? Is there nothing that can be done? Must he simply wait to die? Not at all! Jehovah’s witnesses have no religious objections to <span id="page565" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="565" data-before-text="565"></span>any treatment that does not conflict with the law of God, and the fact is that other treatments are available. Doctors who recognize man as a creation of God, instead of a product of evolution, are usually more inclined to realize that the human body has been endowed by God with marvelous recuperative powers, and they co-operate with these instead of feeling that the prohibition on the use of blood is a barrier to recovery. Our own bodies are marvelously equipped to meet emergencies, even those occasioned by blood loss. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961684/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 139:14</a>) According to <em>The Encyclopædia Britannica:</em> “Besides the blood which actually circulates in the arteries, veins and capillaries, the body possesses reserves which can be mobilized. One such is known to be located in the spleen. On the onset of haemorrhage the spleen shrinks, squeezing blood as from a sponge into the circulation.”<a id="footnotesource4" data-fnid="4" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1961684/3">d</a> In view of this, many doctors recognize that it is much safer to co-operate with the body’s own blood-manufacturing system than to try to take the place of it by transfusing foreign blood. Even the highly respected medical publication <em>The Surgical Clinics of North America</em> (February, 1959) has said: It is not to be forgotten that, not blood transfusion, but “iron therapy is the treatment of choice for blood loss anemia.” In emergency cases, where the body’s fluid loss has been excessive, there are “plasma volume expanders” that can be used without violating God’s prohibition on blood, and, according to the testimony of many doctors, these have proved to be much safer than blood transfusions. While it is true that they cannot do for the body what one’s own blood does, yet they help to keep the remaining red cells in circulation so that oxygen will reach the various organs during the time needed by the body to replace the blood loss. So Christian patients, instead of being pressured into accepting blood on the plea that it is the only hope, seek out a doctor who has sufficient skill, patience and respect for their religious conscience to be willing to treat them without blood.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">18.

While it may produce seemingly beneficial results at the moment, it may ultimately take its toll in disease and stillborn children as a direct result of such an ill-advised course.

Job proved him a liar, and Jesus Christ outstandingly did so. On one occasion Jesus had been speaking about pursuing a course that would mean his death in the service of God. “At this Peter took him aside and commenced raising strong objections to him.” But Jesus rebuked him. “‘Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, because you think, not God’s thoughts, but those of men.’ Then Jesus said to his disciples: ‘If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake and continually follow me. For whoever wants to save his soul will lose it; but whoever loses his soul for my sake will find it.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961684/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 16:21-25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961684/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Mark 8:31-35</a>) May none of us ever <span id="page566" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="566" data-before-text="566"></span>become like Satan to our Christian brothers, urging them to sell out their confidence in God in favor of the wisdom of the world!

<strong>Preservation by Obedience to God’s Law on Blood</strong><br/><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">For those who escape death due to severe transfusion reactions, only the first <span id="page255" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="255" data-before-text="255"></span>hurdle has been passed. Disease may lie ahead. Syphilis, malaria, hepatitis and other diseases can be transmitted by blood. Not only can they be transmitted by blood, but they have been transmitted in this way, and even today cases are reported in which they are being transmitted by blood transfusions.<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1961285/2">c</a> Yes, there are tests that can be performed to determine whether the blood is safe, but the tests are not infallible, nor are those who check the results. Most blood banks do not ask donors if they have syphilis because it is an embarrassing question; if the donor knew he might lie about it; even the laboratory tests do not always register the danger. As for malaria, the possibility is considered remote in most places, so little is done to check for it. Even if a check is made, it may not be caught. And in those parts of the earth where it is a very present danger so many of the donors would have to be rejected if this were taken into account that there would not be sufficient blood; so doctors often feel that the best thing is to give the blood and then treat the malaria. Concerning serum hepatitis, transmitted in regular blood and plasma transfusions, <em>Today’s Health,</em> October, 1960, says that it “is transmitted from donors to recipients on the average of once in every 200 transfusions of whole blood. ‘No laboratory test is known which will detect donors who are carriers of the hepatitis virus,’ says John B. Alsever, M.D., medical director of the Southwest Blood Banks, Phoenix, Arizona. ‘The donor’s history cannot be relied upon to exclude carriers, partly because of possible willful concealment or poor memory, but principally because most are innocent carriers who never have had a clinically diagnosable illness.’”</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="ss"><strong>WISDOM OF OBEYING DIVINE LAW</strong></p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">These statements from medical journals make it clear that blood transfusions cannot be acclaimed as completely safe lifesaving treatments. Medical experience testifies to the fact that in forbidding man’s use of blood Almighty God, the Creator of man, the great Physician who understands the operation of man’s body as no human doctor ever will, was not only requiring obedience of man, but for those obeying that law he was providing preservation from the numerous ills that have come upon men as a direct result of the use of blood.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">Doctors may argue that the risk is worth it if there is some chance that a life can be saved. Religious leaders may join their plea, contending that the law of God does not apply where life is involved. Both are wrong. When death impends is no time to vacillate or to turn one’s back on God. It is a time to put complete confidence in the One in whose hands lies the power of life. It is a time when all other persons, whether doctors or friends or relatives, can show their sincere love for the patient and their fear of God by encouraging the patient to hold fast his faith, not to fear, but to put his trust in God Almighty.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">Faithful Christians call to mind the accusation of the Devil, who said: “Skin in behalf of skin, and everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his life.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961285/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 2:4</a>, <em>margin</em>) He contended that no one would maintain faith in God and obedience to His law if it put his life in jeopardy. But the Devil is a liar, and God-fearing Christians in all parts of the earth daily prove him so by obedience to the divine law on abstinence from blood. For their faithfulness God will preserve them, even if they die, by raising them to eternal life in his righteous new world.</p>

Shall we accept merely what is good from The [true] God and not accept also what is bad?” This reaction of Job branded Satan a slanderous liar before God, for God’s record says: “In all this Job did not sin with his lips.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Job 2:1-10</a>.</p><p id="p77" data-pid="77" class="qu">23.

Each of them can say with the apostle Paul: “I in my turn am filling up what is lacking of the tribulations of the Christ in my flesh on behalf of his body, which is the congregation”! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Col. 1:24</a>) During the years of World War I they had many spiritual associates who, like themselves, were engaged to be married to the heavenly Bridegroom in the “first resurrection” from the dead; but under the heavy persecutions that the nations heaped upon Jehovah’s witnesses with the approval of the religious leaders these associates rebelled against having to suffer with the faithful remnant. They said that God had rejected the organization of the remnant and they broke off their ties with the remnant and set up their own religious organization. This was a very painful experience for the faithful remnant, as when Job had his wife turn against him as if a God-forsaken man. But from the Scriptures this Joblike remnant pointed out the senseless course of the rebellious, self-seeking quitters, and declared they were determined to undergo the persecution that Almighty God permitted to come upon them to prove their love and devotion to Him. In the eyes of the religious sects of Christendom that joined in persecuting Jehovah’s witnesses the remnant were spiritually just as diseased and stricken of God as Job was and they abandoned these to destruction at the hands of Satan’s political governments and their military machine. But true to the prophetic drama of Job, the faithful remnant endured all this, though wondering what it all meant.</p><p id="p78" data-pid="78" class="qu">24. What had Jehovah restrained the enemy from doing to the Joblike remnant, and yet why were their trials on earth not then over?</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[78]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> World War I ended in November, 1918, but God had restrained the violent hands of Satan’s political and religious agents from taking away the soul of his faithful remnant. In the spring of 1919 he revived them from their deathlike spiritual condition. He set them to work in proclaiming the good news about God’s kingdom that had been born in the heavens at the close of the “appointed times of the nations” in the fall of 1914. But their trials on earth were not over, as Satan’s further mistreatment of Job prophetically portrayed. An extended period of religious controversy was due, also a period of being misjudged, misrepresented and condemned, this to be offset by consoling enlightenment from God.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="ss"><strong>JOB’S THREE FALSE FRIENDS</strong></p><p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="qu">25.

Knowing this, Satan maneuvered three companions of Job’s to come together by appointment and launch a combined triple-blow assault on Job’s integrity, to ruin it if possible. Eliphaz from the land of Teman, Bildad, a descendant of Shuah, and Zophar from Naamah did not recognize the disease-wasted Job at first sight. They put on quite a scene of loud, demonstrative mourning over him. Silently they sat observing him for seven days, opening their minds to Satan’s suggestions as to what Job’s condition indicated. Job at last broke the silence by calling down evil on the day of his birth and expressing wonderment as to why God kept him alive. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Job <span id="page600" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="600" data-before-text="600"></span>2:11 to 3:26</a>) This led to a series of three debates. In the first two debates all three men strongly stated what they thought, and Job defended himself against each one in turn. In the third debate Zophar the Naamathite failed to take part, likely thinking it was useless or having nothing further to say, being put to silence with his two companions.</p>

Satan further claims that God does not love us and that He will not notice our efforts to please Him. Being forewarned, we who hope in Jehovah are not fooled by Satan’s tactics.</p>

<strong>Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p77" data-pid="77"><strong><em>The supreme issue a moral one.</em></strong> It is evident that the spirit son who became Satan knew Jehovah as a God of moral standards, not as a capricious, erratic person. Had he known Jehovah as a God given to uncontrolled, violent outbursts, he could only have expected immediate, on-the-spot extermination for the course he took. The issue Satan raised in Eden, therefore, was not simply a test of Jehovah’s mightiness or power to destroy. Rather, it was a moral issue: that of God’s moral right to exercise universal sovereignty and require implicit obedience and devotion of all of his creatures in all places. Satan’s approach to Eve reveals this.

Satan made the claim that the loyalty of Job (and, by implication, of any of God’s intelligent creatures) toward Jehovah was not wholehearted, not based on true devotion and genuine love.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002391/145/0" data-bid="146-1" class="b">Job 1:6-22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002391/145/1" data-bid="146-2" class="b"> 2:1-8</a>.</p>

By saying, “Everything that <em>a man</em> has he will give in behalf of his soul,” the Devil challenged the integrity not only of Job but of any “man” who worships Jehovah.

Had he known Jehovah as a God given to uncontrolled, violent outbursts, he could only have expected immediate, on-the-spot extermination for the course he took. The issue Satan raised in Eden, therefore was not simply a test of Jehovah’s mightiness or power to destroy. Rather, it was a moral issue: that of God’s moral right to exercise universal sovereignty and require implicit obedience and devotion of all his creatures in all places. Satan’s approach to Eve, already considered, reveals this. So does the book of Job. Therein is related Jehovah’s bringing out into the open before all his assembled angelic sons the extent of the position taken by his adversary. Satan made the claim that the loyalty of Job (and, by implication, of any of God’s intelligent creatures) toward Jehovah was not wholehearted, not based on true devotion and genuine love.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/136/0" data-bid="137-1" class="b">Job 1:6-22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/136/1" data-bid="137-2" class="b"> 2:1-8</a>.</p><p id="p95" data-pid="95" class="sb">Thus, the question of integrity on the part of God’s intelligent creatures was a secondary or subsidiary issue arising out of the primary issue of God’s right to universal sovereignty. These questions would require time in order for the veracity or falsity of the charges to be demonstrated, for the heart attitude of God’s creatures to be proved, and thus for the issue to be settled beyond any doubt. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/137/0" data-bid="138-1" class="b">Job 23:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/137/1" data-bid="138-2" class="b"> 31:5, 6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/137/2" data-bid="138-3" class="b"> Ecclesiastes 8:11-13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/137/3" data-bid="138-4" class="b"> Hebrews 5:7-9</a>; see INTEGRITY; WICKEDNESS.) Jehovah thus did not execute judgment immediately upon the rebellious human pair nor upon the spirit son who raised the issue, and so the two foretold ‘seeds,’ representing opposite sides of the issue, would come into existence.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/138/0" data-bid="139-1" class="b">Gen. 3:15</a>.</p><p id="p96" data-pid="96" class="sb">That this issue still remained alive when Jesus Christ was on earth is seen from his confrontation with Satan in the wilderness after Jesus’ forty-day fast. The serpentlike tactics employed by Jehovah’s adversary in his temptation efforts toward God’s Son followed the pattern seen in Eden some four thousand years earlier, and Satan’s offer of rulership over earthly kingdoms made clear that the issue of universal sovereignty had not changed.

Such sanctification would require a cleansing of the Name of all reproach and false charges, that is, a vindicating of it. But, much more than that, it would require the honoring of that name as sacred by all intelligent creatures in heaven and earth. This, in turn, would mean their recognizing and respecting Jehovah’s sovereign position, doing so willingly, wanting to serve him, delighting to do his divine will, because of love for him. David’s prayer to Jehovah at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/142/0" data-bid="143-1" class="b">Psalm 40:5-10</a> well expresses such attitude and true sanctification of Jehovah’s name. (Note the apostle’s application of portions of this psalm to Christ Jesus at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/143/0" data-bid="144-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:5-10</a>.)</p><p id="p99" data-pid="99" class="sb">Upon the sanctification of Jehovah’s name, therefore, depend the good order, peace and well-being of all the universe and its inhabitants. God’s Son showed this, at the same time pointing out Jehovah’s means for accomplishing his purpose, when he taught his disciples to pray to God: “Let your name be sanctified. Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/144/0" data-bid="145-1" class="b">Matt. 6:9, 10</a>) This primary purpose of Jehovah provides the key for understanding the reason behind God’s actions and his dealings with his creatures as set forth in the entire Bible.</p><p id="p100" data-pid="100" class="sb">Thus, we find that the nation of Israel, whose history forms a large part of the Bible record, was selected to be a ‘name people’ for Jehovah.

<strong>Satan</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The Bible, in lifting the veil to give a glimpse into heavenly affairs, reveals that Satan later as a rival god appeared before Jehovah in heaven, challenging Jehovah to His face, saying that he could turn God’s servant Job, and by implication any servant of God, away from Him. He charged God, in effect, with unrighteously giving Job everything, along with full protection, so that he, Satan, could not test Job and show what was really in his heart, which, Satan intimated, was bad. He implied that Job served God primarily for selfish considerations. Satan made this point of his argument clear when he said: “Skin in behalf of skin, and everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul. For a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch as far as his bone and his flesh and see whether he will not curse you to your very face.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Job 1:6-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 2:1-7</a>; see <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/1">SOVEREIGNTY</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In this special case, Jehovah allowed Satan to bring calamity upon Job by not interfering when Satan brought about a raid from Sabean marauders as well as destruction of flocks and shepherds by what Job’s messenger called “the very fire of God” from the heavens; whether this was lightning or other fire is not stated. Satan also brought a raid by three bands of Chaldeans, as well as a windstorm. These things caused the death of all of Job’s children and destroyed his property. Finally, Satan inflicted a loathsome disease upon Job himself.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 1:13-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 2:7, 8</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">These things reveal the might and power of the spirit creature Satan, as well as his vicious, murderous attitude.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">It is important to note, however, that Satan recognized his impotence in the face of God’s express command, for he did not challenge God’s power and authority when God restricted him from taking Job’s life.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 2:6</a>.</p>

Satan, an enemy of Jehovah’s sovereignty, taunted Jehovah with the words: “A man will give everything that he has for his life. But, for a change, stretch out your hand and strike [Job’s] bone and flesh, and he will surely curse you to your very face.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016282/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Job 2:4, 5</a>) According to Satan, no one serves Jehovah out of unselfish love. Has Satan changed since he made that claim? Not at all! Many centuries later, when he was ousted from heaven, Satan was still called “the accuser of our brothers . . . , who accuses them day and night before our God!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016282/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Rev. 12:10</a>) Satan has not forgotten the issue of integrity.

Satan and his demonic followers are on one side, pointing to your struggles and alleging that you will buckle under the pressure and give up. On the other side are Jehovah, his reigning Son, the resurrected anointed ones, and myriads of angels. They are cheering you on, delighted by your daily endurance and support of Jehovah’s sovereignty. You can take personally Jehovah’s inspired request: “Be wise, my son, and make my heart rejoice, so that I can make a reply to him who taunts me.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016282/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Prov. 27:11</a>.</p>

<strong>Resist Satanic Propaganda</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>“Touch as far as His Bone and His Flesh”</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Satan claimed that Job would give up his faith if he were to lose his good health.

What if a personal friend of ours was attacked and injured? Would we value him less because he could no longer do as much for us as he once did? Surely not! We would still love him and care for him​—especially if he was injured trying to serve our interests. Should we expect anything less of Jehovah? “God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name,” states the Bible.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010126/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Heb. 6:10</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The Scriptures speak of “a certain needy widow” who may have supported God’s worship for many years.

<strong>An Issue That Involves You</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Next, Satan makes a sweeping claim that affects all mankind. “Skin in behalf of skin,” he says to Jehovah, “and everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul.

The Devil replied: “Skin in behalf of skin, and everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul. For a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch as far as his bone and his flesh and see whether he will not curse you to your very face.” So God said: “There he is in your hand! Only watch out for his soul itself!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994843/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Job 2:2-6</a>) Hinting that Jehovah had not yet removed all protective barriers, Satan called for the touching of Job’s bone and flesh. The Devil would not be permitted to kill Job; but Satan knew that physical disease would pain him and make it appear that he was suffering punishment from God for secret sins.</p>

<strong>What Protection for God’s People?</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>GOD’S DEALINGS ARE PURPOSEFUL</strong></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Whenever Jehovah God does something, it is purposeful. So it is not without good reason that Jehovah has permitted his servants to undergo bitter persecution and some even to suffer a violent death. That reason involves an issue of universal importance. Satan the Devil, in effect, claimed that none of God’s intelligent creatures served him out of love but that all were prompted by selfish considerations. He further maintained that when such selfish considerations were removed, they would quit being God’s loyal servants. With reference to Job, Satan said to God: “Skin in behalf of skin, and everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul. For a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch as far as his bone and his flesh and see whether he will not curse you to your very face.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974203/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 2:4, 5</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Time was needed to settle the issue that Satan had raised. And Jehovah God gave Satan time to try to prove his claim and also permitted him to bring pressure upon all intelligent creatures. Hence, in the course of history, there has been no kind of trial or suffering that some of God’s servants have not undergone. Often Jehovah has allowed the testing to go as far as death. Appreciating the rightness of God’s side of the issue, many have been willing to die for it. They have considered it a privilege to share in the vindication of God’s name and thereby prove the Devil’s claim to be false. The apostle Paul, who loyally served God as a disciple of Jesus Christ, said: “I am ready not only to be bound but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974203/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 21:13</a>.</p>

<strong>Does the God of Justice Care?</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The fact that Adam and Eve joined Satan in a course of disobedience raised yet another question or issue: Would all other intelligent creatures become unfaithful and disloyal to God when obedience brought no seeming gain? Satan’s claim, made centuries later regarding faithful Job, implied that​—if loss be suffered—​they would stop serving God. Satan said: “Skin in behalf of skin, and everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul. For a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch as far as his bone and his flesh and see whether he will not curse you to your very face.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973240/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 2:4, 5</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The immediate destruction of Satan would not have settled these issues that had been raised. Time was needed to prove that submission to God’s rule is righteous and in the best interests of all intelligent creation. And time was needed to prove that Satan was wrong in maintaining that all who served God did so merely for selfish reasons.</p>

His own brothers kept their distance from him; his acquaintances turned aside from him, quit him; those whom he well knew forgot him as if dead; he became like a foreigner to sojourners and slaves in his own house, who refused to obey him. His breath became sickening to his wife; his body became foul-smelling to his own brothers; young men no longer paid him respect in word or conduct; intimate associates detested him, and those whom he had loved grew cold toward him. His body became wasted to the bone, and, to explain how he was still living, Job said: “I escape with the skin of my teeth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Job 17:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 19:13-20</a>) Persuaded now that Jehovah had openly renounced Job, his own wife paid him a compliment and yet said it was hopeless. “Are you yet holding fast your integrity?” she said. “Curse God and die!” Still believing in his own integrity, Job sustained this cruel blow from the wife of his love and gave her this deserved correction: “As <span id="page599" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="599" data-before-text="599"></span>one of the senseless women speaks you speak also.

They said that God had rejected the organization of the remnant and they broke off their ties with the remnant and set up their own religious organization. This was a very painful experience for the faithful remnant, as when Job had his wife turn against him as if a God-forsaken man. But from the Scriptures this Joblike remnant pointed out the senseless course of the rebellious, self-seeking quitters, and declared they were determined to undergo the persecution that Almighty God permitted to come upon them to prove their love and devotion to Him. In the eyes of the religious sects of Christendom that joined in persecuting Jehovah’s witnesses the remnant were spiritually just as diseased and stricken of God as Job was and they abandoned these to destruction at the hands of Satan’s political governments and their military machine.

Eliphaz from the land of Teman, Bildad, a descendant of Shuah, and Zophar from Naamah did not recognize the disease-wasted Job at first sight. They put on quite a scene of loud, demonstrative mourning over him. Silently they sat observing him for seven days, opening their minds to Satan’s suggestions as to what Job’s condition indicated. Job at last broke the silence by calling down evil on the day of his birth and expressing wonderment as to why God kept him alive.

For a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch as far as his bone and his flesh and see whether he will not curse you to your very face.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101979008/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 2:4, 5</a>) By faithful endurance under suffering, we share in proving Satan’s contention to be a lie and share in vindicating the good name of our heavenly Father, who trusts his loyal servants. What if Jehovah were to allow Satan, by means of his agents, to subject true Christians to very cruel <span id="page118" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="118" data-before-text="118"></span>treatment that ended in death or crippling infirmity? What if some were even sexually assaulted or abused in other vile ways? These things are shocking. Yet there is nothing beyond the power of our heavenly Father to rectify fully in his due time. So, in some cases, he may see fit to let the trial be pushed to such an extreme point. Through faithfulness, even to the point of death, God’s servants are thus given the opportunity to show beyond denial the genuineness of their devotion.</p>

He could easily, and rightfully, have destroyed Satan and Adam and Eve at the time of the rebellion in Eden. That would have demonstrated Jehovah’s sovereign power. But would it have answered the questions now raised in the minds of all God’s creatures who had observed these developments? The eternal peace and security <span id="page54" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="54" data-before-text="54"></span>of the universe required that these questions be settled completely, once and for all time. Besides that, the integrity and loyalty of all God’s intelligent creation had been called into question. If they truly loved him, they would want to answer that false charge themselves. Jehovah determined to afford them opportunity to do just that and to show their real heart attitude toward his sovereign rule. Also, by allowing Adam and Eve to bring forth offspring (though imperfect), God would prevent the extinction of the human family as yet unborn​—a family that has come to include all of us living today. This would give these descendants the opportunity to choose for themselves whether they would obey divine rulership. That choice is what now confronts you!</p>

As the encyclopedia article on standards, mentioned earlier, observes regarding the material creation: “Yet with this overwhelming evidence of standards none charges nature with monotony. Although a narrow band of spectral wave lengths forms the foundation, the available variations and combinations of colour to delight the eye of the observer are virtually without limit. Similarly, all of the artistry of music comes to the ear through another small group of frequencies.” (<em>The Encyclopædia Britannica,</em> 1959 ed., Vol. 21, p. 307) Likewise, God’s requirements for the human pair allowed them all the freedom that a righteous heart could desire. There was no need to hem them in with a multitude of laws and regulations. The loving example set for them by their Creator and their respect and love for him would protect them from exceeding the proper bounds of their freedom.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/124/0" data-bid="125-1" class="b">1 Timothy 1:9, 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/124/1" data-bid="125-2" class="b"> Rom. 6:15-18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/124/2" data-bid="125-3" class="b"> 13:8-10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/124/3" data-bid="125-4" class="b"> 2 Cor. 3:17</a>.</p><p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="sb">Jehovah God, therefore, by his very Person, his ways and words, was and is the Supreme Standard for all the universe, the definition and the sum of all goodness.

Satan’s rebellion brought God’s name and reputation into question. To Eve, he claimed to speak for God in telling her what “God knows,” while at the same time casting doubt on God’s command, expressed to Adam, concerning the tree of the knowledge of good and bad.

Rather, it was a moral issue: that of God’s moral right to exercise universal sovereignty and require implicit obedience and devotion of all his creatures in all places. Satan’s approach to Eve, already considered, reveals this. So does the book of Job. Therein is related Jehovah’s bringing out into the open before all his assembled angelic sons the extent of the position taken by his adversary. Satan made the claim that the loyalty of Job (and, by implication, of any of God’s intelligent creatures) toward Jehovah was not wholehearted, not based on true devotion and genuine love.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/136/0" data-bid="137-1" class="b">Job 1:6-22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/136/1" data-bid="137-2" class="b"> 2:1-8</a>.</p><p id="p95" data-pid="95" class="sb">Thus, the question of integrity on the part of God’s intelligent creatures was a secondary or subsidiary issue arising out of the primary issue of God’s right to universal sovereignty. These questions would require time in order for the veracity or falsity of the charges to be demonstrated, for the heart attitude of God’s creatures to be proved, and thus for the issue to be settled beyond any doubt. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/137/0" data-bid="138-1" class="b">Job 23:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/137/1" data-bid="138-2" class="b"> 31:5, 6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/137/2" data-bid="138-3" class="b"> Ecclesiastes 8:11-13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/137/3" data-bid="138-4" class="b"> Hebrews 5:7-9</a>; see INTEGRITY; WICKEDNESS.) Jehovah thus did not execute judgment immediately upon the rebellious human pair nor upon the spirit son who raised the issue, and so the two foretold ‘seeds,’ representing opposite sides of the issue, would come into existence.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/138/0" data-bid="139-1" class="b">Gen. 3:15</a>.</p><p id="p96" data-pid="96" class="sb">That this issue still remained alive when Jesus Christ was on earth is seen from his confrontation with Satan in the wilderness after Jesus’ forty-day fast. The serpentlike tactics employed by Jehovah’s adversary in his temptation efforts toward God’s Son followed the pattern seen in Eden some four thousand years earlier, and Satan’s offer of rulership over earthly kingdoms made clear that the issue of universal sovereignty had not changed.

Such sanctification would require a cleansing of the Name of all reproach and false charges, that is, a vindicating of it. But, much more than that, it would require the honoring of that name as sacred by all intelligent creatures in heaven and earth. This, in turn, would mean their recognizing and respecting Jehovah’s sovereign position, doing so willingly, wanting to serve him, delighting to do his divine will, because of love for him. David’s prayer to Jehovah at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/142/0" data-bid="143-1" class="b">Psalm 40:5-10</a> well expresses such attitude and true sanctification of Jehovah’s name. (Note the apostle’s application of portions of this psalm to Christ Jesus at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012337/143/0" data-bid="144-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:5-10</a>.)</p><p id="p99" data-pid="99" class="sb">Upon the sanctification of Jehovah’s name, therefore, depend the good order, peace and well-being of all the universe and its inhabitants.

<strong>Satan</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The Bible, in lifting the veil to give a glimpse into heavenly affairs, reveals that Satan later as a rival god appeared before Jehovah in heaven, challenging Jehovah to His face, saying that he could turn God’s servant Job, and by implication any servant of God, away from Him. He charged God, in effect, with unrighteously giving Job everything, along with full protection, so that he, Satan, could not test Job and show what was really in his heart, which, Satan intimated, was bad. He implied that Job served God primarily for selfish considerations. Satan made this point of his argument clear when he said: “Skin in behalf of skin, and everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his soul. For a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch as far as his bone and his flesh and see whether he will not curse you to your very face.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Job 1:6-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 2:1-7</a>; see <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/1">SOVEREIGNTY</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In this special case, Jehovah allowed Satan to bring calamity upon Job by not interfering when Satan brought about a raid from Sabean marauders as well as destruction of flocks and shepherds by what Job’s messenger called “the very fire of God” from the heavens; whether this was lightning or other fire is not stated. Satan also brought a raid by three bands of Chaldeans, as well as a windstorm. These things caused the death of all of Job’s children and destroyed his property. Finally, Satan inflicted a loathsome disease upon Job himself.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 1:13-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 2:7, 8</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">These things reveal the might and power of the spirit creature Satan, as well as his vicious, murderous attitude.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">It is important to note, however, that Satan recognized his impotence in the face of God’s express command, for he did not challenge God’s power and authority when God restricted him from taking Job’s life.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003845/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 2:6</a>.</p>

<strong>Subjection to “Superior Authorities”—Why?</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[69]" class="sb"><span id="page686" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="686" data-before-text="686"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Of course, all this has been only by God’s permission, and it has resulted in the political governments and rulerships that exist today. However, Satan the Devil is not a visible, earthly authority to whom Christians are commanded to subject themselves. When Christians subject themselves to existing visible, earthly, human governments or “superior authorities,” they are not subjecting themselves to Satan the Devil, the Dragon. They are obeying God’s command.</p><p id="p70" data-pid="70" class="qu">18, 19. (a) Because of what declaration of purpose has God held back from destroying Satan? (b) What did God have to prove regarding the promised “seed”?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[70]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> From before the flood of Noah’s day till now Satan the Dragon has exercised power and authority only by God’s permission. God has held back from destroying Satan only because of what God said to Satan in the garden of Eden after Adam and Eve had sinned. God said: “I shall put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed. He will bruise you in the head and you will bruise him in the heel.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962842/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Gen. 3:15</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[70]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> Time and freedom of action had to be permitted the Devil in order to settle the newly arisen issue: Who holds the universal sovereignty, Jehovah God or Satan the Devil? Also, since the Seed or Offspring of God’s “woman” was put into the issue, God had to prove this point: In spite of the fall of the first perfect man into sin under pressure by Satan the Devil, Jehovah God is able to put on earth in the midst of the Devil’s world a Seed or Offspring that will remain faithful to God. The subjecting of this Seed to earthly “superior authorities” would not lead this Seed or Offspring to be disloyal to God or break integrity toward God.</p><p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="qu">20. What was illustrated in the case of Job of the land of Uz, and what was foreshadowed through him?</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[71]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> God’s allowance of Satan to use his power against godly men of integrity is illustrated in the case of patient Job of the land of Uz. Under challenge by Satan the Devil, Jehovah God said to him regarding faithful Job: “Look! Everything that he has is in your hand. Only against him himself do not thrust out your hand!” When the unsuccessful Satan challenged God on a second occasion, God said regarding Job: “There he is in your hand! Only watch out for his soul itself!” Job proved Satan the Devil a liar again. This foreshadowed how Satan would completely fail when he would be allowed to use his powers against the Seed or Offspring of God’s “woman.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962842/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Job 1:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962842/42/1" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 2:6</a>.</p><p id="p72" data-pid="72" class="qu">21, 22. (a) Hence how has it been that “superior authorities” have been able to exercise authority? (b) How did Jesus make this point clear to the Roman governor?</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[72]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> As in Satan’s case, so in the case of the visible, human “superior authorities.” These could exercise no authority except by God’s permission because of the issue that is involved. Accordingly, when the Chief One of the Seed of God’s “woman,” namely, Jesus Christ, stood before the earthly superior authority in Judea, the Roman Governor Pontius Pilate, Jesus said something very enlightening. Jesus was then on trial for his human life.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[72]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> When Jesus refused to tell the Roman governor about his heavenly origin, “Pilate said to him: ‘Are you not speaking to me? Do you not know I have authority to release you and I have authority to impale you?’ Jesus answered him: ‘You would have no authority at all against me unless it had been granted to you from above.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962842/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">John 19:9-11</a>) Only by grant from God was Pilate able to exercise his earthly authority against Jesus to put him to death.</p><p id="p73" data-pid="73" class="qu">23. What, then, is true in the case of action against the other members of the woman’s seed, and how at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962842/68/0" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Romans 13:1</a> does <em>An American Translation</em> agree with this?</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[73]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> The same thing is true with regard to all other political “superior authorities” when they proceed against the other faithful members of the seed or offspring of <span id="page687" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="687" data-before-text="687"></span>God’s “woman,” when, for example, they proceed against the “remaining ones of her seed” in our days.

<strong>Endurance like Job’s in the Time of the End</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[76]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> However, Satan struck Job with a disease that seemed to mean certain death, so that Job himself said: “The graveyard is for me.” It also looked like a punishment from the true God in the eyes of the people of the Middle East. His own brothers kept their distance from him; his acquaintances turned aside from him, quit him; those whom he well knew forgot him as if dead; he became like a foreigner to sojourners and slaves in his own house, who refused to obey him. His breath became sickening to his wife; his body became foul-smelling to his own brothers; young men no longer paid him respect in word or conduct; intimate associates detested him, and those whom he had loved grew cold toward him. His body became wasted to the bone, and, to explain how he was still living, Job said: “I escape with the skin of my teeth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Job 17:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 19:13-20</a>) Persuaded now that Jehovah had openly renounced Job, his own wife paid him a compliment and yet said it was hopeless. “Are you yet holding fast your integrity?” she said. “Curse God and die!” Still believing in his own integrity, Job sustained this cruel blow from the wife of his love and gave her this deserved correction: “As <span id="page599" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="599" data-before-text="599"></span>one of the senseless women speaks you speak also. Shall we accept merely what is good from The [true] God and not accept also what is bad?” This reaction of Job branded Satan a slanderous liar before God, for God’s record says: “In all this Job did not sin with his lips.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Job 2:1-10</a>.</p><p id="p77" data-pid="77" class="qu">23. How did the remnant suffer an experience like that of Job with his wife?</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[77]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> How well this part of Job’s test of integrity prophetically dramatized what has come upon the remnant of Christ’s anointed followers! Each of them can say with the apostle Paul: “I in my turn am filling up what is lacking of the tribulations of the Christ in my flesh on behalf of his body, which is the congregation”! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Col. 1:24</a>) During the years of World War I they had many spiritual associates who, like themselves, were engaged to be married to the heavenly Bridegroom in the “first resurrection” from the dead; but under the heavy persecutions that the nations heaped upon Jehovah’s witnesses with the approval of the religious leaders these associates rebelled against having to suffer with the faithful remnant. They said that God had rejected the organization of the remnant and they broke off their ties with the remnant and set up their own religious organization. This was a very painful experience for the faithful remnant, as when Job had his wife turn against him as if a God-forsaken man. But from the Scriptures this Joblike remnant pointed out the senseless course of the rebellious, self-seeking quitters, and declared they were determined to undergo the persecution that Almighty God permitted to come upon them to prove their love and devotion to Him. In the eyes of the religious sects of Christendom that joined in persecuting Jehovah’s witnesses the remnant were spiritually just as diseased and stricken of God as Job was and they abandoned these to destruction at the hands of Satan’s political governments and their military machine. But true to the prophetic drama of Job, the faithful remnant endured all this, though wondering what it all meant.</p><p id="p78" data-pid="78" class="qu">24. What had Jehovah restrained the enemy from doing to the Joblike remnant, and yet why were their trials on earth not then over?</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[78]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> World War I ended in November, 1918, but God had restrained the violent hands of Satan’s political and religious agents from taking away the soul of his faithful remnant. In the spring of 1919 he revived them from their deathlike spiritual condition. He set them to work in proclaiming the good news about God’s kingdom that had been born in the heavens at the close of the “appointed times of the nations” in the fall of 1914. But their trials on earth were not over, as Satan’s further mistreatment of Job prophetically portrayed. An extended period of religious controversy was due, also a period of being misjudged, misrepresented and condemned, this to be offset by consoling enlightenment from God.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="ss"><strong>JOB’S THREE FALSE FRIENDS</strong></p><p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="qu">25. What course of action did Satan now maneuver three friends of Job to take, and what series of debates developed?</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[79]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"><sup>25</sup></span> Misguided friends, with misdirected persuasiveness, can prove to be a searching test of our integrity toward Jehovah God. Knowing this, Satan maneuvered three companions of Job’s to come together by appointment and launch a combined triple-blow assault on Job’s integrity, to ruin it if possible. Eliphaz from the land of Teman, Bildad, a descendant of Shuah, and Zophar from Naamah did not recognize the disease-wasted Job at first sight. They put on quite a scene of loud, demonstrative mourning over him. Silently they sat observing him for seven days, opening their minds to Satan’s suggestions as to what Job’s condition indicated. Job at last broke the silence by calling down evil on the day of his birth and expressing wonderment as to why God kept him alive. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Job <span id="page600" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="600" data-before-text="600"></span>2:11 to 3:26</a>) This led to a series of three debates. In the first two debates all three men strongly stated what they thought, and Job defended himself against each one in turn. In the third debate Zophar the Naamathite failed to take part, likely thinking it was useless or having nothing further to say, being put to silence with his two companions.</p>

These angels, having left God’s service, came under the control of Satan. Hence Satan is called “the ruler of the demons.” In one instance, when Jesus expelled demons from a man, the Pharisees accused him of doing so by the power of “Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons.” That they had reference to Satan is shown by Jesus’ answer, in which he said: “If Satan expels Satan, he has become divided against himself.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013757/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matt. 12:22-27</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The apostle Paul associates Satan with “the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places,” and speaks of them as “the world rulers of this darkness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013757/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Eph. 6:11, 12</a>) As a governing force in the invisible realm immediately about the earth, he is “the ruler of the authority of the air.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013757/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Eph. 2:2</a>) In Revelation he is shown to be the one “misleading the entire inhabited earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013757/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Rev. 12:9</a>) The apostle John said that “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013757/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 John 5:19</a>) He is therefore “the ruler of this world.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013757/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">John 12:31</a>) That is why James wrote that “the friendship with the world is enmity with God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013757/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Jas. 4:4</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>HIS FIGHT TO DESTROY THE “SEED”</strong></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Satan made early efforts to block the promise of the “seed” to come through Abraham.

A high point in Satan’s ambitious attempts in his fight against God, and what appeared to Satan to be success, was reached when the king of the Third World Power of Bible history, Babylon, took Jerusalem, overturning the rulership of King Zedekiah of the line of David, and destroyed the temple of Jehovah, desolating Jerusalem and Judah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013757/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ezek. 21:25-27</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">As an instrument of Satan, the ruling dynasty of Babylon, initially headed by Nebuchadnezzar, and which held Israel in exile for sixty-eight years (until Babylon’s overthrow) with the intention of never releasing its captives, reflected Satan’s own boastful, ambitious attempts as a rival god opposed to the Universal Sovereign Jehovah. The Babylonian kings, worshiping their idol god Marduk, goddess Ishtar and a host of others, were actually worshipers of the demons and, as part of the world alienated from Jehovah, were under Satan’s domination.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013757/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ps. 96:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013757/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 10:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013757/27/2" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> Eph. 2:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013757/27/3" data-bid="28-4" class="b"> Col. 1:21</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Satan fired the king of Babylon with the ambition to have complete domination over the earth, even over “Jehovah’s throne” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013757/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:23</a>) and the “stars of God,” the kings of the line of David sitting on the throne at Mount Moriah (by extension, Zion). This “king,” that is, the dynasty of Babylon, ‘lifted himself up’ in his own heart and was in his own eyes and in the eyes of his admirers a “shining one,” a “son of the dawn.” (In some translations the Latin <em>Vulgate</em> term “Lucifer” is retained. It is, however, merely the translation of the Hebrew word <em>heh·lelʹ,</em> “shining one.” <em>Heh·lelʹ</em> is therefore not a name or a title, but, rather, a term describing the boastful position taken by Babylon’s dynasty of kings of the line of Nebuchadnezzar.)

Again, Jehovah came to the salvation of his people by restoring them to their land, until the real Seed of promise should come.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013757/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ezra 1:1-6</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong><em>Efforts to cause Jesus to stumble</em></strong></p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Satan, no doubt identifying Jesus as the Son of God and the one who was prophesied to bruise him in the head (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013757/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Gen. 3:15</a>), did everything he could to destroy Jesus. But, when announcing the conception of Jesus to Mary, the angel Gabriel told her: “Holy spirit will come upon you, and power of the Most High will overshadow you. For that reason also what is born will be called holy, God’s Son.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013757/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Luke 1:35</a>) The efforts to destroy Jesus when an infant were unsuccessful.

After his baptism, Jesus was encountered by Satan in the wilderness, where Satan approached him with three different strong temptations, thoroughly testing him on the issue of devotion to Jehovah. In one of Satan’s appeals he showed Jesus all the kingdoms of the world, claiming them to be his (Satan’s). Jesus did not contradict this claim. Nonetheless, Jesus refused to contemplate even for the briefest instant of time any “shortcut” to kingship, nor did he consider for an instant the doing of anything merely to please himself. His immediate reply to Satan was “Go away, Satan! For it is written, ‘It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.’” At this, “the Devil retired from him until another convenient time.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013757/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Matt. 4:1-11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013757/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> Luke 4:13</a>) This illustrates the truth of James’ words later written: “Oppose the Devil, and he will flee from you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013757/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Jas. 4:7</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Jesus was ever alert to the danger of Satan’s machinations and to the fact that Satan desired to cause his destruction by getting him to entertain a thought contrary to Jehovah’s will. This was demonstrated when Peter, on one occasion, though with good intentions, was actually throwing temptation in his way. Jesus had spoken of the suffering and death he was to undergo. “At this Peter took him aside and commenced raising strong objections to him, saying: ‘Be kind to yourself, Lord; you will not have this destiny at all.’ But, turning his back, he said to Peter: ‘Get behind me, <em>Satan!</em> You are a stumbling block to me, because you think, not God’s thoughts, but those of men.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013757/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Matt. 16:21-23</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Throughout Jesus’ ministry he was in danger, Satan using human agents to oppose and to try either to cause him to stumble or to kill him. At one time the people were about to seize Jesus to make him <span id="page1452" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1452" data-before-text="1452"></span>king. But he would not consider such a thing before God’s due time. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013757/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">John 6:15</a>) On another occasion those of his own hometown attempted to kill him.

Satan was thoroughly proved to be a liar and failed in his challenge of God’s sovereignty and the integrity of God’s servants. As Jesus said, shortly before his death: “Now there is a judging of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013757/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">John 12:31</a>) Satan had a grip on all mankind through sin. But after celebrating his last Passover with his disciples, Jesus, knowing that Satan would soon bring about his death, could say: “The ruler of the world is coming. And <em>he has no hold on me.”—</em><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013757/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">John 14:30</a>.</p>

In its conclusion it called upon “all lovers of life and happiness under a righteous government to whose attention this Resolution may come, to take to heart its import and to honor the name of the Creator of heaven and earth and to turn to His kingdom by Christ as the rightful government of the new world.” This Resolution had a circulation of 70,000,000 copies in fifty languages of the world. This plaguing message continues upon antitypical Egypt to the present time, calling on the people to heed the command of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965482/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Revelation 18:4</a>: “Get out of her [Babylon the Great], my people, if you do not want to share with her in her sins, and if you do not want to receive part of her plagues.” Not that Babylon the Great and symbolic Egypt of today are the same thing; rather, Babylon the Great is the religious part of symbolic Egypt, Satan’s visible organization. So by fleeing from modern Babylon the Great, or dying as to giving it support, one is figuratively dying as far as giving his support to modern “Egypt” is concerned just like the domestic animals of ancient Egypt.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Each annual report of Jehovah’s witnesses, as it is published in each January 1 issue of <em>The Watchtower</em> and in the <em>Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses</em> in several languages now, tells of the extent of this plague.

During the 1963 service year the number was 62,798, and during 1964 the number was 68,236.

And the magic-practicing priests were unable to stand before Moses as a result of the boils, because the boils had developed on the magic-practicing priests and on all the Egyptians.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965482/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ex. 9:7-11</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> This plague disgraced Imhotep, the Egyptian god of medicine, for none of the Egyptian physicians were able to cure it. In particular did it bring low the magic-practicing priests of Egypt. Previously they had appeared to imitate the first two plagues that Moses brought on, and the third plague, that of gnats, they had to admit was by the “finger of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965482/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ex. 8:1-19</a>) But the sixth plague really disgraced them to the extent of their being unable to appear before Pharaoh. Some Bible commentators hold that this plague was the black leprosy or botch of Egypt, known as elephantiasis, the disease that most likely afflicted Job some years before this. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965482/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Job 2:6-12</a>) Be that as it may, it was a skin disease marked with boils, swellings, ulcers and skin eruptions and without a doubt was extremely painful, as can be gathered from its effect on Egypt’s priests.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">14-16.

The book entitled “‘Babylon the Great Has Fallen!’ God’s Kingdom Rules!” shows that this plague began in 1919, when the failure of the League of Nations was foretold. It was in the year 1919 that <em>The Watchtower</em> for the first time identified the symbolic sea beast of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965482/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Revelation chapter 13</a> as Satan’s visible political organization rather than an ecclesiastical system, and the idolized “image” of the beast as the League of Nations. This plague, even as the other plagues, might be said to have two aspects in modern times. One aspect is the use of the Bible to show the way the modern “Egyptians,” the worshipers of the “image” of the beast, appear in the eyes of Jehovah, and the other is the pain that this exposé gave them. Since Egypt stands for Satan’s entire visible organization, this plague affects the religious leaders and guides of both Christendom and pagandom.</p>

<strong>Maintaining Personal Integrity</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> Now let us look further into this perfect law and see that, when we do something wrong, we just cannot always say, ‘It is due to the weakness of the flesh,’ and try to justify our wrong. Paul, in writing to the Corinthians, says: “No temptation has taken you except what is common <span id="page370" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="370" data-before-text="370"></span>to men. But God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear, but along with the temptation he will also make the way out in order for you to be able to endure it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:13</a>) The way out is not the way we think but the way Jehovah God provides. According to Paul, Jehovah is sure to help us so we can keep our uprightness of deportment before him and his people.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">14, 15. (a) How does Jehovah’s theocratic organization help us maintain integrity? (b) Whose conduct can we faithfully imitate?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Another provision that God has supplied in maintaining integrity is his theocratic organization, a wholly devoted, clean, pure organization that gives us personal guidance so that we can maintain our faithful course. In this organization Jehovah has provided mature, properly trained, faithful overseers in every Christian congregation that are willing to help with any problem that we may have that interferes with our worship of God. They are ever ready to offer counsel from the Scriptures on how we should walk and the way we should talk so as to be identified as Jehovah’s integrity-keepers. Let us note what our relationship to these theocratically appointed overseers should be as set forth in Hebrews: “Remember those who are taking the lead among you, who have spoken the word of God to you, and as you contemplate how their conduct turns out imitate their faith.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Heb. 13:7</a>) Overseers must walk circumspectly before God, because Jehovah holds them responsible too. Of him that has much, more will be required.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Luke 12:48</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> We have many examples of men and women who maintained their integrity when put to the test. In their lives we can see illustrated examples of wholeheartedness to Jehovah God. We recognize that a pupil learns faster by having what he hears demonstrated, and that was the way that Christ Jesus taught his apostles and disciples. So if we watch the conduct of our overseers in the organization, then it will help us to maintain our uprightness.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Hebrews chap. 11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Matt. 11:1</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>EXAMPLES ANCIENT AND MODERN</strong></p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">16.

Satan tried to destroy Job’s integrity. Job lost first his material possessions, then his family whom he dearly loved. Finally he was plagued with disease and sickness. But in spite of Job’s losses and the wrong influence brought to bear against him, he endured it and proved Satan the Devil a liar. Job’s attitude was: “Until I expire I shall not take away my integrity from myself!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 27:5</a>) So God blessed him.

Do not underrate the Devil. He knows our weakest spot. He knows what may shake our faith. For some it may be the loss of material things, which would cause them to work harder to make more money to regain what they had before or to get as much as someone else. He may strike through loved ones, turning them against you because of your love for Jehovah God. If because of our love for Jehovah we lose the love of those dear to us, it should not affect our pure worship to Jehovah God. It should simply deepen our appreciation of the wonderful promise from God to provide a hundredfold. Jesus said: “Truly I say to you men, No one has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the sake of the good news who will not get a hundredfold.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Mark 10:29, 30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Matt. 10:37</a>.</p>

<strong>Euthanasia and God’s Law</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><span id="page118" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="118" data-before-text="118"></span>Yes, God’s Word plainly tells that human life is sacred and that he who takes a human life must forfeit his own: “Anyone shedding a man’s blood, by man will his own blood be shed, for in God’s image he made man.” This law was repeatedly stated to the nation of Israel by Moses and others of the prophets, as well as to the followers of Jesus Christ by himself and his apostles.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961124/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 9:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961124/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Ex. 20:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961124/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Num. 35:30-32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961124/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> Matt. 19:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961124/3/4" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> 1 John 3:15</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">But does not God’s Word show that Jehovah is merciful and compassionate, and does he not require the same qualities in us? All very true, yet he has seen fit to let suffering continue for some six thousand years now. Not only that, but he, the Almighty and the Most High, has suffered more than anyone else during all this time. His principle is that his laws come ahead of suffering, even as in blood transfusion God’s law takes precedence over the life of a creature. Suffering in itself is not life’s greatest evil and may not be used as an excuse for breaking God’s law regarding the sanctity of life.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">In particular does the vindication of God’s name take precedence over suffering. If faithfully endured, suffering contributes to the vindication of Jehovah’s name, proving that men will remain true to God in spite of what they must endure. Consider Job. He suffered greatly from a very loathsome disease as well as from many misfortunes. And of Jesus we read that “he learned obedience from the things he suffered.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961124/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 2:4-10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961124/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Heb. 5:8</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Appreciating these facts helps one to endure suffering. Then, too, Christians have the comfort of God’s Word, the sustaining power of his spirit and the precious privilege of prayer. Nor can it be denied that one of the biggest factors in suffering is one’s mental attitude toward it. Rebellion may make the suffering unbearable, whereas submissiveness may enable one to rejoice in it, as did the apostles at being permitted to suffer for Christ’s sake.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961124/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 5:40, 41</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">There are also other, though lesser, considerations. At times a condition that seems hopeless takes a turn for the better for apparently no reason whatever. And, too, who knows what diseases that are considered incurable today may become curable tomorrow? Certainly more is constantly being done to relieve suffering.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">All this, however, does not mean that where a person is suffering greatly from a disease and death is only a matter of time the physician must continue to take extraordinary, complicated, distressing and costly measures to keep the patient alive. There is a great difference between extending the life of a patient and stretching out the dying process. In such cases it would not be violating God’s law regarding the sanctity of life to mercifully let the dying process take its due course. The medical profession generally acts in harmony with this principle.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">So we can see that in view of God’s law regarding the sanctity of life and Scriptural precedent, life may not be taken or surrendered simply because of suffering, as recommended by many well-meaning persons. But at the same time, God’s law does not require that extreme measures be taken that would merely make the ebbing away of life more drawn out and costly. Thus both God’s just principles and his loving mercy are acknowledged; his law regarding the sanctity of life is upheld, and yet compassion is shown.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sd">Instruct me, O Jehovah, in the way of your regulations, that I may observe it down to the last.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961124/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 119:33</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Endurance like Job’s in the Time of the End</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[76]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> However, Satan struck Job with a disease that seemed to mean certain death, so that Job himself said: “The graveyard is for me.” It also looked like a punishment from the true God in the eyes of the people of the Middle East. His own brothers kept their distance from him; his acquaintances turned aside from him, quit him; those whom he well knew forgot him as if dead; he became like a foreigner to sojourners and slaves in his own house, who refused to obey him. His breath became sickening to his wife; his body became foul-smelling to his own brothers; young men no longer paid him respect in word or conduct; intimate associates detested him, and those whom he had loved grew cold toward him. His body became wasted to the bone, and, to explain how he was still living, Job said: “I escape with the skin of my teeth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Job 17:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 19:13-20</a>) Persuaded now that Jehovah had openly renounced Job, his own wife paid him a compliment and yet said it was hopeless. “Are you yet holding fast your integrity?” she said. “Curse God and die!” Still believing in his own integrity, Job sustained this cruel blow from the wife of his love and gave her this deserved correction: “As <span id="page599" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="599" data-before-text="599"></span>one of the senseless women speaks you speak also. Shall we accept merely what is good from The [true] God and not accept also what is bad?” This reaction of Job branded Satan a slanderous liar before God, for God’s record says: “In all this Job did not sin with his lips.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Job 2:1-10</a>.</p><p id="p77" data-pid="77" class="qu">23.

Each of them can say with the apostle Paul: “I in my turn am filling up what is lacking of the tribulations of the Christ in my flesh on behalf of his body, which is the congregation”! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Col. 1:24</a>) During the years of World War I they had many spiritual associates who, like themselves, were engaged to be married to the heavenly Bridegroom in the “first resurrection” from the dead; but under the heavy persecutions that the nations heaped upon Jehovah’s witnesses with the approval of the religious leaders these associates rebelled against having to suffer with the faithful remnant. They said that God had rejected the organization of the remnant and they broke off their ties with the remnant and set up their own religious organization. This was a very painful experience for the faithful remnant, as when Job had his wife turn against him as if a God-forsaken man. But from the Scriptures this Joblike remnant pointed out the senseless course of the rebellious, self-seeking quitters, and declared they were determined to undergo the persecution that Almighty God permitted to come upon them to prove their love and devotion to Him. In the eyes of the religious sects of Christendom that joined in persecuting Jehovah’s witnesses the remnant were spiritually just as diseased and stricken of God as Job was and they abandoned these to destruction at the hands of Satan’s political governments and their military machine. But true to the prophetic drama of Job, the faithful remnant endured all this, though wondering what it all meant.</p><p id="p78" data-pid="78" class="qu">24.

In the spring of 1919 he revived them from their deathlike spiritual condition. He set them to work in proclaiming the good news about God’s kingdom that had been born in the heavens at the close of the “appointed times of the nations” in the fall of 1914. But their trials on earth were not over, as Satan’s further mistreatment of Job prophetically portrayed. An extended period of religious controversy was due, also a period of being misjudged, misrepresented and condemned, this to be offset by consoling enlightenment from God.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="ss"><strong>JOB’S THREE FALSE FRIENDS</strong></p><p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="qu">25.

Knowing this, Satan maneuvered three companions of Job’s to come together by appointment and launch a combined triple-blow assault on Job’s integrity, to ruin it if possible. Eliphaz from the land of Teman, Bildad, a descendant of Shuah, and Zophar from Naamah did not recognize the disease-wasted Job at first sight. They put on quite a scene of loud, demonstrative mourning over him. Silently they sat observing him for seven days, opening their minds to Satan’s suggestions as to what Job’s condition indicated. Job at last broke the silence by calling down evil on the day of his birth and expressing wonderment as to why God kept him alive. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Job <span id="page600" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="600" data-before-text="600"></span>2:11 to 3:26</a>) This led to a series of three debates. In the first two debates all three men strongly stated what they thought, and Job defended himself against each one in turn. In the third debate Zophar the Naamathite failed to take part, likely thinking it was useless or having nothing further to say, being put to silence with his two companions.</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950042/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Matt. 13:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950042/38/1" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> 22</a>) Do not most persons find some time for less essential things, such as secular work? shopping for food? reading the newspaper? listening to the radio? visiting friends? relaxing by some form of recreation? and perhaps even sleeping in some Sunday mornings? The last query reminds of the next—too lazy? <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950042/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Proverbs 6:6-11</a> says (<em>Moff.</em>): “You sluggard, how long will you sleep? When will you rise from your slumber? ‘Let me sleep for a little, a little! let me fold my hands for a little, to rest?’ yes, and poverty will pounce on you, want will overpower you.” But perhaps such ones are too tired to live forever, and prefer to sleep forever, in death, undisturbed by clanging alarm clocks or resurrections!</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">19.

Jeremiah surmounted that obstacle.

Both Jeremiah and Moses felt the same way at the start, but look at the stirring oral testimony they gave after they overcame this false fear.

Theological training in a religious seminary does not equip one for Jehovah’s service now, no more than it did in Jesus’ day when he and the apostles confounded such trained ones. Private study of the Bible and group study with other witnesses, plus Jehovah’s spirit, give ability to answer second to none! “Thy commands make me wiser than my foes; I am never without them. I have more insight than all these oracles, for I muse on thine injunctions! I know more than these sages, for I carry out thy behests!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950042/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Ps. 119:98-100</a>, <em>Moff.</em>) Note how young Elihu extols Jehovah’s spirit as the vital factor in wisdom: “I am of few days, while you are aged; therefore I feared and was afraid to show you my knowledge. I thought days should speak, and many years should teach wisdom. However, it is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty, that makes them intelligent; it is not the old that are wise.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950042/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Job 32:6-9</a>, <em>An Amer.

None should need to be driven by others or by themselves to be active in witnessing. But what if one does not feel the urge to preach? Study. Meditate in God’s law day and night. Talk about the Scriptures at congregational meetings, listen to the comments of others. Take in the truth through eye and ear till it fills the mind and heart, till it wells up inside and overflows out the mouth in field service. It will do this of itself. We talk of what is in our mind and heart. “Of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950042/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Luke 6:45</a>) Some gossip, carry tales, air family troubles, detail their ailments and describe their operations, or nag or complain or quarrel. That is what fills their mind. What is on our mind, we want to get off. So get the truth on your mind, and then get it off your mind in your witnessing territory!</p>

These involve spirituality, seeking God’s kingdom and his righteousness, and the practice of moral uprightness.

Any Christian committing fornication not only is bringing in moral defilement but is also “sinning against his own [fleshly] body.” He is putting himself in peril of being removed from the body of Christ, the temple organization, and is exposing himself to the danger of syphilis and other venereal diseases.

He who loves his wife loves himself, for no man ever hated his own flesh; but he feeds and cherishes it, as the Christ also does the congregation, because we are members of his body. ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and he will stick to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.’ This sacred secret is great. Now I am speaking with respect to Christ and the congregation.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010774/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Eph. 5:28-32</a>; see parts of the body under their individual headings.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Ashes</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">It was a practice in Biblical days to sit in ashes or to scatter them upon oneself in symbol of mourning, humiliation, and repentance.

When Satan struck Job with “a malignant boil” from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot, Job “proceeded to take for himself a fragment of earthenware with which to scrape himself.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003536/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 2:7, 8</a>) And concerning Leviathan it is stated: “As pointed earthenware fragments are its underparts.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003536/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 41:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003536/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 30</a>.</p>

<strong>Job—A Pattern of Godly Conduct</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">But Job was to endure yet further difficulties. Next he was smitten “with a malignant boil from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. And he proceeded to take for himself a fragment of earthenware with which to scrape himself; and he was sitting in among the ashes.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979407/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Job 2:7, 8</a>) This extreme posture of dejection was due to excessive suffering and grief. Pointing to the loathsome nature of his disease, Job exclaimed: “When I have lain down I have also said, ‘When shall I get up?’ And when evening actually goes its measure, I have also been glutted with restlessness until morning twilight. My flesh has become clothed with maggots and lumps of dust; my skin itself has formed crusts and dissolves.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979407/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Job 7:4, 5</a>.</p>

<strong>A God of Matchless Humility</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The pitiable condition of those finding themselves reduced to the ashpit is illustrated in the case of the man Job. Having experienced the loss of everything, diseased Job sat “among the ashes,” possibly like an outcast at a city dump. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976241/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 2:8</a>) Once he had enjoyed a position of honor as a respected elder and judge in the city gate. But as an afflicted man he was subjected to indignities from base persons. He exclaimed: “I have become even the theme of their song, and I am to them for a byword. They have detested me, they have kept themselves far from me; and from my face they did not hold back their spit.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976241/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 30:9, 10</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Think of it, Jehovah God has been willing to come to the aid of despised persons like afflicted Job.

Again, “three” in being a number indicating emphasis well stresses the all-out, united opposition that Christendom’s sectarian clergy have been hurling against the modern Job-like ones. It is a matter of history that, as Job and Jesus were considered “outcasts” of their day, so Jehovah’s witnesses are found to be unwanted, smelly outcasts of Christendom.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966682/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Job 2:7, 8</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[67]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> For example, the Witnesses are not considered “respectable” or “regular” when spoken of in connection with the weedlike sects of Christendom.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="si"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>“At all events, whether they are liked or disliked, approved or disapproved, they [Jehovah’s witnesses] continue their witness not only in America but in many foreign lands with a vigor and persistence which one could wish were more often found in one’s own and other <em>eminently respectable ‘regular’ churches.”</em><a id="footnotesource5" data-fnid="5" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966682/4">e</a> (Italics ours)</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>By the well-to-do religious leaders the “wheatlike” Witnesses are branded as an “unorthodox cult” of ‘poor and uncultured’ ones.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="si"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>“Jehovah’s Witnesses belong to one of those <em>unorthodox religious cults</em> . . . which prosper among those burdened with everything except <em>worldly possessions and cultural graces.”</em><a id="footnotesource6" data-fnid="6" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966682/5">f</a> (Italics ours)</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>Also, these “outcast” Witnesses are referred to as ‘deviationists.’</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="si"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>“Many observers of the Jehovah’s witnesses have concluded that it is a ‘Christian deviation’ in that its system of doctrine <em>imitates, and at the same time distorts</em> the essential Christian beliefs.”<a id="footnotesource7" data-fnid="7" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966682/6">g</a> (Italics ours)</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>Lastly they are considered “odious” and “fanatical” by the clergy.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="si"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"></span>“A curb upon the propagandist activity of the <em>odious</em> sect—unless it can be shown to be a definite peril to society—is a potential attack upon the liberties of all citizens.

This was to be a long, grueling ordeal that was to try to break down Jesus’ heart integrity toward Jehovah and to defeat Jehovah on the issue of Godship. In Jesus’ time, the “three companions” of Job’s day represented all the teaching groups or sects of Judaism together with their retinues of disciples that should have been companions with Jesus in correctly upholding the Godship of Jehovah and the true teachings of the Bible. Instead, these false teaching agencies were employed to make bitter, violent doctrinal attacks upon Jesus. The number three, Biblically indicating emphasis, aptly illustrated the emphatic, all-out attack from all these leading sects of Jesus’ day that had become doctrinally defiled with Babylonish thinking. The statistics show that Jesus had some forty different skirmishes or word battles with these several pressure groups. There were two involving the Sadducees, two the party followers of Herod, five with members of the Sanhedrin, eight with the scribes, one indirectly referring to the Essenes (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966644/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Matt. 19:12</a>) and thirty-three involving the leading sect, that of the Pharisees.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="ss"><strong>ANSWERS BY JESUS VINDICATE GOD</strong></p><p id="p96" data-pid="96" class="qu">24.

Like Job, Jesus protested against the false charge that he was a sinner just because he was being tested as to his integrity. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966644/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Job 10:14, 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966644/37/1" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> Luke 5:30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966644/37/2" data-bid="38-3" class="b"> John 8:46;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966644/37/3" data-bid="38-4" class="b"> 9:24</a>) Like Job, Jesus rejected the Babylonish false teaching that man has an immortal soul by showing plainly that man is mortal and, when dead, is unconscious, asleep.

<strong>Endurance like Job’s in the Time of the End</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[76]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> However, Satan struck Job with a disease that seemed to mean certain death, so that Job himself said: “The graveyard is for me.” It also looked like a punishment from the true God in the eyes of the people of the Middle East. His own brothers kept their distance from him; his acquaintances turned aside from him, quit him; those whom he well knew forgot him as if dead; he became like a foreigner to sojourners and slaves in his own house, who refused to obey him. His breath became sickening to his wife; his body became foul-smelling to his own brothers; young men no longer paid him respect in word or conduct; intimate associates detested him, and those whom he had loved grew cold toward him. His body became wasted to the bone, and, to explain how he was still living, Job said: “I escape with the skin of my teeth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Job 17:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 19:13-20</a>) Persuaded now that Jehovah had openly renounced Job, his own wife paid him a compliment and yet said it was hopeless. “Are you yet holding fast your integrity?” she said. “Curse God and die!” Still believing in his own integrity, Job sustained this cruel blow from the wife of his love and gave her this deserved correction: “As <span id="page599" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="599" data-before-text="599"></span>one of the senseless women speaks you speak also. Shall we accept merely what is good from The [true] God and not accept also what is bad?” This reaction of Job branded Satan a slanderous liar before God, for God’s record says: “In all this Job did not sin with his lips.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Job 2:1-10</a>.</p><p id="p77" data-pid="77" class="qu">23.

Each of them can say with the apostle Paul: “I in my turn am filling up what is lacking of the tribulations of the Christ in my flesh on behalf of his body, which is the congregation”! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Col. 1:24</a>) During the years of World War I they had many spiritual associates who, like themselves, were engaged to be married to the heavenly Bridegroom in the “first resurrection” from the dead; but under the heavy persecutions that the nations heaped upon Jehovah’s witnesses with the approval of the religious leaders these associates rebelled against having to suffer with the faithful remnant. They said that God had rejected the organization of the remnant and they broke off their ties with the remnant and set up their own religious organization. This was a very painful experience for the faithful remnant, as when Job had his wife turn against him as if a God-forsaken man. But from the Scriptures this Joblike remnant pointed out the senseless course of the rebellious, self-seeking quitters, and declared they were determined to undergo the persecution that Almighty God permitted to come upon them to prove their love and devotion to Him. In the eyes of the religious sects of Christendom that joined in persecuting Jehovah’s witnesses the remnant were spiritually just as diseased and stricken of God as Job was and they abandoned these to destruction at the hands of Satan’s political governments and their military machine. But true to the prophetic drama of Job, the faithful remnant endured all this, though wondering what it all meant.</p><p id="p78" data-pid="78" class="qu">24.

In the spring of 1919 he revived them from their deathlike spiritual condition. He set them to work in proclaiming the good news about God’s kingdom that had been born in the heavens at the close of the “appointed times of the nations” in the fall of 1914. But their trials on earth were not over, as Satan’s further mistreatment of Job prophetically portrayed. An extended period of religious controversy was due, also a period of being misjudged, misrepresented and condemned, this to be offset by consoling enlightenment from God.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="ss"><strong>JOB’S THREE FALSE FRIENDS</strong></p><p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="qu">25.

Knowing this, Satan maneuvered three companions of Job’s to come together by appointment and launch a combined triple-blow assault on Job’s integrity, to ruin it if possible. Eliphaz from the land of Teman, Bildad, a descendant of Shuah, and Zophar from Naamah did not recognize the disease-wasted Job at first sight. They put on quite a scene of loud, demonstrative mourning over him. Silently they sat observing him for seven days, opening their minds to Satan’s suggestions as to what Job’s condition indicated. Job at last broke the silence by calling down evil on the day of his birth and expressing wonderment as to why God kept him alive. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Job <span id="page600" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="600" data-before-text="600"></span>2:11 to 3:26</a>) This led to a series of three debates. In the first two debates all three men strongly stated what they thought, and Job defended himself against each one in turn. In the third debate Zophar the Naamathite failed to take part, likely thinking it was useless or having nothing further to say, being put to silence with his two companions.</p>

The loss of her children and the family wealth must have devastated her. It must have hurt her to see her husband suffering a painful disease. She cried out to Job: “Are you yet holding fast your integrity? Curse God and die!” Then, three men arrived​—Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar—​ostensibly to offer Job comfort. Instead, they used deceptive reasoning and proved to be “troublesome comforters.” For example, Bildad suggested that Job’s children had engaged in wrongdoing and deserved their fate. Eliphaz insinuated that Job’s suffering was punishment for past sins. He even questioned whether those who keep integrity are of any value to God!

<strong>Christians Must Expect Persecution</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> A subtler form of persecution and one <span id="page595" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="595" data-before-text="595"></span>that is often very hard to bear is opposition from relatives. Sometimes newly converted Christians find that relatives whom they love dearly and who have always been very close to them now begin to oppose and persecute them, because of their new way of life. The faithful man Job had this to bear at the height of his suffering. After his losing almost everything he had, his wife turned against him, saying: “Are you yet holding fast your integrity? Curse God and die!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966722/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Job 2:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966722/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 19:17</a>) But Job, although in great pain and, no doubt, cut to the quick by this unkind onslaught from one who should have comforted him, held fast his integrity to Jehovah. And so must we under similar trials, hard though it may be. Jesus said it would happen this way: “For I came to cause division, with a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a young wife against her mother-in-law. Indeed, a man’s enemies will be persons of his own household.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966722/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 10:35, 36</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 7.

He has often used this after making false charges, as was the case with Jacob’s son Joseph, thrown into an Egyptian prison on the false charge of attempting to rape his master’s wife. This must have been very hard for Joseph to bear, knowing full well he was innocent of the vile charge. What did he do? Make a jailbreak and set himself free and try to vindicate himself of the false charges? No, indeed, Joseph did no such thing. He patiently waited for Jehovah to set him free in His own time and way. This is exactly what Jehovah did, and it resulted in Joseph’s being exalted to a high position under Pharaoh, and being used further by Jehovah for his own glory and praise. What a wonderful reward for Joseph for faithful endurance under persecution!</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 8. From what other examples of imprisonment of Jehovah’s servants can we draw courage?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Other servants of God, such as the prophet Jeremiah and the apostle Paul were thrown into prison because of their boldness in speaking the truth of God’s Word although forbidden to do so. It is always the public declaration of the truths of Jehovah’s purposes that the adversary wishes to stop. Because of their faithfulness as Jehovah’s witnesses in preaching the good news thousands of our brothers were thrown into prisons and concentration camps in Hitler’s Germany. Thousands of others have suffered similar persecution in Communist prison camps. One brother recently released spent twenty-four years in Nazi and Communist prisons and refused to compromise. Many in Nazi prisons could have bought their release by renouncing their faith, but they never have it a moment’s consideration. Indeed, they continued preaching in prison and found many of Jehovah’s “sheep” there. In all these trials they were sustained by God’s promise at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966722/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Revelation 2:10</a>: “Do not be afraid of the things you are about to suffer. Look! The Devil will keep on throwing some of you into prison that you may be fully put to the test.” Yes, they were “fully put to the test” and proved to themselves that Jehovah could bring them through.</p>

Job and his wife had no spiritual television arrangement such as we now have in the completed, inspired, Scriptural account of Job, to see with ‘eyes of the heart’ what was back of Job’s afflictions. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Eph. 1:18</a>) While there were many things Job could not understand as to his testing, yet his faith was strong to hold true to champion Jehovah’s Godship all along. Another blow—the faith of Job’s nearest and dearest, his wife, weakens. She says to him: “‘Are you yet holding fast your integrity?

Babylonish religious thinking had influenced all the peoples in and about Palestine. Evidences now scintillate to indicate that the so-called friends of Job had become addicted to Babylonish apostasy. Such false friends were now ready for Satan’s special pressures against Job. To make Job’s sufferings jab deep into his heart, Satan maneuvered these three Babylonized agents to employ philosophical wisdom to wear down Job mentally in his loyalty to Jehovah. The fact that there were three of such pretended comforters emphasizes Satan’s all-out attempt in this subtle fashion. The first false one was Eliphaz, the Temanite, indicating he was a descendant of Abraham through his apostate grandson Esau. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Gen. 36:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 10, 11</a>) The Temanites became famous for their apostate wisdom since they had not held fast to the true religion of Abraham. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Jer. 49:7</a>) Bildad, the Shuhite, was the second false companion, being also a descendant of Abraham through Abraham’s sixth son, Shuah, by his second wife, Keturah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Gen. 25:2</a>) Bildad, too, had become an apostate from the true religion of Abraham. His name Bildad means either “Son of Contention,” or, “Bel has loved,” which latter meaning could indicate the strong Babylonish background of his parental training, since Bel was the title of Marduk, the chief god of the Babylonians. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Jer. 50:2</a>)<a id="footnotesource9" data-fnid="9" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966643/8">i</a> The third of this trio of trying “comforters” was Zophar, the Naamathite, betrayed by his speeches also to be an apostate from the true religion of Abraham. The <em>Septuagint</em> refers to him as “Sophar king of the Minaeans,” an Arabian people, the Arabs being generally considered as descendants of Abraham.</p><p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu">15.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Job 2:13</a>) While it is true the descendants of Abraham, at the time of Jacob’s burial, conducted mourning rites with <em>heavy wailing</em> for seven days (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Gen. 50:10</a>), yet there is no evidence of a custom of seven days of <em>silence</em> amongst the Israelites. So the <span id="page526" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="526" data-before-text="526"></span>seven days of silence seem to correspond with a Babylonish practice of imploring the invisible powers of Satan and the demons for suggestions as to what conditions indicated.<a id="footnotesource10" data-fnid="10" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966643/9">j</a> At least by the end of seven days these three manifested themselves as part of Satan’s plot to weaken Job’s support of Jehovah’s Sovereign Godship.</p>

<strong>Take It with Love and You Can Take It</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Often misunderstanding is hard to take. You may feel that the other one should know better, is laboring under false impressions or is acting inexcusably selfish. Love, however, will enable you to make allowances for that one, to exercise patience and try to straighten out the matter. Love will keep you from being unduly sensitive in your relations with others, thus <span id="page356" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="356" data-before-text="356"></span>making it easier for you to take it. It will enable you to “continue putting up with one another.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963440/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Col. 3:13</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Then, again, disaster may strike suddenly, in the form of loss of job, home or loved one. How will you take it? “Curse God and die,” as Job’s wife foolishly counseled her husband? Or take it with love, thankful for what has been spared? As Job himself said: “Shall we accept merely what is good from the true God and not accept also what is bad?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963440/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 2:9, 10</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Or are you the victim of some prejudice—cultural, economic, national or racial? Are you suffering religious persecution? Love will keep you from chafing, from becoming bitter, from seething inside with schemes of vengeance or retaliation. Rather, it will make you feel like Jesus did when he prayed: “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963440/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 23:34</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Or perhaps you are among the many family heads whose lot it is to do monotonous work day in and day out in order to provide for those dependent upon you. Love for your family, however, should enable you to bear this burden without undue chafing. Remember, your family is looking to you to provide for them, they are of your flesh and blood and are <em>yours!</em> Is not the fact that you are able to provide for them far more important than the particular way by which you may get the necessary means? Surely!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963440/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Tim. 5:8</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The same, of course, applies if you happen to be the wife and mother. Without love the daily routine of making beds, cooking meals, washing and ironing, cleaning and shopping and otherwise caring for your brood, may be O so dreary. But if you have love in your heart for your husband and provider, for your children that you conceived and, by the miracle of birth, brought into the world, then you will appreciate how much your efforts contribute to their well-being and happiness, and it will not be too hard to take.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963440/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Prov. 31:10-31</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Yes, regardless of what it may be—perhaps weighty responsibilities that you cannot conscientiously get out from under—take it with love and you will be able to take it. Interestingly, men of science are at last becoming aware of the importance of this need of love. Says anthropologist Ashley Montagu in his latest book (1962), <em>The Humanization of Man:</em> “This is not a new discovery in the world, what is new is that scientists should be rediscovering these truths by scientific means. Contemporary scientists working in this field are giving a scientific foundation or validation to the Sermon on the Mount and the Golden Rule: To do unto others as you would have them do to you, and love your neighbor as yourself.”</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Some 3,500 years ago Moses was inspired to write, “You must love your fellow as yourself,” and more than 1,900 years ago Jesus showed that love sums up the whole duty of man—love of God and love of neighbor as of oneself. They appreciated the importance of love.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963440/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Lev. 19:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963440/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Mark 12:30, 31</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">And in particular does the apostle Paul show us what love is like: “Love is long-suffering and kind. Love is not jealous, it does not brag, does not get puffed up, does not behave indecently, does not look for its own interests, does not become provoked. It does not keep account of the injury. It does not rejoice over unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth. It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails.” Since love can do all these things, is it any wonder that if you take it with love you can take it.?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963440/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:4-8</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Evil—Does It Soften or Does It Harden You?</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The ten plagues that God caused to come upon Egypt, to show Pharaoh who Jehovah is, were evils. No question about <span id="page442" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="442" data-before-text="442"></span>that. But while they hardened Pharaoh and most of his subjects, there were some Egyptians who were softened by them. These exercised faith in the God of Moses, sought cover when warned about the seventh plague, of hail, fire and thunder; and many, as “a vast mixed company,” also went up with the Israelites out of Egypt after the memorable night of Nisan 14, 1513 B.C.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961526/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Num. 33:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">As we look about us today we see many who needlessly have let themselves become hard, to their own detriment. Some born with a defect such as blindness or lameness have let this make them bitter and hard. They resent the fact that, as the Bible expresses it, their ‘teeth got set on edge’ due to their ‘fathers’ eating unripe grapes.’ But the man, whom the Bible tells about, who was born blind and who had his sight restored by Jesus had not let this affliction harden him; neither did the man crippled from birth whom Peter and John cured. They kept soft at heart and hoping, and so were in the right heart condition to respond to miraculous healing. Those who under like conditions today keep soft at heart are more likely to receive spiritual healing.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961526/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezek. 18:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961526/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> John 9:1-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961526/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Acts 3:1-8</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Others permit some disaster to make them hard. They rebel that God lets “time and unforeseen occurrence befall them all.” All such should consider the example of Job. What disasters he experienced all at once! Loss of all his ten children, all his possessions and even his health. Did he permit it to harden him? It hardened his wife, for she said to him: “Are you yet holding fast your integrity? Curse God and die!” But Job became soft and said: “As one of the senseless women speaks you speak also. Shall we accept merely what is good from The true God and not accept also what is bad?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961526/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Eccl. 9:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961526/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Job 2:9, 10</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Then again, many let social injustices, such as economic oppression and racial prejudice harden them. They begin crusading as if righting these wrongs were the most important thing in life and as if it contained no joys so long as these evils had to be endured. Some even swing to the extreme of becoming atheistic communists. What folly! The apostle Peter counseled Christian slaves in his day to submit even to unreasonable masters rather than to rebel.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961526/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:18, 19</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The Samaritan of Jesus’ illustration did not permit the discrimination he was suffering at the hands of the Jews to harden him. Far from it! He went out of his way to help a man, doubtless a Jew, who had been waylaid, beaten and robbed, and was the happier for it. Yes, just “because sentence against a bad work has not been executed speedily,” that is no reason for our becoming hard.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961526/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Luke 10:29-37;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961526/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Eccl. 8:11</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">A common reason why some let their hearts become hard is the misuse or abuse of power by those in authority. That could have been the case with the teen-ager referred to above. Any in subordinate positions—wives, children, employees and also members of a Christian congregation—must be on guard here. Failing in this, the ten tribes of Israel let the position taken by Solomon’s son, Rehoboam, unreasonable it is true, harden them. But how much better was the example of David, who did not let Saul’s abuse of power make him hard!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961526/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Chron. 10:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961526/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 1 Sam. 26:9</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">A more or less common evil that has caused some persons to harden their heart is that associated with finding a mate. Due to inexperience or too trusting a nature, or due to dishonesty on the part of another, one suffers disappointment or frustration and may be deeply wounded. Because of this some become hard in all their relations <span id="page443" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="443" data-before-text="443"></span>with their fellows and particularly with those of the opposite sex. Jephthah’s daughter could well have let herself become hard when, due to her father’s vow, she found herself dedicated to a life of virginity, but she did not. She found happiness in serving Jehovah God full time.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961526/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Judg. 11:36-40</a>.</p>

His own brothers kept their distance from him; his acquaintances turned aside from him, quit him; those whom he well knew forgot him as if dead; he became like a foreigner to sojourners and slaves in his own house, who refused to obey him. His breath became sickening to his wife; his body became foul-smelling to his own brothers; young men no longer paid him respect in word or conduct; intimate associates detested him, and those whom he had loved grew cold toward him. His body became wasted to the bone, and, to explain how he was still living, Job said: “I escape with the skin of my teeth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Job 17:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 19:13-20</a>) Persuaded now that Jehovah had openly renounced Job, his own wife paid him a compliment and yet said it was hopeless. “Are you yet holding fast your integrity?” she said. “Curse God and die!” Still believing in his own integrity, Job sustained this cruel blow from the wife of his love and gave her this deserved correction: “As <span id="page599" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="599" data-before-text="599"></span>one of the senseless women speaks you speak also. Shall we accept merely what is good from The [true] God and not accept also what is bad?” This reaction of Job branded Satan a slanderous liar before God, for God’s record says: “In all this Job did not sin with his lips.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Job 2:1-10</a>.</p><p id="p77" data-pid="77" class="qu">23.

Each of them can say with the apostle Paul: “I in my turn am filling up what is lacking of the tribulations of the Christ in my flesh on behalf of his body, which is the congregation”! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Col. 1:24</a>) During the years of World War I they had many spiritual associates who, like themselves, were engaged to be married to the heavenly Bridegroom in the “first resurrection” from the dead; but under the heavy persecutions that the nations heaped upon Jehovah’s witnesses with the approval of the religious leaders these associates rebelled against having to suffer with the faithful remnant. They said that God had rejected the organization of the remnant and they broke off their ties with the remnant and set up their own religious organization. This was a very painful experience for the faithful remnant, as when Job had his wife turn against him as if a God-forsaken man. But from the Scriptures this Joblike remnant pointed out the senseless course of the rebellious, self-seeking quitters, and declared they were determined to undergo the persecution that Almighty God permitted to come upon them to prove their love and devotion to Him. In the eyes of the religious sects of Christendom that joined in persecuting Jehovah’s witnesses the remnant were spiritually just as diseased and stricken of God as Job was and they abandoned these to destruction at the hands of Satan’s political governments and their military machine.

Knowing this, Satan maneuvered three companions of Job’s to come together by appointment and launch a combined triple-blow assault on Job’s integrity, to ruin it if possible. Eliphaz from the land of Teman, Bildad, a descendant of Shuah, and Zophar from Naamah did not recognize the disease-wasted Job at first sight. They put on quite a scene of loud, demonstrative mourning over him. Silently they sat observing him for seven days, opening their minds to Satan’s suggestions as to what Job’s condition indicated. Job at last broke the silence by calling down evil on the day of his birth and expressing wonderment as to why God kept him alive. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Job <span id="page600" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="600" data-before-text="600"></span>2:11 to 3:26</a>) This led to a series of three debates. In the first two debates all three men strongly stated what they thought, and Job defended himself against each one in turn. In the third debate Zophar the Naamathite failed to take part, likely thinking it was useless or having nothing further to say, being put to silence with his two companions.</p>

<strong>Unmasking the Serpent</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Even when we consider the significant account of Job and his trials, we see that Job never attributes his tests to the adversary, Satan. Evidently, he was unaware at the time of the issue that hung on the outcome of his conduct. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988642/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Job 1:6-12</a>) He did not realize that Satan had precipitated the crisis by challenging Job’s integrity before Jehovah. Thus, when Job’s wife reprimanded him with the words: “Are you yet holding fast your integrity? Curse God and die!” he simply answered: “Shall we accept merely what is good from the true God and not accept also what is bad?” Without knowing the true source of his trials, he apparently viewed them as coming from God and therefore something to be accepted. Thus, this became a very severe test of Job’s integrity.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988642/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Job 1:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988642/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 2:9, 10</a>.</p>

<strong>Take It with Love and You Can Take It</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Often misunderstanding is hard to take. You may feel that the other one should know better, is laboring under false impressions or is acting inexcusably selfish. Love, however, will enable you to make allowances for that one, to exercise patience and try to straighten out the matter. Love will keep you from being unduly sensitive in your relations with others, thus <span id="page356" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="356" data-before-text="356"></span>making it easier for you to take it. It will enable you to “continue putting up with one another.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963440/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Col. 3:13</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Then, again, disaster may strike suddenly, in the form of loss of job, home or loved one. How will you take it? “Curse God and die,” as Job’s wife foolishly counseled her husband? Or take it with love, thankful for what has been spared? As Job himself said: “Shall we accept merely what is good from the true God and not accept also what is bad?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963440/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 2:9, 10</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Or are you the victim of some prejudice—cultural, economic, national or racial? Are you suffering religious persecution? Love will keep you from chafing, from becoming bitter, from seething inside with schemes of vengeance or retaliation. Rather, it will make you feel like Jesus did when he prayed: “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963440/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 23:34</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Or perhaps you are among the many family heads whose lot it is to do monotonous work day in and day out in order to provide for those dependent upon you. Love for your family, however, should enable you to bear this burden without undue chafing. Remember, your family is looking to you to provide for them, they are of your flesh and blood and are <em>yours!</em> Is not the fact that you are able to provide for them far more important than the particular way by which you may get the necessary means? Surely!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963440/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Tim. 5:8</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The same, of course, applies if you happen to be the wife and mother. Without love the daily routine of making beds, cooking meals, washing and ironing, cleaning and shopping and otherwise caring for your brood, may be O so dreary. But if you have love in your heart for your husband and provider, for your children that you conceived and, by the miracle of birth, brought into the world, then you will appreciate how much your efforts contribute to their well-being and happiness, and it will not be too hard to take.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963440/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Prov. 31:10-31</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Yes, regardless of what it may be—perhaps weighty responsibilities that you cannot conscientiously get out from under—take it with love and you will be able to take it. Interestingly, men of science are at last becoming aware of the importance of this need of love. Says anthropologist Ashley Montagu in his latest book (1962), <em>The Humanization of Man:</em> “This is not a new discovery in the world, what is new is that scientists should be rediscovering these truths by scientific means. Contemporary scientists working in this field are giving a scientific foundation or validation to the Sermon on the Mount and the Golden Rule: To do unto others as you would have them do to you, and love your neighbor as yourself.”</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Some 3,500 years ago Moses was inspired to write, “You must love your fellow as yourself,” and more than 1,900 years ago Jesus showed that love sums up the whole duty of man—love of God and love of neighbor as of oneself. They appreciated the importance of love.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963440/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Lev. 19:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963440/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Mark 12:30, 31</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">And in particular does the apostle Paul show us what love is like: “Love is long-suffering and kind. Love is not jealous, it does not brag, does not get puffed up, does not behave indecently, does not look for its own interests, does not become provoked. It does not keep account of the injury. It does not rejoice over unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth. It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails.” Since love can do all these things, is it any wonder that if you take it with love you can take it.?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963440/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:4-8</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Evil—Does It Soften or Does It Harden You?</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The ten plagues that God caused to come upon Egypt, to show Pharaoh who Jehovah is, were evils. No question about <span id="page442" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="442" data-before-text="442"></span>that. But while they hardened Pharaoh and most of his subjects, there were some Egyptians who were softened by them. These exercised faith in the God of Moses, sought cover when warned about the seventh plague, of hail, fire and thunder; and many, as “a vast mixed company,” also went up with the Israelites out of Egypt after the memorable night of Nisan 14, 1513 B.C.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961526/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Num. 33:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">As we look about us today we see many who needlessly have let themselves become hard, to their own detriment. Some born with a defect such as blindness or lameness have let this make them bitter and hard. They resent the fact that, as the Bible expresses it, their ‘teeth got set on edge’ due to their ‘fathers’ eating unripe grapes.’ But the man, whom the Bible tells about, who was born blind and who had his sight restored by Jesus had not let this affliction harden him; neither did the man crippled from birth whom Peter and John cured. They kept soft at heart and hoping, and so were in the right heart condition to respond to miraculous healing. Those who under like conditions today keep soft at heart are more likely to receive spiritual healing.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961526/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezek. 18:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961526/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> John 9:1-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961526/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Acts 3:1-8</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Others permit some disaster to make them hard. They rebel that God lets “time and unforeseen occurrence befall them all.” All such should consider the example of Job. What disasters he experienced all at once! Loss of all his ten children, all his possessions and even his health. Did he permit it to harden him? It hardened his wife, for she said to him: “Are you yet holding fast your integrity? Curse God and die!” But Job became soft and said: “As one of the senseless women speaks you speak also. Shall we accept merely what is good from The true God and not accept also what is bad?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961526/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Eccl. 9:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961526/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Job 2:9, 10</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Then again, many let social injustices, such as economic oppression and racial prejudice harden them. They begin crusading as if righting these wrongs were the most important thing in life and as if it contained no joys so long as these evils had to be endured. Some even swing to the extreme of becoming atheistic communists. What folly! The apostle Peter counseled Christian slaves in his day to submit even to unreasonable masters rather than to rebel.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961526/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:18, 19</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The Samaritan of Jesus’ illustration did not permit the discrimination he was suffering at the hands of the Jews to harden him. Far from it! He went out of his way to help a man, doubtless a Jew, who had been waylaid, beaten and robbed, and was the happier for it. Yes, just “because sentence against a bad work has not been executed speedily,” that is no reason for our becoming hard.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961526/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Luke 10:29-37;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961526/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Eccl. 8:11</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">A common reason why some let their hearts become hard is the misuse or abuse of power by those in authority. That could have been the case with the teen-ager referred to above. Any in subordinate positions—wives, children, employees and also members of a Christian congregation—must be on guard here. Failing in this, the ten tribes of Israel let the position taken by Solomon’s son, Rehoboam, unreasonable it is true, harden them. But how much better was the example of David, who did not let Saul’s abuse of power make him hard!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961526/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Chron. 10:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961526/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 1 Sam. 26:9</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">A more or less common evil that has caused some persons to harden their heart is that associated with finding a mate. Due to inexperience or too trusting a nature, or due to dishonesty on the part of another, one suffers disappointment or frustration and may be deeply wounded. Because of this some become hard in all their relations <span id="page443" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="443" data-before-text="443"></span>with their fellows and particularly with those of the opposite sex. Jephthah’s daughter could well have let herself become hard when, due to her father’s vow, she found herself dedicated to a life of virginity, but she did not. She found happiness in serving Jehovah God full time.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961526/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Judg. 11:36-40</a>.</p>

<strong>Endurance like Job’s in the Time of the End</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[76]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> However, Satan struck Job with a disease that seemed to mean certain death, so that Job himself said: “The graveyard is for me.” It also looked like a punishment from the true God in the eyes of the people of the Middle East. His own brothers kept their distance from him; his acquaintances turned aside from him, quit him; those whom he well knew forgot him as if dead; he became like a foreigner to sojourners and slaves in his own house, who refused to obey him. His breath became sickening to his wife; his body became foul-smelling to his own brothers; young men no longer paid him respect in word or conduct; intimate associates detested him, and those whom he had loved grew cold toward him. His body became wasted to the bone, and, to explain how he was still living, Job said: “I escape with the skin of my teeth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Job 17:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 19:13-20</a>) Persuaded now that Jehovah had openly renounced Job, his own wife paid him a compliment and yet said it was hopeless. “Are you yet holding fast your integrity?” she said. “Curse God and die!” Still believing in his own integrity, Job sustained this cruel blow from the wife of his love and gave her this deserved correction: “As <span id="page599" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="599" data-before-text="599"></span>one of the senseless women speaks you speak also. Shall we accept merely what is good from The [true] God and not accept also what is bad?” This reaction of Job branded Satan a slanderous liar before God, for God’s record says: “In all this Job did not sin with his lips.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Job 2:1-10</a>.</p><p id="p77" data-pid="77" class="qu">23.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Col. 1:24</a>) During the years of World War I they had many spiritual associates who, like themselves, were engaged to be married to the heavenly Bridegroom in the “first resurrection” from the dead; but under the heavy persecutions that the nations heaped upon Jehovah’s witnesses with the approval of the religious leaders these associates rebelled against having to suffer with the faithful remnant. They said that God had rejected the organization of the remnant and they broke off their ties with the remnant and set up their own religious organization. This was a very painful experience for the faithful remnant, as when Job had his wife turn against him as if a God-forsaken man. But from the Scriptures this Joblike remnant pointed out the senseless course of the rebellious, self-seeking quitters, and declared they were determined to undergo the persecution that Almighty God permitted to come upon them to prove their love and devotion to Him.

Knowing this, Satan maneuvered three companions of Job’s to come together by appointment and launch a combined triple-blow assault on Job’s integrity, to ruin it if possible. Eliphaz from the land of Teman, Bildad, a descendant of Shuah, and Zophar from Naamah did not recognize the disease-wasted Job at first sight. They put on quite a scene of loud, demonstrative mourning over him. Silently they sat observing him for seven days, opening their minds to Satan’s suggestions as to what Job’s condition indicated. Job at last broke the silence by calling down evil on the day of his birth and expressing wonderment as to why God kept him alive. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957725/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Job <span id="page600" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="600" data-before-text="600"></span>2:11 to 3:26</a>) This led to a series of three debates. In the first two debates all three men strongly stated what they thought, and Job defended himself against each one in turn. In the third debate Zophar the Naamathite failed to take part, likely thinking it was useless or having nothing further to say, being put to silence with his two companions.</p>

<strong>An Educated Tongue—“To Encourage the Weary”</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>“Troublesome Comforters”</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">When Job was in a depressed state, three of his companions heard of his plight and came to “sympathize with him and comfort him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982402/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 2:11</a>) Because of having the wrong viewpoint of matters, they were poorly equipped. They came with a preset theory in mind​—if a person is suffering it is because he has done something bad. As a result, they failed to understand what Job’s problems were all about. The <em>Interpreter’s Bible</em> evaluates their “comfort”:</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“It becomes an irritant. . . . It is a comment from the side lines, with a bit of good advice thrown in. . . . like someone safely up on the beach throwing a cheery word or two to poor souls wrestling in the great dark deeps, with the huge billows knocking the breath out of them. What Job needs is the compassion of a human heart. What he gets is a series of absolutely ‘true’ and absolutely beautiful religious clichés and moral platitudes.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">What were some of the approaches that irritated? Eliphaz coldly reasoned: ‘Look, you strengthened others. Now when you have troubles you get disturbed. Should you not have confidence in your own integrity?’ Bildad added: ‘If you would only look to God more, he would restore you.’ How insensitive! Especially since Job <em>was</em> already trusting in God. How would you have felt? Rather than comfort, those seemingly well-intentioned words were “crushing” to Job. No wonder he cried out, ‘If only you were in my place!’​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982402/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 4:3-6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982402/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 8:5, 6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982402/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 16:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982402/5/3" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> 4, 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982402/5/4" data-bid="6-5" class="b"> 19:2</a>.</p>

<strong>Job—A Pattern of Godly Conduct</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The test of Job’s endurance was to become even greater. He was visited by three companions, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite. Supposedly they came to “sympathize with [Job] and comfort him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979407/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Job 2:11</a>) But the visit proved to be anything but comforting. The companions insisted that Job’s sickness was a punishment from God for serious sins. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979407/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Job 4:7-9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979407/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 8:11-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979407/24/2" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> 20:4-29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979407/24/3" data-bid="25-4" class="b"> 22:7-11</a>) In the opinion of Eliphaz, Bildad and Zophar, a person’s circumstances, whether of prosperity or misfortune, were an indication of that one’s moral worth. They were convinced that Job’s disease was evidence of his being of reprobate conduct and they kept insisting that he repent.</p>

Job and his wife had no spiritual television arrangement such as we now have in the completed, inspired, Scriptural account of Job, to see with ‘eyes of the heart’ what was back of Job’s afflictions. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Eph. 1:18</a>) While there were many things Job could not understand as to his testing, yet his faith was strong to hold true to champion Jehovah’s Godship all along. Another blow—the faith of Job’s nearest and dearest, his wife, weakens. She says to him: “‘Are you yet holding fast your integrity? Curse God and die!’<a id="footnotesource8" data-fnid="8" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966643/7">h</a> But [Job] said to her: ‘As one of the senseless women speaks, you speak also. Shall we accept merely what is good from the true God and not accept also what is bad?’ In all this Job did not sin with his lips.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Job 2:9, 10</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="ss"><strong>THREE COMPANIONS BABYLONIZED</strong></p><p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">14.

Babylonish religious thinking had influenced all the peoples in and about Palestine. Evidences now scintillate to indicate that the so-called friends of Job had become addicted to Babylonish apostasy. Such false friends were now ready for Satan’s special pressures against Job. To make Job’s sufferings jab deep into his heart, Satan maneuvered these three Babylonized agents to employ philosophical wisdom to wear down Job mentally in his loyalty to Jehovah. The fact that there were three of such pretended comforters emphasizes Satan’s all-out attempt in this subtle fashion. The first false one was Eliphaz, the Temanite, indicating he was a descendant of Abraham through his apostate grandson Esau. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Gen. 36:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 10, 11</a>) The Temanites became famous for their apostate wisdom since they had not held fast to the true religion of Abraham. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Jer. 49:7</a>) Bildad, the Shuhite, was the second false companion, being also a descendant of Abraham through Abraham’s sixth son, Shuah, by his second wife, Keturah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Gen. 25:2</a>) Bildad, too, had become an apostate from the true religion of Abraham. His name Bildad means either “Son of Contention,” or, “Bel has loved,” which latter meaning could indicate the strong Babylonish background of his parental training, since Bel was the title of Marduk, the chief god of the Babylonians. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Jer. 50:2</a>)<a id="footnotesource9" data-fnid="9" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966643/8">i</a> The third of this trio of trying “comforters” was Zophar, the Naamathite, betrayed by his speeches also to be an apostate from the true religion of Abraham. The <em>Septuagint</em> refers to him as “Sophar king of the Minaeans,” an Arabian people, the Arabs being generally considered as descendants of Abraham.</p><p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu">15. What do the seven days of silence seem to indicate, and why?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[67]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> When the three “companions” arrived they opened their ‘program of comfort’ with a period of silence for seven days and seven nights sitting in the presence of Job. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Job 2:13</a>) While it is true the descendants of Abraham, at the time of Jacob’s burial, conducted mourning rites with <em>heavy wailing</em> for seven days (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Gen. 50:10</a>), yet there is no evidence of a custom of seven days of <em>silence</em> amongst the Israelites. So the <span id="page526" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="526" data-before-text="526"></span>seven days of silence seem to correspond with a Babylonish practice of imploring the invisible powers of Satan and the demons for suggestions as to what conditions indicated.<a id="footnotesource10" data-fnid="10" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966643/9">j</a> At least by the end of seven days these three manifested themselves as part of Satan’s plot to weaken Job’s support of Jehovah’s Sovereign Godship.</p>

The three men—Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar—put on a great show of grief, wailing loudly and throwing dust on their heads. Then they sat on the ground near Job and said nothing.

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Job mentioned various ways in which a miscarriage can occur, any of which he felt would have been better for him than the suffering he was experiencing. He said that he might have been “a hidden miscarriage,” someone who “should not come to be, like children that have seen no light.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984208/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 3:16</a>) This could refer to a woman’s miscarrying even before she realized that she was pregnant and while the embryo was not viable. <em>The Body Machine</em> states: “Many ova [fertilized eggs] do not develop normally, a greater number in fact than those which do. About ten per cent fail to implant and of those that do about half are aborted spontaneously, usually without the mother knowing.”</p>

<strong>Light</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Light from the sun is a combination of colors, with each color having a different wavelength. The color of an object is determined by the particular portion of the light reflected by its surface. Thus light furnishes the many hues that delight the eye of man. <span id="page1067" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1067" data-before-text="1067"></span>It is also essential for earthly life—plants, animals and man—to continue.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>THE SOURCE OF LIGHT</strong></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jehovah God is the Former of light and the Creator of darkness. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 45:7</a>) It was on the first creative day that he said: “Let light come to be.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 1:3</a>) Earlier he had created the heavens (including the “great lights,” the sun, moon and stars; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 136:7-9</a>) and the earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gen. 1:1</a>) So the bringing of light into existence with reference to the earth apparently involved removing whatever had formerly obstructed the sun’s rays from reaching this planet. And the “division” between light and darkness must have come about through the rotation of the earth as it moved around the sun. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 1:4, 5</a>) Much later Jehovah plagued the sun-worshiping Egyptians with darkness, a darkness that did not affect the Israelites.

There was something like the appearance of the bow that occurs in a cloud mass on the day of a pouring rain. That is how the appearance was of the brightness round about.

But freedom was granted by the Law to this Hebrew in the seventh year of his servitude. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011527/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ex. 21:2</a>) In the Jubilee (occurring every fiftieth year) liberty was proclaimed in the land to all its inhabitants.

They were making an effort to induce the Galatian Christians to give up their freedom in Christ by trying to gain righteousness by works of the Law, instead of by faith in Christ. Paul warned that they would thereby fall away from Christ’s undeserved kindness.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011527/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Gal. 5:2-6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011527/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 6:12, 13</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The freedom that the early Christians enjoyed from bondage to sin and death and from fear (“For God gave us not a spirit of cowardice, but that of power and of love and of soundness of mind”) was exemplified in the outspokenness and freeness of speech of the apostles in proclaiming the good news. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011527/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Tim. 1:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011527/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Acts 4:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011527/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> Phil. 1:18-20</a>) They recognized this freeness of speech about the Christ to be a valuable possession, one that must be developed, guarded and maintained in order to receive God’s approval.

In his letter to the congregation at Corinth he showed that he would not injure another person’s conscience by doing something he had the Scriptural freedom to do, but which might be questioned by another with less knowledge, and whose conscience might be offended by Paul’s acts. He cites as an example the eating of meat offered before an idol prior to being put in the market to be sold. Eating such meat might cause one with a weak conscience to criticize Paul’s proper freedom of action and thereby to act as a judge of Paul, which would be wrong. Therefore, Paul said: “Why should it be that my freedom is judged by another person’s conscience? If I am partaking with thanks, why am I to be spoken of abusively over that for which I give thanks?” Nonetheless, the apostle was determined to exercise his freedom in an upbuilding, not a detrimental, way.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011527/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:23-33</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>THE CHRISTIAN’S FIGHT AND MANKIND’S HOPE</strong> </p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Paul shows that there is a danger to the Christian’s freedom in that, whereas the “law of that spirit which gives life in union with Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011527/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Rom. 8:1, 2</a>), the law of sin and of death working in the Christian’s body fights to bring one into bondage again. Therefore the Christian must set his mind on the things of the spirit in order to win.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011527/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Rom. 7:21-25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011527/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 8:5-8</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">After outlining the Christian conflict, Paul goes on to speak of the joint heirs with Christ as “sons of God.” Then he refers to others of mankind as the “creation” and presents the marvelous purpose of God “that the creation itself also will be set free from enslavement to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011527/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Rom. 8:12-21</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>FIGURATIVE USE</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">When Job, in his suffering, wished to find release in death, he likened death to a freedom for those afflicted.

<strong>Light</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Light from the sun is a combination of colors, with each color having a different wavelength. The color of an object is determined by the particular portion of the light reflected by its surface. Thus light furnishes the many hues that delight the eye of man. <span id="page1067" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1067" data-before-text="1067"></span>It is also essential for earthly life—plants, animals and man—to continue.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>THE SOURCE OF LIGHT</strong></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jehovah God is the Former of light and the Creator of darkness.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gen. 1:1</a>) So the bringing of light into existence with reference to the earth apparently involved removing whatever had formerly obstructed the sun’s rays from reaching this planet. And the “division” between light and darkness must have come about through the rotation of the earth as it moved around the sun.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Job 3:16</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Psalm 49:19</a>.) “It is good for the eyes to see the sun” may be understood to mean ‘it is good to be alive.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Eccl. 11:7</a>. <span id="page1068" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1068" data-before-text="1068"></span>Morning light is picturesquely described as ‘taking hold of the ends of the earth and shaking the wicked out of it,’ because dawn disperses evildoers. Darkness is their “light,” for they are accustomed to carry out their evil deeds under its cover and this figurative “light” is taken from them by the literal light of dawn.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Job 38:12-15</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Job 24:15-17</a>.</p>
