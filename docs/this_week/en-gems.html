In general they know more about the Bible than most Catholics. Since they insist on carrying on all discussions on the basis of the Bible, a Catholic involved with them will be forced to meet them on their own grounds. While the Witnesses’ view of the Bible is a distorted one, the deplorable lack of knowledge that a Catholic is likely to have of the Holy Scriptures puts him at a serious disadvantage.

For instance, it has been pointed out that men <em>are</em> souls and beasts are souls and that the same eventuality befalls both categories, “as the one dies, so the other dies.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966683/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:19-21</a>) In the face of plain Bible statements the clergy complain against the Job-like witnesses in the words of Bildad: “Why should we be reckoned as beasts and be regarded as unclean in your eyes?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966683/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Job 18:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966683/33/1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 2 Pet. 2:12</a>) Hear now what some who are teaching that souls are roasting in hell have to say:</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="si"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>“‘Jehovah’s Witnesses,’ 70,000 strong, have just had a convention in New York [1950], making a great noise. Their [Society’s president] Nathan H. Knorr, has promised them extremely interesting things for ‘the near future,’ among which is the abolition of Hell as set forth in the Scriptures. . . . But they do not discern that the offer is made them in terms the exact opposite to the language God employs. God tells them that there is such a place as Hell, and it is not Hades or the grave. Their leaders tell them that such a place does not exist. This is plainly anti-God and brands the ‘Witnesses’ as having the ‘mark of the beast.’ God says the wicked ‘shall go away into eternal punishment’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966683/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Matt. 25:46</a>); but the ‘Witnesses’ say there is no such place. <em>But in so saying, they are preparing themselves to go there!”</em><a id="footnotesource12" data-fnid="12" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966683/11">l</a> (Brackets and italics ours)</p><p id="p114" data-pid="114" class="qu">18.

You say, ‘the offer is made them in terms the exact opposite to the language God employs.’ How can this be? <em>The New World Translation</em> does not use the Old English word ‘hell,’ but uses the very words God gave us in his original Bible, namely, Hades, Gehenna, and Tartarus. Certainly this is not making another Bible, a Bible different from the one God gave us, but is using the exact language God employs. You are far-fetched, therefore, in branding this as ‘plainly anti-God’ and as having ‘the mark of the beast.’ Jehovah’s witnesses are not abolishing Gehenna, but are putting it back into the Scriptures where it belongs. . . . Jesus warned his opposers with the admonition: ‘By your words you will be vindicated, and by your words you will be condemned.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966683/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Matt. 12:37</a>, <em>NW</em>) By your words against Jehovah’s witnesses your paper <em>The Vindicator</em> stands, not vindicated, but condemned before God and all men of good will.”<a id="footnotesource13" data-fnid="13" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966683/12">a</a> <span id="page567" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="567" data-before-text="567"></span>Once again the reader can judge who is in the right as to this teaching of the clergy on hellfire.</p>

It can be proved that among the ancient Babylonians and Egyptians the view prevailed that not only oracles but also omens of all kinds are given to men by the gods and express the minds of these gods.”<a id="footnotesource13" data-fnid="13" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966643/12">a</a> Note that in Eliphaz’s first speech he appeals to one of his Babylonish-like, spiritistic experiences to support his argument.

He understood man to be a living soul. He rejected the Babylonish view that man has an immortal soul. Job believed that man is mortal and, when man dies, he is dead.

<strong>Lamp</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">When King Zedekiah was dethroned and taken captive to Babylon, to die there, it appeared that the “lamp” was extinguished. But Jehovah had not <span id="page1024" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1024" data-before-text="1024"></span>abandoned his covenant. He merely held rulership on the throne in abeyance “until he comes who has the legal right.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012621/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ezek. 21:27</a>) Jesus Christ, the Messiah, the “son of David,” was heir to that throne forever. Thus the “lamp” of David will never go out. Jesus is therefore an everlasting lamp as the one who possesses the Kingdom forever.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012621/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matt. 1:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012621/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Luke 1:32</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>GOD’S WORD</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Because “man must live, not on bread alone, but on every utterance coming forth through Jehovah’s mouth” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012621/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matt. 4:4</a>), His commandments are like a lamp, lighting the way of God’s servant in the darkness of this world. The psalmist declared: “Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light to my roadway.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012621/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 119:105</a>) King Solomon said: “For the commandment is a lamp, and a light the law is, and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012621/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Prov. 6:23</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The apostle Peter had seen many prophecies concerning Jesus Christ fulfilled, and he had been personally present at Jesus’ transfiguration on the mountain. In view of all this, Peter could say: “Consequently we have the prophetic word made more sure; and you are doing well in paying attention to it as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until day dawns and a daystar rises, in your hearts.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012621/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">2 Pet. 1:19</a>) The Christian was encouraged, therefore, to pay attention to prophecy <em>in his heart</em>. Peter pointed out that he should get what it says, not only into his mind, but also into his heart; then it would furnish guidance in the safe way “until day dawns and a daystar rises.”</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="ss"><strong>JOHN THE BAPTIST</strong></p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">In the year 29 C.E., John the son of Zechariah, a priest, came, announcing: “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012621/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matt. 3:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012621/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Luke 1:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012621/23/2" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> 13</a>) Israel had turned away from obedience to the Law, and John was sent preaching repentance and pointing to the Lamb of God. He came “in order to bear witness about the light,” Jesus Christ. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012621/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">John 1:6, 7</a>) He succeeded in turning many of the sons of Israel back to Jehovah their God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012621/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Luke 1:16</a>) Consequently, Jesus said of John: “That man was a burning and shining lamp, and you for a short time were willing to rejoice greatly in his light. But I have the witness greater than that of John, for the very works that my Father assigned me to accomplish, the works themselves that I am doing, bear witness about me that the Father dispatched me.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012621/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">John 5:35, 36</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong>GOD’S SERVANTS</strong></p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Jesus was a lamp and a light, and he said to those professing to be God’s servants: “You are the light of the world. A city cannot be hid when situated upon a mountain. People light a lamp and set it, not under the measuring basket, but upon the lampstand, and it shines upon all those in the house. Likewise let your light shine before men, that they may see your fine works and give glory to your Father who is in the heavens.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012621/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Matt. 5:14-16</a>) The servant of God should appreciate the reason for which he is given the light, and realize that it would be utterly foolish, and disastrous for him, to refuse to let it shine from him as from a lamp.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="ss"><strong>OTHER FIGURATIVE USES</strong></p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">That which one depends upon to light his way is symbolized by a lamp. With such a figure the proverb contrasts the righteous and the wicked, saying: “The very light of the righteous ones will rejoice; but the lamp of the wicked ones—it will be extinguished.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012621/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Prov. 13:9</a>) The light of the righteous continually becomes more brilliant, but however brilliantly the lamp of the wicked appears to shine and however prosperous his way may seem as a consequence, God will see to it that he ends up in darkness, where his foot will certainly stumble. Such an outcome is ahead of the person calling down evil on his father and mother.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012621/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Prov. 20:20</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">One’s ‘lamp being extinguished’ also means that there is no future for him. Another proverb says: “There will prove to be no future for anyone bad; the very lamp of wicked people will be extinguished.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012621/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Prov. 24:20</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Bildad, when implying that Job was hiding some secret wickedness, said of the wicked: “A light itself will certainly grow dark in his tent, and in it his own lamp will be extinguished.” Farther on in his argument Bildad adds: “He will have no posterity and no progeny among his people.” In the light of the fact that David’s son Solomon was said to be a lamp that God gave him, the putting out of one’s lamp may carry the thought that such a person would have no progeny to take over his inheritance.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012621/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Job 18:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012621/31/1" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 19</a>.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="ss"><strong>THE EYE</strong></p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">One’s eye is, figuratively, a “lamp.” Jesus said: “The lamp of the body is the eye. If, then, your eye is sincere [simple; all one way; in focus; generous], your whole body will be bright; but if your eye is bad, your whole body will be dark.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012621/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Matt. 6:22, 23</a>, <em>NW,</em> 1950 ed., ftn.) The eye is like a lamp, because with it the body can walk about without stumbling or bumping into something. Jesus, of course, had in mind the ‘eyes of the heart’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012621/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Eph. 1:18</a>), as his words in the context show.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="ss"><strong>A WIFE</strong></p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">Lamps were sometimes kept burning all day so that fires could be easily kindled. Also, some burned all night. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012621/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Proverbs 31:18</a>, in saying of the good wife: “Her lamp does not go out at night,” may be using a figurative expression meaning that she works industriously at night and even rises before dawn for further work.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012621/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Proverbs 31:15</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="ss"><strong>ONE’S BREATH</strong></p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">According to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012621/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Proverbs 20:27</a>, “the breath of earthling man is the lamp of Jehovah, carefully searching all the innermost parts of the belly.” What a person “breathes out” or gives vent to, good or bad expressions, reveals or sheds light on his personality or inmost self.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012621/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Acts 9:1</a>.</p>

<strong>Firstborn, Firstling</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The firstborn is primarily the oldest son of a father (rather than the firstborn of the mother), the beginning of the father’s generative power (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deut. 21:17</a>); also, the initial male offspring <span id="page584" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="584" data-before-text="584"></span>of animals, at times designated as “firstlings.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 4:4</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">From earliest times the firstborn son held an honored position in the family and was the one who succeeded to the headship of the household.

By obeying God’s instructions concerning the slaying of a lamb and the splashing of its blood on the doorposts and upper part of the doorway of their houses, the Israelites did not lose their firstborn in death, whereas all the firstborn of the Egyptians, both of man and beast, were slain. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ex. 12:21-23,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 28, 29</a>) Evidently the firstborn son of each household is meant in most cases and not the head of the household, who may have been a firstborn. Pharaoh himself was probably a firstborn and yet his life was not taken. However it may be that not every Egyptian household had a literal firstborn son (the married couple being childless or the firstborn son having already died), and in view of the statement at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Exodus 12:30</a>, “there was not a house where there was not one dead,” the destruction could have included the chief one in the house occupying the <em>position</em> of firstborn.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Since the firstborn sons among the Israelites were those in line to become the heads of the various households, they represented the entire nation. Jehovah, in fact, referred to the whole nation as his “first-born,” it being his firstborn nation because of the Abrahamic covenant. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ex. 4:22</a>) In view of his having preserved their lives, Jehovah commanded that “every male first-born that opens each womb among the sons of Israel, among men and beasts,” be sanctified to him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ex. 13:2</a>) Thus, the firstborn sons were devoted to God.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Later Jehovah took the male Levites, evidently aside from the 300 Levite firstborn (compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Numbers 3:21, 22,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 27, 28,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 33, 34</a> with 3:39), in place of the firstborn sons of Israel, from those one month old and upward. A ransom price of five shekels had to be paid to Aaron and his sons for each of the 273 in excess of the Levites. Also, Jehovah took the domestic animals of the Levites in place of the firstborn domestic animals of the other tribes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Num. 3:40-48</a>) From that time forward, a firstborn son was to be presented to Jehovah at the tabernacle or temple after the period of the mother’s uncleanness and be redeemed by the payment of the estimated value for those from a month up to five years old, “five silver shekels by the shekel of the holy place.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Lev. 12:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 27:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/12/2" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> Num. 18:15, 16</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The firstborn males of clean animals, such as the bull, lamb or goat, were not to be redeemed. Such a bull was not to be worked nor the lamb sheared. Instead, they were to be presented to Jehovah as a sacrifice at the tabernacle or temple on the eighth day after birth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ex. 22:30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Num. 18:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/13/2" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> Deut. 15:19, 20</a>) If, however, the animal had a bad defect it was not to be sacrificed to Jehovah but was to be eaten at one’s place of dwelling.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Deut. 15:21-23</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The firstborn of an ass, an unclean animal, could not be presented as a sacrifice and, therefore, was to be redeemed or bought back by substituting a sheep in its place. Otherwise, its neck was to be broken, since it belonged to Jehovah and was not to be used by man. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ex. 13:12, 13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 34:19, 20</a>) However, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Leviticus 27:27</a> reads: “If it is among the unclean beasts and he must redeem it according to the estimated value, he must then give a fifth of it in addition to it. But if it should not be bought back, it must then be sold according to the estimated value.” Some commentators view this text as a modification of the regulation concerning the redeeming of an ass. Apparently, though, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Leviticus 27:27</a> deals with a different matter. Rather than referring to an unclean animal, such as an ass, the words “if it is among the unclean beasts” may denote an animal that was unclean in the sense of being unfit for sacrifice because of being blemished.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">David, who was the youngest son of Jesse, was called by Jehovah the “first-born,” due to Jehovah’s elevation of David to the preeminent position in God’s chosen nation and his making a covenant with David for a dynasty of kings.

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page255" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="255" data-before-text="255"></span><strong>Questions From Readers</strong></p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● At</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 2:10</strong>-<strong>14</strong></a> <strong>four rivers are mentioned. However, on Bible maps only two of these, the Hiddekel and the Euphrates, are shown. What about the other two, Pishon and Gihon?—H. N., United States.</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Before answering this question it may be well to observe that “Hiddekel,” the third river mentioned in the scripture cited, is by common consent recognized to be the river Tigris. In fact, this is the name given for it in the <em>Septuagint Version</em> at both <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 2:14</a> and at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Daniel 10:4</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">As for the first two rivers, Pishon and Gihon, there has been much conjecture on their identity. Bible dictionaries and religious encyclopedias give various theories and some go to great lengths to present these. But in the end it all amounts to conjecture.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The fact that these two rivers cannot with certainty be identified is no cause for concern. It may well be that these two no longer exist. Changes have taken place in the appearance of the earth since those words were first recorded in the book that Moses consulted when compiling this part of Genesis. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 5:1</a>) Especially is it reasonable to conclude that the flood of Noah’s day brought about great changes in the topography of the earth, even as that flood wiped out the garden of Eden, so that angels were no longer needed to guard its entrance.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 104:6-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Gen. 3:24</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">As Delitzsch so well observes in his <em>Commentary on Genesis:</em> “It is therefore unnecessary in order to establish the geographical statements of the sacred writer, that we should be able still to point to four distinct streams (the Tigris and the Euphrates among them), proceeding from a single source, which is plainly impossible. The original oneness of the four streams is, in the sense of the author, as certainly at an end as that paradise is lost.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>● What is the explanation for Lot’s being called Abraham’s brother at</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 14:14</strong></a> <strong>when he was in fact his nephew?—A. M., United States.</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Lot was, of course, the nephew of Abraham, for <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 11:31</a> says that Terah took “Abram his son and Lot, the son of Haran, his grandson,” along with him when they left Ur of the Chaldeans. However, Abraham recognized Lot as a brother, not because Lot was the son of Abraham’s dead brother Haran, but because he was in a spiritual family relationship such as obtains today between the members of the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses. Hence Abraham addressed Lot as his brother, as, for instance, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Genesis 13:8</a>, “Please, do not let any quarreling continue between me and you and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen, for we men are brothers.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In view of these facts it was consistent for <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Genesis 14:14</a> to speak of Lot as Abraham’s brother. Likewise, the members of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel addressed one another as brothers, although according to the flesh they were really cousins, all of them being sons of twelve brothers. Thus in the Christian Greek Scriptures we find the apostles repeatedly referring to their fellow Jews, not yet Christians, as “Brothers.” (See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 2:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 3:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 23:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/9/3" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> 5, 6</a>.) In the same way these Jews at times addressed the apostles as “brothers.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 2:37;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 13:15</a>) In certain instances, however, it seems that the term “brothers” was intended to apply to Jews of the same age or younger, and so we find both Stephen and Paul using the expression, “Brothers and fathers.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 7:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 22:1</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">In Biblical Hebrew there is no specific word for nephew, as is apparent from the fact that the term “nephew” is not found in the Revised Standard Version of the Bible. In Hebrew a nephew is termed either <em>ben ahh,</em> “son of a brother,” or <em>ben ahhóth,</em> “son of a sister.” The four references to nephews in the <em>Authorized Version</em> use this obsolete word for “grandson” and thus translate Hebrew and Greek words really meaning progeny or grandsons and are so rendered in the <em>New World Translation.</em> (See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Judges 12:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Job 18:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/12/2" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> Isaiah 14:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/12/3" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> 1 Timothy 5:4</a>.) The term nephew does occur in the <em>New World Translation,</em> at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 27:32</a>. However, as noted in the footnote of the first edition of that translation, as well as in the margin of the <em>Authorized Version,</em> “nephew” or son of an uncle apparently is meant, although the Hebrew word there generally does mean “uncle.” But Rotherham’s <em>Emphasised Bible</em> translates it “relative.” Let it be noted, however, that modern Hebrew does have a word for “nephew,” namely, <em>ahh·yán.</em></p>

<strong>The Power of a Kind Word</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">However, when Job himself needed encouragement, Eliphaz and his companions did not utter kind words.

What he gets is a series of absolutely ‘true’ and absolutely beautiful religious clichés and moral platitudes.” So distraught was Job at hearing the speech of Eliphaz and his companions that he was compelled to cry out: “How long will you men keep irritating my soul and keep crushing me with words?”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994727/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 19:2</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Never should we cause a fellow servant of God to cry out in distress because of our thoughtless, unkind words.

<strong>Christians Must Expect Persecution</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> A subtler form of persecution and one <span id="page595" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="595" data-before-text="595"></span>that is often very hard to bear is opposition from relatives. Sometimes newly converted Christians find that relatives whom they love dearly and who have always been very close to them now begin to oppose and persecute them, because of their new way of life. The faithful man Job had this to bear at the height of his suffering. After his losing almost everything he had, his wife turned against him, saying: “Are you yet holding fast your integrity? Curse God and die!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966722/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Job 2:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966722/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 19:17</a>) But Job, although in great pain and, no doubt, cut to the quick by this unkind onslaught from one who should have comforted him, held fast his integrity to Jehovah. And so must we under similar trials, hard though it may be. Jesus said it would happen this way: “For I came to cause division, with a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a young wife against her mother-in-law. Indeed, a man’s enemies will be persons of his own household.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966722/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 10:35, 36</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 7. What is the right attitude toward imprisonment as a form of persecution?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> A favorite method of persecution used by Satan is imprisonment. He has often used this after making false charges, as was the case with Jacob’s son Joseph, thrown into an Egyptian prison on the false charge of attempting to rape his master’s wife. This must have been very hard for Joseph to bear, knowing full well he was innocent of the vile charge. What did he do? Make a jailbreak and set himself free and try to vindicate himself of the false charges? No, indeed, Joseph did no such thing. He patiently waited for Jehovah to set him free in His own time and way. This is exactly what Jehovah did, and it resulted in Joseph’s being exalted to a high position under Pharaoh, and being used further by Jehovah for his own glory and praise. What a wonderful reward for Joseph for faithful endurance under persecution!</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 8. From what other examples of imprisonment of Jehovah’s servants can we draw courage?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Other servants of God, such as the prophet Jeremiah and the apostle Paul were thrown into prison because of their boldness in speaking the truth of God’s Word although forbidden to do so. It is always the public declaration of the truths of Jehovah’s purposes that the adversary wishes to stop. Because of their faithfulness as Jehovah’s witnesses in preaching the good news thousands of our brothers were thrown into prisons and concentration camps in Hitler’s Germany. Thousands of others have suffered similar persecution in Communist prison camps. One brother recently released spent twenty-four years in Nazi and Communist prisons and refused to compromise. Many in Nazi prisons could have bought their release by renouncing their faith, but they never have it a moment’s consideration. Indeed, they continued preaching in prison and found many of Jehovah’s “sheep” there. In all these trials they were sustained by God’s promise at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966722/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Revelation 2:10</a>: “Do not be afraid of the things you are about to suffer. Look! The Devil will keep on throwing some of you into prison that you may be fully put to the test.” Yes, they were “fully put to the test” and proved to themselves that Jehovah could bring them through.</p>

It does not seem to be necessary to endeavor to explain Job’s statement in the light of discoveries that scientists have made in recent times with the aid of microscopes. It seems that Job was simply saying that he had escaped with nothing or with next to nothing. He had escaped with the skin of his teeth, that is, with the “skin” of what apparently has no skin.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Since Jesus knew he was to be bruised by the great Serpent, Satan the Devil, in fulfillment of</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958498/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 3:15</strong></a><strong>, why did he, when dying on the torture stake, ask: “My God, my God, to what end have you forsaken me?”—</strong><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958498/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Matt. 27:46</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jesus on the torture stake asked this question, not because he did not know why Jehovah God, his heavenly Father, had forsaken him, but in order that prophecy might be fulfilled. The prophecy here fulfilled was one found in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958498/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 22</a>, which was written by David, who was a prophetic type of the Lord Jesus Christ in many respects.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the opening words of that psalm, David cries out: “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” (<em>AV</em>) When any disciples of Jesus who were standing near his torture stake, such as John and Mary, the mother of Jesus, heard him cry out those words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958498/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 22:1</a>, they may not at the time have appreciated why Jesus made such an outcry. But after understanding came upon them, following the outpouring of the holy spirit on the day of Pentecost, then they must have remembered and appreciated the fact that this prophetic outcry identified Jesus as the Christ, the Messiah of God.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">On the torture stake Jesus was indeed forsaken by his heavenly Father, Jehovah, in order that his integrity to God might be tested to the very limit. God forsook him, abandoning him to the cruel devices of Satan the Devil and his wicked religious agents on earth. Thus Satan, who has the means to cause death, was given free allowance to exercise that power against the Son of God.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">But God’s abandonment of Jesus was only as far as allowing the Devil and his dupes to put Jesus to death. This abandonment of Jesus did not include the disposal of his dead body or corpse. Instead of Jesus’ enemies taking his body down from the torture stake and casting it into the fiery valley of Hinnom (or Gehenna), his body was recovered from the torture stake by Joseph of Arimathea, who had the corpse buried in a new tomb that he had cut. This burial of Jesus meant he was in Sheol, the common grave of mankind. In Sheol he was not abandoned by Jehovah God, for <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958498/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 139:8</a> (which was written by David, a type of Jesus Christ) says: “If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, thou art there.” (<em>AS</em>) Hence on the third day after Jesus’ death Jehovah God showed that he had not permanently abandoned Jesus, by raising him from the dead to spirit life immortal. When Jesus later appeared to his disciples that same resurrection day he could therefore say: “All the things written in the law of Moses and in the Prophets and Psalms about me must be fulfilled,” including <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958498/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 22:1</a> (<em>AV</em>), namely, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958498/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Luke 24:44</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Where Did It Originate?</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">It may come as a surprise to many <span id="page14" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>that Bible events have made a generous contribution to the English language. For instance, the miraculous handwriting on the wall of King Belshazzar’s palace meant doom for mighty Babylon.

Interestingly, scientists have come to realize that the enamel covering of the teeth is not just a dead shell. Rather, they speak of it as a “superskin” produced by epithelial (skin) cells.</p>

<strong>Sivan</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Sivan comes at the end of the spring when the intense heat of summer is approaching; this is mentioned by Josephus in describing a slaughter of Samaritans by the Roman army in that month. (<em>Wars of the Jews,</em> Book III, chap.

He may come to ruin in trying to get them. At any rate, his craving with laziness turns him away from God the Source of life.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012643/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Prov. 21:25</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The Christian who is lazy is not cultivating the fruitage of the spirit, which will enliven and activate (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012643/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Acts 18:25</a>), but is actually bringing himself into trouble. He is catering to the desires of the flesh.

It seems that some of the younger widows expressed themselves as desirous of using their freedom as widows to engage zealously in the Christian ministry. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012643/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:34</a>.) Evidently some of such were given material assistance. But instead of using in a proper manner the greater freedom and additional time thus afforded them, they became idle, unoccupied, beginning to gad about. They became gossipers and meddlers in other people’s affairs, talking of things they ought not. For this reason, the apostle Paul instructed the overseer Timothy not to put such persons on the list for aid, but to let them marry and use their energies and directive tendencies in having children and a household to manage.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012643/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Tim. 5:9-16</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">In the matter of material assistance in the Christian congregation, the Bible rule is: “If anyone does not want to work, neither let him eat.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012643/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">2 Thess. 3:10</a>) The family head must provide for his household, and the wife must not eat “the bread of laziness.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012643/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Prov. 31:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012643/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 5:8</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>AVOID SLUGGISHNESS IN STUDY AND IN THE MINISTRY</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Counsel is given against laziness as to studying and getting a deeper understanding of God’s purposes and as to engaging in the Christian ministry. The apostle Paul reproved some unprogressive Hebrew Christians, pointing out: “You have become dull [sluggish] in your hearing. For, indeed, although you ought to be teachers in view of the time, you again need someone to teach you from the beginning the elementary things of the sacred pronouncements of God; and you have become such as need milk, not solid food.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012643/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Heb. 5:11, 12</a>) He also admonishes: “Do not loiter [be slothful] at your business. Be aglow with the spirit.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012643/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Rom. 12:11</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Jesus foretold that there would be a class of persons claiming to be his servants who would become sluggish and wicked, not working to increase the Master’s interests in the earth.

<strong>Resurrected—“Each In His Own Proper Place”</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> During the time of Job’s affliction, he did not see God’s face as being favorable to him. Do we today sometimes feel that, because of the trouble God lets come upon us, he is looking with disapproval upon us, and we should like to see a change of <span id="page21" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>facial expression toward us? On the coming “last day” there will be a resurrection of the human dead from Sheol, or Haʹdes, and this very fact will signify that Jehovah God looks upon redeemed mankind with favor. Job believed that there would be a resurrection for him and others of mankind because there was a “redeemer,” someone who would provide the purchase price to buy him back from the “compulsory service” into which he had been sold.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">22, 23. (a) Because of confidence in what did Job believe that there would be one to provide a basis for his resurrection? (b) When did Job expect this “redeemer” to come, and whose face of favor did Job expect to see?</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> Job had confidence in his personal integrity toward Jehovah in spite of the men who falsely accused him. Hence, he felt sure that there would be a “redeemer” for him. This “redeemer” would rise up after Job’s death, but Job would leave behind a good record for his “redeemer” to consider. In the confidence that the coming “redeemer” would furnish the basis for a resurrection, Job exclaimed:</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> “And I myself well know that my redeemer is alive, and that, coming after me, he will rise up over the dust. And after my skin, which they have skinned off,​—this! Yet reduced in my flesh [due to the skinning] I shall behold God, whom even I shall behold for myself, and whom my very eyes will certainly see, but not some stranger. My kidneys have failed deep within me,” because of the tremendousness of the expectation.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979447/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Job 19:25-27</a>.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">24. How did the “redeemer” whom God provided become related to humankind, and what did this one give as “a ransom in exchange for many”?</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> So, then, let Satan the Devil keep on maligning mankind as being unfit for a resurrection because of an inability to produce men and women who would keep their integrity toward God. Resurrection of dead mankind will take place on the “last day” mentioned by Martha of Bethany. Why so? Because God, for whom nothing is impossible, has produced a “redeemer,” his only-begotten Son who became related to humankind by being born as a perfect man. He came temporarily to earth, not to be served, “but to minister and to give his [human] soul a ransom in exchange for many.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979447/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Matt. 20:28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979447/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> Mark 10:45</a>) This paved the way for God to sanction the resurrection of as many as were ransomed or redeemed by the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">25. Why will the “last day” not be the final one for mankind to exist, and, on that “day,” what will God do in behalf of mankind?</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"><sup>25</sup></span> Consequently, the “last day” does not mean the final day for mankind to exist, inasmuch as the resurrection of redeemed mankind takes place on that “day” under Christ’s millennial reign. This will be “the last day” after all the previous days during which God has let sin and death rule over mankind with countless millions going down into Sheol, or Haʹdes. That will be the “day” for God to count redeemed mankind as acquitted of all past sins and to teach them his righteous requirements for them to gain everlasting life in a paradise restored to earth.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979447/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Isa. 26:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979447/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Rom. 6:7</a>.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">26. (a) What was Christ’s “own proper place” with regard to the resurrection? (b) How does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979447/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a> show that there will be a resurrection of others in order of rank or of place or of importance?</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"><sup>26</sup></span> So there had to be the death and resurrection of the “redeemer” before there could be a resurrection of mankind that needed to be redeemed. Thus the resurrection of the Redeemer Jesus Christ proved to be of the first rank. He was resurrected “in his own proper place” as regards place of importance. Moreover, there will be a resurrection of others in order of rank or of place or of importance, before the resurrection of Job, the slaughtered babes of Bethlehem and others of dead mankind. This is called to our attention by the inspired words written in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979447/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>, which read: “And the dead in Christ shall rise first.” (<em>American Standard Version</em>) Who are those who shall share first in a resurrection, and when and how will this be?</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="se"><strong>[Picture on page 17]</strong></p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> Imagine the joy of welcoming back from the dead faithful men of old, and the happiness of mothers receiving back their young ones killed by Herod!</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Job’s Reward—A Source of Hope</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Completely humbled, Job acknowledged his wrong viewpoint and admitted that he had spoken without knowledge. Yet, he had expressed faith that he would “behold God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994844/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Job 19:25-27</a>) How could that happen, since no human can see Jehovah and live on? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994844/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Exodus 33:20</a>) Actually, Job saw the manifestation of divine power, heard God’s word, and had his eyes of understanding opened to see the truth about Jehovah. Job therefore ‘made a retraction and repented in dust and ashes.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994844/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Job 42:1-6</a>) The many questions that he had been unable to answer had proved God’s supremacy and had shown the smallness of man, even one as devoted to Jehovah as Job was. This helps us to see that our interests are not to be put above the sanctification of Jehovah’s name and the vindication of his sovereignty.

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The hard consequences of the unscriptural divorce bear just as heavily upon the divorcer as upon the divorcee. Therefore the hard consequences of an unscriptural divorce should stand as a warning to any prospective divorcer so that he will consider first the limitations and restrictions and dangers that would result from his unscriptural course to his own self as well as to his innocent marriage mate. It is not the prerogative or obligation of the Christian congregation to relieve the divorced couple of the hard consequences of their unscriptural divorce. In its tendency toward mercy the Christian congregation must not go beyond what is written in God’s Word and attempt a reversal of the situation by doing something that it is not authorized to do. A man that forces an unscriptural divorce through becomes very responsible toward the innocent, undeserving mate inasmuch as he makes the post-divorce life and course of her very hard with respect to morality. If the innocent divorcee goes <span id="page96" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="96" data-before-text="96"></span>bad, the Christian congregation is not primarily responsible for not sanctioning her remarriage before the death or post-divorce adultery of her ex-husband. The self-seeking divorcer is the responsible one, according to the Scriptures. All that the Christian congregation can do legitimately is to help her to grow straight morally as a Christian by extending to her all the spiritual help possible.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Because of his adultery, unrepented of before the divorce, the unfaithful husband could be disfellowshiped by the Christian congregation of which he may be a baptized member. By concealing his adultery from wife and congregation he may postpone his disfellowshipment for a time. If in addition to his concealed adultery he undertakes to divorce his innocent wife, then he shows that he has not repented of his adultery. Neither does he have his wife’s forgiveness for it. Hence he must be disfellowshiped by the congregation when the facts of the matter become known. To the wrong that he has committed against his wife by the adultery that he has concealed from her he hardheartedly adds injury by suing for divorce from her in her innocence. For his moral uncleanness, of which his hypocritical, unloving course shows he has not repented, he must be disfellowshiped from the Christian congregation on the basis of the evidence laid before the congregation’s judicial committee.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn"><strong>● What is the meaning of</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961090/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Job 19:26</strong></a><strong>? In the <em>King James Version</em> it reads the opposite of the way it does in the <em>American Standard Version;</em> the one saying, “Yet in my flesh shall I see God,” and the other, “Then without my flesh shall I see God.”—J.G., U.S.A.</strong></p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The <em>New World Translation</em> of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961090/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 19:26</a> reads: “Yet reduced in my flesh I shall behold God.” Under footnote b it gives two alternate renderings: “Yet out of my flesh,” and, “Yet apart from my flesh.” The <em>American Standard Version,</em> which reads “without my flesh,” has a footnote reading, “Yet from my flesh shall I see God.”</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Why these differences in translations and the presence of the footnotes? These are no doubt due to the ambiguity of the Hebrew text. However, the thought seems to be that Job, when so wasted away as to be merely skin and bones, and thus practically “without flesh,” or “reduced in my flesh,” would “see” God. Job cannot be accused of here speaking ill-advisedly, as some would have it, but rather prophetically. He himself did later “see” God by seeing the manifestation of his power, by hearing his voice by means of the Word or Logos, and by having the eyes of his understanding opened to see the truth about God. Because of this he could say: “In hearsay I have heard about you, but now my own eye does see you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961090/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 42:5</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Not that faithful Job himself literally saw Jehovah God, for God plainly told Moses: “You are not able to see my face, because no man may see me and yet live.” The apostle John testified to the same effect, saying: “No man has seen God at any time.” “At no time has anyone beheld God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961090/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ex. 33:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961090/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> John 1:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961090/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 1 John 4:12</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Our Spiritual Health and the Kidneys</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Well, now, why did King David specially mention the kidneys? It was in order to make his point. He was magnifying the depth of penetration on the part of God’s spirit and visual powers, reaching as far down as into Sheol, the common grave of mankind. God can also peer down deep into the human body, as far down as the kidneys, these being below the heart and the diaphragm and toward the base of the spine. And when God created the embryo and kept it screened off in the belly of David’s mother, he could see down to the location for these deep-seated organs. Nothing blocked his visual powers or the range of his creative spirit. Indicating the deep location of these sensitive organs, the greatly afflicted patriarch Job said: “My kidneys have failed deep within me [or, literally, “within my bosom”].”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977805/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 19:27</a>, <em>NW; Leeser.</em></p>

<strong>Examinations Yet Ahead for a Graduating Class</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span id="page352" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="352" data-before-text="352"></span>Before the distribution of diplomas, F. W. Franz also addressed the class. He reminded them of the school examinations that they had had earlier, but then arrested their attention by asking: “Have you had the more vital and serious examination of your kidneys?” He showed from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977410/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 19:27</a> that in the Bible “kidneys” often represent the innermost recesses of one’s being. So, when <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977410/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jeremiah 17:10</a> says that Jehovah ‘examines the kidneys,’ Franz explained, this is not a medical examination, but is done in a judicial capacity. In their postgraduate life, the speaker pointed out, the missionaries will face such an examination of their kidneys. How? In that new situations in life will confront them. When put to the test, what will they really prove to be, deep inside? The psalmist David, though a sinner, did not fear such an inspection by God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977410/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 26:1-3</a>) Nor should we. Concluding, Franz advised: “Be genuine Christians, not hypocritical, not counterfeit. Be sound Christians down to the core of your personality. If you are, you will pass the examination of your kidneys with everlasting credits to yourself and a clean bill of spiritual health.”</p>
