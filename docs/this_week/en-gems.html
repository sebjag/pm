<strong>“Do Not Forget All His Doings”</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> You can say that “there is no God,” if you wish, and that “God is dead.” The evolutionist says, “I proved there is no God,” but that will not change matters. Jehovah speaks boldly through his Word to the immoral ones and all “forgetters of God,” and warns that he will tear them <span id="page13" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>to pieces. Despite all their howling when the war of Armageddon in the great day of God the Almighty strikes, there will be no deliverer. Then Jehovah will surely set things in order for the blessing of those who love righteousness.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>OFFERING THANKSGIVING</strong></p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 9. How does the psalmist describe one who does not forget God?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Maybe you are one of those who really love God and who are practicing his sayings and have not forgotten God’s Word. To such the psalmist says: “The one offering thanksgiving as his sacrifice is the one that glorifies me; and as for the one keeping a set way, I will cause him to see salvation by God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969002/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 50:23</a>) Are you keeping a set way, along with thousands of persons who are offering thanksgiving to Jehovah daily? Keep on glorifying Jehovah by preaching from house to house and encouraging people who love righteousness to study his Word. “Keeping a set way,” the righteous way, will cause an even greater crowd of people to sing God’s praises day and night and to see salvation.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu">10, 11. Of what benefit to others can a person be if he does not forget God?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> The best way to keep from forgetting God is to keep thinking about him. Get acquainted with what he wants done and then do it. Jehovah says through the psalmist: “Do give ear, O my people, to my law; incline your ear to the sayings of my mouth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969002/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 78:1</a>) Is there any value in doing this? Are there benefits? Is there something to be gained? Is it rewarding to incline your ears and to listen to what God has to say and then do it? It certainly is! Not only will you personally profit by inclining your ears to the sayings of Jehovah’s mouth, but another good purpose is this: “In order that the generation to come, the sons that were to be born, might know them, that they might rise up and relate them to their sons, and that they might set their confidence in God himself and not forget the practices of God but observe his own commandments.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969002/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ps. 78:6, 7</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> How many people in Christendom today really want their children to “set their confidence in God himself”? Before you can instill such confidence in your children, you must learn about Jehovah and “not forget the practices of God.” How can your children know anything about God unless you yourself observe God’s commandments and teach them to your children?</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">12. Whose responsibility is it to teach children God’s commandments, and why?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Humankind is the creation of Jehovah God. He knows better how we should conduct our lives and live them than anyone else does. Educators and scientists think they know better how to teach and conduct the lives of children. Parents who believe the Word of God and observe God’s commandments, however, are the ones that have the responsibility. It cannot be given to the State. The Israelites were instructed to teach their children the things <span id="page14" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>that they saw and heard and to inculcate in the minds of their children the principles of truth and righteousness. The State is not doing this, and every year fewer people teach their children what the Bible counsels. Every person who professes to be a true Christian should say: “With your orders I will concern myself, and I will look to your paths. For your statutes I shall show a fondness. I shall not forget your word.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969002/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 119:15, 16</a>) How pointed and direct this advice! Have you concerned yourself as to what Jehovah’s statutes are? Do you want to know the orders of God and his regulations for proper living? Even in the normal processes of life most people recognize order and law and get acquainted with the rules of the land, but far more important are the laws that Jehovah has had written. These pertain to our living, and our children’s living, forever. We must show a fondness for His statutes, and we must not forget his Word, the Holy Bible. Teach them to your children.</p>

Indeed, without an illustration he would not speak to them, in order to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet who said: ‘I will open my mouth with illustrations.’” The prophet mentioned by Matthew was the writer of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102007054/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 78:2</a>.

(Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002147/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mr 4:30</a>.) Most English translations simply use the anglicized form “parable” to render the Greek term. However, this translation does not serve to convey the full meaning in every instance.</p>

Matthew tells us so. After relating illustrations in which Jesus likened the Kingdom to a developing mustard grain and to leaven, Matthew states: “Without an illustration [Jesus] would not speak to them; that there might be fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet who said: ‘I will open my mouth with illustrations, I will publish things hidden since the founding.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011605/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Matt. 13:31-35</a>) Proverbial sayings, or parables, were among Jesus’ effective means of teaching.</p>

<strong>The Field of Bible Prophecy</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Another study of plenary utterance of divine revelations is that of the case of Jesus Christ while he walked on the earth. On the occasion of his baptism at the Jordan A.D. 29 and his anointing with the holy spirit, Jesus had ‘the heavens opened up’ to him, which enabled him to recall his prehuman associations with the Father in heaven. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952285/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Matt. 3:16</a>, <em>NW</em>) This made it possible for him to recall all the multitude of personal conversations he had with heavenly authorities in the ages past of his ancient existence. Jesus’ spirit-begetting and receiving the gift of the spirit now made it possible for him to repeat verbatim the pronouncements God discussed with him and in turn transmit them to man on the earth. So here we have plenary communication in its highest form, with Jesus <span id="page246" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="246" data-before-text="246"></span>Christ serving as the greatest prophet that ever was appointed by God. Hear Jesus’ own words in support of this. “I have not spoken out of my own impulse, but the Father himself that sent me has given me a commandment as to what to tell and what to speak. Also I know that his commandment means everlasting life. Therefore the things I speak, just as the Father has told me them, so I speak them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952285/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">John 12:49, 50</a>, <em>NW</em>) This makes Jesus Christ the greatest authority in the universe aside from Jehovah himself. What force this adds to Peter’s quotation of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952285/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 18:19</a>: “Indeed, any soul that does not listen to that Prophet will be completely destroyed from among the people”! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952285/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Acts 3:23</a>, <em>NW</em>) But some will say that Jesus did not record his plenary utterances while on earth. True, Jesus did no Bible writing himself, yet he made ample provision for the recording of his verbatim utterances and this again by means of God’s active force. Jesus said: “But the helper, the holy spirit which the Father will send in my name, that one will teach you all things and BRING BACK TO YOUR MINDS ALL THE THINGS I TOLD YOU.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952285/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">John 14:26</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">15, 16. Describe and give examples of inspiration that was accompanied by the playing of music.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> The second interesting manner of inspiration was that which accompanied the playing of music. Some may reason that the playing of the harp or musical instrument was in order to quiet and compose the mind of the prophet that he might better receive the impressions of God’s spirit. But evidently it was for prophetic illustration, because the harp is symbolically used to represent the means of sounding forth harmoniously, impressively and with more power the message of God. This accompaniment of the harp to prophecy by inspiration is referred to at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952285/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Psalm 49:3, 4</a>, which reads: “My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding. I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.” Another prophecy accompanied by music was <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952285/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Psalm 78:2</a>, which says: “I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old.” Jesus, a speaker in parables, is the one who fulfills the above prophecy.—See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952285/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Matthew 13:34, 35</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> After the prophet Samuel had anointed Saul as the first king over all Israel, Samuel told Saul that as a sign that Jehovah was with him he would meet up with a band of prophets with a psaltery, a timbrel, and a pipe and a harp and that he would prophesy among them. Just as Samuel had foretold, Saul did prophesy in accompaniment with music. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952285/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">1 Sam. 10:5, 6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952285/40/1" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> 9, 10</a>, <em>AS</em>) What Saul said in prophesying among the prophets may not have been predictions of things to come but only praises and prayers to God; still it was done under the influence of God’s spirit. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952285/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">1 Sam. 19:20-24</a>) Another specific case of inspiration under music is that of Elisha on his meeting up with the military expedition of Kings Jehoram and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom against the king of Moab.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952285/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">2 Ki. 3:15-17</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">17, 18. Describe inspiration by vision. Give examples.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> After the days of Samuel, the record shows that many of the prophets received inspired revelations in the manner of visions. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952285/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">1 Sam. 3:1</a>, <em>AS</em>) It appears that when a prophet received a vision, the impression of the revelation, utterance or picture of God’s purpose was made upon his conscious mind. During such period of consciousness when the prophet was wide awake the active force of God would ‘bear along’ or superimpose the divine impressions so vividly upon the mind of the prophet that he could clearly remember every detail. It seems the vision was then left for the prophet to describe in his own <span id="page247" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="247" data-before-text="247"></span>words under supervision of the unerring spirit of God. To the extent that the prophet was left to his own words of description and expression, he was not a mere automaton or robot, but had the divine guidance in order to express truthfully the things showed to him so vividly. The very fact that all the many prophets wrote their prophecies and revelations in their own varying styles bears out the above suggestions. Otherwise the messages conveyed through visions to the many different prophets would have been plenary inspiration where the word-for-word style would be similar, because it was the one active force that had moved all these different servants to write.</p>

For, says the apostle Peter, “maintain your conduct fine among the nations.” Why so? In order, Peter continues, “that . . . they may as a result of your fine works of which they are eyewitnesses <em>glorify God.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:12</a>) So when dealing with outsiders you must be patient and long-suffering. You must show kindness and neighbor love. You must exercise self-control. You must prove your uncompromising integrity to Jehovah when facing the everyday issues. And there are so many issues presented by this materialistic, sex-crazed system of things, including such vital matters as blood transfusions, regimented servitude and saluting of images of the State, all of which must be met with the same intelligent determination as displayed by first-century Christians who boldly declared: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Acts 5:29</a>.</p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">24.

Satan and his agents are very much opposed to you young ones worshiping and serving Jehovah, and they will try to stop you, just as the religious rulers of Jesus’ day tried to prevent children from praising Jehovah. In rebuking that Satanic crowd Jesus asked them: “Did you never read this, ‘Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you [Jehovah] have furnished praise’?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matt. 21:16</a>) So also today, Jehovah it is who has provided and furnished you young ones with the privilege and ability of praising Him.

Certainly it is not to the Republic of Israel or to Christendom, but to you united worshipers and witnesses of Jehovah that the invitation is given: “Be praising our God, all you his slaves, who fear him, the small ones and the great.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Rev. 19:5</a>) Really, you have the grandest song to sing that was ever written.

So keep on singing. Keep on increasing your individual and collective praise of your Grand Creator, all to your own everlasting blessing and to the glory, honor, vindication and eternal praise of Jehovah!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Pss. 97:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/32/1" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> 145:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/32/2" data-bid="33-3" class="b"> 150:1-6</a>.</p>

Despite all their howling when the war of Armageddon in the great day of God the Almighty strikes, there will be no deliverer.

Are there benefits? Is there something to be gained? Is it rewarding to incline your ears and to listen to what God has to say and then do it? It certainly is! Not only will you personally profit by inclining your ears to the sayings of Jehovah’s mouth, but another good purpose is this: “In order that the generation to come, the sons that were to be born, might know them, that they might rise up and relate them to their sons, and that they might set their confidence in God himself and not forget the practices of God but observe his own commandments.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969002/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ps. 78:6, 7</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> How many people in Christendom today really want their children to “set their confidence in God himself”? Before you can instill such confidence in your children, you must learn about Jehovah and “not forget the practices of God.” How can your children know anything about God unless you yourself observe God’s commandments and teach them to your children?</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">12.

He knows better how we should conduct our lives and live them than anyone else does. Educators and scientists think they know better how to teach and conduct the lives of children. Parents who believe the Word of God and observe God’s commandments, however, are the ones that have the responsibility. It cannot be given to the State. The Israelites were instructed to teach their children the things <span id="page14" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>that they saw and heard and to inculcate in the minds of their children the principles of truth and righteousness. The State is not doing this, and every year fewer people teach their children what the Bible counsels. Every person who professes to be a true Christian should say: “With your orders I will concern myself, and I will look to your paths. For your statutes I shall show a fondness. I shall not forget your word.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969002/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 119:15, 16</a>) How pointed and direct this advice! Have you concerned yourself as to what Jehovah’s statutes are? Do you want to know the orders of God and his regulations for proper living? Even in the normal processes of life most people recognize order and law and get acquainted with the rules of the land, but far more important are the laws that Jehovah has had written. These pertain to our living, and our children’s living, forever. We must show a fondness for His statutes, and we must not forget his Word, the Holy Bible. Teach them to your children.</p>

So as to have twelve tribes again, the tribe of Joseph was divided into two tribes, those of his two sons Ephraim and Manasseh.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Num. 3:12, 13,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 41;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 10:14-28</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">It follows that in listing the twelve tribes of spiritual Israel not all the names of the tribes could appear and there still be only the symbolic number of twelve. It might be thought that the original twelve tribes would be named in the book of Revelation, but not so. The tribes of Ephraim and Dan are omitted there as not deserving of symbolic significance. Why?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Ephraim had had a most favored start. Jehovah himself had said of Ephraim, “He is my first-born.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jer. 31:9</a>) Ephraim, though the younger of Joseph’s two sons, inherited the right of the first-born by reason of Jacob’s blessing upon him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 48:13-20</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In spite of this favored start the tribe of Ephraim produced a notoriously bad record. It grumbled against its inheritance in the land; it “vehemently tried to pick a quarrel with” Gideon; it fought against Jephthah; and concerning it we further read: “The sons of Ephraim, though armed shooters of the bow, retreated in the day of fight.” No wonder that Jehovah “proceeded to reject the tent of Joseph, and the tribe of Ephraim he did not choose. But he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loved.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Josh. 17:14, 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Judg. 8:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 12:1-6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/5/3" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> Ps. 78:9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/5/4" data-bid="6-5" class="b"> 67, 68</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Ephraim took the lead in the rebellion against the house of David as represented by Jeroboam. More than that, it despised the covenant for the kingdom, warring against the kingdom of Judah, and it poured contempt upon the covenant of Levi by establishing rival calf worship throughout the ten-tribe kingdom. Concerning Ephraim we further read: “They did not keep the covenant of God, and in his law they refused to walk.” “O Ephraim, you have played the harlot.” “Ephraim is a cake not turned”; meaning that it was halfhearted in its devotion to Jehovah God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Ki. 12:25-30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 13:3-20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Ps. 78:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/6/3" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> Hos. 5:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/6/4" data-bid="7-5" class="b"> 7:8</a>, <em>RS.</em></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">However, it is to be noted that Ephraim is really represented in Joseph his father, for Joseph’s other son, Manasseh, is given a separate individual mention and standing in the list.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The tribe of Dan also made a bad name for itself. The very terms of the blessing upon this tribe, as uttered by Jacob upon his deathbed, imply this tribe would take an unfavorable course: “Let Dan prove to be a serpent by the roadside, a horned snake at the wayside, that bites the heels of the horse so that its rider falls backward.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 49:17</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">It is also noteworthy that the only ancient historical incident specifically dealing with the Danites tells of some of them falling away to idolatry. Apparently they were the first to do so. Thus in the Targum of Jonathan “Dan” is a byword for idolatry. When Jeroboam instituted calf worship, he did so by setting up one of the calves at the chief city of the Danites, the city of Dan: “They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, As thy god, O Dan, liveth; . . . they shall fall, and never rise up again.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Judg. 18:1-31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Amos 8:14</a>, <em>AS</em>) Dan’s place was taken by Manasseh in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Revelation 7:6</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">In view of the foregoing it is easy to see why the names of Ephraim and Dan do not appear among the twelve tribes of spiritual Israel.</p>

B., U.S.A.</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The law, as stated at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>, shows that fathers were not to be put to death for their sons nor were sons to be put to death for their fathers. In man’s administration of justice each was to die for his own sin, and not drag innocent relatives down with him. In <span id="page480" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="480" data-before-text="480"></span>this particular case of David and Bath-sheba neither of them had a right to the child and so there was no injustice in their being deprived of it. Besides, as an uncircumcised, unnamed infant it had not as yet developed any personality pattern or consciousness so as to appreciate life. Then again, Bath-sheba could have been stoned to death for her adultery, in which case the unborn child would also have perished. However, as previously noted in <em>The Watchtower,</em> David was shown mercy because of the Kingdom covenant, which Jehovah had made with him. Nevertheless, to drive home the fact of Jehovah’s displeasure he let the child die, which was a very severe blow to King David. Two similar instances are recorded in David’s life: One was in connection with the death of Uzzah, who tried to steady the ark of the covenant; the other was the destruction of tens of thousands of Israelites because King David presumptuously and proudly determined to number the hosts of Israel.

<strong>Zoan</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004754/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 78:12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004754/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 43</a>, “the field of Zoan” is used parallel to “the land of Egypt” in recounting Jehovah’s miraculous acts on behalf of Israel leading up to the Exodus. This has caused some scholars to hold that Moses’ meetings with Pharaoh took place at Zoan. Similarly, it has led to the effort to link Zoan (Tanis) with the city of Rameses, as well as with the city of Avaris, referred to by Manetho in his account about the so-called Hyksos kings. Thus, many modern reference works say that Zoan’s name changed to Avaris under the “Hyksos,” then changed to Rameses under the Ramesside dynasty, and finally reverted to Zoan (in the Greek form Tanis). It may be noted, however, that the Bible uses the name Zoan consistently as applying before the Exodus (back to Abraham’s time), at the time of the Exodus, and as late as the eighth, seventh, and sixth centuries B.C.E. (in the time of the prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel).</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">If Zoan were the site of Moses’ interviews with Pharaoh, this would certainly give some indication as to the starting point of the Exodus route. However, several factors place this view in doubt. For Zoan to refer to such a site, the expression “the field of Zoan” would have to be viewed, not as simply <em>paralleling</em> “the land of Egypt,” but as a much more <em>specific</em> expression, designating the precise location where the miracles occurred. Such a limiting or restrictive sense would not actually fit the case, for the Ten Plagues did not occur in just one part of Egypt (such as a portion of the Delta) but throughout the entire land. This would seem to support the view that “the field of Zoan” is used as a parallel of “the land of Egypt.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Those modern scholars who endeavor to present Zoan (or, according to their attempted connection, Avaris or Rameses) as Pharaoh’s residence at the time of the Exodus also face a lack of Biblical support and agreement in several respects. The Bible shows that Moses’ first encounter took place at the edge of the Nile River. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004754/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex 7:14, 15</a>) Zoan (Tanis) is not on the actual river but at the terminus of one of the ancient branches forking off from the main stream. In attempting to locate the city of Rameses at the same place as Zoan, or Tanis, they also pass over the fact that Zoan was already a city in Abraham’s time, whereas the Biblical Raamses (“Rameses,” <em>NE</em>) began to be built by the Israelites in Egypt about 400 years later (unless by “building” the Bible means “building up,” or strengthening).​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004754/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ex 1:11</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">These scholars would make Zoan (Avaris-Rameses, as they identify it) the Egyptian capital <span id="page1239" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1239" data-before-text="1239"></span>at the time of the Exodus, whereas the Bible identifies Rameses as merely a ‘storage place.’ And, in holding that Ramses II was the Pharaoh of the Exodus because of his claim that he was the builder of the city of Rameses (or, more accurately, a place called Per-Ramses), they ignore the fact that the building of the Biblical Rameses began 80 years or more before the Exodus (before the birth of Moses [<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004754/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex 1:11–2:10</a>]), whereas historians credit Ramses II with a rule of only about 66 years.​—See <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004754/0">RAAMSES, RAMESES</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The question remains, then, why “the field of Zoan” is apparently used to parallel “the land of Egypt” with regard to Jehovah’s performance of miraculous acts. While a possible connection with Pharaoh’s court cannot be completely discounted, it is also entirely possible that the great age of the city caused the psalmist to use Zoan in such a way, it apparently being one of the earliest cities founded in Egypt. Its use, if this was the case, might be similar to the use of “Plymouth Rock” as representing the early colonizing of the United States. Or it may be due to its prominence and its location at the entrance to Egypt for those coming from Palestine, perhaps being the first major city Jacob’s family encountered when coming into Egypt. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004754/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isa 30:2-4</a>; see <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004754/1">HANES</a>.) Lying as it does near the northern extremity of Egypt, its “field” might even figuratively refer to all the Nile Valley stretching to the S thereof, as far as the southern boundary of Egypt.</p>

There are many aids of which we can avail ourselves. One of these is the regular study of God’s Word with the helps he has provided, for his Word is “beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963887/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:16, 17</a>) Another great aid is prayer, talking to God. Still another aid is the weekly gathering of ourselves together at our Kingdom Halls and neighborhood Bible studies, where we can incite one another to love and fine works. Nor would we overlook the strength that comes from zealous activity in the ministry. By taking advantage of all such aids we shall be able to resist any tendency to shrink back and thus keep from failing our God in this time of the end.</p>

However, most showed an ungrateful attitude toward the very One who delivered them from slavery in Egypt.

Nevertheless, there would come a time when “the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ” would be clearly recognized, when he would exercise authority as “the happy and only Potentate” and “the King of those who rule as kings and Lord of those who rule as lords.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012825/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:13-16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012825/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Dan. 2:44;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012825/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 7:13, 14</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">In view of the coming Kingdom and of Christ’s manifestation, Paul said to Timothy: “I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is destined to judge the living and the dead, and by his manifestation and his kingdom, preach the word.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012825/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Tim. 4:1, 2</a>) The apostle thus pointed to the time when Christ’s glorious position in heaven would be made unmistakably manifest, when he would make God’s judgments felt in the earth.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong><em>In destroying the “man of lawlessness</em>”</strong></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">In writing to Christians in Thessalonica “respecting the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ,” Paul urged them not to be shaken from their reason or to be excited by any message “to the effect that the day of Jehovah is here.” The symbolic “man of lawlessness,” which had been operating for centuries in opposition to God and Christ, would then be brought to nothing “by the manifestation of his presence.” This “lawless one” would recognize Christ’s presence, not by faith, as would Christians, who loved his manifestation, but by Jesus’ power manifested in annihilating those of this composite “man.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012825/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Thess. 2:1-8</a>; see MAN OF LAWLESSNESS.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>MANIFESTATION OF THE SPIRIT AND THE TRUTH</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">After the holy spirit was poured out on Christ’s disciples, the fact of its invisible operation on these disciples was ‘manifested’ by visible evidences.

<strong>Does Jehovah Have Feelings?</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">IF THE answer is yes, then another question arises: Does our conduct affect God’s feelings? That is, can we by our actions cause God to feel happy or hurt? Some ancient philosophers said no. They argued that no one can influence God and that God must therefore be incapable of feeling. But the Bible gives a different picture, namely, that Jehovah has tender feelings and deeply cares about what we do. Consider the words found at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011484/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 78:40, 41</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011484/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 78</a> recounts God’s dealings with ancient Israel. After delivering the nation from slavery in Egypt, Jehovah offered to enter into a special relationship with them. He promised that if they would remain obedient to his laws, they would become his “special property” and be used in an extraordinary way to fulfill his purpose. The people agreed and entered into the Law covenant. Did they live up to their end of the agreement?​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011484/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Exodus 19:3-8</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The psalmist says: “How often they would rebel against him in the wilderness!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011484/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Verse 40</a>) The next verse adds: “Again and again they would put God to the test.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011484/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Verse 41</a>) Notice that the writer describes a pattern of rebellion. This ugly spirit surfaced early​—in the wilderness shortly after their deliverance from Egypt. The people began to murmur against God, questioning whether he was able and willing to care for them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011484/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Numbers 14:1-4</a>) A reference work for Bible translators says that the words “they would rebel against him” might be “rendered idiomatically as ‘they made their hearts hard against God’ or ‘they said “No” to God.’” Yet, in his mercy, Jehovah would forgive his people when they demonstrated repentance. But then they would return to their old ways and rebel again, and the pattern continued.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011484/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 78:10-19,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011484/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 38</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">How did Jehovah feel each time his fickle people rebelled? “They would make him feel hurt,” says <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011484/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">verse 40</a>. Another translation says that they would “give him cause for grief.” One Bible reference work explains: “The meaning here is that the conduct of the Hebrews was such as was fitted to cause pain,​—as the conduct of a disobedient and rebellious child is.” Just as an unruly child can cause his parents much pain of heart, the rebellious Israelites “pained even the Holy One of Israel.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011484/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Verse 41</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">What can we learn from this psalm? It is reassuring to see that Jehovah has a strong attachment to his worshippers and is not quick to give up on them. At the same time, it is sobering to consider that Jehovah has feelings and that our conduct can affect his feelings. How does knowing that affect you? Does it move you to want to do what is right?</p>

<strong>God as a Personality</strong><br/><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">What kind of person do you grow to love? Is it not likely one who has tender feelings, one who loves you and tries to show it in many unselfish ways, perhaps even making big sacrifices for your benefit? This is exactly the type of Person the Bible shows God to be. The fact that he is spoken of as ‘feeling hurt’ and being “pained” tells us that he has tender feelings and is intensely interested in others.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101979242/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 78:38-41</a>.</p>

<strong>Would a God of Love Torment Souls?</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The extent of God’s love for humankind is evident from his view of those who transgress his laws. Though their actions make him “feel hurt” and ‘pain’ him, he does not immediately flare up against them in anger.

<strong>God’s Patience and Your Worship</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In what a wonderful way Almighty God exercises this quality! When the covering cherub in the garden of Eden turned the first human pair away from him, how it must have pained God! Yet he allowed the rebellion to continue and grow, even though he had the power to wipe it out immediately. But in what way has the enduring <span id="page262" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="262" data-before-text="262"></span>of this evil rebellion and the resulting history of wickedness been beneficial? Why show patience with rebellious persons?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">God has been patient with an important and beneficial end in view. First, to teach everyone once and for all that he is the all-powerful God who can carry out his declared purposes no matter what the opposition may be. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963321/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ex. 9:16</a>) Secondly, to allow an opportunity for the sinful offspring of Adam and Eve to repent and take advantage of his provisions for salvation. An outstanding demonstration of this patience of God was in the days of Noah prior to the flood.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">At that time “the badness of man was abundant in the earth and every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only bad all the time.” This evildoing caused God to feel “hurt at his heart,” but he did not impatiently destroy mankind. No, God patiently took steps to provide a way of salvation for any who would repent. He instructed Noah to build a massive ark and to preach a message that warned of impending destruction. Over 2,400 years later the apostle Peter observed that “the <em>patience</em> of God was waiting in Noah’s days, while the ark was being constructed.” Was not this exercise of patience a merciful consideration on God’s part?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963321/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 6:5, 6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963321/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 3:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963321/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 2 Pet. 2:5</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">After the Flood God continued to show patience. “He was merciful; he would cover the error and not bring ruin. And many times he made his anger turn back, and he would not rouse up all his rage. And he kept remembering that they were flesh.” But God’s nation of Israel spurned his patience, as the psalmist records: “How often they would rebel against him in the wilderness, they would make him feel hurt in the desert! And again and again they would put God to the test, and they pained even the Holy One of Israel.” Yet God endured the pain and distress of this unfaithful people, but the more patience he showed the worse they became. Certainly it is just on God’s part when he finally executes judgment!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963321/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 78:38-41</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>GOD’S PATIENCE TODAY</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Today mankind has reached the climax of the ages. Evildoing has reached its apex. The human race flouts the righteous principles of the Bible and ridicules its message of a new world. But, as in Noah’s day, God patiently endures these distressing conditions. Many, however, mistake this patience for evidence that God will not require an accounting. In effect, they mimic the unfaithful Jews, who, prior to God’s execution of judgment, said: “Jehovah will not do good, and he will not do bad.” But they were wrong, and so will all those prove to be who copy their attitude today. This is one of the points the apostle Peter makes in the third chapter of his second letter.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">After using Noah’s day as an illustration of God’s taking action against evildoing, Peter assured that this present world is “being reserved to the day of judgment and of destruction of the ungodly men.” But when? The apostle warned against impatience. Christians must get the proper perspective—God’s view of matters. “However, let this one fact not be escaping your notice, beloved ones,” he wrote, “that one day is with Jehovah as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day.” Although it had been over 2,400 years since “the world of that time suffered destruction when it was deluged with water,” Peter was emphasizing that from God’s point of view that was only about two and a half days ago. Add another 1,899 years since these words were penned about A.D. 64, and it still adds up, from God’s viewpoint, to less than two-thirds of a week! Really, <span id="page263" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="263" data-before-text="263"></span>can we accuse God of slowness?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963321/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:3-8</a>.</p>

The Bible says: “Jehovah loves justice, and he will not abandon his loyal ones.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021207/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 37:28</a>) He is also <strong>“very tender in affection and merciful,”</strong> especially toward people who are suffering.

<strong>Does Jehovah Have Feelings?</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">IF THE answer is yes, then another question arises: Does our conduct affect God’s feelings? That is, can we by our actions cause God to feel happy or hurt? Some ancient philosophers said no. They argued that no one can influence God and that God must therefore be incapable of feeling. But the Bible gives a different picture, namely, that Jehovah has tender feelings and deeply cares about what we do. Consider the words found at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011484/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 78:40, 41</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011484/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 78</a> recounts God’s dealings with ancient Israel. After delivering the nation from slavery in Egypt, Jehovah offered to enter into a special relationship with them. He promised that if they would remain obedient to his laws, they would become his “special property” and be used in an extraordinary way to fulfill his purpose. The people agreed and entered into the Law covenant. Did they live up to their end of the agreement?​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011484/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Exodus 19:3-8</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The psalmist says: “How often they would rebel against him in the wilderness!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011484/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Verse 40</a>) The next verse adds: “Again and again they would put God to the test.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011484/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Verse 41</a>) Notice that the writer describes a pattern of rebellion. This ugly spirit surfaced early​—in the wilderness shortly after their deliverance from Egypt. The people began to murmur against God, questioning whether he was able and willing to care for them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011484/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Numbers 14:1-4</a>) A reference work for Bible translators says that the words “they would rebel against him” might be “rendered idiomatically as ‘they made their hearts hard against God’ or ‘they said “No” to God.’” Yet, in his mercy, Jehovah would forgive his people when they demonstrated repentance. But then they would return to their old ways and rebel again, and the pattern continued.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011484/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 78:10-19,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011484/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 38</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">How did Jehovah feel each time his fickle people rebelled? “They would make him feel hurt,” says <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011484/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">verse 40</a>. Another translation says that they would “give him cause for grief.” One Bible reference work explains: “The meaning here is that the conduct of the Hebrews was such as was fitted to cause pain,​—as the conduct of a disobedient and rebellious child is.” Just as an unruly child can cause his parents much pain of heart, the rebellious Israelites “pained even the Holy One of Israel.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011484/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Verse 41</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">What can we learn from this psalm? It is reassuring to see that Jehovah has a strong attachment to his worshippers and is not quick to give up on them. At the same time, it is sobering to consider that Jehovah has feelings and that our conduct can affect his feelings. How does knowing that affect you? Does it move you to want to do what is right?</p>

<strong>God as a Personality</strong><br/><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">What kind of person do you grow to love? Is it not likely one who has tender feelings, one who loves you and tries to show it in many unselfish ways, perhaps even making big sacrifices for your benefit? This is exactly the type of Person the Bible shows God to be. The fact that he is spoken of as ‘feeling hurt’ and being “pained” tells us that he has tender feelings and is intensely interested in others.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101979242/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 78:38-41</a>.</p>

<strong>Zoan</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004754/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 78:12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004754/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 43</a>, “the field of Zoan” is used parallel to “the land of Egypt” in recounting Jehovah’s miraculous acts on behalf of Israel leading up to the Exodus. This has caused some scholars to hold that Moses’ meetings with Pharaoh took place at Zoan. Similarly, it has led to the effort to link Zoan (Tanis) with the city of Rameses, as well as with the city of Avaris, referred to by Manetho in his account about the so-called Hyksos kings. Thus, many modern reference works say that Zoan’s name changed to Avaris under the “Hyksos,” then changed to Rameses under the Ramesside dynasty, and finally reverted to Zoan (in the Greek form Tanis). It may be noted, however, that the Bible uses the name Zoan consistently as applying before the Exodus (back to Abraham’s time), at the time of the Exodus, and as late as the eighth, seventh, and sixth centuries B.C.E. (in the time of the prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel).</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">If Zoan were the site of Moses’ interviews with Pharaoh, this would certainly give some indication as to the starting point of the Exodus route. However, several factors place this view in doubt. For Zoan to refer to such a site, the expression “the field of Zoan” would have to be viewed, not as simply <em>paralleling</em> “the land of Egypt,” but as a much more <em>specific</em> expression, designating the precise location where the miracles occurred. Such a limiting or restrictive sense would not actually fit the case, for the Ten Plagues did not occur in just one part of Egypt (such as a portion of the Delta) but throughout the entire land. This would seem to support the view that “the field of Zoan” is used as a parallel of “the land of Egypt.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Those modern scholars who endeavor to present Zoan (or, according to their attempted connection, Avaris or Rameses) as Pharaoh’s residence at the time of the Exodus also face a lack of Biblical support and agreement in several respects. The Bible shows that Moses’ first encounter took place at the edge of the Nile River. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004754/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex 7:14, 15</a>) Zoan (Tanis) is not on the actual river but at the terminus of one of the ancient branches forking off from the main stream. In attempting to locate the city of Rameses at the same place as Zoan, or Tanis, they also pass over the fact that Zoan was already a city in Abraham’s time, whereas the Biblical Raamses (“Rameses,” <em>NE</em>) began to be built by the Israelites in Egypt about 400 years later (unless by “building” the Bible means “building up,” or strengthening).​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004754/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ex 1:11</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">These scholars would make Zoan (Avaris-Rameses, as they identify it) the Egyptian capital <span id="page1239" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1239" data-before-text="1239"></span>at the time of the Exodus, whereas the Bible identifies Rameses as merely a ‘storage place.’ And, in holding that Ramses II was the Pharaoh of the Exodus because of his claim that he was the builder of the city of Rameses (or, more accurately, a place called Per-Ramses), they ignore the fact that the building of the Biblical Rameses began 80 years or more before the Exodus (before the birth of Moses [<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004754/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex 1:11–2:10</a>]), whereas historians credit Ramses II with a rule of only about 66 years.​—See <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004754/0">RAAMSES, RAMESES</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The question remains, then, why “the field of Zoan” is apparently used to parallel “the land of Egypt” with regard to Jehovah’s performance of miraculous acts. While a possible connection with Pharaoh’s court cannot be completely discounted, it is also entirely possible that the great age of the city caused the psalmist to use Zoan in such a way, it apparently being one of the earliest cities founded in Egypt. Its use, if this was the case, might be similar to the use of “Plymouth Rock” as representing the early colonizing of the United States. Or it may be due to its prominence and its location at the entrance to Egypt for those coming from Palestine, perhaps being the first major city Jacob’s family encountered when coming into Egypt. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004754/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isa 30:2-4</a>; see <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200004754/1">HANES</a>.) Lying as it does near the northern extremity of Egypt, its “field” might even figuratively refer to all the Nile Valley stretching to the S thereof, as far as the southern boundary of Egypt.</p>

The Devil’s helplessness and failure to evade and offset these blows offer continuing proof that there is none like Jehovah. The gadflies that stung and tormented man and beast had a decimating effect on the Egyptian economy. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970564/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 78:45</a>) So the Kingdom message’s exposure of all the false doctrines and pagan mysteries of Satan’s false religion has been destructive of the influence wielded by his religious organization among credulous multitudes. The falsity of teachings such as the triune deity, the divine right of kings, immortality of the human soul, transmigration of souls, tortures in literal fires of hell or purgatory, teachings that the clergy have always delighted to inculcate in the gullible masses, has now been laid bare. The widely published Bible truths on these matters have maddened the false shepherds of worldly religion, while the true source of the superstitious fears under which they have labored and been victimized is made plain to many.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Why do not the tribes of Ephraim and Dan appear among those of spiritual Israel as given at</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Revelation 7:4-8</strong></a><strong>?—P. R., U.S.A.</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It is clear from the Scriptures that Jehovah purposed the number twelve, the multiple of two symbolically complete numbers, three and four, to represent organizational completeness. This is seen not only in there being twelve sons of Jacob and twelve tribes of Israel, but also in there being “the twelve apostles of the Lamb.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rev. 21:14</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Early in the wilderness journey the tribe of Levi was exchanged for all the first-born survivors, who belonged to Jehovah by reason of his sparing them on the night of the first Passover. So as to have twelve tribes again, the tribe of Joseph was divided into two tribes, those of his two sons Ephraim and Manasseh.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Num. 3:12, 13,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 41;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 10:14-28</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">It follows that in listing the twelve tribes of spiritual Israel not all the names of the tribes could appear and there still be only the symbolic number of twelve. It might be thought that the original twelve tribes would be named in the book of Revelation, but not so. The tribes of Ephraim and Dan are omitted there as not deserving of symbolic significance. Why?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Ephraim had had a most favored start. Jehovah himself had said of Ephraim, “He is my first-born.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jer. 31:9</a>) Ephraim, though the younger of Joseph’s two sons, inherited the right of the first-born by reason of Jacob’s blessing upon him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 48:13-20</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In spite of this favored start the tribe of Ephraim produced a notoriously bad record. It grumbled against its inheritance in the land; it “vehemently tried to pick a quarrel with” Gideon; it fought against Jephthah; and concerning it we further read: “The sons of Ephraim, though armed shooters of the bow, retreated in the day of fight.” No wonder that Jehovah “proceeded to reject the tent of Joseph, and the tribe of Ephraim he did not choose. But he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loved.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Josh. 17:14, 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Judg. 8:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 12:1-6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/5/3" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> Ps. 78:9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/5/4" data-bid="6-5" class="b"> 67, 68</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Ephraim took the lead in the rebellion against the house of David as represented by Jeroboam. More than that, it despised the covenant for the kingdom, warring against the kingdom of Judah, and it poured contempt upon the covenant of Levi by establishing rival calf worship throughout the ten-tribe kingdom. Concerning Ephraim we further read: “They did not keep the covenant of God, and in his law they refused to walk.” “O Ephraim, you have played the harlot.” “Ephraim is a cake not turned”; meaning that it was halfhearted in its devotion to Jehovah God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Ki. 12:25-30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 13:3-20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Ps. 78:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/6/3" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> Hos. 5:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/6/4" data-bid="7-5" class="b"> 7:8</a>, <em>RS.</em></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">However, it is to be noted that Ephraim is really represented in Joseph his father, for Joseph’s other son, Manasseh, is given a separate individual mention and standing in the list.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The tribe of Dan also made a bad name for itself. The very terms of the blessing upon this tribe, as uttered by Jacob upon his deathbed, imply this tribe would take an unfavorable course: “Let Dan prove to be a serpent by the roadside, a horned snake at the wayside, that bites the heels of the horse so that its rider falls backward.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 49:17</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">It is also noteworthy that the only ancient historical incident specifically dealing with the Danites tells of some of them falling away to idolatry. Apparently they were the first to do so. Thus in the Targum of Jonathan “Dan” is a byword for idolatry. When Jeroboam instituted calf worship, he did so by setting up one of the calves at the chief city of the Danites, the city of Dan: “They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, As thy god, O Dan, liveth; . . . they shall fall, and never rise up again.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Judg. 18:1-31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Amos 8:14</a>, <em>AS</em>) Dan’s place was taken by Manasseh in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Revelation 7:6</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">In view of the foregoing it is easy to see why the names of Ephraim and Dan do not appear among the twelve tribes of spiritual Israel.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn"><strong>● How can</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b"><strong>Deuteronomy 24:16</strong></a><strong>, which says, “Children should not be put to death on account of fathers,” be harmonized with the fact that the offspring of the adulterous relation between David and Bath-sheba died due to their sin, as shown in</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>2 Samuel 12:14</strong></a><strong>?—J. B., U.S.A.</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The law, as stated at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>, shows that fathers were not to be put to death for their sons nor were sons to be put to death for their fathers. In man’s administration of justice each was to die for his own sin, and not drag innocent relatives down with him. In <span id="page480" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="480" data-before-text="480"></span>this particular case of David and Bath-sheba neither of them had a right to the child and so there was no injustice in their being deprived of it. Besides, as an uncircumcised, unnamed infant it had not as yet developed any personality pattern or consciousness so as to appreciate life. Then again, Bath-sheba could have been stoned to death for her adultery, in which case the unborn child would also have perished. However, as previously noted in <em>The Watchtower,</em> David was shown mercy because of the Kingdom covenant, which Jehovah had made with him. Nevertheless, to drive home the fact of Jehovah’s displeasure he let the child die, which was a very severe blow to King David. Two similar instances are recorded in David’s life: One was in connection with the death of Uzzah, who tried to steady the ark of the covenant; the other was the destruction of tens of thousands of Israelites because King David presumptuously and proudly determined to number the hosts of Israel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Chron. 15:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 21:1-27</a>) Such records as these magnify the supremacy of Jehovah God and underscore the words: “He [God] doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960569/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Dan. 4:35</a>, <em>AS.</em></p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Note that by disobedience the Edenic beauty of the land would be lost, and subsequent rebellious unfaithfulness on the part of the Israelites did cause the loss of the paradiselike condition of the Promised Land. The earth today is not ordained to bring forth thorns <span id="page639" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="639" data-before-text="639"></span>and thistles as a result of the curse in Eden. That curse vanished with the Flood waters. In many parts of the earth today there are natural spots of breath-taking beauty and grandeur, and other locations men have transformed into glorious parks and gardens. But for the most part men have ruined the earth and ravaged the animal and plant realms because of commercial greed or sheer destructive lust. They have forgotten or ignored God’s purpose for man and the earth, shunned Jehovah’s true worship, and brought upon themselves divine disfavor rather than blessings, just as the Israelites did. The Bible speaks of curses for disobedience, and these curses will be climaxed at Armageddon in a devouring of earth’s wicked dwellers, when Jehovah God through Christ will “bring to ruin those ruining the earth”. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951766/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Lev. 26:14-39;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951766/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Deut. 27:15-26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951766/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 28:15-68;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951766/6/3" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> Isa. 24:5, 6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951766/6/4" data-bid="7-5" class="b"> Rev. 11:18</a>, <em>NW</em>) It is the curse for disobedience and false worship that <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951766/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Revelation 22:3</a> (<em>NW</em>) mentions: “And no more will there be any curse.” The anointed remnant of spiritual Israel have been cleansed of past derelictions in matters of worship, and their field of worship has become pure and blessed like the original Eden. In Jehovah’s due time and under the reign of Christ’s kingdom, Armageddon survivors and resurrected ones will be used to fulfill the mandate to subdue the literal earth and transform it into an earth-wide paradise filled with praise for Jehovah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951766/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 150:1-6</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>● Why did Jehovah select Israel’s first human king from the tribe of Benjamin and hold out to that one the hope of the kingship remaining in his house forever, when previous prophecy had named Judah as the tribe from which kings would come?—R. G., Cuba.</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Leah was the first one to marry and bear children for Jacob, but it was so only by a deception worked on Jacob. Rachel was the one he loved and bargained for, and hence it was to Rachel’s offspring that the birthright was to go, though Jacob’s offspring by Leah were older. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951766/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Gen. 29:18-28</a>) Sarah was the beloved wife of Abraham, and it was to her offspring Isaac that the birthright went, even though Abraham’s son Ishmael by Hagar was older. So it was with Rachel’s offspring Joseph. However, Joseph became no tribal head in Israel, but his sons Manasseh and Ephraim did. Manasseh was the older, but divine direction caused the better blessing to go to Ephraim. Of him Jehovah said: “Ephraim is my firstborn.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951766/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gen. 48:8-20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951766/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Jer. 31:9</a>) However, the tribe of Ephraim later eliminated itself from this favored position by many derelictions, and the psalmist tells of Jehovah’s action: “He refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: but chose the tribe of Judah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951766/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 78:9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951766/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 67, 68</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">With Joseph, by Ephraim’s failure, eliminated, Rachel’s other offspring, Benjamin, had to have its chance. That opportunity came with Saul’s anointing as king, for Saul was a Benjamite. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951766/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Samuel 13:13</a> it speaks of the possibility of Saul’s kingdom being established forever; but we must remember that the Hebrew word here translated “forever” is <em>ohlahm</em>. As shown in previous <em>Watchtowers</em> and in the <em>“Let God Be True”</em> book, this Hebrew word means a period of concealed or indefinite time, not necessarily for everlasting. True, Jehovah God knew before time that the kingdom would not remain in the house of Benjamin; but it was Saul’s own presumptuous and faithless course that caused his loss of the kingship for his household and tribe. The mere exercise of Jehovah’s power of foreknowledge did not actively force Saul to act reprehensibly. On his own Saul acted contrary to the express commands of Jehovah God, fully responsible for these violations in the face of knowledge of his sins.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">With the favored Rachel’s offspring having had their chance, the older sons of Leah would be in line for the blessing of kingship. Ahead of Judah were Reuben, Simeon and Levi. All three of these were eliminated by the occurrences mentioned by Jacob at the time of his blessing of his sons. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951766/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Gen. 49:3-7</a>) Moreover, later the Levites acted in noteworthy faithfulness and were rewarded by being given the blessings of the priesthood. That would prevent any of their number from becoming king. So Judah was now next in line, and the prophecy at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951766/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Genesis 49:8-12</a> shows he would succeed in gaining the kingship, and being the human ancestor of the King who will reign forever, Christ Jesus. Of course, in all this Jehovah was under no obligation to conform to the general practice concerning the firstborn and birthright privileges. He could have chosen whomever he wanted, right at the outset, without eliminating those first in line according to human procedures.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"></p>

<strong>David</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">All this training while caring for sheep prepared David for the greater role of shepherding Jehovah’s people, as it is written: “[Jehovah] chose David his servant and took him from the pens of the flock.

<strong>Shepherding the Sheep with Skillfulness</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> One’s being in the position of an overseer, however, places a much greater responsibility upon one as shepherd of the sheep. An overseer, however, always keeps in mind that Jehovah is the Great Shepherd, not himself. David said: “Jehovah is my Shepherd.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959443/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 23:1</a>) Jehovah is chiefly responsible, then, for the gathering of and caring for the sheep, but he does use men to do the shepherding. Since 1919 we see not only the remnant of the anointed “little flock” being gathered, but we also see a great crowd of “other sheep” being gathered in, particularly since 1935. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959443/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Luke 12:32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959443/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> John 10:16</a>) The remaining ones or remnant of the little flock were scattered during the cloudy and dark days of World War I, but now many of the remnant, having been gathered, are being used to do shepherding work. All of them as ministers of God have gone out with <span id="page364" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="364" data-before-text="364"></span>the good news of the Kingdom and they have been preaching it and have been doing the divine will during the past forty years. They have been hunting for the sheep and have been bringing them in and feeding them with the necessary spiritual food.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> In other words, there must be a great ingathering. However, all these sheep, the little flock and the other sheep, Jehovah now has made into one co-operative company or flock, all being heirs of life in the new world of righteousness. Faithfully Jehovah has done everything he promised for his people, but there are some things that Christians must do for themselves, and especially overseers, who must be faithful shepherds of the flock, or congregation. Christ Jesus is the Greater David, and when on earth he took on the responsibility of a shepherd and set the right example for other overseers. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959443/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 78:70-72</a> refers to Jesus when it says: “He [Jehovah] chose David his servant . . . He brought him in to be a shepherd over Jacob his people and over Israel his possession. And he began to shepherd them according to the integrity of his heart, and with the skillfulness of his hands he began leading them.” Just like that Christ Jesus was a skillful shepherd. His Father said to him: “You loved righteousness and hated lawlessness.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959443/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Heb. 1:9</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>ACQUIRING SKILLFULNESS</strong></p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu">11. How does a shepherd acquire skillfulness?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Skill means the ability that comes with knowledge and practice; aptitude. Jesus, the Right Shepherd, had knowledge of God’s Word. He practiced what the Word taught. He applied it to his own life, thus showing wisdom and understanding. He recognized Jehovah God as the Great Shepherd and he directed the minds of men toward Jehovah, his Father, not toward himself. He was chosen by God to be the right kind of shepherd. Undershepherds today must be like Jesus and not be interested in having the flock for themselves. With integrity-keeping hearts they must skillfully shepherd God’s flock. How necessary it is, then, for overseers to have knowledge and in wisdom put that knowledge to work! A shepherd is not an awkward, clumsy, careless overseer. He uses God’s Word skillfully in caring for the other sheep. When the Right Shepherd, Jesus Christ, by holy spirit made appointments of the apostles to do shepherding work, they were put in that work because they knew how to use the Word of God “for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness,” and they did this work skillfully.

Remember, all are sheep, whether overseers or not. All are sheep under the Great Shepherd, Jehovah, and the Right Shepherd that he has chosen, Jesus Christ.

So to others Peter said: “Shepherd the flock of God in your care, not under compulsion, but willingly, neither for love of dishonest gain, but eagerly, neither as lording it over those who are God’s inheritance, but becoming examples to the flock.

<strong>David</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">All this training while caring for sheep prepared David for the greater role of shepherding Jehovah’s people, as it is written: “[Jehovah] chose David his servant and took him from the pens of the flock. From following the females giving suck he brought him in to be a shepherd over Jacob his people and over Israel his inheritance.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps 78:70, 71;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 2Sa 7:8</a>) However, when David first left his father’s sheep it was not to take over the kingship. Instead, he served as the court musician upon the recommendation of an adviser of Saul, who described David not only as “skilled at playing” but also as “a valiant, mighty man and a man of war and an intelligent speaker and a well-formed man, and Jehovah is with him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1Sa 16:18</a>) So David became the harpist to troubled Saul, as well as his armor-bearer.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001130/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1Sa 16:19-23</a>.</p>

<strong>Pursuing My Purpose in Life</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">At the assembly some asked me about going back to India. How did I feel? Did I really want to go? I guess it is a case of, “Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.” I have a lot of treasures in India. For ten years, along with others, I have worked, hoping to see a Marathi unit organized—one of the largest of the <span id="page344" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="344" data-before-text="344"></span>local language groups. We have had many disappointments with those that would like to ‘lord it over those of God’s inheritance’ and have had to start all over again. Just before leaving for New York, though, a Marathi unit was formed and now there was the anxiety to get back and see how they were doing. I am glad to report that they are doing very well.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">But that was not the only reason to rush back. Have you had the joy of going back to a brother or good-will person, knowing that he was waiting for you, and telling him about the assembly? In India I knew there was not one but hundreds of our brothers waiting to hear about Jehovah’s will as revealed at the assembly. In fact, we were going back to prepare for the largest assembly of our brothers ever to come together in India and to tell them what happened in New York. Here, for the first time, we were going to translate all the talks into five languages simultaneously so that all could understand. Oh, what happiness, to look out on that sea of happy, eager faces and see how Jehovah had prospered our work in the preceding ten or more years!</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Now there are 1,514 publishers of the Kingdom in India. How happy I am that Jehovah has made it possible for me to enjoy these years aiding my brothers and the good-will persons here where the need is so great. I know that it is the only work worth while before Armageddon and I feel confident, as I look to the years ahead, that by keeping my dedication vows I will find the greatest happiness and years of satisfying service.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Shepherding the Sheep with Skillfulness</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> One’s being in the position of an overseer, however, places a much greater responsibility upon one as shepherd of the sheep. An overseer, however, always keeps in mind that Jehovah is the Great Shepherd, not himself. David said: “Jehovah is my Shepherd.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959443/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 23:1</a>) Jehovah is chiefly responsible, then, for the gathering of and caring for the sheep, but he does use men to do the shepherding. Since 1919 we see not only the remnant of the anointed “little flock” being gathered, but we also see a great crowd of “other sheep” being gathered in, particularly since 1935. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959443/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Luke 12:32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959443/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> John 10:16</a>) The remaining ones or remnant of the little flock were scattered during the cloudy and dark days of World War I, but now many of the remnant, having been gathered, are being used to do shepherding work. All of them as ministers of God have gone out with <span id="page364" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="364" data-before-text="364"></span>the good news of the Kingdom and they have been preaching it and have been doing the divine will during the past forty years. They have been hunting for the sheep and have been bringing them in and feeding them with the necessary spiritual food.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> In other words, there must be a great ingathering. However, all these sheep, the little flock and the other sheep, Jehovah now has made into one co-operative company or flock, all being heirs of life in the new world of righteousness. Faithfully Jehovah has done everything he promised for his people, but there are some things that Christians must do for themselves, and especially overseers, who must be faithful shepherds of the flock, or congregation. Christ Jesus is the Greater David, and when on earth he took on the responsibility of a shepherd and set the right example for other overseers. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959443/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 78:70-72</a> refers to Jesus when it says: “He [Jehovah] chose David his servant . . . He brought him in to be a shepherd over Jacob his people and over Israel his possession. And he began to shepherd them according to the integrity of his heart, and with the skillfulness of his hands he began leading them.” Just like that Christ Jesus was a skillful shepherd. His Father said to him: “You loved righteousness and hated lawlessness.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959443/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Heb. 1:9</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>ACQUIRING SKILLFULNESS</strong></p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu">11. How does a shepherd acquire skillfulness?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Skill means the ability that comes with knowledge and practice; aptitude. Jesus, the Right Shepherd, had knowledge of God’s Word. He practiced what the Word taught. He applied it to his own life, thus showing wisdom and understanding. He recognized Jehovah God as the Great Shepherd and he directed the minds of men toward Jehovah, his Father, not toward himself. He was chosen by God to be the right kind of shepherd. Undershepherds today must be like Jesus and not be interested in having the flock for themselves. With integrity-keeping hearts they must skillfully shepherd God’s flock. How necessary it is, then, for overseers to have knowledge and in wisdom put that knowledge to work! A shepherd is not an awkward, clumsy, careless overseer. He uses God’s Word skillfully in caring for the other sheep. When the Right Shepherd, Jesus Christ, by holy spirit made appointments of the apostles to do shepherding work, they were put in that work because they knew how to use the Word of God “for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness,” and they did this work skillfully. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959443/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:16</a>) All undershepherds must use the Word of God in the same way.
