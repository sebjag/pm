<strong>Word Pictures in the Bible—Do You Understand Them?</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The correct understanding of word pictures not only enlightens our minds but also touches our hearts. We feel the heaviness of sin when it is likened to a debt. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009326/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Luke 11:4</a>) But when Jehovah forgives us and cancels the debt that would otherwise be charged against our account, what a relief we feel! When we are told that he ‘covers over’ and ‘blots out’ our sins​—wiping the slate clean as it were—​we are reassured that he will not hold such sins against us in the future. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009326/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 32:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009326/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Acts 3:19</a>) And how comforting it is to know that Jehovah can take sins that are as glaring as scarlet or crimson and make them as white as snow!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009326/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Isaiah 1:18</a>.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/427/0">6/1/2001, p. 30</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Confession That Leads to Healing</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">After David confessed, he did not regress to a negative sense of worthlessness. His expressions in the psalms that he wrote about confessions show the relief he felt and his determination to serve God faithfully. Look, for example, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001407/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Psalm 32</a>. In verse 1, we read: “Happy is the one whose revolt is pardoned, whose sin is covered.” No matter how serious the sin, a happy outcome is possible if a person is sincere in his repentance. One way to show this sincerity is by accepting full responsibility for one’s actions, as David did. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001407/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">2 Samuel 12:13</a>) He did not try to justify himself before Jehovah or attempt to pass the blame on to others. Verse 5 says: “My sin I finally confessed to you, and my error I did not cover. I said: ‘I shall make confession over my transgressions to Jehovah.’ And you yourself pardoned the error of my sins.” Genuine confession brings relief, so that a person no longer needs to be plagued by his conscience over past wrongs.</p>

As David foretold in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Psalm 32:1, 2</a>: “Happy is the one whose transgression is pardoned, whose sin is covered. Happy is the man to whose account Jehovah does not put error, and in whose spirit there is no deceit.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Rom. 4:5-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/40/1" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> Jer. 31:31-34</a>, <em>AS</em>) By this covenant we are taken out from all the worldly nations to become a people for Jehovah’s name, that is, Jehovah’s happy, righteous witnesses. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Acts 15:14</a>) In these last days the remnant of those upon whom Jehovah has bestowed his loving-kindness have been gathered to him so as to serve as witnesses of his kingdom to all nations in all the inhabited earth.</p><p id="p84" data-pid="84" class="qu">24. What purpose does the Kingdom serve, and who had to conceive the idea of a covenant for it, and do the Psalms also speak of this?</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[84]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> In Jehovah’s exalted arrangement the Kingdom serves the most important purpose. It is the special means by which Jehovah will vindicate his position as the universal Sovereign Lord. In this kingdom he has a representative of his on the throne, one whom he anoints to be King. Early after the flood of Noah’s day Jehovah raised up a king on earth who foreshadowed Jehovah’s anointed King of the new world. His name was Melchizedek, and he was king of the city of Salem and at the same time priest of the Most High God. No creature in heaven or on earth could arrange to make himself king of the new world. It was Jehovah who had to conceive the idea of such a king and to make a covenant or solemn agreement with one whom he wanted to hold this kingship. Jesus Christ is the one whom Jehovah has anointed to be the King, the one with whom he has made the special covenant for the kingdom of the heavens. Since Jesus showed his disciples that the Psalms had so much to say prophetically about him, do we find some psalms speaking of the Kingdom covenant and of Melchizedek? We do. Jehovah chose the family line of King David as the one through whom the Messiah, the anointed King of the new world, should come. So Jehovah made with David a covenant for a permanent kingdom.</p><p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="qu">25. How did Ethan the Ezrahite appeal to God in the name of the Kingdom covenant in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/89/0" data-bid="90-1" class="b">Psalm 89</a>?</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[85]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"><sup>25</sup></span> In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Psalm 89</a> Ethan the Ezrahite makes an appeal to Jehovah God in the name of this kingdom covenant; he quotes Jehovah as saying: “I have concluded a covenant toward my chosen one; I have sworn to David my servant: ‘Even to time indefinite I shall firmly establish your seed, and I will build your throne to generation after generation.’ He himself calls out to me: ‘You are my Father, my God and the Rock of my salvation.’ Also I myself shall place him as first-born, the most high of the kings of the earth. To time indefinite I shall preserve my loving-kindness toward him, and my covenant will be faithful to him. And I shall certainly set up his seed forever and his throne as the days of heaven. I shall not profane my covenant, and the expression out of my lips I shall not change. Once I have sworn in my holiness, to David I will not tell lies. His seed itself will prove to be even to time indefinite and his throne as the sun in front of me. As the moon it will be firmly established for time indefinite and be a faithful witness in the skies.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Ps. 89:3, 4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/43/1" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> 26-29,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/43/2" data-bid="44-3" class="b"> 34-37</a>.</p><p id="p86" data-pid="86" class="qu">26.

Jehovah has sworn to David, truly he will not draw back from it: ‘Of the fruitage of your belly I shall set on your throne. If your sons will keep my covenant and my reminders that I shall teach them, their sons also forever will sit upon your throne.’ For Jehovah has chosen Zion; he has longed for it as a dwelling for himself: ‘ . . . There I shall cause the horn of David to grow. I have set in order a lamp for my anointed one. His enemies I shall clothe with shame, but upon him his diadem will flourish.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Ps. 132:10-18</a>) Since the Kingdom is the powerful means by which Jehovah has chosen to vindicate his universal sovereignty, how could we even think that Jehovah would draw back what he has solemnly sworn to King David even though it was thirty centuries ago! He is a God that faithfully keeps his covenant.</p>

As David foretold in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Psalm 32:1, 2</a>: “Happy is the one whose transgression is pardoned, whose sin is covered. Happy is the man to whose account Jehovah does not put error, and in whose spirit there is no deceit.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Rom. 4:5-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/40/1" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> Jer. 31:31-34</a>, <em>AS</em>) By this covenant we are taken out from all the worldly nations to become a people for Jehovah’s name, that is, Jehovah’s happy, righteous witnesses. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Acts 15:14</a>) In these last days the remnant of those upon whom Jehovah has bestowed his loving-kindness have been gathered to him so as to serve as witnesses of his kingdom to all nations in all the inhabited earth.</p><p id="p84" data-pid="84" class="qu">24. What purpose does the Kingdom serve, and who had to conceive the idea of a covenant for it, and do the Psalms also speak of this?</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[84]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> In Jehovah’s exalted arrangement the Kingdom serves the most important purpose. It is the special means by which Jehovah will vindicate his position as the universal Sovereign Lord. In this kingdom he has a representative of his on the throne, one whom he anoints to be King. Early after the flood of Noah’s day Jehovah raised up a king on earth who foreshadowed Jehovah’s anointed King of the new world. His name was Melchizedek, and he was king of the city of Salem and at the same time priest of the Most High God. No creature in heaven or on earth could arrange to make himself king of the new world. It was Jehovah who had to conceive the idea of such a king and to make a covenant or solemn agreement with one whom he wanted to hold this kingship. Jesus Christ is the one whom Jehovah has anointed to be the King, the one with whom he has made the special covenant for the kingdom of the heavens. Since Jesus showed his disciples that the Psalms had so much to say prophetically about him, do we find some psalms speaking of the Kingdom covenant and of Melchizedek? We do. Jehovah chose the family line of King David as the one through whom the Messiah, the anointed King of the new world, should come. So Jehovah made with David a covenant for a permanent kingdom.</p><p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="qu">25.

To time indefinite I shall preserve my loving-kindness toward him, and my covenant will be faithful to him. And I shall certainly set up his seed forever and his throne as the days of heaven. I shall not profane my covenant, and the expression out of my lips I shall not change. Once I have sworn in my holiness, to David I will not tell lies. His seed itself will prove to be even to time indefinite and his throne as the sun in front of me. As the moon it will be firmly established for time indefinite and be a faithful witness in the skies.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Ps. 89:3, 4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/43/1" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> 26-29,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/43/2" data-bid="44-3" class="b"> 34-37</a>.</p><p id="p86" data-pid="86" class="qu">26.

Jehovah has sworn to David, truly he will not draw back from it: ‘Of the fruitage of your belly I shall set on your throne. If your sons will keep my covenant and my reminders that I shall teach them, their sons also forever will sit upon your throne.’ For Jehovah has chosen Zion; he has longed for it as a dwelling for himself: ‘ . . . There I shall cause the horn of David to grow. I have set in order a lamp for my anointed one. His enemies I shall clothe with shame, but upon him his diadem will flourish.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Ps. 132:10-18</a>) Since the Kingdom is the powerful means by which Jehovah has chosen to vindicate his universal sovereignty, how could we even think that Jehovah would draw back what he has solemnly sworn to King David even though it was thirty centuries ago! He is a God that faithfully keeps his covenant.</p>

He was a valiant warrior, a skilled statesman, a poet, and a musician. Yet, he relied, not on his abilities, but on his God.

A person may have become involved in conduct that troubles his conscience. His experience may be like that of David, an Israelite king who lived about 3,000 years ago. Describing the effect of his guilt feelings, David wrote: “My bones wore out through my groaning all day long. . . .

<strong>What Can Be Done About That “Always Tired” Feeling</strong><br/><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">First, decide what you can do about the matter bothering you. If, for example, you have erred in some way, do what you can to correct the matter. If it is of a serious nature, go to the persons involved and ask their forgiveness. When King David sinned, he said: “When I kept silent my bones wore out through my groaning all day long.” How fatigued he felt! He was bone weary! But when he confessed his error to God, and did what he could to straighten out the matter, he experienced relief.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101974123/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 32:3-5</a>.</p>

A person may have become involved in conduct that troubles his conscience. His experience may be like that of David, an Israelite king who lived about 3,000 years ago. Describing the effect of his guilt feelings, David wrote: “My bones wore out through my groaning all day long. . . . My life’s moisture has been changed as in the dry heat of summer.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980122/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 32:3, 4</a>) These words suggest that David’s efforts to suppress the naggings of a guilty conscience made him weary. Like a tree deprived of needed moisture during a drought or a very hot, dry summer, David was sapped of his strength or vitality. How did he gain relief?</p>

<strong>What Can Be Done About That “Always Tired” Feeling</strong><br/><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">First, decide what you can do about the matter bothering you. If, for example, you have erred in some way, do what you can to correct the matter. If it is of a serious nature, go to the persons involved and ask their forgiveness. When King David sinned, he said: “When I kept silent my bones wore out through my groaning all day long.” How fatigued he felt! He was bone weary! But when he confessed his error to God, and did what he could to straighten out the matter, he experienced relief.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101974123/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 32:3-5</a>.</p>

<strong>Life</strong><br/><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="sb">“The fruitage of the righteous one is a tree of life, and he that is winning souls is wise,” says another proverb.

Here the nations are shown as partaking of the leaves of the trees for healing purposes. They are alongside the river flowing out from the temple-palace of God, in which is his throne. The picture appears after the scene of the establishing of the new heaven and the new earth and the statement that “the tent of God is with mankind.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012682/94/0" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Rev. 21:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012682/94/1" data-bid="95-2" class="b"> 22,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012682/94/2" data-bid="95-3" class="b"> 24</a>) Symbolically, then, these would be curative, life-sustaining provisions for humankind, for their eventual everlasting life. Being heavenly “trees” they may picture the righteous, fruit-bearing heavenly ones who serve with Christ in administering life-giving spiritual nourishment to humankind.

It apparently has contained the names of righteous persons, beginning with Abel. Moses pleaded to Jehovah for Israel: “Now if you will pardon their sin,—and if not, wipe me out, please, from your book that you have written.” Jehovah answered: “Whoever has sinned against me, I shall wipe him out of my book.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012682/95/0" data-bid="96-1" class="b">Ex. 32:32, 33</a>.) This would show that the names are not predestined, but are only temporarily inscribed, permanence being conditioned on obedience. It therefore appears that the list would undergo changes because of disobedience on the part of some, but, ultimately, the names in the “book” or “scroll” would be permanent. It is God who ‘declares one righteous,’ and he determines when one’s name is to be indelibly inscribed.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012682/96/0" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Rom. 8:33</a>.</p><p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="sb">In the judgment scene at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012682/97/0" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Revelation 20:11-15</a>, the scroll of life is opened to receive names of persons undergoing judgment. At the end of the period of judgment the names in the scroll evidently become permanent, for the description of the judgment indicates it is final. The ones not found written in the book are annihilated in the lake of fire, the second death. At this time also all the effects of sin on those successfully passing through the judgment are gone, death being annihilated in the lake of fire.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012682/98/0" data-bid="99-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:26</a>.</p><p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="ss"><strong><em>“The Lamb’s scroll”</em></strong></p><p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="sb">“The Lamb’s scroll of life” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012682/99/0" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Rev. 21:27</a>) is a separate scroll, appearing to contain only the names of those who are the associates of the Lamb, Jesus Christ, with whom he shares his Kingdom rule.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012682/105/0" data-bid="106-1" class="b">Rev. 22:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012682/105/1" data-bid="106-2" class="b"> 21:2</a>) Water is essential for life. The time setting given in the vision is after the establishment of “a new heaven and a new earth; for the former heaven and the former earth had passed away.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012682/106/0" data-bid="107-1" class="b">Rev. 21:1</a>) The context places the flowing of this river after the destruction of the present system of things. The vision speaks of trees alongside the river producing fruit, and leaves for the curing of the nations. The life-giving waters, then, would be the provisions for life that Jehovah has made through the Lamb, Jesus Christ, for all who will receive life.</p><p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="sb">The setting then moves back in time to John’s day (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012682/107/0" data-bid="108-1" class="b">Rev. 22:6, 7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012682/107/1" data-bid="108-2" class="b"> 16</a>), and speaks of the spirit and the bride saying: “Come!” and commands anyone hearing to say: “Come!” then extending the invitation to anyone thirsting to “take life’s water free.” The spirit and the bride invite persons to <em>begin</em> drinking of God’s provisions for gaining eternal life through the Lamb of God. Such invited ones also can anticipate drinking from the river of water of life, which will bring complete healing to them under the ministrations of the Lamb and his bride after the establishment of the new heaven and the new earth.</p><p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="ss"><strong>“LIFE’S MOISTURE”</strong></p><p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012682/108/0" data-bid="109-1" class="b">Psalm 32:1-5</a> David shows the happiness that attends forgiveness, though he also reveals the distress experienced before making confession of transgressing to Jehovah and receiving God’s pardon. Prior to confessing and while trying to conceal his error, the psalmist is conscience-stricken and says: “My life’s moisture has been changed as in the dry heat of summer.” Attempted repression of a guilty conscience wore him out and anguish reduced his vigor just as a tree might lose life-giving moisture during a drought or in summer’s intense dry heat. David’s words seem to indicate that he experienced ill effects both mentally and physically, or had at least lost most of his joy of life, because of failure to confess his sin. Only confession to Jehovah could bring pardon and relief.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012682/109/0" data-bid="110-1" class="b">Prov. 28:13</a>.</p><p id="p70" data-pid="70" class="ss"><strong>“THE BAG OF LIFE”</strong></p><p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="sb">When Abigail appealed to David to turn back from his mission of vengeance upon Nabal, thereby restraining him from entering into bloodguilt, she said: “When man rises up to pursue you and look for your soul, the soul of my lord will certainly prove to be wrapped up in the bag of life with Jehovah your God; but, as for the soul of your enemies, he will sling it forth as from inside the hollow of the sling.” <span id="page1066" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1066" data-before-text="1066"></span>(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012682/110/0" data-bid="111-1" class="b">1 Sam. 25:29-33</a>) Just as a person wraps up something valuable to protect and preserve it, so David’s life as an individual was in the hands of the living God, and He would preserve David’s life from his enemies, as long as David did not try to bring his salvation by his own hand, but waited on Jehovah. But the soul of David’s enemies God would throw away.</p>

<strong>Confession That Leads to Healing</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">After David confessed, he did not regress to a negative sense of worthlessness. His expressions in the psalms that he wrote about confessions show the relief he felt and his determination to serve God faithfully. Look, for example, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001407/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Psalm 32</a>. In verse 1, we read: “Happy is the one whose revolt is pardoned, whose sin is covered.” No matter how serious the sin, a happy outcome is possible if a person is sincere in his repentance. One way to show this sincerity is by accepting full responsibility for one’s actions, as David did. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001407/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">2 Samuel 12:13</a>) He did not try to justify himself before Jehovah or attempt to pass the blame on to others. Verse 5 says: “My sin I finally confessed to you, and my error I did not cover. I said: ‘I shall make confession over my transgressions to Jehovah.’ And you yourself pardoned the error of my sins.” Genuine confession brings relief, so that a person no longer needs to be plagued by his conscience over past wrongs.</p>

(Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997883/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Leviticus 16:20-22</a>.) This no doubt eased the feelings of guilt that David had been carrying. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997883/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Psalm 32:3</a>.) We too can have full confidence in the God who pardons the sins of those who seek his forgiveness on the basis of their faith in the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997883/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Matthew 20:28</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997883/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Isaiah 53:12</a>.) Those whose sins Jehovah thus lifts up and carries away need not continue to carry the burden of guilt feelings for past sins.</p>

<strong>Counsel—Will You Profit from It?</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Concerning this experience, David later wrote: “My sin I finally confessed to you, and my error I did not cover. I said: ‘I shall make confession over my transgressions to Jehovah.’ And you yourself pardoned the error of my sins.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976688/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 32:5</a>) In <em>The Soncino Books of the Bible</em> these comments are made: “He was not giving information to God Who knew what he had done; by acknowledging it to Him he acknowledged it to himself. That is the purpose of confession and the first preliminary to forgiveness. . . . The sinner having done his part, God was ready to do His as Pardoner.” How greatly David profited from heeding reproof! Do you also profit from reproof?</p>

<strong>What Can Be Done About That “Always Tired” Feeling</strong><br/><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">First, decide what you can do about the matter bothering you. If, for example, you have erred in some way, do what you can to correct the matter. If it is of a serious nature, go to the persons involved and ask their forgiveness. When King David sinned, he said: “When I kept silent my bones wore out through my groaning all day long.” How fatigued he felt! He was bone weary! But when he confessed his error to God, and did what he could to straighten out the matter, he experienced relief.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101974123/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 32:3-5</a>.</p>

<strong>“Carry On Prayer on Every Occasion in Spirit”</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> For example, recently it was experienced in one congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses that, whenever a certain male member was asked to offer prayer for the congregation at its meetings, he repeatedly would fail to ask for forgiveness of sins. It became rather noticeable as a ‘hindering’ to the prayer. Later this man’s course <span id="page561" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="561" data-before-text="561"></span>of conduct came to be in question. It was found that this minister in fact had been morally unclean all this time.

Note one of David’s prayers of confession: “My sin I finally confessed to you, and my error I did not cover.

During these pre-Har–Magedon days each one needs to have a burden-free conscience so that he can stand up against all the opposition mounting. If anyone is carrying heavy burdens of guilt upon his conscience, then it is well for him to confess as soon as possible to Jehovah and to his brothers, so that once more he can lift up his head as clean and upright. No longer will there be a ‘hindering’ to one’s prayers.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964684/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Tim. 1:18, 19</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Three years ago a special pioneer minister of Jehovah’s witnesses had become ill during the end of the month. He was missing thirty hours for his monthly report in order to qualify for his money allowance, which then was especially needed. He dishonestly reported the full amount of time, expecting to make up the missing thirty hours of ministerial service next month. But difficulties continued and he was not able to make up the time. It seemed that Jehovah’s blessing was not upon his field preaching activities. In prayer he confessed his wrong to Jehovah. He also wrote to the Society to ask their forgiveness and offered to make an adjustment. The Society’s headquarters mercifully agreed to let the allowance stand as paid but said that the minister should make up the missing thirty hours during his vacation time that next summer. Yes, that prayer of confession brought relief to a stricken conscience and restored pleasant relationship with Jehovah and his people.

He puts in forty hours a week at the place of business and thereafter has a free mind for his ministerial activities. Last year the owners of the business made him a tempting offer to become the factory supervisor. They offered an increased salary and other so-called benefits. But there were also increased responsibilities that might bring many sleepless nights and extra activities beyond the present forty hours a week. This tempting offer was taken to Jehovah in prayer. The result was that he was strengthened to turn down the <span id="page562" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="562" data-before-text="562"></span>offer.

<strong>“Confess Your Sins”</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The erring person has become so sick spiritually that he no longer feels that his prayer has effect. So the mature overseer, having faithfully applied the soothing oil of God’s Word and strengthened with it the one seeking help, aids him by expressing for him his request to God for forgiveness. It is His forgiveness that counts. “I have acknowledged my sin to <span id="page747" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="747" data-before-text="747"></span>thee: and my injustice I have not concealed. I said I will confess against myself my injustice to the Lord.

Rather, as a loving Christian brother, he approaches God in prayer along with the spiritually sick one, doing so through the one Mediator Christ Jesus, and faithfully pointing out Jehovah’s loving provision for forgiveness. It is Jehovah who restores the truly repentant one.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Do you confess your sins?

<strong>Keep Your Place</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Appreciating this and the fact that God knows what is going on and does not overlook or miss anything will help a Christian to be not overly worried about the wicked. Practically all mankind, similar to many of the angels, have left the place assigned to them by Jehovah, stubbornly refusing to obey his counsel. The expenditure of thousands upon thousands of lives on battlefields, billions of dollars in equipment, and tremendous efforts of mankind today are futile in stamping out wrongdoing. Instead, the whole society of man is steadily progressing downward in its stubborn course, reaping its wicked harvest of greed, selfishness, delinquency, graft, corruption, disobedience, dishonesty, etc. The man of God does not get unduly excited about the activities of these wicked and proud persons and invent in his mind places of eternal torment after this life as punishment for the wicked. But he realizes that God can handle the situation, and waits upon him and does not fret himself. “Fret not thyself because of evil-doers, neither be thou envious against them that work unrighteousness. For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb. Rest in Jehovah, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself, it tendeth only to evil-doing. For evil-doers shall be cut off; but those that wait for Jehovah, they shall inherit the land. For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and he shall not be. The wicked plotteth <span id="page281" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="281" data-before-text="281"></span>against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth. The Lord will laugh at him; for he seeth that his day is coming.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955330/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 37:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955330/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 7-10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955330/19/2" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 12, 13</a>, <em>AS</em>) Imperfect man, in trying to stamp out evil, commits evil himself.

How can man know where his proper place is?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> This promised housecleaning stirs up intelligent and honesthearted men and women to be anxious to learn where their place is in Jehovah’s sight. Does God have laws of nature to bind them in a certain place? Is man forced to stay in his place? Do the Scriptures tell us where man’s place is and how to get into it and stay in it? David expressed the truth on the matter and shows us that there is a relationship possible between man and his Creator and that man’s getting into this relationship means a secure place for him with protection and deliverance. “Thou art my hiding-place; thou wilt preserve me from trouble; thou wilt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955330/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 32:7</a>, <em>AS</em>) With man’s expressing himself as recognizing his dependence upon Jehovah, as shown in this psalm, Jehovah answers him in the next two verses and shows exactly what arrangements he has made to put man in his place and for him to keep his place. “I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will counsel thee with mine eye upon thee. Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding; whose trappings must be bit and bridle to hold them in, else they will not come near unto thee.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955330/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ps. 32:8, 9</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">16. Why does God use different means to guide man than he uses for animals?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> In these two verses it is clear that Jehovah knows his creatures and knows what to use to keep them in their proper places. For man who was created with a marvelous brain, far, far superior to that in any animal, the intellect is the part of man that needs guidance and it is the intellect of man that directs him. Therefore God did not provide the same kind of boundaries for man that he did for lesser creation, but he provided counsel for him. So in many places in the Scriptures men of understanding spoke of the value of God’s written Word as a guide for them and as a light for their path. So, in the above verses of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955330/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Psalm 32:8, 9</a>, Jehovah contrasts the means of guiding man with that of guiding a horse or a mule. Having a very inferior brain, a horse or a mule has to be guided to places it is desired for it to go by physical means—a bit and bridle. Man, then, should not expect that God would provide the same thing for him, for certainly God knows that man was created on a much higher level and can be directed in a superior way. Therefore, man is counseled to be not like a horse or mule. Jehovah does not force or drive man to do certain things. He uses the appropriate way—he gives counsel that man can take in through his eyes by reading and his ears by hearing and store it in his mind and then use the information to direct his steps and control his actions.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">17. How important does this make the Bible?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> This clearly puts much emphasis on the importance of the Bible. It is God’s provision for aiding us to know what to do and how to do it, so that we not only can please him but also get into a place that is in complete harmony with the operation of the entire universe. It is a provision that will enable obedient mankind to get back into a relationship with Jehovah that was set before Adam. If he had been obedient to God’s instructions, he could have continued living even down to <span id="page282" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="282" data-before-text="282"></span>our day and on through our day. So if one will accept Jehovah’s counsel today, he may look forward to the undeserved gift of everlasting life.</p>

<strong>“Young People Ask”—A Series With Bible Answers</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">This feature tries to imitate Jehovah God who stated: “I will give [you] advice <em>with my eye upon you.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101983008/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 32:8</a>) By careful observation God offers wise guidance suited to the person’s individual case. He understands the causes. Likewise, upon hearing the report from the house of Chloe, the apostle Paul was able to give specific counsel that addressed the problems peculiar to that first-century Corinthian congregation.

<strong>Attain Completeness in the New World Society</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> One obstacle to obedience and submission is the tendency in imperfect humans to pass judgment on the fitness or otherwise of the instructions that come down to them. Instead of accepting these as from Christ through the organization, they debate within themselves, or with others, what they shall do. This may be normal procedure in the present evil world, but it has no merit in Jehovah’s eyes. On one occasion King Saul considered it sensible to salvage some of the enemy’s possessions. Worldly reasoning might have agreed with him. However, Jehovah did not agree with him. He had instructed otherwise. Through the mouth of his prophet Samuel he declared: “Does Jehovah <span id="page270" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="270" data-before-text="270"></span>have as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of Jehovah? Look! to obey is better than a sacrifice, . . . for rebelliousness is the same as the sin of divination, and pushing ahead presumptuously the same as using uncanny power and idolatry.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959322/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Sam. 15:22, 23</a>, <em>margin</em>) Eve, likewise, was attracted by the idea of deciding for herself what was good and what was bad, rather than leave this to Jehovah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959322/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gen. 3:1-6</a>) God’s people today should avoid the same mistakes.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 9. How does Jehovah guide man, and what kind of obedience does he require?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> To make a horse or mule obey, a bit is put in its mouth, and a bridle is used to guide it. Man, however, has the power of reason and understanding. Jehovah guides man by supplying the needed knowledge through His Word, the power through His spirit and the direction through His organization. It is up to each one to obey. Through David, Jehovah gave admonition: “I shall make you have insight and instruct you in the way you should go. I will give advice with my eye upon you. Do not make yourselves like a horse or mule without understanding, whose spiritedness is to be curbed even by bridle or halter before they will come near to you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959322/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 32:8, 9</a>) The Universal Sovereign wants no forced obedience, but rather the obedience that comes from a heart filled with understanding and with love for Jehovah.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>BE QUICK TO OBEY</strong></p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">10, 11.

(b) Rebekah?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Jehovah loves those who are quick to obey. Many are the examples in the Scriptures that prove it so. Abraham is one of these. When Jehovah told him to sacrifice his son, there was no quibbling or debate about it. Abraham had faith in Jehovah and he obeyed, even to the point of raising his knife to plunge it into the breast of his son. Through faith and obedience Abraham gained the distinction of being called “Jehovah’s friend,” and his place as a prince in God’s new world is assured.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959322/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Jas. 2:23</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Another example of obedience and its blessings is that of Rebekah. From the account in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959322/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Genesis chapter 24</a> the ready obedience of Rebekah shines out even more beautifully than the ornaments that Eliezer presented to her. When he asked her for a drink of water her response was prompt: “So she quickly lowered her jar from off her and said, ‘Take a drink, and I shall also water your camels.’” Then, as Eliezer explained that Jehovah had led him there, “the young woman went running and telling the household of her mother about these things.” Later, when the question arose whether Rebekah would be willing to go to Isaac and whether she would agree to depart immediately, her answer was, “I am willing to go.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959322/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Gen. 24:46,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959322/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 28,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959322/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 58</a>) Rebekah’s readiness to obey gained for her the privilege of bearing Jacob, the father of the tribal heads of the nation of Israel and prominent in the Messianic line.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">12, 13.

Of Peter and Andrew, the record says at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959322/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 4:19-22</a>: “And he said to them: ‘Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.’ At once abandoning the nets, they followed him.” The response of James and John, the sons of Zebedee, was the same: “At once leaving the boat and their father, they followed him.” Time and again the apostle Paul also demonstrated that he had this desirable quality of prompt obedience. The record at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959322/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Acts 9:20</a> states that after his conversion “immediately in the synagogues he began to preach Jesus.” Later, when he received in vision the call <span id="page271" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="271" data-before-text="271"></span>to “step over into Macedonia and help us,” he and those with him obeyed quickly. “Now as soon as he had seen the vision, we sought to go forth into Macedonia, drawing the conclusion that God had summoned us to declare the good news to them.” Jehovah blessed their quick response with fruitage, Lydia and her household quickly accepting the truth and being baptized.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959322/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Acts 16:9-15</a>.</p>

<strong>Keep Your Place</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Appreciating this and the fact that God knows what is going on and does not overlook or miss anything will help a Christian to be not overly worried about the wicked. Practically all mankind, similar to many of the angels, have left the place assigned to them by Jehovah, stubbornly refusing to obey his counsel. The expenditure of thousands upon thousands of lives on battlefields, billions of dollars in equipment, and tremendous efforts of mankind today are futile in stamping out wrongdoing. Instead, the whole society of man is steadily progressing downward in its stubborn course, reaping its wicked harvest of greed, selfishness, delinquency, graft, corruption, disobedience, dishonesty, etc. The man of God does not get unduly excited about the activities of these wicked and proud persons and invent in his mind places of eternal torment after this life as punishment for the wicked. But he realizes that God can handle the situation, and waits upon him and does not fret himself. “Fret not thyself because of evil-doers, neither be thou envious against them that work unrighteousness. For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb. Rest in Jehovah, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself, it tendeth only to evil-doing. For evil-doers shall be cut off; but those that wait for Jehovah, they shall inherit the land. For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and he shall not be. The wicked plotteth <span id="page281" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="281" data-before-text="281"></span>against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth. The Lord will laugh at him; for he seeth that his day is coming.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955330/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 37:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955330/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 7-10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955330/19/2" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 12, 13</a>, <em>AS</em>) Imperfect man, in trying to stamp out evil, commits evil himself. Those that wait upon Jehovah trust and know that he will take care of the wicked, leaving them absolutely no place for existence anywhere in his vast and glorious universe.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>GUIDANCE FOR KEEPING IN PLACE</strong></p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">15. How can man know where his proper place is?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> This promised housecleaning stirs up intelligent and honesthearted men and women to be anxious to learn where their place is in Jehovah’s sight. Does God have laws of nature to bind them in a certain place? Is man forced to stay in his place? Do the Scriptures tell us where man’s place is and how to get into it and stay in it? David expressed the truth on the matter and shows us that there is a relationship possible between man and his Creator and that man’s getting into this relationship means a secure place for him with protection and deliverance. “Thou art my hiding-place; thou wilt preserve me from trouble; thou wilt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955330/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 32:7</a>, <em>AS</em>) With man’s expressing himself as recognizing his dependence upon Jehovah, as shown in this psalm, Jehovah answers him in the next two verses and shows exactly what arrangements he has made to put man in his place and for him to keep his place. “I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will counsel thee with mine eye upon thee. Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding; whose trappings must be bit and bridle to hold them in, else they will not come near unto thee.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955330/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ps. 32:8, 9</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">16. Why does God use different means to guide man than he uses for animals?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> In these two verses it is clear that Jehovah knows his creatures and knows what to use to keep them in their proper places. For man who was created with a marvelous brain, far, far superior to that in any animal, the intellect is the part of man that needs guidance and it is the intellect of man that directs him. Therefore God did not provide the same kind of boundaries for man that he did for lesser creation, but he provided counsel for him. So in many places in the Scriptures men of understanding spoke of the value of God’s written Word as a guide for them and as a light for their path. So, in the above verses of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955330/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Psalm 32:8, 9</a>, Jehovah contrasts the means of guiding man with that of guiding a horse or a mule. Having a very inferior brain, a horse or a mule has to be guided to places it is desired for it to go by physical means—a bit and bridle. Man, then, should not expect that God would provide the same thing for him, for certainly God knows that man was created on a much higher level and can be directed in a superior way. Therefore, man is counseled to be not like a horse or mule. Jehovah does not force or drive man to do certain things. He uses the appropriate way—he gives counsel that man can take in through his eyes by reading and his ears by hearing and store it in his mind and then use the information to direct his steps and control his actions.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">17. How important does this make the Bible?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> This clearly puts much emphasis on the importance of the Bible. It is God’s provision for aiding us to know what to do and how to do it, so that we not only can please him but also get into a place that is in complete harmony with the operation of the entire universe. It is a provision that will enable obedient mankind to get back into a relationship with Jehovah that was set before Adam. If he had been obedient to God’s instructions, he could have continued living even down to <span id="page282" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="282" data-before-text="282"></span>our day and on through our day. So if one will accept Jehovah’s counsel today, he may look forward to the undeserved gift of everlasting life.</p>

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page592" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="592" data-before-text="592"></span><strong>Way of Success</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHAT greater success could anyone attain than to gain endless life in peace and happiness? None, of course. And next to that, what sweeter privilege could anyone enjoy than to help other persons obtain the same success? The big question, therefore, is how we as individuals may obtain this good success.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1951724/0">a</a></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jehovah God is conducting a school of success, and anyone that desires may enroll in it. What is required of all who do enter this course of training is willingness to apply themselves to the course of study as outlined by the Teachers. The pupils must choose to serve God, agree to do his will, and permit him to make out of them what he wishes. Enrollment will outlast this present world, for none will graduate from this school until they have proved worthy of the new world.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Persons obtaining what is called success according to old world standards pride themselves on having attended a certain school or having had a certain famed instructor as their teacher. But no one could attend a school of higher learning, nor have a Teacher more competent and wonderful than Jehovah God. Lovingly he cares for the particular needs of each student, giving both general and individual guidance, instruction, counsel, reproof and correction. “I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go,” he says, “I will counsel thee with mine eye upon thee.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951724/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 32:8</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The greatest man that ever walked this earth, Jesus of Nazareth, attended this same school, and had this same Instructor. As he says: “I do nothing of my own initiative, but just as the Father taught me I speak these things.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951724/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 8:28</a>, <em>NW</em>) We do well, therefore, to follow Jesus’ example, for he finished his schooling and graduated with the highest degrees inscribed on a never-fading diploma.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">This is a practical school, and not one where mere theory is taught. Jesus was taught by his Father, that he might teach others. So we, too, after learning ourselves, must teach others. When closing our divinely inspired textbook, the Bible, after a session of personal study, or upon leaving an assembly of fellow Christians, we must not forget what we have learned. We must meditate on the instruction given, apply the lessons to our daily lives, and tell others about what we have learned. We must “become doers of the word, and not hearers only”. A great part of our schooling comes through teaching others what we have learned.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951724/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jas. 1:22</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">So what is the way of success? Faithful obedience to Jehovah, the Great Teacher, and his commandments set forth in his Lawbook the Bible. “This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951724/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Josh. 1:8</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Never quit or play hooky from this divine school of success. Apply your mind to the instruction given. Be meek, be teachable. Draw good out of correction. As the scholar Paul told young Timothy: “Ponder over these things, be absorbed in them, that your advancement may be manifest to all persons. Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching. Stay by these things, for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951724/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:15, 16</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p>

That is why he told David: “Do not make yourselves like a horse or mule without understanding, whose spiritedness is to be curbed even by bridle or halter.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988247/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Psalm 32:9</a>) Rather, Jehovah has endowed us <span id="page31" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="31" data-before-text="31"></span>with thinking ability and discernment so that, based on understanding, we can choose to obey him.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">In Japanese, the word <em>kiku</em> (to hear) includes the meaning not only of listening and obeying but also of judging whether a thing is good or bad. When someone speaks to us, it is good to listen in this sense so that when obeying, we do so not by mere credulity but by choice. When our heavenly Father, Jehovah God, speaks, whether through his Word, the Bible, or through his earthly organization, it is all the more important for us to listen and obey, thus proving that we are obedient worshipers who do not ignore the loving reminder: “Did you hear me?”</p>

<strong>How Your View of Authority Affects Your Life</strong><br/><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> Remember, it was on this matter of respect for authority that the first man was tested and it may be that at the end of Christ’s thousand-year reign this principle will also be involved in the final test. This could be indicated by the fact that there would be “nations in the four corners of the earth” that would be led to attack Jehovah’s authority as represented by the “camp of the holy ones and the beloved city.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972322/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Rev. 20:8, 9</a>) Our view of authority is really a reflection of our understanding, our appreciation of Jehovah’s purpose in all its connected parts. When a person lacks understanding, then he becomes “like a horse or mule <em>without understanding,</em> whose spiritedness is to be curbed even by bridle or halter.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972322/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 32:9</a>) Rather than be curbed at Armageddon or later, it is wise to develop and display understanding with respect to authority so we will be the kind of persons Jehovah wants in his new order of righteousness. Then we will work in harmony with his direction through Christ’s Kingdom reign and make our peaceful Paradise earth a grand testimony to the benefits that come when we have the right view of authority.</p>

<strong>Keep Your Place</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Appreciating this and the fact that God knows what is going on and does not overlook or miss anything will help a Christian to be not overly worried about the wicked. Practically all mankind, similar to many of the angels, have left the place assigned to them by Jehovah, stubbornly refusing to obey his counsel. The expenditure of thousands upon thousands of lives on battlefields, billions of dollars in equipment, and tremendous efforts of mankind today are futile in stamping out wrongdoing. Instead, the whole society of man is steadily progressing downward in its stubborn course, reaping its wicked harvest of greed, selfishness, delinquency, graft, corruption, disobedience, dishonesty, etc. The man of God does not get unduly excited about the activities of these wicked and proud persons and invent in his mind places of eternal torment after this life as punishment for the wicked. But he realizes that God can handle the situation, and waits upon him and does not fret himself. “Fret not thyself because of evil-doers, neither be thou envious against them that work unrighteousness. For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb. Rest in Jehovah, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself, it tendeth only to evil-doing. For evil-doers shall be cut off; but those that wait for Jehovah, they shall inherit the land. For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and he shall not be. The wicked plotteth <span id="page281" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="281" data-before-text="281"></span>against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth. The Lord will laugh at him; for he seeth that his day is coming.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955330/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 37:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955330/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 7-10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955330/19/2" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 12, 13</a>, <em>AS</em>) Imperfect man, in trying to stamp out evil, commits evil himself. Those that wait upon Jehovah trust and know that he will take care of the wicked, leaving them absolutely no place for existence anywhere in his vast and glorious universe.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>GUIDANCE FOR KEEPING IN PLACE</strong></p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">15. How can man know where his proper place is?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> This promised housecleaning stirs up intelligent and honesthearted men and women to be anxious to learn where their place is in Jehovah’s sight. Does God have laws of nature to bind them in a certain place? Is man forced to stay in his place? Do the Scriptures tell us where man’s place is and how to get into it and stay in it? David expressed the truth on the matter and shows us that there is a relationship possible between man and his Creator and that man’s getting into this relationship means a secure place for him with protection and deliverance. “Thou art my hiding-place; thou wilt preserve me from trouble; thou wilt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955330/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 32:7</a>, <em>AS</em>) With man’s expressing himself as recognizing his dependence upon Jehovah, as shown in this psalm, Jehovah answers him in the next two verses and shows exactly what arrangements he has made to put man in his place and for him to keep his place. “I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will counsel thee with mine eye upon thee. Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding; whose trappings must be bit and bridle to hold them in, else they will not come near unto thee.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955330/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ps. 32:8, 9</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">16. Why does God use different means to guide man than he uses for animals?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> In these two verses it is clear that Jehovah knows his creatures and knows what to use to keep them in their proper places. For man who was created with a marvelous brain, far, far superior to that in any animal, the intellect is the part of man that needs guidance and it is the intellect of man that directs him. Therefore God did not provide the same kind of boundaries for man that he did for lesser creation, but he provided counsel for him. So in many places in the Scriptures men of understanding spoke of the value of God’s written Word as a guide for them and as a light for their path. So, in the above verses of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955330/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Psalm 32:8, 9</a>, Jehovah contrasts the means of guiding man with that of guiding a horse or a mule. Having a very inferior brain, a horse or a mule has to be guided to places it is desired for it to go by physical means—a bit and bridle. Man, then, should not expect that God would provide the same thing for him, for certainly God knows that man was created on a much higher level and can be directed in a superior way. Therefore, man is counseled to be not like a horse or mule. Jehovah does not force or drive man to do certain things. He uses the appropriate way—he gives counsel that man can take in through his eyes by reading and his ears by hearing and store it in his mind and then use the information to direct his steps and control his actions.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">17. How important does this make the Bible?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> This clearly puts much emphasis on the importance of the Bible. It is God’s provision for aiding us to know what to do and how to do it, so that we not only can please him but also get into a place that is in complete harmony with the operation of the entire universe. It is a provision that will enable obedient mankind to get back into a relationship with Jehovah that was set before Adam. If he had been obedient to God’s instructions, he could have continued living even down to <span id="page282" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="282" data-before-text="282"></span>our day and on through our day. So if one will accept Jehovah’s counsel today, he may look forward to the undeserved gift of everlasting life.</p>

Not to heathendom whose people worship millions of gods of their own making, and who, for the most part, never even heard of the great name of the true God Jehovah. The “godless” Communists who dominate a great portion of the earth’s surface bitterly hate and fight against the name of Jehovah and are against his Word of truth, the Holy Bible. The same is true of millions of Moslems throughout the earth. Well, what about Christendom with her nearly 920,000,000 members? Alas! Christendom is a dominant part of the United Nations and as such is very much a part of “the present wicked system of things” of which Satan the Devil is god.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001061/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ge 1:2</a>) Thus, God used his active force, or “spirit” (Heb., <em>ruʹach</em>), to accomplish his creative purpose. The things he has created testify not only to his power but also to his Godship. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001061/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Jer 10:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001061/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Ro 1:19, 20</a>) And, as Jehovah “is a God, not of disorder, but of peace” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001061/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1Co 14:33</a>), his creative work is marked with orderliness rather than chaos or chance.

<strong>Spirit</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"><strong>Its Use in Creation.</strong> Jehovah God accomplished the creation of the material universe by means of his spirit, or active force. Regarding the planet Earth in its early formative stages, the record states that “God’s active force [or “spirit” (<em>ruʹach</em>)] was moving to and fro over the surface of the waters.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Ge 1:2</a>) <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Psalm 33:6</a> says: “By the word of Jehovah the heavens themselves were made, and by the spirit of his mouth all their army.” Like a powerful breath, God’s spirit can be sent forth to exert power even though there is no bodily contact with that which is acted upon. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/58/0" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Ex 15:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/58/1" data-bid="59-2" class="b"> 10</a>.) Where a human craftsman would use the force of his hands and fingers to produce things, God uses his spirit. Hence that spirit is also spoken of as God’s “hand” or “fingers.”​—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Ps 8:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/59/1" data-bid="60-2" class="b"> 19:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/59/2" data-bid="60-3" class="b"> Mt 12:28</a> with <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/60/0" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Lu 11:20</a>.</p>

<strong>Storehouse</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Jehovah speaks of things around which he has put boundaries by means of created forces, or natural laws, as well as of things he has reserved under his control for special purposes, as being in “storehouses.” The sea is said to be ‘gathered like a dam, put in storehouses.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004241/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps 33:7</a>) Also of other natural phenomena that he has at times used against his enemies, he asked Job: “Have you entered into the storehouses of the snow, or do you see even the storehouses of the hail, which I have kept back for the time of distress, for the day of fight and war?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004241/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Job 38:22, 23</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004241/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Jos 10:8-11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004241/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Jg 5:20, 21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004241/13/2" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> Ps 105:32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004241/13/3" data-bid="14-4" class="b"> 135:7</a>.)

<strong>The Happiness of the “Nation Whose God Is Jehovah”</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> No, it is not the most powerful and prosperous nation on earth today. However, that it was a happy nation and would be such may have been suggested by what took place on an inauguration day of one of its presidents at the national capital, Washington, D.C., January 20, 1957. The nation’s thirty-fourth president was being inaugurated for his second term in office. Following the custom, he was being sworn in with his right hand resting upon an open Bible. This Bible was not the British King James or Authorized Version Bible, but was the American Standard Version <span id="page685" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="685" data-before-text="685"></span>of the Bible as published in the year 1901 C.E. This particular copy had been given him by his God-fearing mother when he was about to graduate from the national Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1915, the second year of World War I. His hand purposely rested at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968842/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 33:12</a>, which, in the <em>American Standard Version,</em> reads as follows: “Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah, the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.” In the later published version, <em>An American Translation,</em> of 1939, this <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968842/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps 33 verse 12</a> opens up saying: “How happy is the nation . . . ”—See the New York <em>Times</em> of January 21, 1957.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1968842/0">a</a></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> By this gesture the reinaugurated president may have been suggesting that the United States of America was that blessed or happy nation or that he would serve in the presidency to make it such. But during his two terms in the presidency did he lead his nation into the blessedness or happiness spoken of in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968842/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 33:12</a>? Well, during his first term in office his nation became involved in the political struggles of North Vietnam and South Vietnam. (See <em>The Americana Annual,</em> 1956, page 356, about Indochina and under the subheading “Principal Events, 1955.”) Nor did difficulties with North Korea cease. Other troubles of the nation, both internal and external, domestic and foreign, have multiplied since. Why, then, has the blessedness, the happiness, for which the president hoped on his second inauguration in 1957, not been realized since? Why has the nation not proved itself entitled to such happiness?</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 5.

(b) Does any other earthly government qualify as God’s happy nation?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Some basic requirement has been overlooked, ignored. If we reexamine <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968842/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 33:12</a> we can easily see what is the real key to happiness for a nation. The secret is its God and its being his chosen possession. The verse plainly says, not, ‘Happy is the most prosperous and most militarily powerful nation,’ but: “Blessed [or, Happy] is the nation whose God is Jehovah, the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.” (<em>AS; AT</em>) So, quite properly, we ask: Did the nation’s thirty-fourth president lead his nation into choosing Jehovah as its God? By the Supreme Court of the United States of America this nation has been designated as a “Christian nation,” but has it worshiped Jehovah as its God and has it proved itself to be “the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance”? Where are the facts in favor of the answer Yes! even though the United States of America is the leading nation in Christendom? Such facts cannot be found. Nor can they be found for any other of the 197 nations among whom the name of Jehovah has been proclaimed by his witnesses for many years, not even for the Republic of Israel.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 6. As borne out in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968842/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Psalm 33:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968842/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 16, 17</a>, on what does God’s “happy” nation <em>not</em> depend, thus eliminating whom as qualified to be God’s “happy” nation?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> If we examine the neighboring verses of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968842/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 33:12</a>, we note these further striking details about the happy nation: “Jehovah himself has broken up the counsel of the nations; he has thwarted the thoughts of the peoples. There is no king saved by the abundance of military forces; a mighty man himself is not delivered by the abundance of power. The horse is a deception for salvation, and by the abundance of its vital energy it does not afford escape.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968842/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 33:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968842/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 16, 17</a>) That is to say, the “happy” nation did not depend upon the military forces of this world, but its deliverance from the hostile counsel of the nations and the malicious thoughts of the peoples was by its God Jehovah, not <span id="page686" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="686" data-before-text="686"></span>by mighty men of war and energetic war horses. Such features do not distinguish the nations and peoples of this world in this most heavily armed period in all human history. The nations and peoples groan under the burden loaded upon them because of the expenses and demands of their military, naval and air force departments. Regardless of the prayers of their popes, priests, and other religious clergymen and orders, they do not find that without militarism Jehovah God delivers them.</p>

<strong>The Happiness of the “Nation Whose God Is Jehovah”</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> No, it is not the most powerful and prosperous nation on earth today. However, that it was a happy nation and would be such may have been suggested by what took place on an inauguration day of one of its presidents at the national capital, Washington, D.C., January 20, 1957. The nation’s thirty-fourth president was being inaugurated for his second term in office. Following the custom, he was being sworn in with his right hand resting upon an open Bible. This Bible was not the British King James or Authorized Version Bible, but was the American Standard Version <span id="page685" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="685" data-before-text="685"></span>of the Bible as published in the year 1901 C.E. This particular copy had been given him by his God-fearing mother when he was about to graduate from the national Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1915, the second year of World War I. His hand purposely rested at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968842/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 33:12</a>, which, in the <em>American Standard Version,</em> reads as follows: “Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah, the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.” In the later published version, <em>An American Translation,</em> of 1939, this <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968842/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps 33 verse 12</a> opens up saying: “How happy is the nation . . . ”—See the New York <em>Times</em> of January 21, 1957.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1968842/0">a</a></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> By this gesture the reinaugurated president may have been suggesting that the United States of America was that blessed or happy nation or that he would serve in the presidency to make it such. But during his two terms in the presidency did he lead his nation into the blessedness or happiness spoken of in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968842/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 33:12</a>? Well, during his first term in office his nation became involved in the political struggles of North Vietnam and South Vietnam. (See <em>The Americana Annual,</em> 1956, page 356, about Indochina and under the subheading “Principal Events, 1955.”) Nor did difficulties with North Korea cease. Other troubles of the nation, both internal and external, domestic and foreign, have multiplied since. Why, then, has the blessedness, the happiness, for which the president hoped on his second inauguration in 1957, not been realized since? Why has the nation not proved itself entitled to such happiness?</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 5.

If we reexamine <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968842/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 33:12</a> we can easily see what is the real key to happiness for a nation. The secret is its God and its being his chosen possession. The verse plainly says, not, ‘Happy is the most prosperous and most militarily powerful nation,’ but: “Blessed [or, Happy] is the nation whose God is Jehovah, the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.” (<em>AS; AT</em>) So, quite properly, we ask: Did the nation’s thirty-fourth president lead his nation into choosing Jehovah as its God? By the Supreme Court of the United States of America this nation has been designated as a “Christian nation,” but has it worshiped Jehovah as its God and has it proved itself to be “the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance”? Where are the facts in favor of the answer Yes! even though the United States of America is the leading nation in Christendom? Such facts cannot be found. Nor can they be found for any other of the 197 nations among whom the name of Jehovah has been proclaimed by his witnesses for many years, not even for the Republic of Israel.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 6.

There is no king saved by the abundance of military forces; a mighty man himself is not delivered by the abundance of power. The horse is a deception for salvation, and by the abundance of its vital energy it does not afford escape.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968842/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 33:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968842/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 16, 17</a>) That is to say, the “happy” nation did not depend upon the military forces of this world, but its deliverance from the hostile counsel of the nations and the malicious thoughts of the peoples was by its God Jehovah, not <span id="page686" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="686" data-before-text="686"></span>by mighty men of war and energetic war horses. Such features do not distinguish the nations and peoples of this world in this most heavily armed period in all human history. The nations and peoples groan under the burden loaded upon them because of the expenses and demands of their military, naval and air force departments. Regardless of the prayers of their popes, priests, and other religious clergymen and orders, they do not find that without militarism Jehovah God delivers them.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 7.

Who, indeed, is the “happy” nation, the “chosen” people? It will help us to find out if we look back at the nation of whom the inspired writer of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968842/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 33</a> was a member, for he wrote concerning his own nation. From the beginning of its national history it had been favored with miraculous deliverances by this God who alone bears the name Jehovah. What a dramatic deliverance that was at the very birth of the nation, when it was delivered from captivity and slavery in Egypt after its celebration of the Passover in the year 1513 B.C.E., followed not many days later by that astounding deliverance across the dried-up bed of the Red Sea to the Sinai Peninsula, whereas the militarized forces of the Egyptians were drowned like rodents in the returning waters of the sea! No other nation in ancient or modern history can point to such a deliverance or anything like such in its national history. The eastern bank of the Red Sea was the scene of great happiness for the miraculously rescued nation. Truly Jehovah God had chosen them!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968842/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ex. 12:1 to 15:21</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 8.

There they were really organized into a nation, separate and distinct from all the other nations of the earth. There they were favored by hearing a voice from God declaring the famous Ten Commandments and afterward given those Ten Commandments in written form on stone tablets, the writing of these being done, not by the prophet Moses, but by the “finger of God.” These Ten Commandments were the first laws of the legal contract or covenant that was made between the nation and its heavenly Deliverer. The First of these Ten Commandments insisted that He must be their God. It read: “I am Jehovah your God, who have brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slaves. You must not have any other gods against my face.” No other god had shared in their deliverance and so Jehovah had a right to demand their exclusive devotion.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968842/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ex. 19:1 to 20:18</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>DEATH AND REBIRTH OF A NATION</strong></p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 9.

As long as they carried out their national contract or covenant as mediated by the prophet Moses they prospered in the land flowing with milk and honey into which their God brought them, in 1473 B.C.E. It was when they broke the laws and commandments of their national covenant and turned to worshiping the false gods of the nations roundabout that they got into difficulty. Faithful to his covenant, Jehovah God raised up special judges to deliver them out of the hand of their enemies. He raised <span id="page687" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="687" data-before-text="687"></span>up his fearless, plain-speaking prophets to warn them of the foolishness of a wrong course and of the terrible consequences to come from it. Because of wavering between the worship of the one living and true God and the false demon gods, the nation had its ups and downs. Because of the goodness of God to the nation, their second king, namely, David the son of Jesse of Bethlehem, wrote: “Happy is the people whose God is Jehovah!”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968842/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 144:15</a>.</p>

<strong>The Rebirth of the Happy Nation</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[26]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> From the standpoint of Babylon the Great and her political paramours, the deathblow had been dealt to the “nation whose God is Jehovah.” But they forgot or overlooked what this God had done back in the year 537 B.C.E. They did not figure or believe that this same God could do it again, in a final and complete fulfillment of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968844/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isaiah 66:7, 8</a>. But he did do so! The very next year, the first postwar year of 1919, Babylon the Great and her political paramours saw the rebirth of the “nation whose God is Jehovah” at “one time,” together with the bringing forth of its “land” of religious existence and activity as “in one day”! Suddenly those dynamic leading representatives of the Watch Tower Society were released from imprisonment, never to return under false charges. The international organization was reconstructed, <span id="page697" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="697" data-before-text="697"></span>the first postwar international convention was held at Cedar Point, Ohio, and a new magazine, auxiliary to the still continuing <em>Watch Tower</em> magazine, was published.

O how happy the “nation whose God is Jehovah” could be, not only the remnant thereof still in the flesh on this earth, but also its King Jesus Christ and the other resurrected members of the “holy nation” in heaven! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968844/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 33:12</a>) But how unhappy Babylon the Great, including Christendom, had reason to be at this powerful evidence that she had fallen from her position of power against Jehovah’s “nation” and had come under his adverse judgment that will shortly be executed in absolute destruction! Like her prototype of ancient times that fell before Cyrus the Great in 539 B.C.E., so Babylon the Great must have fallen or otherwise the remnant of the “nation whose God is Jehovah” could not have gone free in the year 1919.

But even now while yet on earth in this “time of the end” of the anguished Gentile nations, the remnant of the “nation whose God is Jehovah” has unique reasons for being happy.

Worshiping Jehovah does not mean that you must unite with the Republic of Israel or worship in Jewish synagogues, or even at modern Jerusalem. But it is true that any people that has had Jehovah as its God has been honored and blessed because of this. When General Dwight D. Eisenhower was inaugurated as United States president for the second time, in 1957, and took his oath of office, he had his hand on the open Bible (<em>American Standard Version</em>), at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961761/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 33:12</a>, which reads: “Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah, the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.” So the main thing is our having respect for the true God himself, rather than our having respect for the people having him as God. The reason why the natural Jews or the Israelites of today do not evidently have divine blessing is that they do not have Jehovah as their God any more. Yet there is today a people that does worship Jehovah as God with spirit and truth. They are not to be despised, for to despise these faithful ones means to show disrespect and dishonor to God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961761/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 4:21-24</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>THE “KING OF ETERNITY”</strong></p><p id="p76" data-pid="76" class="qu">11.

It is because of the original rebellion against the “King <span id="page616" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="616" data-before-text="616"></span>of eternity.” Was that rebellion not put down at once? No, it was not. Why were not the rebels executed all at once to keep the rebellion from spreading? Well, if they had been at once executed, we would not be here today, with an opportunity of being united under God’s kingdom. Why not? It was because the rebels included our first human parents. We are the latest descendants from those rebels against Jehovah God.</p>

The Far East took note of the remedy that he offered. On January 22, 1957, the <em>China Post</em> of Taipei, Taiwan (or, Formosa), came out with a front-page headline: “Ike Pledges US Might, Wealth To Help Heal World Division In 2nd Inaugural Address.” Then with reference to the second inauguration of <span id="page558" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="558" data-before-text="558"></span>Dwight D. Eisenhower as president of the United States of America, this only English-language newspaper of Free China published this CNA-UP news dispatch of January 21, from Washington, D.C.: “President Eisenhower today pledged America’s might and wealth to help ‘heal this divided world’ and bring it peace with justice under law. To achieve this goal ‘will be hard’ and ‘we must be . . . ready to pay its full price,’ the President said. ‘High will be its cost,’ he said, ‘in toil patiently sustained, in help honorably given, in sacrifice calmly borne.’ Eisenhower proclaimed America’s ‘deep involvement in the destiny of men everywhere.’”</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu"> 4.

But note these facts: When Eisenhower was sworn into office the second time he had his hand on the open copy of the American Standard Version of the Bible, given him by his mother when he was about to graduate from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1915. His hand rested on the scripture at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957683/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 33:12</a>, which reads: “Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah, the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.” This was as if to suggest that the United States of America should be that blessed “nation whose God is Jehovah,” and that, to become blessed, all nations of the earth must each be a nation having Jehovah as its God.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu"> 5.

When being sworn in then he had his left hand on two copies of the Bible. The one copy, the so-called George Washington Bible, was opened at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957683/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 127:1</a>, which reads: “Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.” The other copy, General Eisenhower’s gift Bible, with his full name inscribed in gold letters on the black leather binding, was opened at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957683/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>, which reads: “If my people who are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.”—New York <em>Times,</em> January 20 and 21, 1953.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu"> 6.

Less than two months after General Eisenhower first became president the mighty Russian Communist dictator, Joseph Stalin, died, but has the condition of the nations of the world got better? In President Eisenhower’s second term of office, more than four years after he swore solemnly with his hand at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957683/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>, has the land of America been healed by him and other American politicians, and by business leaders and religious clergymen?

Failure to heal means nothing less than the death of this world with all the consequences of that to earth’s population of two billion five hundred million. If the United States of America is to be healed, the rest of the world must also be healed. For today no nation lives to itself. No nation can stand alone. No nation can keep from catching the infectious disease that is bringing the sick nations to their grave.</p>

Their sickly condition is now coming to a grand climax. Why has this serious condition arisen? What is the root of the trouble, that we may know what is the only remedy to be applied for us to be healed? The answer to this vital question is given us in a national example. No, not in the modern-day Israel, whose very existence the Arab world hates, but in the twelve-tribe nation of Israel of more than two thousand five hundred years ago, the nation that produced the lawgiver, Moses, and King David and King Solomon. In the Sinai Peninsula, at Mount Sinai, Moses acted as a go-between between Jehovah God and men and brought these into a national agreement with God. Through Moses, God gave that ancient nation of Israel his special laws.</p><p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="qu">12. Because of their descent from what man did God choose that nation of Israel, and what promises of healing to the nations did God make through this man?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Back there Moses told Israel that Jehovah God had not chosen the nation because of what they were in themselves. To the contrary, it was because their great-grandfather was the Hebrew named Abraham, and this Abraham really believed in Jehovah as God and obeyed him and was called for this “Jehovah’s friend.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957683/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Deut. 7:6-9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957683/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 20:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957683/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Isa. 41:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957683/9/3" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> Jas. 2:23</a>) God specially promised to his friend Abraham that there was to come a healing to all the nations of the earth, and that Abraham and his offspring or descendants would have a part in that wonderful healing work. God’s promises to Abraham were: “By you all the families of the earth will bless themselves.” “And by your descendants shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves, because you have obeyed my voice.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957683/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gen. 12:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957683/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 22:18</a>, <em>RS</em>) In view of those promises, let no one today make a mistake and think this means the modern nation of Israel. It is true that the modern Israelis can show they are natural descendants of ancient Abraham, but that mere line of descent does not make them the seed of blessing, not even to the eighty other nations in the United Nations organization to which Israel belongs. Today no one sees the nations of the earth blessing themselves by the nation of Israel and getting healed. The healing of people of all nations has drawn near in our day by means other than that modern nation of this divided world.</p><p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="qu">13.

They worked together in building a glorious temple to him at Jerusalem. They kept their part of their agreement or covenant with him by obeying his commandments. So he kept his part of the covenant by blessing them with protection from their enemies and with prosperity. The history of King Solomon’s reign tells us: “Judah and Israel were many, like the grains of sand that are by the sea for multitude, eating and drinking and rejoicing. As for Solomon, he proved to be ruler over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines and to the boundary of Egypt. They were bringing gifts and serving Solomon all the days of his life.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957683/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Ki. 4:20, 21</a>) That was a prophetic picture of what it will be like on earth when Jehovah God heals all mankind by bringing the blessing that he promised through Abraham.</p>

Did the healing come? Yes, seventy years after the destruction of the holy city of Jerusalem. Why? Because Jehovah God did not then cast them off from being his chosen people. As exiles in Babylon, or in what is now the Arab kingdom of Iraq, many of the Israelites sorrowed for having broken their covenant with Jehovah God and they turned again to his worship. For his own name’s sake Jehovah God did then what he had promised to do when they returned to him. He healed them. He healed their land by bringing them back from exile and peopling it with them, that there they might again worship him at a rebuilt temple in Jerusalem. In this way the great Physician bound up their broken hearts and blessed their plagued land so that it became like the garden of Eden, like the paradise in which God, the Creator, put the first man and woman, Adam and Eve.

Where is the temple to Jehovah on the hill or mountain of Moriah? It is not. It was destroyed by the Roman world power in the year 70 of the Christian era. Was this for the same reason as in 607 before Christ? Yes. It was because the Israelites fell away from worshiping Jehovah. For this decisive reason their holy city was besieged for several months and captured and destroyed, along with its temple, and the 97,000 Israelites that lived through the horrible destruction were carried away captive and scattered to the ends of the earth, where many are to be found today. But has not their nation been healed since 1948, when the republic of Israel was set up in the midst of the Arab nations? Has not their land been healed by all the farming and gardening and oil digging that the Israelis are doing? To answer these questions with hard facts we must ask, Has the temple to Jehovah been rebuilt upon Mount Moriah? Is the nation of modern Israel trusting in him for protection against all its enemies? Are the Israelis eating and drinking and rejoicing under Jehovah’s king of the tribe of Judah and of the royal family of David as in the days of King Solomon, the anointed son of David? Is their land flourishing like the garden of Eden? Are they happy as Jehovah’s people, bearing his holy name as his witnesses?</p><p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">18. Why is the answer to all these questions No?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Why is the answer to all of these questions No?

In turn Jehovah cast away that faithless nation as his people and removed his name from them. He has since put his name upon those worthy to bear it and to act as his witnesses.</p><p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu">19.

He said to them: “Why is it you also overstep the commandment of God because of your tradition? . . . And so you have made the word of God invalid because of your tradition. You hypocrites, Isaiah aptly prophesied about you, when he said: ‘This people honors me with their lips, yet their hearts are far removed from me. It is in vain that they keep paying respect to me, because they teach commands of men as doctrines.’” <span id="page563" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="563" data-before-text="563"></span>And a few days before such Israelites put Jesus Christ to death for the sake of their man-made traditions, he told them that they had rejected the promised descendant of King David, whom Jehovah God had anointed and sent, and then he added: “This is why I say to you, The kingdom of God will be taken from you and be given to a nation producing its fruits.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957683/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 15:1-9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957683/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 21:42, 43</a>) Since it is to be judged by its fruits, we ask, Is the republic of Israel today bringing forth the fruits of the kingdom of God in proof that they are his nation? No; no more than their forefathers nineteen hundred years ago did. Jesus’ sentential words to them continue true until now: “Look! your house is abandoned to you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957683/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matt. 23:38</a>) To this day they have no temple at its old location in Jerusalem. To this day they have no priesthood of the chosen family of Aaron, the brother of Moses. Their government is not a theocracy. Their republic is trying to bring forth the fruits of the United Nations organization.</p>

<strong>The Happiness of the “Nation Whose God Is Jehovah”</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> No, it is not the most powerful and prosperous nation on earth today. However, that it was a happy nation and would be such may have been suggested by what took place on an inauguration day of one of its presidents at the national capital, Washington, D.C., January 20, 1957. The nation’s thirty-fourth president was being inaugurated for his second term in office. Following the custom, he was being sworn in with his right hand resting upon an open Bible. This Bible was not the British King James or Authorized Version Bible, but was the American Standard Version <span id="page685" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="685" data-before-text="685"></span>of the Bible as published in the year 1901 C.E. This particular copy had been given him by his God-fearing mother when he was about to graduate from the national Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1915, the second year of World War I. His hand purposely rested at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968842/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 33:12</a>, which, in the <em>American Standard Version,</em> reads as follows: “Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah, the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.” In the later published version, <em>An American Translation,</em> of 1939, this <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968842/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps 33 verse 12</a> opens up saying: “How happy is the nation . . . ”—See the New York <em>Times</em> of January 21, 1957.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1968842/0">a</a></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> By this gesture the reinaugurated president may have been suggesting that the United States of America was that blessed or happy nation or that he would serve in the presidency to make it such.

Well, during his first term in office his nation became involved in the political struggles of North Vietnam and South Vietnam.

Other troubles of the nation, both internal and external, domestic and foreign, have multiplied since. Why, then, has the blessedness, the happiness, for which the president hoped on his second inauguration in 1957, not been realized since? Why has the nation not proved itself entitled to such happiness?</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 5.

The secret is its God and its being his chosen possession. The verse plainly says, not, ‘Happy is the most prosperous and most militarily powerful nation,’ but: “Blessed [or, Happy] is the nation whose God is Jehovah, the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.” (<em>AS; AT</em>) So, quite properly, we ask: Did the nation’s thirty-fourth president lead his nation into choosing Jehovah as its God? By the Supreme Court of the United States of America this nation has been designated as a “Christian nation,” but has it worshiped Jehovah as its God and has it proved itself to be “the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance”? Where are the facts in favor of the answer Yes! even though the United States of America is the leading nation in Christendom? Such facts cannot be found. Nor can they be found for any other of the 197 nations among whom the name of Jehovah has been proclaimed by his witnesses for many years, not even for the Republic of Israel.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 6.

<strong>How Can You Find Real Security?</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[27]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Nothing that this world offers as security will mean anything when God’s anger comes against the present human systems. And <em>all</em> the political, religious, military and economic systems now dominating mankind are to be brought to nothing. Hence, they certainly will not provide any security. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977241/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Rev. 6:16, 17</a>) So what may appear strong and protective today will crumble when God’s destructive forces strike. In ancient times, many looked to powerful horses for security and escape in time of trouble. But God’s Word says: “The horse is a deception for salvation, and by the abundance of its vital energy it does not afford escape.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977241/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 33:17</a>) Similarly today, neither seemingly strong man-made systems nor material advantages will provide any better security or escape. “Salvation belongs to Jehovah,” not to any system or work of men. “The name of Jehovah is a strong tower. Into it the righteous runs and is given protection.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977241/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 3:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977241/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Prov. 18:10</a>.</p>

Red is associated with war because war means bloodshed and blood is red. Thus the ancients made the planet Mars a symbol of war because of its reddish hue. This horseman’s work finds mention in Jesus’ great prophecy: “Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.” Certainly World War I, beginning in 1914, took peace from the earth and resulted in much slaughter.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Mark 13:8</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The third horse was black and its rider carried a pair of scales. He was accompanied by an announcement of high prices: a quart of wheat and three quarts of barley, each for a denarius, a day’s wages. (Barley was held to be so far inferior to wheat that Roman soldiers at times were punished by being given barley instead of wheat rations.) This horseman pictures famine due to war. Fittingly the horse itself was black, for blackness is a symbol of famine: “Their aspect has become darker than blackness itself. They have not been recognized in the streets. Their skin has shriveled upon their bones.” Jesus, in his great prophecy, likewise associated world war with famine: “Nation will rise against nation and . . . there will be food shortages.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Lam. 4:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Mark 13:8</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">The rider’s having a pair of scales in his hand is also indicative of famine conditions. Thus Ezekiel was told: “Son of man, . . . they will have to eat bread by weight and in anxious care, and it will be by measure and in horror that they will drink water itself, to the intent that they may be lacking bread and water.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ezek. 4:16, 17</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">As to the meaning of the peculiar instruction given to this third horseman, <span id="page152" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="152" data-before-text="152"></span>“Do not harm the olive oil and the wine,” God’s Word itself gives a clue, for at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Proverbs 21:17</a> we are told that “he that is loving wine and oil will not gain riches.” Wine and oil are symbols of luxuries and their not being harmed would indicate that, in spite of famine conditions that affected the common people, the rich still had their luxuries, and so it proved to be.</p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The hamstrings of a horse are the back tendons above the hock of the hind legs of the horse; the hock of the hind legs corresponding to the knee of the horse’s front legs. By cutting these tendons the horses were crippled and no longer able to serve war purposes, either for cavalry or to pull war chariots. This was the simplest way to put a horse out of the battle. Of course, after these horses were hamstrung, disabled, they would be put to death, <span id="page608" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="608" data-before-text="608"></span>destroyed, even as were the war chariots.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Concerning horses McClintock &amp; Strong’s <em>Cyclopædia</em> states: “The most striking feature in the Biblical notices of the horse is the exclusive use of it for military operations. In no instance is it referred to as employed for the purpose of ordinary locomotion or agriculture.” They were, however, used for affairs of state. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962729/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Esther 6:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962729/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 8:14</a>) They were especially associated with Egypt, as we note at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962729/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 31:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962729/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 3</a>: “Woe to those going down to Egypt for assistance, those who rely on mere horses, and who put their trust in war chariots, because they are numerous, and in steeds, because they are very mighty, but who have not looked to the Holy One of Israel and have not searched for Jehovah himself. The Egyptians, though, are earthling men, and not God; and their horses are flesh, and not spirit.” Similar unfavorable references appear at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962729/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 20:7 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962729/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Ps 33:17</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Concerning the king of Israel in particular, warning was given: “He should not increase horses for himself.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962729/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Deut. 17:16</a>) No doubt, among the reasons why Jehovah, by the requirements set out in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962729/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Leviticus 11</a>, showed that the horse was to be viewed as an unclean animal was so that the Jews would not be tempted to acquire horses for food and then use them for war purposes and place their trust in them. Joshua’s action was according to divine instructions that, in turn, were in line with this divine principle. He was the judge of Israel under the invisible King Jehovah God. In obeying the divine command to hamstring the forces of the enemy, he did not appropriate them to himself and thus increase horses for himself as the judge of Israel.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">All this, however, serves for more than historical interest, for it is included in “all the things that were written aforetime [which] were written for our instruction, that through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962729/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Rom. 15:4</a>) Joshua’s diligently complying with these instructions, doing “just as Jehovah had said to him,” pictures that Jehovah’s people of today do not rely upon the world’s means of carnal warfare. They renounce the carnal warfare of this world and beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears. This corresponds to the hamstringing of the war horses of the ancient Canaanites.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962729/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isa. 2:4</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"></p>

<strong>The Source of All Dynamic Energy and Vigorous Power</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> Many people, however, seem to be blinded by the brilliance of such scientific progress and technological achievements. Losing sight of their proper place in the universe, some of these confessed physical weaklings suddenly view themselves and other men as great mental giants with overpowering intelligence. Especially is this perverted mental concept found among the more educated classes and prominent world leaders, many of whom are disgustingly obnoxious in their boastful arrogance and overbearing self-confidence. Bloated with pride, they wantonly brag of man’s accomplishments in this jet-powered, electronic, atom-smashing age. As men zoom to new heights of success in their rocket program they imagine and <span id="page425" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="425" data-before-text="425"></span>predict in great swelling words that humans are on the very threshold of becoming conquerors and masters of outer space, of establishing themselves in what they think is the “ultimate position” in the universe. As a consequence the general masses of mankind are constantly urged and pressured into putting their complete trust and confidence in the mental powers and thinking ability of these world leaders for guidance, protection and security.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 4. Are human creatures justified in boasting of their accomplishments?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> But is there any truth, in actual fact, that gives these human creatures the license and freedom to glory and boast in their accomplishments or in the security of human strength? It is granted, men through the fertility of their brains and the ingenuity of their hands have contrived not only simple oxcarts and water wheels but also giant turbines and intricate nuclear machines of great power. But certainly this gives no reason or excuse for praising and worshiping these mortal creatures as if they were gods. Really, man’s most complicated machines are based on simple fundamental laws and principles of mechanics, not one of which he has created or originated. Men of science and learning have merely discovered and applied principles and forces of energy that were in existence long before man made his comparatively recent debut on this planet.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 5. So how are we to view the physical and mental strength of creatures?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> The pounding hoofs and the snorting nostrils of a charging cavalry of horses may be rated by some people as a thrilling display of vigor and strength, sending shivers down the spine. Yet long ago the psalmist warned against trusting in such false strength. “The horse is a deception for salvation, and by the abundance of its vital energy it does not afford escape.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961523/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 33:17</a>) With like force of reasoning it is foolish and ridiculous to put trust and confidence in men, who are much weaker than horses. The bulging muscles of an athlete or the thunderous lung power of a political dictator are just as deceiving. To put trust and hope in the strength of earthly men, even though they elevate themselves to a princely status among their fellows because of their “brainy” accomplishments—this too was long ago described as futile. “Salvation by earthling man is worthless.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961523/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Pss. 60:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961523/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 146:3</a>) Of a truth both men and horses are deceptive sources of true strength.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 6.

Who gave the horse or the athlete his vitality and strength? Who generated the power of gravity by which the rivers flow and the waters fall? Or who set the ceaseless tides in motion to time indefinite? Who created the fabulous furnace of the sun with its internal temperature estimated at more than 40,000,000 degrees Fahrenheit? And who concentrated such incomprehensible energy as is bound up in minute atoms, the invisible particles of all physical matter?

<strong>Warnings of Jehovah’s Unusual Work</strong><br/><p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[70]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"><sup>30</sup></span> Likewise in this time of the end, when Jehovah’s witnesses are particularly warning Christendom concerning the coming of God’s executional forces at Armageddon. Now her rulers, backed by her priests and prophets, take refuge, not in Jehovah’s provided resting place and place of ease, but in worldly alliances. First, Christendom proposed and took refuge in the League of Nations, from 1919 down to 1939. Then, from 1945 till now, she has concealed herself behind the world-peace-and-security organization, the United Nations. <span id="page143" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="143" data-before-text="143"></span>Heedless of Jehovah’s witnesses, Christendom in effect says:</p><p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="qu">31. What, in effect, does Christendom say self-assuringly and in defiance to Jehovah’s witnesses?</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[71]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="31"><sup>31</sup></span> ‘You witnesses, with your message of the day of vengeance of your God Jehovah, can’t scare us. The Death and Sheol that you predict for us won’t touch us or harm us. We have got on good terms with Death so it will not touch us by those executional forces of your Jehovah God. We’ll survive and you won’t. We have come to a good understanding with Sheol, which you witnesses say is the common grave. We have a vision with it; we see alike as to the outcome of matters. Sheol will not open its mouth or enlarge itself to receive us, and you witnesses of Jehovah will never bury our bones after what you call Armageddon. Ha, ha! We once made our refuge the League of Nations and the Court of International Justice. Since World War II we have concealed ourselves behind the United Nations, its security forces, its Committee for Disarmament, its International Court of Justice, and all the defensive alliances and pacts that have been formed within the framework of the United Nations. So those forces of destruction about which you witnesses of Jehovah are doing such sensational preaching will never reach us or sweep us into Death and Sheol. They will be swept back, and our Egyptian refuge and place of concealment will hold out. They are our last and only hope, but they will not fail us. They will prove true to us, and you witnesses will prove to be calamity howlers, false prophets such as we have all along said that you were.’</p><p id="p72" data-pid="72" class="qu">32, 33. (a) In what do we witnesses of Jehovah say that Christendom’s rulers have made their refuge, as proved by <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959162/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Psalms 62:8, 9 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959162/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Ps 33:17-19</a>? (b) As a refuge and concealment place, what did the League of Nations prove to be, and what will the United Nations prove to be?</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[72]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="32"><sup>32</sup></span> But, standing on God’s sure Word, we witnesses of Jehovah say that Christendom’s rulers political and religious have made their refuge a lying, deceptive arrangement. They have concealed themselves in what will prove false to them—in false gods, in undependable allies, in what is unequal to meeting the forces operating at the time of divine execution. We quote <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959162/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Psalm 62:8, 9</a>: “God is a refuge for us. . . . Indeed the sons of earthling man are an exhalation, the sons of mankind are a <em>lie.</em> When laid upon the scales they are all together lighter than an exhalation.”</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" data-rel-pid="[72]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="33"><sup>33</sup></span> We witnesses also quote <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959162/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Psalm 33:17-19</a>: “The horse [of Egypt for warfare] is a deception for salvation, and by the abundance of its vital energy it does not afford escape. Look! the eye of Jehovah is toward those fearing <em>him,</em> to those waiting for his loving-kindness, to deliver their soul from death itself, and to preserve them alive in famine.” Today Christendom has a symbolic “image of the wild beast.” Each member of the United Nations has joined in setting it up or in maintaining it for worship as an idol image for worship by the worldly nations. Concerning it we quote <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959162/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Jeremiah (10:14, 15</a>): “His molten image is a <em>falsehood,</em> and there is no spirit in them. They are vanity, a work of mockery. In the time of their being given attention they will perish.” Hence we witnesses say: The war horses of antitypical Egypt will not avail Christendom. The Devil-inspired, man-made images symbolizing peace and security now worshiped by the nations will prove to be no gods. The alliance of Christendom’s religions with this political world is an unclean, ungodly deception. As a refuge and place of concealment the League of Nations proved to be a lie, even without the coming of the battle of Armageddon. Not less so now, when the actual “war of the great day of God the Almighty” is impending, the United Nations is a lie and a falsehood! Jehovah says so through his Word.</p>
