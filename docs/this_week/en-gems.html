Marriage customs also vary. <em>Zeitschrift für Semitistik und verwandte Gebiete</em> (edited by E. Littmann, Leipzig, 1927, Vol. 5, p. 132) reported that child marriage is frequent in the Promised Land even in modern times, one case being cited of two brothers aged 8 and 12 who were married, the wife of the older attending school with her husband. However, one Hebrew manuscript, the Syriac <em>Peshitta,</em> and some manuscripts of the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000144/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 28:1</a> give “twenty-five years” as the age of Ahaz when beginning to reign.</p>

<strong>God Does Not Torment Souls</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> However, some persons may point to Jesus’ parable at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101976011/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 16:19-31</a>, which describes a rich man in a “blazing fire” of torment. The dictionary defines a “parable” as a “short fictitious story”​—not something that literally happens in real life. Here, Jesus was illustrating how, as a class, the religious leaders of the Jews would “die” figuratively toward having God’s favor and come into distress while alive on earth​—as they did on hearing Jesus proclaim his message against them. The Bible says nothing about God’s tormenting people after death in “hellfire.”<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1101976011/0">a</a> The idea of torment by fire is completely foreign to Jehovah God, who forthrightly condemned apostate Jews for the “detestable thing” of making “their sons and their daughters pass through the fire to Molech,” the god of Ammon.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101976011/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jeremiah 32:35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101976011/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 2 Chronicles 28:3</a>.</p>

The best fords are usually marked by a break in the steep banks and tangled undergrowth and could therefore easily be guarded, as occurred <span id="page315" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="315" data-before-text="315"></span>when the spies were hidden by Rahab, and when the men of Gilead under Jephthah stopped all travelers and tested them with the word “Shibboleth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963367/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Josh. 2:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963367/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 16,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963367/13/2" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 22, 23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963367/13/3" data-bid="14-4" class="b"> Judg. 12:1-6</a>) The control of the fords was partly responsible for Ehud’s victory over the Moabites after the death of King Eglon and the successful mopping-up operation against the Midianites fleeing from Gideon’s little band of three hundred men.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963367/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Judg. 3:28, 29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963367/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 7:24, 25</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Elijah and Elisha needed no fords when Jehovah divided the waters so that they crossed dry-shod.

Already by early April the barley harvest is over in the valley, some six weeks ahead of the hill country. The melting snows of Hermon have found their way through the higher lakes and now fill the Zor to the brim, making the stream swift and deep and, where the banks are low, hundreds of yards wide. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963367/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Josh. 3:15</a>) It was a feat worthy of mention when the strong men of Gad swam the river under similar conditions later on.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963367/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Chron. 12:15</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Imagine the multitude of Israelites crossing, with women and children! It needed a miracle indeed. Through Jehovah’s power the miracle did occur and the waters were cut off completely so that the nation could cross “on dry ground.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963367/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Josh. 3:16, 17</a>) It may be that a blockage higher up was timed to assist the crossing, just as when, in December, A.D. 1267, a lofty mound collapsed into the river and stopped the waters for sixteen hours. This was recorded by the Arab historian Nowairi when relating how Sultan Beybars had a bridge built to get his army across the Jordan during the Crusades. He refers to the rising waters a “lance length” in depth washing away some of the bridge piers, so this too was a time of flood, though caused at this date by the winter rains. But we must beware of minimizing the miraculous element, as does Josephus, who argues that the nation waded across at a time when the current only ran gently.—<em>Antiquities,</em> Book 5, chap. 1. 3.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="ss"><strong>JERICHO AND THE DEAD SEA</strong></p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">When Lot chose the area of the Jordan he no doubt realized its potential value, fully justified since, as men have terraced, irrigated and cared for it.

Forty-nine varieties of dates grew in the valley, and Jericho, with its own vital spring, and aided by a system of aqueducts, was a flourishing winter resort. “The city of the palm trees” was a fitting name, and still is.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963367/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Deut. 34:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963367/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 28:15</a>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Between 1939 and 1948 the settlement of Bet Haarava not far from the Dead Sea used the sweet waters of Jordan to leach the salt from the soil, and became renowned throughout Israel for the best tomatoes, grown all the year round.

For years nearly seven million tons of water has flowed in each day, and an equal amount evaporates, so that the level of 1,287 feet below sea level stays much the same.

<strong>Tiglath-pileser (III)</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Most reference works assign a reign of about eighteen years to Tiglath-pileser III. However, the Biblical references to him indicate that his kingship was of considerably longer duration, inasmuch as he appears from the time of Menahem down to that of Hoshea. (See chart, pages 344, 345.) It is therefore worth noting that the period prior to the time generally assigned for the start of Tiglath-pileser’s reign is one of relative obscurity as far as the ancient records are concerned and is considered to have been a time of great decline for the Assyrians. Thus the <span id="page1600" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1600" data-before-text="1600"></span>French scholar, Georges Roux, in his book <em>Ancient Iraq</em> (p. 251) states that “for thirty-six years . . . , Assyria was practically paralysed.” As for Ashurnirari V, considered to have been the predecessor of Tiglath-pileser III, the same author observes: “. . . he hardly dared leave his palace and was probably killed in a revolution which broke out in Kalhu and put upon the throne his younger brother [?], Tiglath-pileser III.” In view of this it seems entirely possible that Tiglath-pileser may have exercised the power of kingship for a longer period of time than commonly credited to him, even perhaps as a coregent.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014302/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 28:16</a> Ahaz is spoken of as sending “to the <em>kings</em> of Assyria for <em>them</em> to help him.” While the plural “kings,” occurring in the Hebrew Masoretic text, appears in the singular (“king”) in other ancient manuscripts and in the <em>Septuagint,</em> many modern translations favor the Hebrew plural (<em>JP</em>, [English and French], <em>NW</em>) Some scholars view the plural here as merely indicating the sum of majesty and greatness ascribed to the one monarch (Tiglath-pileser III) as the “king of kings.” Yet attention is also called to the boastful claim of the Assyrian monarch recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014302/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isaiah 10:8</a>: “Are not my princes at the same time kings?” It is thus possible that the reference to “Pul the king of Assyria” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014302/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Ki. 15:19</a>) may also be applied in the sense of his being the ruler of an Assyrian province prior to becoming head of the entire empire.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Upon his death Tiglath-pileser III was succeeded by Shalmaneser V.

So they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath-heres in the mountainous region of Ephraim, on the north of Mount Gaash. And all that generation too were gathered to their fathers, and another generation began to rise after them.” The gathering of all these to their fathers signifies that they all descended to Sheol, Haʹdes.</p><p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu">28.

He was the first Jewish king to rule at Jerusalem. In a number of the psalms that David wrote he speaks about deliverance from Sheol or Haʹdes.

Long afterward, on the festival day of Shabuoth (Pentecost) of 33 C.E., David was reported to be still in Sheol or Haʹdes. On that day the Christian apostle Peter reported that Psalm Sixteen <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Ps 16</a> (composed by David) had then been fulfilled in David’s promised descendant, Jesus Christ. As Peter said concerning David: “He saw beforehand and spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he forsaken in Haʹdes nor did his flesh see corruption. This Jesus God resurrected, of which fact we are all witnesses. . . .

By turning back his people to the law of Jehovah God, Josiah tried to do what he could to prevent national calamity from coming upon them. When he inquired through the prophetess Huldah what the future held for his nation, Josiah was given this promise from God: “Here I am gathering you to your forefathers, and you will certainly be gathered to your own graveyard in peace, and your eyes will not look upon all the calamity that I am bringing upon this place.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">2 Ki. 22:20</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"><sup>30</sup></span> Josiah died from a wound received in battle at Megiddo. So it was not during the terrible calamity that was to come upon Jerusalem. After Josiah was fatally wounded, “his servants took him down from the chariot and had him ride in the second war chariot that was his and brought him to Jerusalem. Thus he died and was buried in the graveyard of his forefathers; and all Judah and Jerusalem were mourning over Josiah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">2 Chron. 35:22-24</a>) Not all the kings of Jerusalem who preceded Josiah were buried in the same place at Jerusalem, in the “burial places of the kings of Israel.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">2 Chron. 28:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/41/1" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> 21:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/41/2" data-bid="42-3" class="b"> 24:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/41/3" data-bid="42-4" class="b"> 32:33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/41/4" data-bid="42-5" class="b"> 16:14</a>.</p><p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">31, 32.

Nearly three millenniums! someone exclaims. What in that day and age could interest us moderns of this smart twentieth century? There is really much to interest us. For the critical world situation of today, with its fearful possibilities, finds a striking parallel in the threat that the ancient Assyrian Empire posed to all other nations in that heyday of its power. Heated emotions of nationalism rose to the boiling point. And in this nuclear age, radical, dictatorial powers are again whipping the earth into a ferment of nationalistic disunity. Thus the same question now comes to the fore as in the day of the proud Assyrian: Who may successfully meet the challenge of nationalism, and survive?</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">2, 3. (a) In what way was Hezekiah’s reign noteworthy? (b) In the psalms collected by Hezekiah, who and what are exalted, and with what prophetic import?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> It was in the eighth century B.C.E. that the Assyrian World Empire reached a zenith of power. It was in that period, too, in the year 745, that Hezekiah, like David and Solomon before him, came to sit “upon Jehovah’s throne as king” in Jerusalem. “And he continued to do what was right in Jehovah’s eyes, according to all that David his forefather had done.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 29:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 2 Chron. 29:2</a>) He was wholehearted in his support of the true worship of Jehovah. He collected many of the psalms into book form for temple worship, including those composed by David. Hezekiah himself may have written <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 33</a> quoted above, as well as other psalms that appear to extol Jehovah because of his triumph over the Assyrian.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> These psalms rise to sublime heights in praising Jehovah as the great Deliverer. They exalt true worship as the way to salvation and enduring happiness. Beyond compare is the eternal King, Jehovah, and how blessed the city of his true worship! “Jehovah is great and much to be praised in the city of our God, in his holy mountain. Pretty for loftiness, the exultation of the whole earth, is Mount Zion on the remote sides of the north, the town of the grand King. In her dwelling towers God himself has become known as a secure height.” Through the miraculous deliverance of his beloved nation in Hezekiah’s day, Jehovah gives a prophetic forevision of how he will save true worshipers from nationalistic <span id="page141" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="141" data-before-text="141"></span>oppressors of this modern age, to his name’s praise.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 48:1-5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 10</a>.</p>

<strong>Rejoicing in the God of True Worship</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Then, in the sixteenth century, the Reformation brought forth Protestantism. Although Protestantism at first challenged some of the abuses of Catholicism, it failed to shake itself free from most of the “appendages of demon-worship.” Very soon it became involved in the wars and politics of Christendom. The divided sects <span id="page144" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="144" data-before-text="144"></span>of Protestantism have found no answer to the world problems of today.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">17.

King Ahaz died, and this marked the end of an era. Likewise, the year 1914 C.E. marked the end of the “appointed times of the nations,” during which God had permitted nationalism and its gods to hold uninterrupted sway over the earth. Now, with World War I, the present-day “pangs of distress” began. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Luke 21:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Matt. 24:8</a>) In the frenzy of war, Christendom’s religions chose nationalism ahead of Christian unity. The clergy urged on Catholic to kill Catholic, and Protestant to kill Protestant, and the apostate sects of so-called “Christianity” showed themselves to be as dead spiritually as King Ahaz is physically. They proved that they had lost their real identity as Christians in the same way that Israel lost any remaining identity as God’s nation when it was overthrown by the Assyrian and its people were transplanted within his empire. And why? “Over the fact that they had not listened to the voice of Jehovah their God . . . They neither listened nor performed.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Dan. 11:29</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>TRUE WORSHIP TO THE FORE!</strong></p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">18, 19.

This one does not fail in the crucial hour. He is the Founder of the real Christianity, Jehovah’s anointed King, Christ Jesus. The psalmist writes of him, prophetically: “You have loved righteousness and you hate wickedness. That is why God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of exultation more than your partners.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 45:7</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> One of Jesus’ “partners” in the Kingdom covenant, which Jehovah made with David, was Ahaz’s son, good King Hezekiah. His name means “Jehovah Has Strengthened.” It appears that, even before Jehovah established Hezekiah as king in Judah, he may have served for a time as coregent with Ahaz. No doubt he then began to show strength in behalf of true worship. Today, also, Christ began to do a preparatory work among sincere Christians on earth prior to receiving his kingdom. It was in this connection that the <em>Watchtower</em> magazine began to be published in 1879, in strong support of the Christian doctrine of the ransom and other Bible truths.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">20.

This has meant “woe for the earth,” as we see all around us today. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Rev. 12:7-9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 12</a>) But God now cut short the tribulation on his enemies, so that the “chosen ones” might be saved. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Matt. 24:21, 22</a>) How saved? By being gathered to true worship at Jehovah’s spiritual temple. It is thrilling to examine how Hezekiah’s bold action in Judah typifies Christ’s restoring true worship among the “praisers” of Jehovah on earth in modern times.</p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">21. What was foreshadowed by Hezekiah’s prompt action in opening and repairing the temple doors?</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> Right early at the beginning of his reign, Hezekiah attended to something very close to his heart.

Likewise, with <span id="page145" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="145" data-before-text="145"></span>Satan and his demons ousted from heaven, Jehovah and his kingly Son proceeded to fulfill Malachi’s prophecy: “‘And suddenly there will come to His temple the true Lord [Jehovah], whom you people are seeking, and the messenger of the covenant [Christ] in whom you are delighting. Look! He will certainly come,’ Jehovah of armies has said. . . . ‘And he must sit as a refiner and cleanser of silver and must cleanse the sons of Levi; . . . and they will certainly become to Jehovah people presenting a gift offering in righteousness. And the gift offering of Judah and of Jerusalem will actually be gratifying to Jehovah, as in the days of long ago and as in the years of antiquity.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Mal. 3:1-4</a>) Suddenly, in the year 1918, and while World War I was still raging at its height, this refining and cleansing of professed Christians commenced, with favor toward those who separated from the fallen religions of Christendom and came forward to serve Jehovah in righteousness.</p>

<strong>Rejoicing in the God of True Worship</strong><br/><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> Right early at the beginning of his reign, Hezekiah attended to something very close to his heart. He “opened the doors of the house of Jehovah and began to repair them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">2 Chron. 29:3</a>) True worship must be restored!

Look! He will certainly come,’ Jehovah of armies has said. . . . ‘And he must sit as a refiner and cleanser of silver and must cleanse the sons of Levi; . . . and they will certainly become to Jehovah people presenting a gift offering in righteousness. And the gift offering of Judah and of Jerusalem will actually be gratifying to Jehovah, as in the days of long ago and as in the years of antiquity.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Mal. 3:1-4</a>) Suddenly, in the year 1918, and while World War I was still raging at its height, this refining and cleansing of professed Christians commenced, with favor toward those who separated from the fallen religions of Christendom and came forward to serve Jehovah in righteousness.</p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">22.

So, Christ the King echoed the command given by Hezekiah of old: “Bring the impure thing out from the holy place.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">2 Chron. 29:5</a>) Christendom, the instigator of war and bloodshed on a mass scale, must be exposed as judged and cast out by Jehovah. The release of Jehovah’s Christian witnesses from Babylonish captivity in 1919 showed that Christendom’s religion had then fallen, along with all the rest of the world empire of demon religion. Now, as “an object of astonishment and a cause for whistling,” it awaits only the execution of God’s righteous judgment.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">2 Chron 29:8</a>.</p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">23.

The Greater-than-Hezekiah, Christ Jesus, has concluded “a covenant with Jehovah the God of Israel” on their behalf.

<strong>Hezekiah</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>His Zeal for True Worship.</strong> Hezekiah demonstrated his zeal for Jehovah’s worship immediately on taking the throne at 25 years of age. His first act was to reopen and repair the temple. Then, calling together the priests and Levites, he said to them: “It is close to my heart to conclude a covenant with Jehovah the God of Israel.” This was a covenant of faithfulness, as though the Law covenant, still in effect but neglected, was inaugurated anew in Judah. With great energy he proceeded to organize the Levites in their services, and he reestablished the arrangements for musical instruments and singing of praises. It was Nisan, the month for Passover to be celebrated, but the temple and the priests and Levites were unclean. By the 16th day of Nisan, the temple was cleansed and its utensils restored. Then a special atonement had to be made for all Israel. First, the princes brought sacrifices, sin offerings for the kingdom, the sanctuary, and the people, followed by thousands of burnt offerings by the people.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002011/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2Ch 29:1-36</a>.</p>

For example, during the years from 1919 onward, sanctimonious dress, the viewing of the great pyramid of Egypt as “the Bible in Stone,” the observance of pagan feasts such as the so-called “Christmas,” the use of pagan symbols such as the cross, and other religious uncleanness, persisted for a time. Such must be gotten rid of! “Utensils” appropriate to Jehovah’s worship must be brought into service. As God’s will was revealed progressively to them, the anointed remnant were happy to purify their temple worship, so that they could report back to their King in the same way that the priests and Levites reported back to Hezekiah: “We have cleansed the whole house of Jehovah, the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils . . . And all the utensils that King Ahaz removed from employment during his reign in his unfaithfulness we have prepared, and have sanctified them; and there they are before the altar of Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">2 Chron. 29:18, 19</a>) The same pattern of true worship that Jesus had established in the first century was restored among true Christians on earth.</p><p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="qu">26.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Rev. 20:6</a>) Then the priests proceeded to offer sacrifices on behalf of all, “because it was for all Israel that the king said the burnt offering and the sin offering should be.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">2 Chron. 29:24</a>) In the fulfillment, all the remaining ones of the spiritual Judeans—the 144,000—must now be brought forth and sanctified as the true people for Jehovah’s name. This was in fulfillment, too, of another of the psalms: “Gather to me my loyal ones, those concluding my covenant over sacrifice.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ps. 50:5</a>) As in Hezekiah’s day, all of these gathered according to Jehovah’s new-covenant arrangement, based on Jesus’ perfect sacrifice, “began to offer praise even with rejoicing.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">2 Chron. 29:30</a>.</p><p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="qu">27, 28.

More workers were needed to carry forward effectively the sacrifice of praise to Jehovah.

<strong>The Tenth Plague—Firstborn Slain</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[15]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Any Israelite household in ancient Egypt that failed to obey instructions for holding the passover supper suffered the death of its firstborn. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965483/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ex. 11:7 to 12:30</a>) So today, all who profess to be members of spiritual Israel, Jehovah’s spiritual anointed people, devoted to him, will likewise be considered as dead in his sight unless they exercise faith in “Christ our passover” and render obedience and live truly devoted lives toward Jehovah God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965483/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Cor. 5:7</a>) Any such dead “firstborn” from among spiritual Israel would be those who after having dedicated themselves to Jehovah God have become ‘drowned in the sea of commercialism,’ as well as those <span id="page403" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="403" data-before-text="403"></span>who for selfish reasons have severed themselves from Jehovah’s people. They too have been exposed in the Watch Tower Society’s publications as not being faithful in their dedication and devotion to Jehovah, as in the <em>Watchtower</em> article entitled “The Traitorous Evil Slave and His Prototypes.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965483/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 24:48-51</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="qu"> 7, 8. What other parallels are to be seen in the prophetic drama of the ten plagues on Egypt?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[16]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Today Jehovah’s dedicated people have the great privilege of sharing in sending the antitypical ten plagues upon modern Egypt and will continue to do so until religious Babylon the Great suffers destruction and the battle of Armageddon strikes. And just as those plagues back there in ancient Egypt magnified Jehovah God, so they do today. Back in ancient Egypt, Moses and Aaron had to appear before Pharaoh time and again, twelve times in all as far as the plagues were concerned, yet not knowing from one plague to the next how many more times they would need to do so. Today Jehovah’s servants must keep going over their territory time and again, not knowing the exact number of times remaining. It was not easy for Moses and Aaron to appear at the court of Pharaoh with its officials, retainers and soldiers. So today, it is not easy for Jehovah’s people to go forth to the homes of the people with these messages and to fight their legal cases in the judicial courts of the land. Back in ancient Egypt the plagues caused the name of Jehovah to be talked about in an unfriendly way by some Egyptians. So today, the plaguing messages that Jehovah’s people bring cause the majority to speak about Jehovah in an unfriendly way.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[16]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> And what has been the result of all ten of these plagues upon antitypical Egypt of today? The same as back there. On the one hand, the ten plagues have hardened the hearts of those having the spirit of the antitypical Pharaoh, Satan the Devil. On the other hand, the plagues have softened those who are of honest heart and who love righteousness. Yes, back in 1513 B.C.E. “a vast mixed company” associated itself with Jehovah’s people, leaving Egypt with them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965483/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ex. 12:38</a>) So today a “great crowd” of persons from all nations, tribes and tongues have left modern “Egypt,” as it were, and taken their stand with the spiritual Israelites, the remnant of anointed Christians still on earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965483/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Rev. 7:9-17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965483/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 11:8</a>) After the death of Egypt’s firstborn, the Israelites and the “mixed company” left Egypt. Today, therefore, from one standpoint, God’s people have left antitypical Egypt and are now on their way to the Promised Land. They must yet pass through the Red Sea experience of Armageddon, where Pharaoh’s counterpart, Satan the Devil, and his pursuit forces will be “drowned.” The antitypical firstborn ones of modern “Egypt” will all be <em>literally</em> destroyed then. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965483/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ex. 14:19–15:19</a>) But, from another point of view, in that the ten plagues are still being poured out upon modern “Egypt,” it might be said that God’s people are still in antitypical Egypt, or, as Jesus said, in the world but no part of it.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965483/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">John 17:15, 16</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="qu"> 9. How can we today heed the instructions King Hezekiah gave the priests and Levites?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[17]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Until Jehovah God’s destruction of Babylon the Great and his war at Armageddon, may there be no quitting or even slowing down on the part of Jehovah’s servants. As faithful King Hezekiah of Jerusalem told the priests and the Levites back in his day: “My sons, do not give yourselves up to rest, for you are the ones whom Jehovah has chosen to stand before him to minister to him and to continue as his ministers.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965483/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Chron. 29:11</a>) Let Jehovah’s servants keep on declaring his name and sharing in plaguing antitypical Egypt, of which religious Babylon the Great is a prominent part. At the same time let them <span id="page404" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="404" data-before-text="404"></span>not forget their peaceful, constructive, educational, lifesaving work. By making the most of their opportunities in antitypical Egypt they will share in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. They will also help increase the numbers of the “vast mixed company” in modern “Egypt” that are taking their stand for Jehovah and his kingdom. They themselves can hope to gain freedom from all oppression by antitypical Pharaoh, Satan the Devil, and his world organization after Jehovah overthrows all the enemies at the antitypical Red Sea, Armageddon. After that they hope to gain everlasting life in happiness in Jehovah’s new order of things.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Music</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The Bible gives very little information concerning the shape or construction of the more than a dozen different musical instruments that it mentions. Hence, most authorities draw heavily on what archaeologists have discovered about the instruments used by contemporary surrounding nations. However, this may not always be a reliable guide, since it appears that Israel excelled in music in comparison with her <span id="page1192" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1192" data-before-text="1192"></span>neighbors. Additionally, some have linked various instruments of Scripture to instruments used in modern times in the Middle East, which are supposed to have an ancient background. This, too, is conjectural.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The musical instruments of the Bible may be classified as follows:</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="si">String: harp, lute, zither, and others.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sv">Wind: bagpipe, flute, horn, pipe, trumpet, (possibly) nehiloth.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sv">Percussion: cymbals, sistrums, tambourine.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">(See individual articles on the above instruments for further information.)</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">There is no reason to believe that the musical instruments of Israel were crude in design, construction or sound production. The Bible notes that the harps and stringed instruments for temple use were of the choicest imported almug wood; the trumpets, in all probability, of silver. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Ki. 10:11, 12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Num. 10:2</a>) Undoubtedly, in the manufacture of the temple instruments, the most skilled craftsmen were employed.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Both the Scriptures and non-Biblical manuscripts dating from before the Common Era testify to the quality of the instruments as well as the competence of the Israelite musicians. The Dead Sea Scrolls state that a number of trumpets were assigned various complicated signals to be executed “as with one mouth.” This would require not only skilled musicians but also instruments so constructed that the pitch might be regulated in order to bring them all into tune with one another. Freedom from dissonance is indicated by the inspired account of the music at the inauguration of Solomon’s temple: “The [one hundred and twenty] trumpeters and the singers were <em>as one in causing one sound</em> to be heard.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Chron. 5:12, 13</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The Bible lists but four instruments as definitely being in the temple orchestra: trumpets, harps, stringed instruments (Hebrew, <em>neʹvel</em>) and cymbals. While this may not seem to be a complete orchestra by modern standards, it was never intended to be a symphony orchestra, but only to provide accompaniment for the singing at the temple. Such a combination of instruments would serve this purpose excellently.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Chron. 29:25, 26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Neh. 12:27,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/17/2" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 41, 42</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">As to the times when the sacred instruments performed, the Scriptures enumerate the following in connection with the trumpets: “In the day of your rejoicing and in your festal seasons and at the commencements of your months, you must blow on the trumpets over your burnt offerings and your communion sacrifices.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Num. 10:10</a>) After the temple music organization was established, it is likely that the rest of the instruments joined the trumpets on these and other special occasions. This conclusion, as well as the musical procedure followed, seems to be indicated by the order of events described as taking place when sacred services were revived by King Hezekiah after he had cleansed the temple: “At the time that the burnt offering started, the song of Jehovah started and also the trumpets, even under the direction of the instruments of David the king of Israel. And all the congregation were bowing down while the song was resounding and the trumpets were blaring—all this until the burnt offering was finished.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Chron. 29:27, 28</a>) The trumpets being “under the direction of the instruments of David” seems to denote that the trumpeters played in such a manner as to complement the other instruments rather than to overshadow them. The position of the entire body of musicians was “to the east of the altar.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Chron. 5:12</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="ss"><strong>VOCAL MUSIC</strong></p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">The singers at the temple were Levite males. Nowhere do the Scriptures speak of female vocalists at the temple. One of the Targums, too, clearly indicates that they were not present in the chorus. The fact that women were prohibited from even entering certain areas of the temple would seem to preclude their occupying any official position there.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">2 Chron. 5:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Neh. 10:39;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/21/2" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> 12:27-29</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Considerable importance was attached to the singing at the temple. This is evident from the many Scriptural references to the singers as well as from the fact that they were “set free from duty” common to other Levites in order to devote themselves wholly to their service.

Certainly the inspiration for the music of Israel was far loftier than that of neighboring nations. Of interest is an Assyrian bas-relief wherein King Sennacherib is represented as demanding that King Hezekiah pay him as tribute both male and female musicians.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">It has long been held by some that Hebrew music was all melody, without harmony. However, the prominence alone of the harp and other stringed instruments in Israel weighs heavily against this assumption. It is almost inconceivable that a musician would play a multistringed instrument and fail to notice that a combination of certain tones was quite pleasing or that a specific series of notes as in an arpeggio produced a pleasant sound. An authority on the history of music, Kurt Sachs, states: “The deep-rooted prejudice that harmony and polyphony [two or more musical parts or voices combined] have been a <span id="page1193" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1193" data-before-text="1193"></span>prerogative of the medieval and modern West does not hold water.” He goes on to say that even among primitive cultures there are many examples of music running in fifths, fourths, thirds as well as in octaves, and that among these peoples, including certain pygmy tribes, there was a development of overlapping antiphony (alternate singing by two divisions of vocalists) into regular canon singing.</p>

<strong>Rejoicing in the God of True Worship</strong><br/><p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> How different the condition today of the faithful spiritual Levites, the anointed remnant of real Christians! The Greater-than-Hezekiah, Christ Jesus, has concluded “a covenant with Jehovah the God of Israel” on their behalf. He has renewed toward them the “new covenant,” with its provision for forgiveness of error, and has reactivated them for true worship. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Luke 22:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Jer. 31:31-34</a>) They are filled with the same spirit and resolve that Hezekiah stirred up in the priestly Levites: “Now, my sons, do not <span id="page146" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="146" data-before-text="146"></span>give yourselves up to rest, for you are the ones whom Jehovah has chosen to stand before him to minister to him and to continue as his ministers.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">2 Chron. 29:10, 11</a>.</p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">24.

How has the antitypical house of Jehovah been cleansed, and its utensils restored?</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"><sup>25</sup></span> However, these praisers of the true God must free themselves completely from pagan doctrine and practice. For example, during the years from 1919 onward, sanctimonious dress, the viewing of the great pyramid of Egypt as “the Bible in Stone,” the observance of pagan feasts such as the so-called “Christmas,” the use of pagan symbols such as the cross, and other religious uncleanness, persisted for a time. Such must be gotten rid of! “Utensils” appropriate to Jehovah’s worship must be brought into service. As God’s will was revealed progressively to them, the anointed remnant were happy to purify their temple worship, so that they could report back to their King in the same way that the priests and Levites reported back to Hezekiah: “We have cleansed the whole house of Jehovah, the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils . . . And all the utensils that King Ahaz removed from employment during his reign in his unfaithfulness we have prepared, and have sanctified them; and there they are before the altar of Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">2 Chron. 29:18, 19</a>) The same pattern of true worship that Jesus had established in the first century was restored among true Christians on earth.</p><p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="qu">26.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Rev. 20:6</a>) Then the priests proceeded to offer sacrifices on behalf of all, “because it was for all Israel that the king said the burnt offering and the sin offering should be.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">2 Chron. 29:24</a>) In the fulfillment, all the remaining ones of the spiritual Judeans—the 144,000—must now be brought forth and sanctified as the true people for Jehovah’s name. This was in fulfillment, too, of another of the psalms: “Gather to me my loyal ones, those concluding my covenant over sacrifice.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ps. 50:5</a>) As in Hezekiah’s day, all of these gathered according to Jehovah’s new-covenant arrangement, based on Jesus’ perfect sacrifice, “began to offer praise even with rejoicing.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">2 Chron. 29:30</a>.</p><p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="qu">27, 28.

More workers were needed to carry forward effectively the sacrifice of praise to Jehovah. Thus, there has been a noteworthy fulfillment of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 29:34</a>: “Only the priests themselves happened to be too few . . .

<strong>Dedication to God and Consecration</strong><br/><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> Since it is the Lord God that empowers or consecrates a person for his special service, what shall we do with such a text as that at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Exodus 32:29</a>? It reads: “Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, even every man upon his son, <span id="page311" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="311" data-before-text="311"></span>and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.” Note, please, that this was said to the sons of Levi or Levites <em>after</em> all Israel had been brought into the law covenant at Mount Sinai and after Jehovah God had designated the Levite Aaron and his sons to be consecrated to the priesthood. The rest of the tribe of Levi were therefore to be the temple servants of those Aaronic priests. So when Moses called out, ‘Who is on Jehovah’s side?’ and the sons of Levi took their stand alongside Moses, then Moses told them to use the swords in their hands and give an expression of their being consecrated to Jehovah God by slaughtering the apostate Israelites who had turned to the worship of the golden calf. Hence Moffatt renders <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Exodus 32:29</a>: “Then said Moses, ‘Be installed as priests to the Eternal this day, for every man’s hand has been against his own son and his own kinsman—that the Eternal may bestow the blessing of the priesthood on you this day.’” Months later, during the first week of the following year, the Aaronic priesthood was consecrated and installed.</p><p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu">23.

Here King David asked: “Who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the LORD?” Or: “Who then offereth willingly to consecrate himself this day unto Jehovah?” (<em>AS</em>) Or: “Who now is willing to consecrate his hand this day unto the LORD?” (<em>Le</em>) This was said, not to uncircumcised heathen, but to an assembly of Israelites who were already God’s chosen people under his law covenant through Moses. They were then faced with making contributions toward the building of a gorgeous temple to their God at Jerusalem. So here was merely a call to circumcised people of God to fill their hand with a contribution for his cause and to offer it in expression of devotion to him.</p><p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="qu">24. Also, how about a <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 29:31</a>? And so, to what conclusion do we come from our examination?</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[68]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> Centuries later that temple built by Solomon became defiled with a lot of rubbish and King Hezekiah had the Aaronic priests and Levites cleanse that sacred building and sanctify it. Then the people gathered there to offer the proper sacrifices and praises to God in his purified temple. “Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now [that] ye have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">2 Chron. 29:31</a>) So this consecrating of themselves was not done by uncircumcised foreigners who were not in the law covenant. It was the putting of Jewish hands to the work of keeping Jehovah’s house clean and of renewing the sacrifices and worship there according to their covenant obligations. In Ezekiel’s vision of the restored temple we read: “Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Ezek. 43:26</a>) But modern translation reads: “Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it; so shall they consecrate it.” (<em>AS; Le; Mo; AT; Ro</em>) From all this examination we see that consecration is not Scripturally applied to a person’s taking his first step to become God’s servant, giving himself to God through Christ.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="ss"><strong>NOT A “COVENANT BY SACRIFICE”</strong></p><p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="qu">25.

Concerning this we read: “Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.” Or, to quote the <em>New World Translation:</em> “Consequently neither was the former covenant inaugurated without blood.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Heb. 9:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/38/1" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> Ex. 24:1-8</a>) According to this covenant inaugurated at Sinai certain consecrations took place, God himself consecrating or installing his priesthood. There was no individual covenant with God by which a person consecrated himself, but the covenant was made with the entire nation of Israel through an individual mediator, Moses. It was God’s covenant, proposed and offered by him, and he speaks of it as “the covenant which I made with their forefathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt”. So he speaks of the entire nation as being his wife and he their husband by virtue of this law covenant.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Heb. 8:8, 9</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Jer. 31:32</a>.</p>

<strong>Rejoicing in the God of True Worship</strong><br/><p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> How different the condition today of the faithful spiritual Levites, the anointed remnant of real Christians! The Greater-than-Hezekiah, Christ Jesus, has concluded “a covenant with Jehovah the God of Israel” on their behalf. He has renewed toward them the “new covenant,” with its provision for forgiveness of error, and has reactivated them for true worship. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Luke 22:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Jer. 31:31-34</a>) They are filled with the same spirit and resolve that Hezekiah stirred up in the priestly Levites: “Now, my sons, do not <span id="page146" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="146" data-before-text="146"></span>give yourselves up to rest, for you are the ones whom Jehovah has chosen to stand before him to minister to him and to continue as his ministers.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">2 Chron. 29:10, 11</a>.</p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">24. What open door has been set before the remnant?</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> Even as the doors of Jerusalem’s temple were opened and repaired, so now Christ offered the anointed remnant an open door of service, “which no one can shut.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Rev. 3:8</a>) Refreshed by Christian assemblies, notably those at Cedar Point, Ohio, U.S.A., in 1919, and again in 1922, they went forth witnessing boldly in answer to the call: “Advertise, advertise, advertise, the King and his kingdom.”</p><p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu">25. How has the antitypical house of Jehovah been cleansed, and its utensils restored?</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"><sup>25</sup></span> However, these praisers of the true God must free themselves completely from pagan doctrine and practice. For example, during the years from 1919 onward, sanctimonious dress, the viewing of the great pyramid of Egypt as “the Bible in Stone,” the observance of pagan feasts such as the so-called “Christmas,” the use of pagan symbols such as the cross, and other religious uncleanness, persisted for a time. Such must be gotten rid of! “Utensils” appropriate to Jehovah’s worship must be brought into service. As God’s will was revealed progressively to them, the anointed remnant were happy to purify their temple worship, so that they could report back to their King in the same way that the priests and Levites reported back to Hezekiah: “We have cleansed the whole house of Jehovah, the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils . . . And all the utensils that King Ahaz removed from employment during his reign in his unfaithfulness we have prepared, and have sanctified them; and there they are before the altar of Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">2 Chron. 29:18, 19</a>) The same pattern of true worship that Jesus had established in the first century was restored among true Christians on earth.</p><p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="qu">26. What is pictured by Hezekiah’s getting up early and gathering the princes to worship?</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"><sup>26</sup></span> “And Hezekiah the king proceeded to get up early and gather the princes of the city together and go up to the house of Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">2 Chron. 29:20</a>) True to type, it was early in the post-World War I era that the King, Jesus Christ, gathered the remaining members on earth of Jehovah’s royal house—those who are to ‘rule as priests and kings with him for the thousand years’ of his Kingdom reign over earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Rev. 20:6</a>) Then the priests proceeded to offer sacrifices on behalf of all, “because it was for all Israel that the king said the burnt offering and the sin offering should be.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">2 Chron. 29:24</a>) In the fulfillment, all the remaining ones of the spiritual Judeans—the 144,000—must now be brought forth and sanctified as the true people for Jehovah’s name. This was in fulfillment, too, of another of the psalms: “Gather to me my loyal ones, those concluding my covenant over sacrifice.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ps. 50:5</a>) As in Hezekiah’s day, all of these gathered according to Jehovah’s new-covenant arrangement, based on Jesus’ perfect sacrifice, “began to offer praise even with rejoicing.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">2 Chron. 29:30</a>.</p><p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="qu">27, 28. (a) How was the gathering completed, and at what may God’s people now rejoice? (b) But what question remains to be answered?</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"><sup>27</sup></span> The gathering was not completed in 1919, or even in 1922. More workers were needed to carry forward effectively the sacrifice of praise to Jehovah. Thus, there has been a noteworthy fulfillment of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968163/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 29:34</a>: “Only the priests themselves happened to be too few . . . So their brothers the Levites helped them out until the work was finished and until the priests could sanctify themselves, for the Levites were more upright of heart for sanctifying themselves than the priests.” <span id="page147" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="147" data-before-text="147"></span>As in the pattern, the remaining members of the anointed remnant of Christ’s followers were gathered in, particularly until 1931-1935, and many of these showed themselves even more zealous for Jehovah’s requirements and service than others who had been gathered earlier.</p>

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page86" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="86" data-before-text="86"></span><strong>Applying the General Priesthood Principle</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">JEHOVAH God, in dealing with the nation of Israel, provided for a priesthood. This priesthood had two functions. One of these was the offering of the various sacrifices on behalf of themselves and the people. The other was the instructing of the people in God’s law, even as we read: “The lips of a priest are the ones that should keep knowledge, and the law is what people should seek from his mouth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964085/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Lev. 7:37;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964085/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 16:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964085/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964085/0/3" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> Mal. 2:7</a>.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1964085/0">a</a></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This priesthood of the nation of Israel was a special one, not a general priesthood. That is, not all Israelites were priests. Priests were limited to unblemished males of a certain age that were the descendants of Aaron, their first high priest. Only when there were insufficient priests or the priests failed to appreciate their privileges, as in the days of King Hezekiah, did the Levites help in offering sacrifices.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964085/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Chron. 29:34</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The priesthood of spiritual Israel, however, Jehovah God purposed to be a general one. All footstep followers of Christ Jesus, who upon dedication and baptism were begotten by God’s spirit and called to the heavenly calling, became members of true Christianity’s general priesthood. All such have access to the “holy place,” and serve as sacrificing priests under their High Priest Jesus Christ.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964085/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb. 10:19-22</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">What took place on the very day of Pentecost shows that the priesthood of spiritual Israel is a general one. On that day the holy spirit came upon all the followers of Christ assembled in an upper room in Jerusalem in fulfillment of Joel’s prophecy in which God says: “I shall pour out some of my spirit upon every sort of flesh, and your sons and your daughters will prophesy . . . and even upon my men slaves and upon my women slaves I will pour out some of my spirit.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964085/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 2:17, 18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964085/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Joel 2:28, 29</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">That all anointed followers of Christ are priests is also made clear by the apostle Peter: “You yourselves also as living stones are being built up a spiritual house for the purpose of a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. . . . you are ‘a chosen race, a royal priesthood, . . . that you should declare abroad the excellencies’” of Jehovah God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964085/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964085/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 9</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">With the foretold falling away from the true faith the churches of Christendom discarded the principle of the general priesthood. With but few notable, well-meant, but at best only temporary exceptions, these have adopted a special priesthood. After many years of special priesthoods, today there is a movement afoot in Christendom to apply the principle of the general priesthood and have the laity preach and serve, chiefly because of a shortage of priests and ministers, but it is not meeting with success. Why not?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Because of two basic reasons. On the one hand, while speaking of a general priesthood, their leaders mean it only in a very limited sense. They do not at all intend to wipe out all distinction between the clergy and the laity. And on the other hand, there is little enthusiasm and zeal on the part of the laity to share actively in the ministry even to the extent of their opportunities.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Today, however, the principle of the general priesthood does find application among the Christian witnesses of Jehovah. Among them there is no class set apart for sacrificing and teaching even though only a few of them belong to the priestly “remnant” and the great majority belong to the non-priestly “other sheep.” All share in making “disciples of people of all the nations.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964085/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964085/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Heb. 13:15</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Among the witnesses of Jehovah any adult, dedicated and baptized male Christian who is qualified may serve in such ministerial capacities as giving public Bible discourses and funeral talks, performing marriages and presiding at the Lord’s evening meal or supper. There is no clergy class. Overseers and their ministerial assistants are merely servants of their fellow Christians. They are not specially ordained and therefore they are such special servants only so long as they have an appointment so to serve.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964085/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Eph. 4:11-16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964085/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 3:1-7</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">All those upon whom God’s spirit came at Pentecost preached. Since God does not change, it is reasonable to expect the same today. Since among the witnesses of Jehovah all are preachers, we must conclude that God’s holy spirit is also upon them. To help them to become ever more effective ministers, five weekly meetings are conducted by each congregation. Do you take full advantage of these? You will if you would have the principle of the general priesthood apply to you.</p>
