<strong>The Voice of Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[28]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> These religionists of modern days may <span id="page750" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="750" data-before-text="750"></span>do what they will with God’s name, Jehovah, but the Great Ruler will see to it that his people proclaim his name and make it known. “The voice of Jehovah” will do this. Nothing, not even Christendom’s religionists, will stop Almighty God from making his name known throughout all the earth, for he himself says: “I will deliver my people out of your hand; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezek. 13:23</a>, <em>AS</em>) Jehovah knows that the clergy of Christendom are serving this old system of things, which he himself is going to destroy at the battle of Armageddon. They are certainly not serving him. That is why Jehovah’s Word says to those that love him: “Get out of her, my people.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rev. 18:4</a>, <em>NW</em>) The time has come for all persons to make a decision as to whose side they are going to be on, Jehovah’s, or that of those who are against Jehovah.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="qu"> 4, 5. What “sons” does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Psalm 29:1</a> mention, and who could they be? Why?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Let us listen to what Jehovah himself has to say through his writer, David, when he wrote the 29th <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 29</a>. The opening verses of this very descriptive psalm say: “Ascribe unto Jehovah, O ye sons of the mighty, ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength. Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name; worship Jehovah in holy array.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 29:1, 2</a>, <em>AS</em>) From this description it appears a time has arrived for celebration, a time for a joyous occasion.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> In considering these two <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps 29 verses 1, 2</a> we might wonder, Just who are these “sons of the mighty”? It could be those who hold very high positions in the theocratic organization of Jehovah God, maybe the powerful servants that Jehovah has appointed to special work. On the other hand, it could mean “sons of God”, as is pointed out in the footnote of the <em>American Standard Version.</em> If that be so, then “sons of God” could take in all the angels of the heavens that are invisible to man but form Jehovah’s universal organization. In the book of Job it is stated: “Now it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan also came among them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 1:6</a>, <em>AS</em>) On festive occasions such as this what singing and praise must have been given to the name of the Most High God, Jehovah! It must have been a beautiful, majestic spectacle to behold! Even the rebellious Satan came to look in on this magnificent assembly and to hear the songs the faithful servants must have been singing. On this particular occasion, Jehovah said to Satan, “Whence comest thou?” or “Where did you come from?” to which Satan answered, saying he had been going to and fro in the earth and walking up and down in it. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 1:7</a>) What was on the earth was the Devil’s world. He had corrupted it. He had not come to this assembly before the mighty ones of Jehovah to praise the Sovereign Ruler. He was just an observer of the splendor and majesty that surround the Creator of heaven and earth.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu"> 6. How does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Psalm 89:5-7</a> show Jehovah’s superiority?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> The psalmist expressed beautifully Jehovah’s superiority over these powerful ones, saying in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 89:5-7</a> (<em>AS</em>): “And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O Jehovah; thy faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones. For who in the skies can be compared unto Jehovah? Who among the sons of the mighty is like unto Jehovah, a God very terrible in the council of the holy ones, and to be feared above all them that are round about him?”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>“SONS OF THE GODS”</strong></p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 7.

Men of all nations have arranged themselves under the imaginary protection of deified heroes. Of course, to help their imaginations, they have made great idols of silver and stone and gold and wood. In this way the peoples of the world have invented and made their own gods. These they have worshiped for centuries; but what has this worship gotten them? The many religions in the world have often been the cause of wars, strifes, hatreds between peoples and nations, class distinction, isolationism. Jesus said to false religionists “You are from your father the Devil.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">John 8:44</a>, <em>NW</em>) The sons of the gods they worship are still carrying on the false religion which began in early mythology, and their doctrines, ideas and philosophies of life have been carried right down to our day. The Sovereign Ruler Jehovah calls on all these sons of the many gods now to ascribe to Jehovah the glory that is due, to ascribe strength to him. Nimrod of centuries past placed himself above God. He wanted to be a mighty one ahead of Jehovah. Where are his strength and glory today? Let the followers of Nimrod and the followers of the many pagan gods, practices and beliefs all forsake their gods and their false religion if they want to live, and give glory to Jehovah, not to some man or image. But the religionists with their many gods will not recognize Jehovah; rather, “modernists” try to hide him.</p>

How have the <em>RS</em> translators rendered <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Psalm 29:2</a> vaguely, and upon whom does this verse call and to do what?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Today we have throughout the world many kinds of religions with their many different gods. Even Christendom wants to have many gods and lords, and she wants the sons of these many gods to be satisfied with the latest product of the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the United States of America, their new Revised Standard Version Bible. So they remove the name Jehovah and make it “the LORD”. But their new version or their revision of their old version makes the translators look vague when we read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 29:2</a> (<em>RS</em>): “Ascribe to <em>the LORD</em> the glory of his name.” Hence we ask the Committee, What is his name? Is it <em>the LORD?</em> No! At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 83:18</a>, according to the book entitled “Studies in The Psalms”, by J. B. Rotherham, a very accurate translation is: “That men may know that thou, whose name is Jehovah, thou alone art most high over all the earth.” While Christendom goes on its wayward course, the faithful followers of the Almighty will hearken to the voice of Jehovah, and they will make his message and his name known to the nations. If we allow as possible this third rendering of the text inviting the “sons of the gods” to praise Jehovah, it means that all creation should tremble before him, not only the creatures of the invisible heavens, but all humankind. The writer of the 96th Psalm expresses this thought in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps 96 verses 7 to 9</a>, where it is stated: “Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts. Oh worship Jehovah in holy array: tremble before him, all the earth.” (<em>AS</em>) Here the appeal is to all earthlings to worship Jehovah, and the expression is very similar to that at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 29:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 9. Who are listening to the praisers of God’s name, and how is their turning and worshiping him foretold?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> While the majority of the peoples of the nations of earth turn a deaf ear to this call, there are many of the other sheep who are listening to the group of praisers in the earth who love to call their God by his name Jehovah, and these sheep are coming to them and joining them in this <span id="page752" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="752" data-before-text="752"></span>song of praise. If Jesus said he had “other sheep”, which he must also bring to associate with the “little flock” who are being called out as joint heirs with him in heavenly glory, then these he must bring and make one flock, and Christ Jesus will be their “one shepherd”. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">John 10:16</a>) Those whose hearts are right will find Jehovah and know him because of Jesus the Shepherd, and they will be guided to Jehovah’s organization, just as the psalmist pointed out in the 22d <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 22, verses 26 and 27</a>: “The meek shall eat and be satisfied; they shall praise Jehovah that seek after him: let your heart live for ever. All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto Jehovah; and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.” (<em>AS</em>) This is in full accord with the expression in Revelation where the thought is brought out that a great crowd shall come from all nations, kindreds and tongues. They will worship before Jehovah, because they know that glory is due to his name. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Rev. 7:9</a>, <em>NW</em>) Jesus their Shepherd acknowledged that there is one living and true God; not many gods, not many lords. And this unique God, the Sovereign Ruler of the universe, has been distinguished from all the false gods by having a name which is worthy of praise on the part of all creatures in heaven and on earth.</p>

It is hard to comprehend the magnificent spectacle that takes place in the heavens and upon the earth when this Psalm comes into complete fulfillment. When Jehovah God had called out the children of Israel as a special people, he had his priests array themselves in holy garments. Aaron’s garments are described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Exodus chapter 28</a> and they were most beautiful. His garments distinguished him from all the other priests. When he appeared before Jehovah God he was on certain occasions in his robes of glory and beauty. In days gone by when Jehovah’s people were marching through the wilderness, he had them array themselves in proper positions. All this was done according to his direction. It was organization. Each tribe was happy to take its right position. It was not that one tribe was trying to be the first in position. It was that God had placed them by his own direction. Jehovah was their God and he guided them. He led them through the wilderness and eventually into the Promised Land. They should have worshiped him in holy array. So when they went to the worship <span id="page753" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="753" data-before-text="753"></span>of other gods, then Jehovah showed his displeasure.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Time and time again the children of Israel went to the worship of false gods, even after Jehovah had provided them with food, with clothing that did not wear out, with shoes that did not get full of holes from walking. Even though they were well acquainted with God’s deliverance of them from Egypt and his power demonstrated in the destruction of Pharaoh and the Egyptians who followed after him, still they forsook Jehovah and went to the worshiping of other gods. These gods were not able to do anything for the Israelites, no more than they were able to do anything for the nations that worshiped them. The prophet Jeremiah put it very forcefully and plainly when he said in his <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Jer second chapter, verses 26-28</a> (<em>AS</em>): “As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets; who say to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face; but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us. But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? Let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.”</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu">13.

Where are the powers of the gods of the nations? Where do they bring blessings to the people? The nations of the earth have marched forth with their armies, they have fought their murderous battles, they have taken possession of new countries, their priests and clergymen have blessed them in their actions, but where is the blessing? The priests that blessed the losing nations have become captives with the losers. The religious leaders who have blessed the victorious nations have not brought peace and prosperity to the winners. Why do not the peoples of the world turn from these religious leaders? Some few do, but the majority of the peoples of this earth are following their blind religious guides and when the guides fall into the pit so will the peoples of the nations. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matt. 15:14</a>, <em>NW</em>) The falling into the pit of all such peoples of the wicked governments along with their rulers is not far distant. The battle of Armageddon is not too far away, when Jehovah God in holy array will strike against all these nations and destroy them utterly.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">14.

Jehovah God, through his kindness and mercy, has spoken through his Word and through his people for centuries. Today he has massed together hundreds of thousands of his witnesses for making proclamation of his name to the ends of the earth. They listen to his voice through his Word. But in a short while the voice of Jehovah will speak in an altogether different manner. He will speak from the heavens in thunderous tones.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>LIKE THUNDER</strong></p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">15. To what did Jehovah’s voice get likened, and what example of this did Israel have at Sinai?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> The 29th <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Psalm 29</a> shows that the thunder of the heavens is like the voice of God. The terrible phenomena of the storm in the heavens are an expression of God’s majesty, his eternalness, his sovereignty and his unshakableness. When Jehovah speaks <span id="page754" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="754" data-before-text="754"></span>with his voice of authority from heaven, then all the nations of earth will tremble and shake and pass out of existence. Now the time has come for those of sheeplike disposition to heed the voice of God as spoken in his Word before his voice will speak from the heavens at Armageddon. Jehovah’s expressions are powerful. When he gave the Ten Commandments to Moses at Mount Sinai, it presented an awesome spectacle. He had just effected a great deliverance of his people. Probably over two million of them, men, women and children, had been brought out of Egypt now into the wilderness. He was going to lead them on to the Promised Land. They were his chosen ones; they were his theocratic organization. And he showed them his power from the heavens. “And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of a trumpet exceeding loud; and all the people that were in the camp trembled.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ex. 19:16</a>, <em>AS</em>) And then, in the 18th <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ex 19 verse 18</a>, we read: “And Mount Sinai, the whole of it, smoked, because Jehovah descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.”—See also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952923/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Exodus 20:18</a>.</p>

This faith, though, comes only by a careful study of God’s Word. That is why it is so important for God’s servants in the earth, his slaves, to continually go to Bible <span id="page758" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="758" data-before-text="758"></span>studies and meet with their brothers. They must have faith as Abraham had faith. They must appreciate that God’s power can operate on us through his holy Word and make us better servants. One must appreciate that when he comes into the truth he is just a novice. One can grow up. He does not have to be a baby all his life. One can gain more knowledge and understanding of Jehovah’s Word. He can conduct Bible studies if he has the faith in Jehovah God to take a Bible study. He can comment at a <em>Watchtower</em> study if he has faith in Jehovah God that he knows something about his Word. He can come to the meetings of God’s people and there constantly take in knowledge. He can associate himself with the theocratic ministry school of Jehovah’s witnesses and take his part in the speaking program. Eventually, through faith and study and putting forth an earnest effort, one can become a public speaker for Jehovah’s organization. But it takes faith, and you know faith without any effort or works is dead. Make your faith live. Give glory to God like the grateful one, not the nine ungrateful.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 7.

That work was not for me.” But everyone who comes under God’s organization must eventually become a good minister, a good preacher. That is part of his training in carrying on true worship in holy array. Why, look at Abraham’s faith. He was an old man when God told him Sarah would bring forth the seed of promise, a son from the freewoman. Paul tells us that there was deadness in the womb of Sarah, Abraham’s wife. “But because of the promise of God he did not waver in a lack of faith, but became powerful by his faith, giving God glory and being fully convinced that what he had promised he was also able to do. Hence ‘it was counted to him as righteousness’.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952924/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rom. 4:20-22</a>, <em>NW</em>) Do you have such faith that what appears to be impossible you can do by Jehovah’s help? The help is there. Use it. Make it work for you in all the meetings you attend. Do you believe you could not be a minister? You could not proclaim the good news for Jehovah God? If so, then you lack faith and you will not be a minister. You will not even try. But if you have faith and believe in Jehovah’s power and you put forth every effort to study, and you come to the study meetings and take in knowledge and learn the truth from God’s Word so as to worship him with all his people, then you will worship Jehovah in his great organization, in holy array.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952924/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Deut. 1:41-46</a>) The faithless Israelites on one occasion were told by him not to go out and fight the enemy, but they thought better of it. No, they were going to go up into the mountains and fight those who were opposed to them. And what happened? They were defeated, they were whipped, they were scattered. Jehovah had told them not to go up into the mountain and fight those people. Jehovah said to Moses: “Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952924/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Deut. 1:42</a>, <em>AS</em>) They were very presumptuous, and they went up into the hill country against the commandment of God. They rebelled against Jehovah’s voice and hence were smitten.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">13.

Jehovah’s Word is right, it is powerful. Believe it. No one should show disrespect for what God has set forth in his Word. It is his voice. He is the most majestic one in all the universe. He is the most authoritative one. No greater knowledge or wisdom is to be found in anyone. He is the Almighty, the Most High; he should have our respect. Those who are proud and haughty will certainly be brought low in the battle of Armageddon, when his voice is heard in the storm in the heavens. The prophet Isaiah said concerning the humbling of the haughtiness of man: “For there shall be a day of Jehovah of hosts upon all that is proud and haughty, and upon all that is lifted up; and it shall be brought low: and upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952924/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Isa. 2:12, 13</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">14.

It twists and turns every way. Now, can you imagine a tremendous cedar tree bouncing and jumping around on the side of a mountain? Not one, but all the cedars of Lebanon will be brought low due to a mighty act of Jehovah God. Not only will the trees be moved, but the earth will literally shake. The voice of Jehovah says these things will happen. “The mountains skipped like rams, the little hills like lambs.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952924/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 114:4</a>, <em>AS</em>) “Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the mountains quaked and were shaken, because he was wroth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952924/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 18:7</a>, <em>AS</em>) When Jehovah shows his anger against the nations of earth they certainly will know it. It is not going to be a small thing.</p>

<strong>Why Be Baptized?</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> The decision, therefore, facing all mankind individually is, Whom will I serve, Jehovah or Satan? This world’s system, or the interests of the Kingdom? Will your decision be like Joshua’s: “As for me and my household, we shall serve Jehovah”? And Jesus’: “Look! I am come to do your will”? Involved in this decision is the command of Christ that we be baptized. It is <span id="page335" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="335" data-before-text="335"></span>an essential step if we wish to be in the special relationship with Jehovah and his Son. We cannot willingly refuse to be baptized and also have his favor. Study God’s Word diligently, which will enhance your understanding of dedication responsibilities and give you a fuller meaning of dedication and baptism. Then, unhesitatingly and obediently, take this step, if you have not already done so, and thus put yourself in line for Jehovah’s favor and life in his new world.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962403/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Josh. 24:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962403/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Heb. 10:9</a>.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">22.

Let them keep their love for him strong and also never forget their love for their neighbor. In giving the command to go forth and make disciples and baptize them in symbol of their dedication to Jehovah, Jesus said: “All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth.” We cannot wisely delay in becoming a disciple of Jesus and following his command given after he was given all authority, to be baptized and to share in the proclamation of the good news.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962403/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 28:18</a>.</p>

<strong>The 1,290 and 1,335 Days of Daniel’s Prophecy</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[26]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> This means that since 1918, which had ended the 1,260-day period, two great wonders had happened. First, the Devil had set up his makeshift kingdom which was to take the place of God’s kingdom by Christ and was striving to make all people worship it. Secondly, he was successful for a time in causing God’s holy ones to cease offering the continual sacrifice of praise <span id="page433" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="433" data-before-text="433"></span>to Jehovah God. These events so clearly fulfill the angel’s prophecy to Daniel of the 1,290 days: “Many shall purify themselves, and make themselves white, and be refined; but the wicked shall do wickedly; and none of the wicked shall understand; but they that are wise shall understand. And from the time that the continual burnt-offering shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Dan. 12:10, 11</a>, <em>AS</em>) “From the time of the taking away of the continual ascending-sacrifice, and the placing of the horrid abomination that astoundeth shall be one thousand two hundred and ninety days.” (<em>Ro</em>) “And from the time of the removal of the perpetual sacrifice, when the abomination of desolation shall be set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.” (<em>LXX</em>) “Twelve hundred and ninety days shall pass, after the daily offering has been stopped and the appalling abomination has been set up.” (<em>Mo</em>) This sacrifice need not be a literal everyday offering, but rather continual. The Hebrew word “taw-meed” is the same thought as in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isaiah 21:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Isaiah 62:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Psalm 34:1 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/9/3" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> Psalm 71:6</a>. It pertains to the continual, faithful service of Jehovah’s people.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[26]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> These two things are in evidence together, namely, (1) placing of the horrid abomination that astounds, and (2) the taking away of the continual sacrifice. There is no Scriptural reason for concluding that the 1,290 days should run at the same time as the 1,260 days. The 1,290 days are therefore reckoned from the date of the setting up of the abomination, which was in the latter part of January, 1919. This period of 3 years and 7 months ends at September, 1922—the very time of the Cedar Point Convention mentioned above. Let it be kept in mind that this convention was not arranged for this date with a view to fulfilling any prophecy, for at that time it was not known that these dates were important. The “continual sacrifice” had been restored by 1922. The Isaiah class had been cleansed of lip and now they are wholly devoted to singing praises to Jehovah. “And in his temple everything saith, Glory.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 29:9</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="qu"> 6. What facts point to the accomplishment of the 1,290-day period in September, 1922?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[27]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> At the end of this 1,290-day period the whole world was to come to know that the League of Nations was not approved of God and would come to nought. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa. 8:9, 10</a>) Its doom was to be pronounced. Any build-up of the same system would be likewise doomed to failure. Three years and seven months passed from the time the abomination was set up until it was publicly pronounced as condemned, there at the Cedar Point Convention of September, 1922. There, too, another situation ceased, from the time the continual sacrifice of praise to Jehovah was interfered with and taken away until it was restored, and the sacrifice of praise was again being offered in God’s temple, and the obnoxious abomination exposed as a subterfuge, standing in the place where it never should be. So ended the 1,290 days.—See <em>The Watchtower,</em> Nov. 1, 1922.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>1,335 DAYS</strong></p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="qu"> 7. Is it reasonable to think that these three time periods mentioned in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Daniel 12</a> cover many centuries of time? Why do you so answer?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[28]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Daniel 12:12</a> (<em>AS</em>) announces: “Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.” From 1922 there was a forward movement, new truths were opening to the view of the faithful. No halting now, for, with the vision of the Lord at the temple, the work of advertising the King and his kingdom was on. There are those who may think it strange that these 2,500-year-old prophecies are now receiving fulfillment in a few short years. But we must realize that they must come to pass sometime, and <span id="page434" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="434" data-before-text="434"></span>why not now? Some may prefer to think of these 1,260, 1,290 and 1,335 “days” of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Daniel 12:7-12</a> as covering many centuries of time, just as though that would add to their importance. But is that reasonable? Why not question yourself: Why were these wonders given? It was certainly not just to record or set forth historical facts, so that Bible students could point with confidence to God’s Word as being true. Rather, these visions are for the comfort, edification and guidance of God’s people in these “last days”, so they would really know the sign of the times and when their deliverance from Babylonish captivity would come. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Rom. 15:4</a>, <em>NW</em>) How possibly could these wonders guide us today if we merely knew that certain prophecies had been fulfilled during the Middle Ages? It is true certain prophecies received a partial or miniature fulfillment at the first advent of Christ Jesus, and this was to identify God’s Son and to fulfill God’s purposes concerning him, so giving the church confidence and complete assurance in him as the Messiah.</p>

When he opened the heavens and the waters poured down on the earth, when the flood came in from all sides, Jehovah was in absolute control, destroying the enemy, bringing to nought all those false gods and their sons, the worshipers of the gods; and there, riding upon the waters, was Noah, his family and all that God desired to have preserved through the flood.

This storm will be so fierce that even the trees will be stripped of their branches and leaves, even their bark. And while all this storm is going on, this display of Jehovah’s anger against the nations, this display of his power, this voice of Jehovah speaking to the nations in the battle of Armageddon, he says: “And in his temple everything saith, Glory.” Yes, all who understand God and who have come to know him through his Son will say, “Glory,” for the glory belongs to Jehovah.

This same God, Jehovah, brought up his faithful prophet <span id="page46" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="46" data-before-text="46"></span>Jesus Christ out of the “heart of the earth” on the third day. Hence the deliverance of Jonah was a prophetic picture of the resurrection of the Son of God from the dead. After his resurrection the “keys of death and of Haʹdes” were given to Jesus Christ, that he might be God’s Agent in raising all the others who are in Haʹdes or Sheol and in the condition of death. No man can, by his own means and arrangements, escape death and Sheol or Haʹdes, the grave that is common to dead mankind in the dust of the earth.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">10.

Is it all in vain that you have created all the sons of men? What able-bodied man is there alive who will not see death? Can he provide escape for his soul from the hand of Sheol?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 89:47, 48</a>) For this reason those dedicated Christians today who will survive the coming battle of Armageddon and enter into a righteous new order on earth with the opportunity of never dying will survive only by means of God’s miraculous power of protection and preservation. Likewise, those who die and are buried in Sheol or Haʹdes cannot come up out of that place of death and decay by their own power. The deathly diseased prophet Job spoke of this inability of man when he mournfully said: “The eye of him that sees me will not behold me; your eyes will be upon me, but I shall not be. The cloud certainly comes to its end and goes away; so he that is going down to Sheol will not come up.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 7:8, 9</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">11.

For he sees that even the wise ones die, together the stupid one and the unreasoning one perish, and they must leave to others their means of maintenance.” Unlike a materialistic rich man, the inspired psalmist trusts in Almighty God Jehovah and says: “However, God himself will redeem my soul from the hand of Sheol, for he will receive me.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 49:15</a>.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">12.

O Jehovah, you have brought up my soul from Sheol itself; you have kept me alive, that I should not go down into the pit.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 30:2, 3</a>) Not only can this God of David keep a person from going down into death and the grave prematurely but he can also bring up the dead from Sheol or Haʹdes by means of a resurrection, just as he did in the case of his own Son Jesus Christ. The mother of the prophet Samuel voiced that same fact when she said: “Jehovah is a Killer and a Preserver of life, a Bringer down to Sheol, and He brings up.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Sam. 2:6</a>) Mary, the mother of Jesus, spoke in praise to Jehovah with a similar thought in mind.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Luke 1:46-55</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>DEAD OR CONSCIOUSLY ALIVE—WHICH?</strong></p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">13.

That is why numbers of Bible translators render these two words into English as “the grave” (not, a grave). The <em>Authorized Version</em> or King James Bible Version renders the Hebrew word Sheol as “the grave” thirty-one times and as “the pit” three times, and the Greek word Haʹdes as “grave” once (in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:55</a>). But for centuries the religious clergy of Christendom have taught that Haʹdes is a place of fiery torment. So now our question is, What is the condition of people who are dead in Sheol or Haʹdes? Are they consciously alive as immortals, or are they really dead and out of existence? What does God’s own Word, the Holy Bible, not the clergy of Christendom, say in answer to this question?</p>

The mother of the prophet Samuel voiced that same fact when she said: “Jehovah is a Killer and a Preserver of life, a Bringer down to Sheol, and He brings up.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Sam. 2:6</a>) Mary, the mother of Jesus, spoke in praise to Jehovah with a similar thought in mind.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Luke 1:46-55</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>DEAD OR CONSCIOUSLY ALIVE—WHICH?</strong></p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">13.

That is why numbers of Bible translators render these two words into English as “the grave” (not, a grave). The <em>Authorized Version</em> or King James Bible Version renders the Hebrew word Sheol as “the grave” thirty-one times and as “the pit” three times, and the Greek word Haʹdes as “grave” once (in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:55</a>). But for centuries the religious clergy of Christendom have taught that Haʹdes is a place of fiery torment. So now our question is, What is the condition of people who are dead in Sheol or Haʹdes? Are they consciously alive as immortals, or are they really dead and out of existence? What does God’s own Word, the Holy Bible, not the clergy of Christendom, say in answer to this question?</p>

<strong>Fear of God’s Anger is Wisdom</strong><br/><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">That love, rather than anger, is God’s predominant quality is also to be seen by this: The expression of his anger is of short duration as compared to the duration of his loving-kindness and goodwill. So we read of the <em>day</em> of his vengeance but of the <em>year</em> of his goodwill. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971441/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Isa. 61:1, 2</a>) Likewise the psalmist, King David, who on three occasions had been the object of God’s anger as well as receiving truly unique expressions of God’s favor, mercy and loving-kindness, said: “Being under his [God’s] anger is for a moment, being under his good will is for a lifetime.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971441/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ps. 30:5</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">King David had the right understanding of God’s anger.

But David also appreciated that to fear God’s anger was truly the course of wisdom, even as his further words show:</p>

But now that we have taken advantage of his “year of goodwill,” that past experience seems as having been for a moment, as a dismal, darkening evening that is past. It calls to mind the expression of the psalmist David after he had been recovered from the divine displeasure: “Because being under his anger is for a moment, being under his goodwill is for a lifetime. In the evening weeping may take up lodging [with us], but in the morning there is a joyful cry.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970806/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Ps. 30:5</a>) By taking final advantage of Jehovah’s “year of goodwill” we have been delivered from the momentary evening of weeping under divine anger and we have entered into the morning of his goodwill with “a joyful cry.”</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> May we make our being under Jehovah’s goodwill, not for one mere morning, but “for a lifetime.” We have the opportunity to make that for a “lifetime” of eternity. Then we shall always be appreciatively giving a “joyful cry” because of being under Jehovah’s goodwill, and our cry will be one of thanksgiving and of praise to Him through Jesus Christ.</p>

<strong>Early Help for Surviving the World’s End</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> How often in past history of God’s people it has been at dawn that the deliverance of them has been realized! It was “when the morning arose” that the angels hurried Lot and his wife and daughters out of Sodom to escape the deluge of fire and sulphur upon the corrupt city. When the Egyptian forces were driving through the Red sea after the fleeing Israelites, it was at the morning watch or watch of daybreak that Jehovah looked through the pillar of fire and the cloud and began troubling the pursuers. Finally he collapsed the walls of sea water in upon them, “when the morning appeared.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. <span id="page186" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="186" data-before-text="186"></span>19:15-28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Ex. 14:24-31</a>) It was “early in the morning” that the people of Jerusalem rose according to the arrangement of King Jehoshaphat and they marched forth singing Jehovah’s praises; and when this singing began Jehovah confused the united armies of Moab, Ammon and Mount Seir and caused them to annihilate one another. When the Assyrian hordes under the Assyrian conqueror Sennacherib menaced the life and independence of Jerusalem, Jehovah’s angel stole through the night and killed 185,000 in the invading army. When King Hezekiah and his besieged people rose “early in the morning”, it was to learn that all those thousands of the enemy had been mowed down and the aggressor was in disgraceful retreat back to Assyria.

Actually it is against Jehovah’s kingdom and against his ambassadors on earth, Jehovah’s witnesses, that the nations are raging. They are now militarized as never before over the supreme issue of world domination. Their determination is either to divide domination between two national blocs of opposed ideologies or to have one bloc as victor hog the whole domination. There is no idea of letting God have it as the Creator and Universal Sovereign. They have their own charter of the United Nations; they have their own treaties of alliance within the framework of the United Nations. They have no regard for the unchangeable covenant which God made with his Son Jesus Christ for the absolute government of the righteous new world. So prayers by their religious clergy for His kingdom are sheer hypocrisy and are for God to adopt the political governments of selfish, ambitious men as his kingdom. By their own militarization and the emergency measures which they take the nations are pressed into opposing the good news of God’s kingdom which his witnesses proclaim world-wide.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Rev. 11:15-18</a>.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">16.

Instead of terrifying us into disorganization and dissolution, the rage of the nations urges us to organize still more tightly with the help of God’s spirit. We see in such rage of the nations a clear sign of the coming end of this world, and it gives greater boldness to proclaim the good news of the Kingdom. The kingdoms of this world are the ones that are moved and made to stagger, a thing which arouses <span id="page187" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="187" data-before-text="187"></span>fears of their toppling into the seas of the revolutionary masses. From a peacetime economy they change to a militant arrangement against God’s incoming kingdom. They are mobilized for defending their national sovereignty against him. They are being speeded by unseen demon influences to take their battle positions at Armageddon to preserve their own way of life, not God’s way. Challenging the divine power, they assault the organization, the neutral position, the missionary activities and the message of Jehovah’s witnesses, not believing that his organized people have a living God who sees, who cares and who can act.</p>

<strong>Face</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">To <em>‘conceal the face’</em> has a variety of meanings, depending on the circumstance. Jehovah God’s concealing his face often signifies a withdrawal of his favor or his sustaining power.

<strong>Mount, Mountain</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><strong><em>Represent governments.</em></strong> In Biblical symbolism mountains can represent kingdoms or ruling governments.

Regarding Jehovah, David said: “You have made my mountain to stand in strength,” probably meaning that Jehovah had exalted David’s kingdom and firmly established it.

The fact that mountains may represent kingdoms aids one in understanding the significance of what is described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003125/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Revelation 8:8</a> as “something like a great mountain burning with fire.” Its resemblance to a burning mountain would suggest that it is associated with a form of rulership having a destructive nature like fire.</p>

Regarding Jehovah, David said: “You have made my mountain to stand in strength,” probably meaning that Jehovah had exalted David’s kingdom and firmly established it.

With reference to this choosing, David wrote: “The mountainous region of Bashan is a mountain of God [that is, created by God]; the mountainous region of Bashan is a mountain of peaks. Why do you, O you mountains of peaks, keep watching enviously the mountain that God has desired for himself to dwell in? Even Jehovah himself will reside there forever. . . .

There is no evidence that such a thing ever took place in connection with the literal temple at Jerusalem. But there is evidence of a fulfillment upon the Christian congregation of spiritual Israel, which is associated with the spiritual temple of Jehovah God. The invitation to become part of spiritual Israel began to be extended to non-Jews in the year 36 C.E. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/63/0" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Acts 10:34, 35</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:9, 10</a>.)

The fact that the “mountain of the house of Jehovah” was to be above mountains and hills would point to the exalted position of true worship, for mountains and hills anciently served as sites for idolatrous worship and for sanctuaries of false deities.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/0" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Deut. 12:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/1" data-bid="68-2" class="b"> Jer. 3:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/2" data-bid="68-3" class="b"> Ezek. 18:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/3" data-bid="68-4" class="b"> 11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/4" data-bid="68-5" class="b"> 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/5" data-bid="68-6" class="b"> Hos. 4:13</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong><em>Obstacles</em></strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">At times mountains represent obstacles.

Or, since mountains are lofty, this may point to the fact that God’s righteousness by far transcends that of man.

Few dance crazes in recent years have provoked so much discussion, so much controversy.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">But dances come and dances go. Tomorrow’s dance fad may be entirely different from today’s.

When divine disapproval came upon dancers, as in the case of the Israelites dancing before a golden calf, it was the idolatry associated with the dancing that was wrong, although there may also have been a factor of abandon in the dancing. Such dancing brought dishonor to Jehovah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962483/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex. 32:1-35</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In ancient Israel dancing was usually done by women, especially on occasions of victory over Jehovah’s enemies. Such dancing was an expression of thanks to God, an expression of joy over his victory, all to his glory. After Jehovah’s victory over Pharaoh and his army at the Red Sea, Moses’ sister Miriam led the Israelite women “with tambourines and in dances.” After God helped David defeat the pagan Philistines, “the women began coming out from all the cities of Israel with song and dances.” After Jehovah gave Jephthah the victory over the Ammonites, his daughter came out to meet him “with tambourine playing and dancing.” When the ark of the covenant of Jehovah was brought to the city of David, King David himself expressed his joy by “dancing around before Jehovah with all his power.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962483/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ex. 15:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962483/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1 Sam. 18:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962483/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Judg. 11:34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962483/1/3" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 2 Sam. 6:14</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The Scriptures also use the word “dancing” as an emphatic term for joy or gladness, such as at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962483/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 30:11</a>: “You have <span id="page410" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="410" data-before-text="410"></span>changed my mourning into dancing for me.”</p>

<strong>Meeting Today’s Problems with Courage</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> What a valid cause for courage this is and therefore how important it is for all Christians to study God’s Word and learn of the time, shortly to come, when the real source of worldly fear will be eliminated for all time! How do we know this? Pick up your Bible and read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 37:10 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Revelation 20:1-3</a> and see what it says. Here it is: “And just a little while longer, and the wicked one will be no <span id="page427" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="427" data-before-text="427"></span>more; and you will certainly give attention to his place, and he will not be.” “And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven with the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. And he seized the dragon, the original serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years. And he hurled him into the abyss and shut it and sealed it over him, that he might not mislead the nations any more until the thousand years were ended. After these things he must be let loose for a little while.”</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>SUCCESSFULLY OVERCOMING TODAY’S FEARS</strong></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">10. What, then, is the only way to conquer fear successfully?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> What, then, is the only way to conquer fear successfully? It is by individually studying the Bible and taking courage from God’s Word. This will give one assurance that the end of wickedness and of the multiplier of fears is at hand. There has not been enough personal study of God’s Word by mankind. If man studied the Bible, he would have the answers to our everyday problems, fears and anxieties. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:16, 17</a>) Learn for yourself how the Bible can be a light to your roadway in these difficult times. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 119:105</a>) Moreover, it is by obeying God’s laws and principles that great peace of mind and heart comes to the Christian. David stated: “Seven times in the day I have praised you because of your righteous judicial decisions. Abundant peace belongs to those loving your law, and for them there is no stumbling block.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 119:164, 165</a>) Do you personally want this peaceful, assuring outlook? Then study further into God’s Word and profit from the splendid examples of courage in times past. Learn from the course of action exemplified by such men as David, Isaac and others.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Rom. 15:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 10:11</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">11-13. (a) How did David indicate courage could be gained? (b) What does it mean to “wait for Jehovah”? (c) What benefits come to those who “wait for Jehovah”?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Now we shall consider what a man of great personal courage had to say about gaining courage, that quality of the mind that enables one to meet danger and difficulties with firmness. David once said: “In you, O Jehovah, have I taken refuge. O may I never be ashamed. In your righteousness provide escape for me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 31:1</a>) Thus, the opening verse of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 31</a> provides some helpful direction on gaining courage, for it shows that a Christian must take refuge in Jehovah and never be ashamed to call on him for help, recognizing his complete dependence on Jehovah. We invite you now to read the whole thirty-first <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 31</a>. In it you will discover that David completely relied on Jehovah in all that he said and did. As you come to the end of this Psalm you will note the key to the whole matter, for the real basis for courage is “waiting for Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 31:24</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> What does it mean to “wait for Jehovah”? The word “wait” here is the Hebrew verb <em>Yahhál,</em> and by implication this word means to be patient, to hope, to expect, to trust. Even when David was outlawed by the king of the very nation of Israel, his own people, he did not try to take matters into his own hand but waited on Jehovah for the outcome, and he was indeed blessed by him. And what about Isaac? For 180 years this faithful man did not see the land of promise in his possession, and yet he, like David, waited on Jehovah. They had this in common. This was the basis of their sticking to the work that Jehovah had given them. It was their source of courage. It kept them moving ahead, enduring, happy in their privileges and responsibilities before Jehovah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 146:5</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> Christians today do well to learn from <span id="page428" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="428" data-before-text="428"></span>these ancient examples and “wait for Jehovah,” completely relying on him and following his principles at all times. Why? Even though Christians are in the world they can be no part of it. Hence, dedicated Christians are urged: “Do not be loving either the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him; because everything in the world—the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one’s means of life—does not originate with the Father, but originates with the world. Furthermore, the world is passing away and so is its desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 John 2:15-17</a>.</p>

<strong>Maintaining Unity in Difficult Times</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> But what about situations coming up that one has never met before, perhaps never discussed before, situations that demand decisions? Perhaps there is no one around whom you could ask. If we know the principles of God’s Word in the Bible it will not be so difficult for a dedicated person to make right decisions. We know what we owe to men, but, primarily, we know what we owe to Jehovah. We must love him and obey him above everything else. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964363/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Matt. 22:36-40</a>) We are in the world, but no part of it. Therefore we are neutral regarding politics and wars. We know the proper relation toward persons of the opposite sex. We are informed about the improper use of blood. We know the Scriptural order in the family and in the Christian congregation, the proper attitude toward our employer and the government. If our conscience is enlightened by the light of Bible principles, then we shall be able to make right decisions. If we are in doubt as to what is the right decision in a matter, then we act wisely if we decide in a way that leaves our conscience unbothered. If we meet situations that demand <span id="page309" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="309" data-before-text="309"></span>decisions from us, we do well to ask Jehovah’s guidance in the matter through prayer. “For the sake of your name you will lead me and conduct me.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964363/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ps. 31:3</a>.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">22. How is the human body a fine illustration of organizational unity?</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> The thought of unity and the closest cooperation is very fittingly illustrated in the Bible. Read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964363/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">First Corinthians chapter 12</a>. The human body is here used as an illustration. Really, the human body is a unity and at unity, something complete. It functions harmoniously and to the well-being of the whole organism. If an organ does not function properly anymore, then disturbances and diseases are usually the result. The New World Society of Jehovah’s witnesses, although scattered in all the world, may be likened to such a human body. Fittingly, the organization in any one country can be likened to a human body. Not all its members perform the same function. “If they were all one member, where would the body be? But now they are many members, yet one body. The eye cannot say to the hand: ‘I have no need of you’; or, again, the head cannot say to the feet: ‘I have no need of you.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964363/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">1 Cor. 12:19-21</a>.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">23. How can unity be maintained under outside pressure, and what mistake must be avoided?</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> In the underground work this principle cannot be ignored. Also, under such circumstances the work is directed from only one central and responsible place in a country, which may be likened to the head of the body. It not only receives the spiritual food so that it may be distributed throughout the whole country, but it receives the necessary instructions and counsel. Remember, God’s Word is always our true guide. If we are living a Christian life as Jesus set the example and, in addition, preach the good news of God’s kingdom, we will be doing the right thing. By following this course, unity will be maintained even under pressure and persecution. We will want to keep in touch with the responsible agency in our country too, if at all possible. We should know our faithful brothers. If we do, we shall not make the mistake some of the Corinthian brothers made: “What I mean is this, that each one of you says: ‘I belong to Paul,’ ‘But I to Apollos,’ ‘But I to Cephas,’ ‘But I to Christ.’ Does the Christ exist divided?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964363/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 Cor. 1:12, 13</a>) The answer, of course, is No! So no matter where Jehovah’s witnesses are, stay close with <em>all</em> your faithful brothers.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">24. How strong is the bond of love, and what can it do for us?</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> Jehovah has called his people out of the confusion of this world. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964363/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:9</a>) He has called all his people to unity, to unity with himself and to unity with their brothers. The new system of things, which is coming closer day by day, will know only this unity. For all of us living in these troublesome days it is the order of the day to live in unity now, every day and under all circumstances, whether in freedom or under persecution, to work for unity and to keep united in Jehovah’s organization. The perfect bond for it has been given us: Love! “But, besides all these things, clothe yourselves with love, for it is a perfect bond of union.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964363/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Col. 3:14</a>) The love for Jehovah and our neighbor can be extremely strong, yes, an untearable bond. It binds us all together, whether we live in the North or South, East or West. It unites us, whether we can preach the gospel freely and meet freely or we have to do it underground, secretly. Love will prevent us from wrongly using our tongue and hurting our brother. Love will make it easy for us to recognize the theocratic order in God’s family at all times. Love will guard us from acting presumptuously and independently. It will guard us from becoming selfish, pleasing ourselves in extreme views or going in the <span id="page310" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="310" data-before-text="310"></span>way of least resistance. It will also prevent us from maneuvering ourselves into positions of responsibility to which we were not appointed. It will teach us to wait on Jehovah.</p>

<strong>Spirit</strong><br/><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="sb">In view of the impersonal nature of the life-force, or spirit, found in man (as also in the animal creation), it is evident that David’s statement at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/174/0" data-bid="175-1" class="b">Psalm 31:5</a>, quoted by Jesus at the time of his death (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004211/175/0" data-bid="176-1" class="b">Lu 23:46</a>), “Into your hand I entrust my spirit,” meant that God was being called upon to guard, or care for, that one’s life-force.

<strong>The Spirit That Returns to God</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">So it is in the case of the spirit or life-force. At death no actual movement from the earth to the heavenly realm need occur for it to ‘return to God.’ But the gift or grant of existence as an intelligent creature, as enjoyed once by the dead person, now reverts to God. That which is needed to animate the person, namely, the spirit or life-force, is in God’s hands.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974066/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 31:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974066/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Luke 23:46</a>.</p>

<strong>‘The Spirit Returns to God’</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The fact that in the case of one whose spirit ‘returns’ to God the future life prospects of the individual rest entirely with the Creator also explains the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101972572/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 31:5</a>: “Into your hand I entrust my spirit.” The individual expressing himself in this way would be calling upon God to guard or care for that spirit or life-force while he slept in death.

<strong>Spirit</strong><br/><p id="p74" data-pid="74" class="sb">As verses 11-14 show, this vision was symbolic of a spiritual (not physical) revivification of the people of Israel who were for a time in a spiritually dead state due to their Babylonian exile. Since they were already physically alive and breathing, it is logical to render <em>ruʹahh</em> as “spirit” in verse 14, where God states <span id="page1547" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1547" data-before-text="1547"></span>that he will put ‘his spirit’ in his people so that they would become alive, spiritually speaking.</p><p id="p75" data-pid="75" class="sb">A similar symbolic vision is given at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014114/160/0" data-bid="161-1" class="b">Revelation chapter 11</a>. The picture is presented of “two witnesses” who are killed and their corpses allowed to lie on the street for three and a half days. Then “spirit [or breath, <em>pneuʹma</em>] of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014114/161/0" data-bid="162-1" class="b">Rev. 11:1-11</a>) This vision again draws on a physical reality to illustrate a spiritual revivification. It also shows that the Greek <em>pneuʹma,</em> like the Hebrew <em>ruʹahh,</em> may represent the life-giving force from God that animates the human soul or person. As <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014114/162/0" data-bid="163-1" class="b">James 2:26</a> states: “The body without spirit [<em>pneuʹma</em>] is dead.”—<em>Kingdom Interlinear Translatio</em>n.</p><p id="p76" data-pid="76" class="sb">Therefore, when God created man in Eden and blew into his nostrils the “breath [<em>n<sup>e</sup>sha·mahʹ</em>] of life” it is evident that simultaneously therewith God caused the life force or spirit (<em>ruʹahh</em>) to vitalize all the cells in Adam’s body.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014114/163/0" data-bid="164-1" class="b">Gen. 2:7</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014114/164/0" data-bid="165-1" class="b">Psalm 104:30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014114/164/1" data-bid="165-2" class="b"> Acts 17:25</a>.</p><p id="p77" data-pid="77" class="sb">This life force is passed on from parents to offspring through conception. Since Jehovah was the original Source of this life force for man, and the Author of the procreation process, one’s life can properly be attributed to Him, though received not directly but indirectly through one’s parents.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014114/165/0" data-bid="166-1" class="b">Job 10:9-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014114/165/1" data-bid="166-2" class="b"> Psalm 139:13-16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014114/165/2" data-bid="166-3" class="b"> Ecclesiastes 11:5</a>.</p><p id="p78" data-pid="78" class="ss"><strong><em>Life force or spirit is impersonal</em></strong></p><p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="sb">As noted, the Scriptures refer to the <em>ruʹahh</em> or life force as being not only in humans but also in animals.

This being so, it is clear that the “spirit” or life force (<em>ruʹahh</em>) as used in this sense is impersonal. As an illustration, one might compare it with another invisible force, electricity, which may be used to make various types of machines operate—causing stoves to produce heat, fans to produce wind, computers to solve problems, television sets to produce figures, voices and other sounds—yet which electric current never takes on any of the characteristics of the machines in which it functions or is active.</p><p id="p80" data-pid="80" class="sb">Thus, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014114/168/0" data-bid="169-1" class="b">Psalm 146:3, 4</a> says that when man’s “spirit [<em>ruʹahh</em>] goes out, he goes back to his ground; in that day <em>his thoughts do perish.”</em> The spirit or life force that was active in man’s body cells does not retain any of the characteristics of those cells, such as the brain cells and their part in the thinking process. If the spirit or life force (<em>ruʹahh; pneuʹma</em>) were not impersonal, then it would mean that the children of certain Israelite widows who were resurrected by the prophets Elijah and Elisha were actually in conscious existence somewhere in the period during which they were dead. So, too, with Lazarus, who was resurrected some four days after his death. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014114/169/0" data-bid="170-1" class="b">1 Ki. 17:17-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014114/169/1" data-bid="170-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 4:32-37;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014114/169/2" data-bid="170-3" class="b"> John 11:38-44</a>) If such had been the case, it is reasonable that they would have remembered such conscious existence during that period and upon being resurrected would have described it, told about it. There is nothing to indicate that any of them did so. Hence, the personality of the dead individual is not perpetuated in the life force or spirit that stops functioning in the deceased person’s body cells.</p><p id="p81" data-pid="81" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014114/170/0" data-bid="171-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a> states that at death the person’s body returns to the dust “and the spirit itself returns to the true God who gave it.” The person himself was never in heaven with God; what “returns” to God is therefore the vital force that enabled the person to live.</p><p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">In view of the impersonal nature of the life force or spirit found in man (as also in the animal creation) it is evident that David’s statement at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014114/171/0" data-bid="172-1" class="b">Psalm 31:5</a>, quoted by Jesus at the time of his death (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014114/172/0" data-bid="173-1" class="b">Luke 23:46</a>), “Into your hand I entrust my spirit,” meant that God was being called upon to guard or care for that one’s life force. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014114/173/0" data-bid="174-1" class="b">Acts 7:59</a>.)

While that force within the person is itself invisible, it produces visible effects. This use of the Hebrew and Greek terms rendered “spirit” and basically related to breath or air in motion is paralleled to a considerable degree by English expressions. Thus, we speak of a person as ‘putting on airs,’ or of manifesting an ‘air of calmness’ or of ‘having a bad spirit.’ We speak of ‘breaking one’s spirit,’ in the sense of discouraging and disheartening him. As applying to a group of persons and the dominant feeling among them we may talk of ‘getting into the spirit of the occasion’ of their being gathered, or refer to the ‘mob spirit’ that infects them. Metaphorically we may refer to an ‘atmosphere of discontent,’ or to ‘winds of change and revolution blowing through a nation.’ By all this we refer to this invisible force, this dominant feeling, working in persons, moving them to speak and act as they do.</p><p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sb">Similarly, we read of Isaac and Rebekah’s “bitterness of spirit” resulting from Esau’s marriage to Hittite women (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014114/177/0" data-bid="178-1" class="b">Gen. 26:34, 35</a>), and the sadness of spirit that overwhelmed Ahab, robbing him of his appetite.

And you must act according to your wisdom, and not let his gray hairs go down in peace to Sheol.” In due time, in the interest of the peace and unity of the kingdom, Solomon found it necessary to send his army officer Benaiah to execute Joab, who tried to take sanctuary at Jehovah’s altar. “Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went on up and fell upon him and put him to death; and he got to be buried at his own house in the wilderness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965083/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Ki. 2:5, 6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965083/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 28-34</a>) Thus Joab’s gray hair did not go down in peace to Sheol.—Contrast <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965083/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Genesis 42:38</a>.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">10.

Yet, although he was on trial for his life, Jesus did not deny who and what he was. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965841/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">John 18:37</a>) His willingness to die for the truth produces in us more confidence that what he taught, preached and commanded was the pure truth. Hence we should accept it as such.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">18. Why did Jesus appropriately quote David’s words in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965841/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Psalm 31:5</a> when dying on the stake, and so to whom did Jesus’ spirit return?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> When, shortly after being sentenced to death, Jesus was hanging on the execution stake, with the inscription posted above his head, “This is the king of the Jews,” he quoted words from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965841/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 31:5</a> as he was about to die and said: “Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965841/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Luke 23:38,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965841/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 46</a>) That psalm was written by King David, who foreshadowed Jesus Christ. So it assured Jesus that he could safely entrust his spirit to Jehovah God in full hope of being delivered from Sheol, the common grave of dead mankind. Jesus knew that the psalmist David appealed to God’s truthfulness, saying: “You will bring me out of the net that they have hidden for me, for you are my fortress. Into your hand I entrust my spirit. You have redeemed me, O Jehovah the God of truth. I do hate those paying regard to worthless, vain idols; but as for me, in Jehovah I do trust. O Jehovah, may I not be ashamed, for I have called on you. May the wicked ones be ashamed; may they keep silent in Sheol.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965841/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 31:4-6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965841/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 17</a>) When Jesus thus entrusted his spirit of life to Jehovah at his death, his spirit returned to the God of truth, who had given it to him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965841/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Eccl. 12:7</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">19.

He had safely kept in trust what his Son had committed to him. He did not let his Son “keep silent in Sheol,” for his Son was not wicked. It had been just to fulfill the prophecy of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965841/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Isaiah 53:9</a> that Jesus made “his burial place even with the wicked ones, and with the rich class in his death, despite the fact that he had done no violence and there was no deception in his mouth.” Because Jehovah raised his Son to spiritual life in heaven on the third day, it proved that Jehovah was not one of those hated “worthless, vain idols” but was actually “the God of truth.” As such, he was able to make good his word, make good his prophecies that were given over his own name.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965841/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:18, 19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965841/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Ps. 16:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965841/17/2" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> Acts 2:22-36</a>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">20.

<strong>“How Great His Goodness Is!”</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> The sense of <em>smell</em> is another evidence of Jehovah’s goodness. The human nose can distinguish vast numbers of different odors​—estimates have ranged from the thousands up to one trillion. Think of just a few: your favorite food cooking, flowers, fallen leaves, the hint of smoke from a cozy fire. And your sense of <em>touch</em> enables you to feel the caress of the breeze on your face, the reassuring embrace of a loved one, the satisfying smoothness <span id="page275" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="275" data-before-text="275"></span>of a piece of fruit in your hand. When you take a bite, your sense of <em>taste</em> comes into play. A symphony of flavor greets you as your taste buds detect subtleties created by the fruit’s complex chemical makeup. Yes, we have every reason to exclaim regarding Jehovah: “How abundant your goodness is! You have stored it up for those who fear you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002052/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 31:19</a>) How, though, has Jehovah stored up goodness for those who have godly fear?</p><h2 id="p16" data-pid="16"><strong>Goodness With Everlasting Benefits</strong></h2><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">12. What provisions from Jehovah are the most important, and why?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> Jesus said: “It is written: ‘Man must live, not on bread alone, but on every word that comes from Jehovah’s mouth.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002052/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 4:4</a>) Indeed, Jehovah’s spiritual provisions can do us even more good than can the physical kind, for they lead to everlasting life. In <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1102002052/0">Chapter 8</a> of this book, we noted that Jehovah has used his restorative power during these last days to bring into being a developing spiritual paradise. A key feature of that paradise is the abundance of spiritual food.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">13, 14. (a) What did the prophet Ezekiel see in vision, with what meaning for us today? (b) What life-giving spiritual provisions does Jehovah make for his faithful servants?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> In one of the Bible’s great restoration prophecies, the prophet Ezekiel was given a vision of a restored and glorified temple. From that temple flowed a stream of water, widening and deepening as it went until it became a torrent. Wherever it flowed, that river brought blessings. On its banks flourished a crop of trees that provided food and healing. And the river even brought life and productivity to the salty, lifeless Dead Sea! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002052/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ezekiel 47:1-12</a>) But what did all of that mean?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> The temple vision meant that Jehovah would restore pure worship. It would again meet his righteous <span id="page276" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="276" data-before-text="276"></span>standards. Like that visionary river, God’s provisions for life would flow out to his people in ever-greater abundance. Since the restoration of pure worship in 1919, Jehovah has blessed his people with life-giving provisions. How? Well, Bibles, Bible literature, meetings, and conventions have all served to bring vital truths to millions. By such means Jehovah has taught people about the most important of his provisions for life​—Christ’s ransom sacrifice, which brings a clean standing before Jehovah and the hope of everlasting life to all those who truly love and fear God.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1102002052/0">a</a> Hence, throughout these last days, while the world has suffered a spiritual famine, Jehovah’s people have enjoyed a spiritual feast.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002052/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:13</a>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">15. In what sense will Jehovah’s goodness flow to faithful mankind during Christ’s Millennial Reign?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> But Ezekiel’s visionary river does not stop flowing when this old system of things meets its end. On the contrary, it will flow even more abundantly during Christ’s Millennial Reign. Then, by means of the Messianic Kingdom, Jehovah will apply the full value of Jesus’ sacrifice, gradually lifting faithful mankind to perfection. How we will then exult over Jehovah’s goodness!</p>

Like a loving, protective father, Jehovah has set aside a treasure of goodness for his earthly children. He has been showering happiness upon them before all onlookers, just as the psalmist says: “How abundant your goodness is, which you have treasured up for those fearing you!

The marriage officer was shocked and asked: “Are you sure that is what you want to do? At your age?”</p>

And who will make lasting peace, and how?</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> Wonderful it will be to realize the third and last stanza of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Psalm 46</a>. It takes the viewpoint of a survivor after the world calamity of Armageddon: “Come view the doings of Jehovah, who hath set desolations in the earth: causing wars to cease unto the end of the earth, the bow he breaketh and cutteth asunder the spear, waggons he burneth with fire.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps. 46:8, 9</a>, <em>Ro. Pss</em>.) This invitation, uttered by those within the visible organization of Jehovah God, positively assures us there will be survivors on earth after Armageddon will have swept away this old world with the broom of destruction and cleansed the earth for the righteous new world. The survivors will be informed and will know it is Jehovah by his mighty Warrior Jesus Christ who has set the then visible desolations in the earth. Such desolations will not have destroyed the earth or ruined it beyond restoration to a paradise state like the garden of Eden. They will only have ‘brought to ruin those ruining the earth’. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Rev. 11:18</a>, <em>NW</em>) God will not destroy his footstool, the earth, but will glorify it under the kingdom of his Christ. Thus it is Jehovah by Christ who ends all forms of war on the earth by destroying all the warmongers, ‘scattering the peoples that delight in war’ and demolishing their terrible weapons of war.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ps. 68:30</a>.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">23.

It will be those who heed the command of the Most High God at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 46:10</a> (<em>AS</em>): “Be still [Give in, <em>Mo;</em> Desist, Ro. Pss.], and know that I am <span id="page189" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="189" data-before-text="189"></span>God: I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.” This advice corresponds with that given at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Psalm 2:10-12</a> (<em>AS</em>): “Now therefore be wise, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve Jehovah with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, for his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all they that take refuge in him.” After decades of testimony we may not now expect political and religious rulers to appreciate and follow this advice and learn to know that Jehovah is God in a way that means salvation to them. But we may look for individuals of all nations to desist from all acts against Jehovah and his theocratic organization and to give in, be still and learn to know him and do good to Christ’s brothers. This means everlasting life.</p>

<strong>Meeting Today’s Problems with Courage</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> What a valid cause for courage this is and therefore how important it is for all Christians to study God’s Word and learn of the time, shortly to come, when the real source of worldly fear will be eliminated for all time! How do we know this? Pick up your Bible and read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 37:10 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Revelation 20:1-3</a> and see what it says. Here it is: “And just a little while longer, and the wicked one will be no <span id="page427" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="427" data-before-text="427"></span>more; and you will certainly give attention to his place, and he will not be.” “And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven with the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. And he seized the dragon, the original serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years. And he hurled him into the abyss and shut it and sealed it over him, that he might not mislead the nations any more until the thousand years were ended. After these things he must be let loose for a little while.”</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>SUCCESSFULLY OVERCOMING TODAY’S FEARS</strong></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">10. What, then, is the only way to conquer fear successfully?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> What, then, is the only way to conquer fear successfully? It is by individually studying the Bible and taking courage from God’s Word. This will give one assurance that the end of wickedness and of the multiplier of fears is at hand. There has not been enough personal study of God’s Word by mankind. If man studied the Bible, he would have the answers to our everyday problems, fears and anxieties. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:16, 17</a>) Learn for yourself how the Bible can be a light to your roadway in these difficult times. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 119:105</a>) Moreover, it is by obeying God’s laws and principles that great peace of mind and heart comes to the Christian. David stated: “Seven times in the day I have praised you because of your righteous judicial decisions. Abundant peace belongs to those loving your law, and for them there is no stumbling block.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 119:164, 165</a>) Do you personally want this peaceful, assuring outlook? Then study further into God’s Word and profit from the splendid examples of courage in times past. Learn from the course of action exemplified by such men as David, Isaac and others.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Rom. 15:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 10:11</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">11-13. (a) How did David indicate courage could be gained? (b) What does it mean to “wait for Jehovah”? (c) What benefits come to those who “wait for Jehovah”?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Now we shall consider what a man of great personal courage had to say about gaining courage, that quality of the mind that enables one to meet danger and difficulties with firmness. David once said: “In you, O Jehovah, have I taken refuge. O may I never be ashamed. In your righteousness provide escape for me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 31:1</a>) Thus, the opening verse of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 31</a> provides some helpful direction on gaining courage, for it shows that a Christian must take refuge in Jehovah and never be ashamed to call on him for help, recognizing his complete dependence on Jehovah. We invite you now to read the whole thirty-first <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 31</a>. In it you will discover that David completely relied on Jehovah in all that he said and did. As you come to the end of this Psalm you will note the key to the whole matter, for the real basis for courage is “waiting for Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 31:24</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> What does it mean to “wait for Jehovah”? The word “wait” here is the Hebrew verb <em>Yahhál,</em> and by implication this word means to be patient, to hope, to expect, to trust. Even when David was outlawed by the king of the very nation of Israel, his own people, he did not try to take matters into his own hand but waited on Jehovah for the outcome, and he was indeed blessed by him. And what about Isaac? For 180 years this faithful man did not see the land of promise in his possession, and yet he, like David, waited on Jehovah. They had this in common. This was the basis of their sticking to the work that Jehovah had given them. It was their source of courage. It kept them moving ahead, enduring, happy in their privileges and responsibilities before Jehovah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 146:5</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> Christians today do well to learn from <span id="page428" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="428" data-before-text="428"></span>these ancient examples and “wait for Jehovah,” completely relying on him and following his principles at all times. Why? Even though Christians are in the world they can be no part of it. Hence, dedicated Christians are urged: “Do not be loving either the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him; because everything in the world—the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one’s means of life—does not originate with the Father, but originates with the world. Furthermore, the world is passing away and so is its desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 John 2:15-17</a>.</p>

<strong>Be Courageous and Strong Through Faith</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> The fear of men, the fear of the governments that were possessing the Promised Land, held back the children of Israel from going forward even though they had the preceding year passed through the Red Sea, gaining deliverance from Egypt, <span id="page10" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>under the guidance of Jehovah God. All of this should have been fresh in their memory. Moses and Aaron, seeing the attitude of the people, fell upon their faces before all the congregation of Israel. Joshua and Caleb; two faithful men who had spied out the land, ripped their garments apart, “and they proceeded to say this to all the assembly of the sons of Israel: ‘The land that we passed through to spy it out is a very, very good land. If Jehovah has found delight in us, then he will certainly bring us into this land and give it to us, a land that is flowing with milk and honey. Only against Jehovah do not rebel; and you, do not you fear the people of the land, for they are bread to us. Their shelter has turned away from over them, and Jehovah is with us. Do not fear them.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962001/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Num. 14:5-9</a>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">16.

But they lacked courage and stayed as wanderers in the wilderness. They had no faith, therefore no courage. Now they would be like exiles for forty years until the whole faithless generation died off. What a disgrace, when they with courage could have been conquerors!</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">17. How did Moses, at the age of 120, show faith when he gave advice to the Israelites?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> With the rebellious ones having died off in forty years, the time came for the nation to cross the river Jordan into the Promised Land. Moses, 120 years old, was about to die too. But he was not weak in faith, for with conviction he said to the nation: “Jehovah your God is the one crossing before you. He himself will annihilate these nations from before you, and you must drive them away. Joshua is the one crossing before you, just as Jehovah has spoken.” Now comes very strong admonition from Moses for all the new generation of Israel to hear: “Be courageous and strong. Do not be afraid or suffer a shock before [these enemies], because Jehovah your God is the one marching with you. He will neither desert you nor leave you entirely.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962001/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Deut. 31:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962001/31/1" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 6</a>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">18.

History proves they did. They marched with Joshua across the Jordan, and Jehovah gave them the victory over their enemies.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong>COURAGE TO FACE A NEW WORLD</strong></p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">19.

It was a new land, not a wilderness, but a very pleasant land, virtually a Garden of Eden. They had to work for it, in fact, fight for it, but not in their own strength.

How much do you believe in the new world of righteousness? Only enough to pray silently or inside a religious building: “Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth”? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962001/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Matt. 6:10</a>) Hundreds of thousands of men and women of all nations not only believe in praying for that kingdom but are actually proclaiming it loudly, publicly, just as Jesus and his faithful followers did one thousand nine hundred years ago.

<strong>Avoid Sicknesses of Mind and Heart</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Many so-called “psychiatrists” claim to be able to read the mind of individuals, but only Jehovah God and Christ Jesus can thoroughly read the hearts of men. Said David: “Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve him with a complete heart and with a delightful soul, for all hearts Jehovah is searching and every inclination of the thoughts he is discerning.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956165/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Chron. 28:9</a>, <em>NW</em>) Jesus, too, has <span id="page143" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="143" data-before-text="143"></span>this discerning power over the heart or seat of affection that induces a creature to think or reason a certain way in his mind. “But Jesus, discerning their reasonings, said in answer to them: ‘What are you reasoning out in your hearts?’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956165/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Luke 5:22</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> Since Jehovah is searching only for those men of good will who are of good heart condition, it is vitally necessary that we become stronghearted for Jehovah in our motives, love, intentions, drive and affection. It is only by allowing the seeds of truth that enter our minds as we study Jehovah’s Word of truth to be absorbed down deep into the “right kind of soil” of our affections or hearts that the strengthening takes place. Indeed, let them take firm root there that an abundance of righteous fruitage of the spirit may be produced. Upon that righteous foundation of collected spiritual treasures let us develop also a heart acceptance of right principles. Not only words of truth but experiences in Jehovah’s ministerial service and also trials of integrity create lasting impressions upon the mind. The effect of this strengthens one’s heart condition immeasurably. “Be strong, and let your heart take courage, all ye that hope in Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956165/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 31:24</a>, <em>AS</em>) The longer one serves as a faithful, dedicated servant and keeps up with the truth, the more stouthearted he becomes as a valiant fighter for Jehovah’s name.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956165/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matt. 13:23</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956165/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Gal. 5:22</a>.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu">16, 17. (a) To what may it be likened and of what advantage is it to have a strong heart condition? (b) How does Satan take advantage of the weakhearted ones, and what is the result?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> A strong, well-fortified heart condition can be likened to a flywheel of a motor which, when in rotation, is difficult to stop but keeps rolling on, overcoming any momentary interference or inertia. If the person should momentarily be thrown off balance or deviated due to temptations by Satan or other evil ones to follow an unwise course, the heart condition of the well-entrenched, long-time servant of Jehovah is strong enough to right him immediately to resist such temptations. A strong heart condition also keeps one balanced against all storms of opposition and assures one of a proper, steady course of righteousness.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Where Satan succeeds in planting doubt and wrong thinking in the minds of weakhearted ones, he keeps them deflected or off balance for a period of time, which results in serious spiritual sickness. Such spiritually sick ones need the services quickly of the true physicians, Jehovah and Christ Jesus, that they may be returned to healthy spiritual balance. Note the following scriptures that reveal Satan’s agelong tactics of keeping the minds of most men blinded to the truth and, instead, occupied with fleshly, earthly thoughts that do not lead to a righteous heart condition. “The god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, that the illumination of the glorious good news about the Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine through.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956165/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:4</a>, <em>NW</em>) “Their god is their belly, and their glory consists in their shame, and they have their minds upon things on the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956165/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Phil. 3:19</a>, <em>NW</em>) “You who were once alienated and enemies because your minds were on the works that were wicked, he now has again reconciled.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956165/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Col. 1:21</a>, <em>NW</em>) Satan has ever sought to steal the minds of men that he might corrupt their hearts, leading them to certain spiritual death. “I am afraid that somehow, as the serpent seduced Eve by its craftiness, your minds might be corrupted away from the sincerity and the chastity that are due the Christ.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956165/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">2 Cor. 11:3</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">18.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956165/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Eph. 6:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956165/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 17</a>, <em>NW</em>) All this enables us to carry out Jesus’ commandment: “You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart [seat of love and motive] and with your whole soul [all physical powers] and with your whole mind [mental powers to gather information and to reason].” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956165/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Matt. 22:37</a>, <em>NW</em>) Said the psalmist: “Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts; and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956165/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ps. 139:23, 24</a>, <em>AS</em>) In the following article an examination will be made of Jehovah’s progressive supply of truth and how to acquire a greater grasp of the Word of life.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956165/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">2 Cor. 2:11</a>, <em>NW.</em></p>
