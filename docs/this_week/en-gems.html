<strong>Copper, Brass, Bronze</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Copper in the free state was not plentiful; metal-bearing ores consisting of oxides, carbonates, or sulfides had to be smelted to release the metallic copper.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Does</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971769/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Job 28:5</strong></a> <strong>refer to the apparent molten state of earth’s interior when it says: “As for the earth, out of it food goes forth; but underneath it, it has been upturned as if by fire”?​—Cyprus.</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">No. The context reveals that this pertains to man’s efforts to find earth’s treasures. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971769/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 28:1-4</a>) Aboveground the farmer peacefully prepares the soil, sows seed and cares for the growing grain. Thus the earth produces food. Underneath earth’s surface, however, man carries on a turbulent ‘upturning’ activity, with effects comparable to that of a ravaging fire. Miners gouge and wrest from earth’s bosom precious stones and metals.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It may be noted that a number of translations render <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971769/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 28:5</a> somewhat differently. For example, the <em>Authorized Version</em> reads: “As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire.” Based on this rendering, some commentators suggest that the fire refers to the glow of precious stones and metals that are uncovered by man. However, our understanding the “fire” to allude to man’s mining operations fits the context better and agrees with the renderings of many modern translations.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Though sparing no efforts to mine earth’s concealed treasures, man does not find true wisdom by exploring the physical creation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971769/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 28:1-12</a>) For this, man must turn to God. Job concludes: “Look! The fear of Jehovah​—that is wisdom, and to turn away from bad is understanding.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971769/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 28:28</a>.</p>

<strong>Crystal</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The comparative worth of “rock crystal” (Heb., <em>ga·vishʹ</em>) in Job’s day may be suggested by his appraisal of it along with coral and pearls, and yet he considered them all to be of less value than wisdom.

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page3" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="3" data-before-text="3"></span><strong>A Book of Wisdom With a Message for Today</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“A BAGFUL of wisdom is worth more than one full of pearls,” observed the ancient patriarch Job, who was undoubtedly one of the richest men of his time. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999240/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 1:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999240/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 28:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999240/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 42:12</a>) Truly, wisdom is worth far more than material possessions when it comes to helping a person to make a success of his life. “Wisdom is for a protection the same as money is for a protection,” said wise King Solomon, “but the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom itself preserves alive its owners.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999240/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 7:12</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">But where can such wisdom be found today? People turn to advice columnists, psychologists, psychiatrists, even hairdressers and taxi drivers, with their personal problems. And experts without number are ready to dispense advice on almost any subject​—for a suitable fee. Often, though, such words of “wisdom” have led only to disappointment, even disaster. How, then, can we find true wisdom?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Jesus Christ, who had great insight into human affairs, once said: “Wisdom is proved righteous by its works.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999240/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 11:19</a>) Let us look at some common problems in people’s lives and see what words of wisdom have truly helped them and have proved to be worth more to them than ‘a bagful of pearls.’ You too may be able to find that “bagful of wisdom” and benefit from it.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span><strong>Are You Suffering From Depression?</strong></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“If the 20th century ushered in the Age of Anxiety, its exit is witnessing the dawn of the Age of Melancholy,” notes the <em>International Herald Tribune</em> of London. It adds that “the first international study of major depression reveals a steady rise in the disorder worldwide. In nations as diverse as Taiwan, Lebanon and New Zealand each successive generation is growing more vulnerable to the malady.” Those born after 1955 are said to be three times more likely to suffer a major depression than were their grandparents.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">That was the case with Tomoe, who suffered from major depression and spent most of her days in bed. As she could not take care of her two-year-old son, she moved back to her parents’ home. A neighbor who had a daughter the same age as Tomoe’s son soon befriended her. When Tomoe told the neighbor how worthless she felt, the neighbor showed her a text from a book. It read: “The eye cannot say to the hand: ‘I have no need of you’; or, again, the head cannot say to the feet: ‘I have no need of you.’ But much rather is it the case that the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.”<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1999240/0">a</a> Tears welled up in Tomoe’s eyes as she realized that everyone has a place in the world and is needed.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The neighbor recommended that she look into the book that contained those words. Tomoe nodded in agreement, even though up till then she had not been able to do anything, not even commit herself to make a simple promise. The neighbor also helped her shop, and she prepared meals with Tomoe every day. One month later Tomoe was getting up every morning, doing the laundry, cleaning the house, shopping, and preparing dinner, just as any housewife would do. She had to overcome many difficulties, but she said, “I was confident that if I just followed the words of wisdom I had found, I’d be fine.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">By applying the wisdom she had found, Tomoe overcame the gloomy days of her depression. Now Tomoe works full-time at helping others to apply the same words that enabled her to cope with her problems. Those words of wisdom are contained in an ancient book that has a message for all people today.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><span id="page5" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span><strong>Are You Facing Domestic Problems?</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Around the world the divorce rate is escalating. Domestic problems are increasing even in Oriental countries, where people once took pride in their close-knit families. Where can we find wise marriage guidance that works?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Consider the case of Shugo and Mihoko, a couple who had endless marital problems. They quarreled over every trifle. Shugo was short-tempered, and Mihoko shot back every time he found fault with her. Mihoko even thought, ‘It is impossible for us to agree on anything.’</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">One day a woman visited Mihoko and read to her these words from a book: “All things, therefore, that you want men to do to you, you also must likewise do to them.”<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1999240/1">b</a> Although not interested in religion, Mihoko agreed to study the book that contained those words. Her interest was in improving her family life. So when she was invited to attend a meeting where a publication entitled <em>Making Your Family Life Happy</em> was discussed, Mihoko​—and her husband—​readily accepted.<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1999240/2">c</a></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">At the meeting, Shugo noted that those in attendance were actually applying what they were learning and that they seemed to be happy. He decided to look into the book that his wife was studying. One statement soon caught his attention: “He that is slow to anger is abundant in discernment, but one that is impatient is exalting foolishness.”<a id="footnotesource4" data-fnid="4" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1999240/3">d</a> Although it took time for him to apply this principle in his life, the gradual change in him was manifest to those around him, including his wife.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Seeing the changes in her husband, Mihoko also started to apply what she was learning. One principle that proved especially helpful was this: “Stop judging that you may not be judged; for with what judgment you are judging, you will be judged.”<a id="footnotesource5" data-fnid="5" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1999240/4">e</a> So Mihoko and her husband decided that they would talk about their good points and how they could improve rather than find fault with each other. What was the result? Mihoko recalls: “It has made me really happy. We have been doing this at dinner each evening. Even our three-year-old son joins in the conversation. It has been truly refreshing to us!”</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><span id="page6" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>When this family put into practice the meaningful counsel that they had received, they were able to overcome the problems that had been straining their relationship to the breaking point. Is that not worth more to them than a bagful of pearls?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>Do You Want to Make a Success of Your Life?</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">For many today, accumulating riches is the goal in life. Yet, a rich businessman in the United States who has given away hundreds of millions of dollars to charity once said: “Money has an attraction for some people, but nobody can wear two pairs of shoes at one time.” Few are those who admit this fact and fewer still are those who stop pursuing riches.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Hitoshi grew up poor, so he had a strong desire to be rich. After seeing how creditors twist people around their little finger, he decided: “The one who grabs ahold of the money is the winner.” Hitoshi believed so much in the power of money that he thought even human lives could be bought with it. In order to accumulate riches, he applied himself to his plumbing business and worked all year round, never taking a day off. As hard as he tried, Hitoshi soon realized that he, a subcontractor, would never be as powerful as the contractors who gave him work. Frustration and fear of bankruptcy were his daily portion.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Then a man came to Hitoshi’s door and asked him if he knew that Jesus Christ had died for him. Since Hitoshi felt that no one would die for a person like him, he was curious and agreed to have further discussions. The following week, he attended a lecture and was shocked to hear the admonition to ‘keep the eye simple.’ The speaker explained that a “simple” eye is one that is farsighted and focused on spiritual things; on the other hand, a “wicked,” or “envious,” eye is focused only on immediate fleshly desires and is shortsighted. The counsel, “Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also,” hit him hard.<a id="footnotesource6" data-fnid="6" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1999240/5">f</a> There is something more important than gaining riches! He had never heard anything like it.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Impressed, he started to apply what he was learning. Rather than toiling for money, he began to put spiritual values first in his life. He also spent time caring for the spiritual welfare of his family. Naturally, that meant less time for work, yet his business took a favorable turn.

He was particularly impressed by the admonition: “Really put them all away from you, wrath, anger, badness, abusive speech, and obscene talk out of your mouth. Do not be lying to one another. Strip off the old personality with its practices, and clothe yourselves with the new personality, which through accurate knowledge is being made new according to the image of the One who created it.”<a id="footnotesource7" data-fnid="7" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1999240/6">g</a> Following this advice did not make him rich, but his “new personality” did make a good impression on his clients and won their trust and confidence. Yes, the words of wisdom he found helped him to make a success of his life. For him, they were literally worth far more than a bagful of pearls or money.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong>Will You Open the Bag?</strong></p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Can you identify the bagful of wisdom that has proved so valuable to the individuals in the above examples? It is the wisdom found in the Bible, the most widely circulated and most readily available book on earth. Possibly you have a copy or can easily obtain one. However, just as having a bagful of valuable pearls and not putting them to use would do the owner little good, simply having a Bible in one’s possession will also be of little value. Why not open up the bag, so to speak, and apply the Bible’s wise counsel and timely advice and see how it can help you to deal successfully with life’s problems.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">If you were ever given a bagful of pearls, would you not be grateful and try to find out who your benefactor is so that you can thank him? Do you know who the Giver is in the case of the Bible?</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">The Bible reveals the Source of the wisdom found in it when it says: “All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999240/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16</a>) It also tells us that “the word of God is alive and exerts power.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999240/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:12</a>) That is why the wise words found in the Bible are timely and effective for us today. Jehovah’s Witnesses would be delighted to help you to learn about this generous Giver, Jehovah God, so that you can come in line for being a beneficiary of the “bagful of wisdom” contained in the Bible​—the book of wisdom with a message for people today.</p>

<strong>Crown</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Diadems, which were considered symbols of royalty, were worn by Hebrew kings, such as Saul. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011050/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Sam. 1:10</a>) However, the main Hebrew word denoting a crown in the usual sense and generally rendered “crown” (<em>NW</em>) is ʽ<em>ata·rah</em>ʹ<em>,</em> from <em>ʽa·tarʹ,</em> meaning “to encircle.” It does not necessarily signify a diadem. The crown (ʽ<em>ata·rah</em>ʹ) David took as a prize of war <span id="page399" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="399" data-before-text="399"></span>from the Ammonites at Rabbah orginally was kept on the head of the idol Malcam. This crown’s form is not revealed, but it was a “talent of gold in weight [c. 91.5 pounds troy or c. 34 kilograms], and in it there were precious stones.” “It came to be on David’s head,” he possibly placing this heavy crown on his head only briefly, perhaps to signify his triumph over the false deity.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011050/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Chron. 20:2</a>; see MOLECH.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Some crowns were made of refined gold (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011050/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 21:3</a>), others additionally being studded with precious stones. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011050/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Sam. 12:30</a>) At times, several bands or diadems were combined and this seems to have been the usual nature of a “grand crown.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011050/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 31:36</a>) The expression “grand crown” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011050/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Zechariah 6:14</a> is, literally, “crowns” in Hebrew, but is accompanied by a verb in the singular number. Hence, it appears to be in the plural number of excellence or grandeur.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Concerning unfaithful Zedekiah, the last of Judah’s kings, Jehovah decreed: “Remove the turban, and lift off the crown.” This may relate to a kingly turban, over which a crown (perhaps a golden diadem) was worn. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011050/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 21:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011050/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Isaiah 62:3</a>.) Both of these symbols of active royal power were removed, and God’s decree indicated that active rulership on “Jehovah’s throne” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011050/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:23</a>) would be held in abeyance until the coming of God’s Messianic King.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011050/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ezek. 21:25-27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011050/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Gen. 49:10</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">A “royal headdress” of the Persian Empire is mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011050/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Esther 1:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011050/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 2:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011050/12/2" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> 6:6-10</a>. The Bible does not describe the Persian “royal headdress,” though the Persian monarch himself ordinarily wore one consisting of a stiff cap, perhaps of cloth or of felt, that had a blue-and-white band around it, the band actually being a diadem.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">When Upper and Lower Egypt were united under one monarch, the Egyptian royal headdress became a combination crown. The crown of Lower Egypt (a flat red cap with a high point in the back and a projection with a curled end jutting out diagonally toward the front) was superimposed upon that of Upper Egypt (a round, high white cap tapering to a knob). Usually the Uraeus (the Egyptians’ sacred asp) appears at the front of the crown. The royal headdress of the Assyrian king, which has been described as a high mitre, was often adorned with such figures as flowers, and was arranged in bands of silk or linen. It was a sort of conical cap somewhat similar to a modern fez, though higher. Greek and Roman crowns were simpler, sometimes being radiated diadems or having the form of wreaths.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Roman soldiers, in mockery of Christ’s royal status and probably also to add to his agony, braided a crown of thorns and placed it on Jesus’ head. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011050/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 27:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011050/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Mark 15:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011050/13/2" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> John 19:2</a>) There have been various suggestions as to the plant used. For instance, the <em>Zizyphus Spina Christi,</em> which has pliable branches, sharp spines and dark-green leaves that look like ivy, has been pointed to. Also suggested is the Nubk (<em>Zizyphus lotus</em>), with bright leaves and strong thorns and found in recent times along the shores of the Sea of Galilee, but not near Jerusalem. However, the Gospel writers do not name the plant.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Jehovah spoke of men putting bracelets upon the hands of the women and “beautiful crowns” on their heads. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011050/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ezek. 23:36,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011050/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 42</a>) Just what these crowns were like, if they were literal, the Bible does not say. However, in recent centuries, Arab women of distinction and wealth have worn (around dome-shaped caps) crowns that were jeweled gold circlets. A similar type of headdress may have been worn by certain women of antiquity.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Crowns of a wreath or a garland of flowers were used in connection with athletic events. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011050/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Tim. 2:5</a>) Winners in Grecian games were given crowns or wreaths that were usually made of the leaves of trees and were adorned with flowers. For instance, in the Pythian games the victors received a crown made of laurel; winners in the Olympian games got crowns of wild olive leaves; and victors in the Isthmian games (held near Corinth) were given crowns made of the pine.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The English word “crown” is also applied, among other things, to the top of the head. It is used in that sense in the Scriptures as well.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011050/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Gen. 49:26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011050/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Deut. 28:35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011050/16/2" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> Ps. 68:21</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>FIGURATIVE USE</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">A capable wife is considered to be “a crown to her owner,” because her good conduct brings honor to her husband, raising him in the estimation of others.

<strong>Abaddon</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In Hebrew the word <em>ʼavad·dohnʹ</em> means “destruction” and may also refer to “the place of destruction.” It appears in the original Hebrew text a total of five times, and in four of the occurrences it is used to parallel “the burial place,” “Sheol,” and “death.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000007/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps 88:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000007/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Job 26:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000007/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 28:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000007/1/3" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> Pr 15:11</a>) The word <em>ʼavad·dohnʹ</em> in these texts evidently refers to the destructive processes that ensue with human death, and these scriptures indicate that decay or destruction takes place in Sheol, the common grave of mankind.

John says: “And the likenesses of the locusts resembled horses prepared for battle; and upon their heads were what seemed to be crowns like gold, and their faces were as men’s faces, but they had hair as women’s hair. And their teeth were as those of lions; and they had breastplates like iron breastplates. And the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running into battle. Also, they have tails and stings like scorpions; and in their tails is their authority to hurt the men five months.” From this description we note that the remnant of Jehovah’s anointed witnesses were brought forth in 1919 for warfare, a spiritual warfare from that year till the actual outbreak of the “war of the great day of God the Almighty,” commonly called Armageddon.

It is a terrific sound. The symbolic locusts shout as from the house-tops and let God’s judgment message be heard over a vast distance in the territory that they cover. Fear of the enemy does not soften down their message to a mere whisper. Jehovah’s war declaration must be sounded loudly. He is responsible for the hurting of feelings that the message causes to the ones who are stung by it. For the brief time interval till Armageddon breaks out, “five months,” as it were, the symbolic locusts must use their scorpion-like tails, God’s Word, “the sword of the spirit,” and must strike men against whom God’s judgment is directed. It is not God’s time to spare feelings. His enemies have to be exposed and notified of coming judgment.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Eph. 6:17</a>.</p><p id="p99" data-pid="99" class="qu">30.

John says of them: “They have over them a king, the angel of the abyss. In Hebrew his name is Abadʹdon, but in Greek he has the name Apollyon.” The resurrected heavenly Jesus Christ is the “angel of the abyss,” for he holds the “keys of death and of Haʹdes.” In the finale of the universal war of Armageddon he will bind and pitch Satan the Devil and his spirit demons into the abyss of deathlike inactivity. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Rev. 20:1-3</a>) When Jesus was on earth as a man, he was a Hebrew, and now in his capacity as Jehovah’s royal Executioner he is called by the Hebrew name Abadʹdon, which means Destruction.

This name clearly shows that he comes to the throne at God’s right hand to rule first in the midst of his enemies and to destroy them in execution of Jehovah’s righteous judgment, Jehovah’s judicial decision against them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Jas. 4:12</a>.</p><p id="p100" data-pid="100" class="qu">31.

But this is not due to any locust instinct. It is due to the heavenly wisdom imparted by God’s spirit. Also, their following their heavenly King Jesus Christ as the Leader whom God had enthroned is what keeps them united in their attack upon the men not sealed.

<strong>Does Relationship with God Help Us Now?</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> While such incidental association with God through his Word has brought enlightenment and better living, people who really read the Bible and make it a guide in their lives profit in far greater measure. The patriarch Job points out that more than a surface knowledge of God is necessary. After remarking about some of the marvelous facts of creation that scientists can understand and explain only after much research, he says: “Look! These are the <em>fringes</em> of [God’s] ways, and what a whisper of a matter has been heard of him!” Later, Job points out that the <em>real wisdom</em> requires more of us than learning the mere “fringes of his ways”​—something more than mere scientific facts. We must come to know the fineness of God’s personality, to fear him as the One who upholds right principles, and to follow these principles. This wisdom can be gained only by a study of his Word. Job says: “Look! The fear of Jehovah​—that is wisdom, and to turn away from bad is understanding.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979285/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 26:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979285/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 28:28</a>) To one who seeks, by looking into the Bible, to achieve a relationship with God, the psalmist wrote: “Happy is the one you <span id="page20" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>choose and cause to approach, that he may reside in your courtyards. He will certainly be satisfied with the goodness of your house.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979285/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 65:4</a>.</p>

<strong>Will Science Really Solve Your Problems?</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="ss"><strong>BALANCED VIEW OF SCIENCE</strong></p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">A Christian appreciates true learning and scientific discovery. However, he has the benefit of real wisdom to direct his thinking. This proper guidance does not come from any man. The upright man, Job, referred to at the start of this article, acknowledged this fact. After admitting that even scientific men do not have wisdom, Job, inspired by God, raised the question:</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">“But wisdom​—where can it be found?” His answer:</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">“Look! The fear of Jehovah​—that is wisdom, and to turn away from bad is understanding.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975120/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 28:1-28</a>.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">What are the results of looking to God in guiding one’s thinking about matters of a scientific nature? Very favorable; the problems of life get solved.</p>

<strong>Wise Sayings for the Modern Day</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> The stupid person does not keep God in mind or in view; the understanding person does. He is not only wise in fearing Jehovah; he is understanding. He is acting in accord with his godly fear. It was God <span id="page664" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="664" data-before-text="664"></span>himself who said: “Look! the fear of Jehovah—that is wisdom, and to turn away from bad is understanding.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957807/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Job 28:28</a>) The understanding person will not refuse a reproof and then ridicule: “The ridiculer you should strike, that the inexperienced one may become shrewd; and there should be a reproving of the understanding one, that he may discern knowledge.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957807/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Prov. 19:25</a>) A mere reproof, not a violent blow, is enough for an understanding person. In spite of all his wisdom, he may act indiscreetly or wrongly. For that reason he may from time to time need a reproof to bring him back to understanding. Encrusted in old age, King Solomon did not take heed to a mere reproof. Despite all the wisdom with which God had favored him, he turned to stupidity. Why? Because he left off understanding. How? He let his vision and his keen sense of his relationship to Jehovah God grow dull; he became like a beast. “Earthling man, although in honor, who does not understand, is indeed comparable with the beasts that have been destroyed.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957807/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Ps. 49:20</a>.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">23. So Solomon lost understanding when he did what, and how can we appreciate the great wisdom from which he fell?</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> Solomon lost understanding when he abandoned his relationship with Jehovah and yoked himself with other gods, the gods of the many pagan wives whom he had married. “And Jehovah came to be incensed at Solomon, because his heart had turned away from Jehovah the God of Israel, the one appearing to him twice. And respecting this thing he commanded him not to go after other gods, but he had not kept that which Jehovah had commanded.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957807/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">1 Ki. 11:9, 10</a>) The great wisdom from which Solomon fell to a death in God’s disfavor can be appreciated when we turn to the writings of Solomon that he composed under inspiration as one of Jehovah’s witnesses.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">24. Why should we never ridicule the things of God, and why will we try to make knowledge, wisdom and understanding a part of ourselves?</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> Let us never ridicule the things of God. The life-giving knowledge of the true God will never be got that way. One who understands his creative tie with God and his total dependence upon him will find it easy to know him. “The ridiculer has sought to find wisdom, and there is none; but to the understanding one knowledge is an easy thing.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957807/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Prov. 14:6</a>) Seeing, then, how knowledge, wisdom and understanding must be kept together, and how needful all three are to life and right conduct, we will try to make them an inseparable part of ourselves. We will make them our relatives, members of our spiritual family. “Say to wisdom: ‘You are my sister,’ and may you call understanding itself ‘Kinswoman.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957807/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Prov. 7:4</a>.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="sb"></p>

<strong>‘Knowledge That Increases Pain’—to Be Avoided?</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">If we are to avoid experiencing pain due to having used human knowledge and wisdom in the wrong way, we must shun everything that stands in opposition to the Creator and his purpose. We must also build our knowledge on the right foundation. What is this foundation? <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101972650/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 28:28</a> answers: “The fear of Jehovah​—that is wisdom, and to turn away from bad is understanding.”</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The fear of Jehovah is an awe, a profound reverence for him with a wholesome dread of displeasing him. When individuals have this wholesome regard for the Creator, they do not deliberately use their knowledge for selfish purposes but seek the advantage of fellow humans. The wisdom that has the fear of Jehovah as its start produces better people and improved relations, for such wisdom “is first of all chaste, then peaceable, reasonable, ready to obey, full of mercy and good fruits, not making partial distinctions, not hypocritical.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101972650/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Jas. 3:17</a>.</p>

<strong>Consolation for the Depressed</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Depression is a miserable feeling, but not uncommon. For example, a mature overseer nearing the end of a period of intense study is suddenly gripped by depressing thoughts. A middle-aged woman who works hard to meet her obligations is sad-faced and dejected. A zealous servant in a congregation, although having many living letters of recommendation, feels miserably depressed. A young mother with several <span id="page182" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="182" data-before-text="182"></span>Bible studies to her credit is painfully downcast and complains that God does not seem to be as close as she had hoped he would be. A young full-time minister raised “in the discipline and authoritative advice of Jehovah” is suddenly crushed by depressing doubts. An elderly Christian with long years of full-time ministry behind him fears that somehow he has lost the race for the heavenly crown of life.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>COMMON EXPERIENCE</strong></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">These true experiences are not news to students of the Bible. In 50 (A.D.) the apostle Paul exhorted the Christians in Thessalonica to “speak consolingly to the depressed souls.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:14</a>) After denying Christ the third time, Peter “went outside and wept bitterly,” undoubtedly very depressed by personal failure. On the road to Emmaus, Cleopas and another disciple “stood still with sad faces” and poured out their disappointment at the death of Jesus, who they had hoped was destined to deliver Israel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 22:62;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 24:13-21</a>) Paul, in his second letter to the Christians at Corinth, wrote: “We are pressed in every way, but not cramped beyond movement; we are perplexed, but not absolutely with no way out; we are persecuted, but not left in the lurch; we are thrown down, but not destroyed.” “In fact, when we arrived in Macedonia, our flesh got no relief, but we continued to be afflicted in every manner—there were fights without, <em>fears within.</em> Nevertheless God, who comforts those laid low, comforted us by the presence of Titus.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:8, 9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 7:5, 6</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Faithful servants of Jehovah also suffered depressed feelings long before the Christian Era. Integrity-keeping Job had so many burdens that he spoke as if God were no longer with him: “As in the days when God was guarding me; . . . when intimacy with God was at my tent; when the Almighty was yet with me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 29:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 4, 5</a>) The Israelites worked so hard in Egyptian slavery that even when Jehovah sent a message of hope through Moses the discouraged people did not believe.

Often, however, the cause cannot be easily pinpointed, since a combination of circumstances is involved. A girl away from home may be out of work, alone and homesick. Physical and mental fatigue also team up to cause depression. Sometimes it may simply be poor health or worry. Periodic adjustments in one’s body chemistry may be accompanied by low spirits. Women frequently undergo depression during the menopause. Elderly people may be dejected because of failing physical strength or suspicion that they are unwanted. If one is fatigued by steady hard work or his mind is wearied by intense study and improper rest, he may begin to view life pessimistically, negatively. These are some common causes of the miserable state of depression. Occasionally depression <span id="page183" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="183" data-before-text="183"></span>may lean more toward spiritual sickness, with weakened faith and a corresponding inability to get comfort from the Scriptures. The spiritually sick one imagines that for some reason God has turned His back on him, and God-given promises of hope and sympathy are doubted. Whatever the particular cause, depressed feelings are never pleasant.</p>

<strong>Consolation for the Depressed</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Depression is a miserable feeling, but not uncommon. For example, a mature overseer nearing the end of a period of intense study is suddenly gripped by depressing thoughts. A middle-aged woman who works hard to meet her obligations is sad-faced and dejected. A zealous servant in a congregation, although having many living letters of recommendation, feels miserably depressed. A young mother with several <span id="page182" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="182" data-before-text="182"></span>Bible studies to her credit is painfully downcast and complains that God does not seem to be as close as she had hoped he would be. A young full-time minister raised “in the discipline and authoritative advice of Jehovah” is suddenly crushed by depressing doubts. An elderly Christian with long years of full-time ministry behind him fears that somehow he has lost the race for the heavenly crown of life.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>COMMON EXPERIENCE</strong></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">These true experiences are not news to students of the Bible. In 50 (A.D.) the apostle Paul exhorted the Christians in Thessalonica to “speak consolingly to the depressed souls.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:14</a>) After denying Christ the third time, Peter “went outside and wept bitterly,” undoubtedly very depressed by personal failure. On the road to Emmaus, Cleopas and another disciple “stood still with sad faces” and poured out their disappointment at the death of Jesus, who they had hoped was destined to deliver Israel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 22:62;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 24:13-21</a>) Paul, in his second letter to the Christians at Corinth, wrote: “We are pressed in every way, but not cramped beyond movement; we are perplexed, but not absolutely with no way out; we are persecuted, but not left in the lurch; we are thrown down, but not destroyed.” “In fact, when we arrived in Macedonia, our flesh got no relief, but we continued to be afflicted in every manner—there were fights without, <em>fears within.</em> Nevertheless God, who comforts those laid low, comforted us by the presence of Titus.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:8, 9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 7:5, 6</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Faithful servants of Jehovah also suffered depressed feelings long before the Christian Era. Integrity-keeping Job had so many burdens that he spoke as if God were no longer with him: “As in the days when God was guarding me; . . . when intimacy with God was at my tent; when the Almighty was yet with me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 29:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 4, 5</a>) The Israelites worked so hard in Egyptian slavery that even when Jehovah sent a message of hope through Moses the discouraged people did not believe. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex. 6:6-9</a>) Elkanah’s beloved wife Hannah was so disappointed over barrenness and vexed by a rival wife that “she would weep and not eat.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Sam. 1:5-7</a>) The harassed psalmist, feeling sad and abandoned, wrote: “I will say to God my crag: ‘Why have you forgotten me?

Were they disgusted that the management had presumed to let a mere child conduct one of the world’s finest orchestras! They showed it by their disdainful, defiant facial expressions; some were even sucking lollipops to show their contempt.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">But not for long. Once the lad lifted his baton and began the rehearsal, it was only a matter of minutes before those instrumental virtuosi were earnestly applying themselves to the business at hand. Ignored now was his being a mere child. What had caused their disdainful disrespect to change to deferential regard, to esteem, to respect? The lad’s ability, for he truly was a prodigy. He had the entire musical score in his head. More than that, he knew what to expect from each instrumentalist, for he could detect at once whenever any one of them played a wrong note. In spite of his age, he had what it took to be a conductor. Incidentally, that was some twenty years ago. Today Maazel is still conducting.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Not only orchestra conductors, but ever so many persons in everyday life are, by reason of their positions, entitled to respect, that is, added respect, for every honest individual is entitled to a measure of respect. In particular are parents and schoolteachers, overseers and ministers—to name but a few—entitled to respect. However, while these could depend solely upon their position or office, it is far better for all concerned when they truly earn the respect due them.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">God’s Word, the Bible, throws light on this matter of earning respect, even as it does on every other aspect of life. Thus it tells us of angels not pursuing a certain course—out of respect for Jehovah God. No question about it, Jehovah, the Creator of all things seen and unseen, is entitled to the greatest respect of all his creatures.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964200/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Pet. 2:11</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In the Bible we also read of one of God’s creatures who at one time enjoyed great respect, namely, Job. As he himself tells us: “When I went forth to the gate by the town, . . . even the aged ones rose up, they stood. Princes themselves restrained words . . . The voice of the leaders themselves was hidden. . . . I was sitting as head; and I resided as a king.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964200/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 29:7-10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964200/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 25</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">And why was such great respect tendered <span id="page164" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="164" data-before-text="164"></span>Job? He himself tells us: “For I would rescue the afflicted one crying for help, and the fatherless boy and anyone that had no helper. With righteousness I clothed myself, and it was clothing me. My justice was like a . . . turban. And I would break the jawbones of the wrongdoer, and from his teeth I would tear away the prey.” More than that, Job goes on to enumerate all the selfish or wicked things he had not done. In short, as “the greatest of all the Orientals,” he “proved to be blameless and upright, and fearing God and turning aside from bad.” No question about it, Job earned the great respect that was tendered him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964200/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 29:12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964200/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964200/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964200/2/3" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 1:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964200/2/4" data-bid="3-5" class="b"> 3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964200/2/5" data-bid="3-6" class="b"> 31:5-40</a>.</p>

We shall concern ourselves here mainly with the gates mentioned in the book of Nehemiah, which gives us the most complete description or listing. The gates named in Nehemiah’s record are gates in the wall that was built prior to the eighth century B.C.E. and in the wall surrounding the “second quarter.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">2 Ki. 22:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/42/1" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 34:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/42/2" data-bid="43-3" class="b"> Zeph. 1:10</a>) The “second quarter” was a part of the city bounded on the W and part of the N by Hezekiah’s wall (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:5</a>) and joined by Manasseh’s wall, which continued on the NE and E. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">2 Chron. 33:14</a>) This was N of the earlier city and wall, but apparently did not extend as far W as the earlier wall.—See accompanying map.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong><em>Nehemiah’s wall</em></strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">In his account of the reconstruction of the wall of the city (chap. 3), Nehemiah begins at the Sheep Gate, located in the NE part of the wall encompassing the second quarter, and proceeds in a counterclockwise direction. We shall follow this procedure in our listing below, inserting the gates not mentioned in the reconstruction account but named in the description of the inauguration procession (chap. 12), along with gates spoken of in other scriptures, some of which are merely other names for those in Nehemiah’s record.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong><em>Sheep Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The Sheep Gate was rebuilt by Eliashib the high priest and associate priests. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Neh. 3:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/45/1" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> 32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/45/2" data-bid="46-3" class="b"> 12:39</a>) This fact would indicate that it was near the Temple area. Its location was probably in the N wall of the second quarter, the part built by Manasseh (see “Fish Gate,” below), at or near the NE corner of the city. This gate may have been so named because through it were brought sheep and goats for sacrifice or perhaps for a market that was located nearby. It may also have been called the “Gate of Benjamin” (which see). The “sheepgate” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">John 5:2</a> is likely this Sheep Gate or a later gate corresponding to it, for it was located in the same vicinity, near the pool Bethzatha.</p>

Were they disgusted that the management had presumed to let a mere child conduct one of the world’s finest orchestras! They showed it by their disdainful, defiant facial expressions; some were even sucking lollipops to show their contempt.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">But not for long. Once the lad lifted his baton and began the rehearsal, it was only a matter of minutes before those instrumental virtuosi were earnestly applying themselves to the business at hand. Ignored now was his being a mere child. What had caused their disdainful disrespect to change to deferential regard, to esteem, to respect? The lad’s ability, for he truly was a prodigy. He had the entire musical score in his head. More than that, he knew what to expect from each instrumentalist, for he could detect at once whenever any one of them played a wrong note. In spite of his age, he had what it took to be a conductor. Incidentally, that was some twenty years ago. Today Maazel is still conducting.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Not only orchestra conductors, but ever so many persons in everyday life are, by reason of their positions, entitled to respect, that is, added respect, for every honest individual is entitled to a measure of respect. In particular are parents and schoolteachers, overseers and ministers—to name but a few—entitled to respect. However, while these could depend solely upon their position or office, it is far better for all concerned when they truly earn the respect due them.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">God’s Word, the Bible, throws light on this matter of earning respect, even as it does on every other aspect of life. Thus it tells us of angels not pursuing a certain course—out of respect for Jehovah God. No question about it, Jehovah, the Creator of all things seen and unseen, is entitled to the greatest respect of all his creatures.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964200/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Pet. 2:11</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In the Bible we also read of one of God’s creatures who at one time enjoyed great respect, namely, Job. As he himself tells us: “When I went forth to the gate by the town, . . . even the aged ones rose up, they stood. Princes themselves restrained words . . . The voice of the leaders themselves was hidden. . . . I was sitting as head; and I resided as a king.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964200/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 29:7-10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964200/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 25</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">And why was such great respect tendered <span id="page164" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="164" data-before-text="164"></span>Job? He himself tells us: “For I would rescue the afflicted one crying for help, and the fatherless boy and anyone that had no helper. With righteousness I clothed myself, and it was clothing me. My justice was like a . . . turban. And I would break the jawbones of the wrongdoer, and from his teeth I would tear away the prey.” More than that, Job goes on to enumerate all the selfish or wicked things he had not done.

<strong>Show Loving-Kindness to Those in Need</strong><br/><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> The Bible accounts we have discussed also underscore the fact that loving-kindness is to be shown to those who have a need that they themselves cannot fill. In order to continue his family line, Abraham needed Bethuel’s cooperation. To have his remains taken to Canaan, Jacob needed Joseph’s help. And to produce an heir, Naomi needed Ruth’s assistance. Neither Abraham, Jacob, nor Naomi could fill those needs without help. Similarly today, loving-kindness should especially be shown to those in need. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002364/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Proverbs 19:17</a>) We should imitate the patriarch Job, who gave attention to “the afflicted one crying for help, and the fatherless boy and anyone that had no helper” as well as to “the one about to perish.” Job also ‘made glad the heart of the widow’ and became ‘eyes to the blind and feet to the lame.’​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002364/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Job 29:12-15</a>.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">20, 21. Who are in need of our expressions of loving-kindness, and what should each of us be determined to do?</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span id="page23" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> Actually, there are ‘afflicted ones crying for help’ in every Christian congregation. This may be the result of such factors as loneliness, discouragement, feelings of unworthiness, disappointment in others, serious illness, or the death of a loved one. No matter what the cause, all such dear ones have needs that can and should be filled by our willing and enduring acts of loving-kindness.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002364/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 5:14</a>.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204407/563/0">11/15/1994, p. 16</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Job’s Reward—A Source of Hope</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Despite his sufferings, Job did not stop serving Jehovah. Instead of turning away from the Most High, this man of integrity yearned for his former “intimacy with God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994844/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Job 29:4</a>) Job was not bragging when he recounted how he ‘rescued the afflicted, clothed himself with righteousness, and was a real father to the poor.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994844/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Job 29:12-16</a>) Rather, he was citing the facts of his life as a faithful servant of Jehovah. Have you built up such a fine record? Of course, Job was also exposing the falsity of the charges made by the three pious frauds.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204407/564/0">9/15/1980, p. 25</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Can You Help Widows and Fatherless Children “in Their Tribulation”?</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>BROTHERS​—‘RESCUE FATHERLESS BOYS’</strong></p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">16. (a) What is a chief concern of female single parents regarding their sons? (b) Who can help, and how?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> The mother in a single-parent family naturally is concerned about the lack of a father’s influence in the home, especially on the sons. Men in the congregation should feel as did Job, who said: “I would rescue . . . the fatherless boy and anyone that had no helper.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980689/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Job 29:12</a>) Often what is needed is sincere interest. These boys could be personally invited to share with you in witnessing, in certain activities at the Kingdom Hall and even in wholesome recreation. This attention could “rescue” a boy from a worldly course and draw him toward the congregation.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204407/565/0">7/15/1962, pp. 441-442</a> - this link has citations, only first citation shown, click link to see more]</strong></p>
<strong>Consideration for Older Persons and Afflicted Ones</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The results of showing tender affection for these older persons and afflicted ones prove that such consideration has Jehovah’s blessing. One woman rises early each Sunday and drives some distance out of her way to pick up an elderly widow for a day of witnessing, meetings and material sustenance. In another congregation, when illness recently struck a middle-aged woman who lives alone with her elderly mother, members of the congregation swarmed <span id="page442" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="442" data-before-text="442"></span>to the sister’s bedside like worker bees, taking over the housecleaning, shopping and other duties. Exclaimed the grateful convalescent: “I didn’t know so many of my brothers loved me! I will never be able to do enough for Jehovah!” Consider the case of a Christian widow and her two daughters. Shortly after this family moved, the mother died. Who would look after the orphans? The overseer in their new congregation appreciated that these teen-agers needed the benefit of a Christian home and arranged to make them part of his household. In yet another instance, when an elderly faithful woman fell into dire circumstances, a family of newly dedicated Witnesses took the afflicted one into their home, where she has been lovingly cared for over a long period of time. These examples prove that James’ words are still being applied: “The form of worship that is clean and undefiled from the standpoint of our God and Father is this: to look after orphans and widows in their tribulation.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962526/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Jas. 1:27</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">When you show consideration to one of the least of Jesus’ brothers, he counts it as done to himself. Such consideration will be found among the Lord’s “other sheep” who are in line for the blessing of endless life in God’s new world. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962526/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matt. 25:31-46</a>) Even now blessings come to considerate ones, who find the proverb true: “Happy is he who is showing favor to the afflicted ones.” Besides enjoying the superior happiness of giving, you will find that a visit with an older person or afflicted Christian often provides a mutual exchange of encouragement. By observing the integrity of the one in difficulty the visitor gains a valuable lesson in endurance. Elderly Christians are often rich in interesting experiences and eyewitness accounts of outstanding events in the modern history of Jehovah’s congregation. Consideration shown to afflicted ones causes them to remember you in their prayers to Jehovah. These are some of the blessings that are yours when you show kindness to those faithful ones who may be ‘poor respecting the world but rich in faith.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962526/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Jas. 2:5</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">In these critical times Jehovah is examining our hearts to see if we have enough love of God and neighbor to qualify for life in his paradise new world. Under this searching inspection may each one of us be able to repeat the statement of faithful Job: “I would rescue the afflicted one crying for help, and the fatherless boy and anyone that had no helper. The blessing of the one about to perish—upon me it would come, and the heart of the widow I would make glad. Eyes I became to the blind one; and feet to the lame one I was. I was a real father to the poor ones.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962526/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Job 29:12, 13,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962526/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 15, 16</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"></p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980689/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Job 29:13</a>) He “felt” the pain experienced by widows. Rather than adding to it by a thoughtless word or deed, he acted to cheer them up inside​—in the heart. Elders of Christian congregations today can do likewise by reassuring such ones that the congregation is a warmhearted family, by really making them feel a part of it. The overseers may share a comforting scripture that shows the blessings resulting from faithfulness. “Fellow feeling” will help them to try to understand the tremendous emotional and mental pressures that plague many single parents. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980689/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:8</a>) Consequently, needy ones will feel free to come to them for help. Each of these spiritual men can truly be like “a place of concealment from the rainstorm, like streams of water in a waterless country.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980689/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Isa. 32:1, 2</a>.</p>

<strong>Consideration for Older Persons and Afflicted Ones</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The results of showing tender affection for these older persons and afflicted ones prove that such consideration has Jehovah’s blessing. One woman rises early each Sunday and drives some distance out of her way to pick up an elderly widow for a day of witnessing, meetings and material sustenance. In another congregation, when illness recently struck a middle-aged woman who lives alone with her elderly mother, members of the congregation swarmed <span id="page442" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="442" data-before-text="442"></span>to the sister’s bedside like worker bees, taking over the housecleaning, shopping and other duties. Exclaimed the grateful convalescent: “I didn’t know so many of my brothers loved me! I will never be able to do enough for Jehovah!” Consider the case of a Christian widow and her two daughters. Shortly after this family moved, the mother died. Who would look after the orphans? The overseer in their new congregation appreciated that these teen-agers needed the benefit of a Christian home and arranged to make them part of his household. In yet another instance, when an elderly faithful woman fell into dire circumstances, a family of newly dedicated Witnesses took the afflicted one into their home, where she has been lovingly cared for over a long period of time. These examples prove that James’ words are still being applied: “The form of worship that is clean and undefiled from the standpoint of our God and Father is this: to look after orphans and widows in their tribulation.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962526/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Jas. 1:27</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">When you show consideration to one of the least of Jesus’ brothers, he counts it as done to himself. Such consideration will be found among the Lord’s “other sheep” who are in line for the blessing of endless life in God’s new world.

By observing the integrity of the one in difficulty the visitor gains a valuable lesson in endurance. Elderly Christians are often rich in interesting experiences and eyewitness accounts of outstanding events in the modern history of Jehovah’s congregation. Consideration shown to afflicted ones causes them to remember you in their prayers to Jehovah. These are some of the blessings that are yours when you show kindness to those faithful ones who may be ‘poor respecting the world but rich in faith.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962526/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Jas. 2:5</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">In these critical times Jehovah is examining our hearts to see if we have enough love of God and neighbor to qualify for life in his paradise new world.

<strong>Dew</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Dew forms when night air laden with water vapor cools, depositing the vapor, condensed to liquid form, on cooler objects. It also develops when warm watery vapor rising from the ground comes in contact with the cooling air. The Bible explains that early in earth’s history, before it rained on earth, “a mist [vapor] would go up from <span id="page624" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="624" data-before-text="624"></span>the earth and it watered the entire surface of the ground.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001167/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ge 2:6</a> and ftn) Dew is also produced when moisture from vegetation evaporates into the air. A plant continues to draw water that has been absorbed by its roots until a balance is obtained between the temperature at the tip of the leaves and that at the plant’s roots. The great amount of dew thus produced by some trees can often be heard dripping from them at night. Most morning dew seems to have this source. Job said, “My root is opened for the waters, and dew itself will stay overnight upon my bough.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001167/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 29:19</a>.</p>

Well, do you remember when someone’s smile brought you a sense of relief or made you feel relaxed? Or when the absence of a smile made you feel nervous or even rejected? Yes, a smile does make a difference. It affects both the one who is smiling and the one smiled at. The Bible character Job said of his adversaries: “I would smile at them—they would not believe it—and the light of my face they would not cast down.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102000484/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 29:24</a>) “The light” of Job’s face may have denoted his brightness or cheerfulness.</p>

<strong>Light</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The Scriptures contain many figurative references to light.

Darkness is their “light,” for they are accustomed to carry out their evil deeds under its cover and this figurative “light” is taken from them by the literal light of dawn.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Job 38:12-15</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Job 24:15-17</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">As the light of the sun is clearly observable, thus Jehovah’s adverse judgments are obvious. This is alluded to at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Hosea 6:5</a>: “The judgments upon you will be as the light that goes forth.”</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The ‘light of God’s face’ means divine favor. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Ps. 44:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/57/1" data-bid="58-2" class="b"> 89:15</a>) “Lift up the light of your face upon us” is an expression meaning ‘show us favor.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/58/0" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Ps. 4:6</a>) Similarly, the favor of a ruler is referred to as “the light of the king’s face.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Prov. 16:15</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Light may denote brightness or cheerfulness, the opposite of gloom. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/60/0" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Job 30:26</a>) This may explain the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Job (29:24</a>): “The light of my face they would not cast down.” Although others were gloomy and dejected, this did not cause Job to become of like disposition.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">A bright prospect, such as salvation or deliverance, is at times referred to under the figure of light. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/62/0" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Esther 8:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/62/1" data-bid="63-2" class="b"> Ps. 97:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/62/2" data-bid="63-3" class="b"> Isa. 30:26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/62/3" data-bid="63-4" class="b"> Mic. 7:8, 9</a>) Jehovah’s causing his glory to shine forth upon Zion pointed forward to her deliverance from a captive state. As a result Zion was to become a source of enlightenment to the nations. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/63/0" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Isa. 60:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/63/1" data-bid="64-2" class="b"> 19, 20</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Revelation 21:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/64/1" data-bid="65-2" class="b"> 22:5</a>.) On the other hand, for the sun, moon and stars not to give their light would signify calamity.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/65/0" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Isa. 13:10, 11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/65/1" data-bid="66-2" class="b"> Jer. 4:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/65/2" data-bid="66-3" class="b"> Ezek. 32:7, 8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012685/65/3" data-bid="66-4" class="b"> Matt. 24:29</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"></p>

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page163" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="163" data-before-text="163"></span><strong>Earning the Respect Due You</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE lad standing upon the conductor’s podium was only ten years old, yet before him were assembled a hundred trained musicians, every one a virtuoso. Were they disgusted that the management had presumed to let a mere child conduct one of the world’s finest orchestras! They showed it by their disdainful, defiant facial expressions; some were even sucking lollipops to show their contempt.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">But not for long. Once the lad lifted his baton and began the rehearsal, it was only a matter of minutes before those instrumental virtuosi were earnestly applying themselves to the business at hand. Ignored now was his being a mere child. What had caused their disdainful disrespect to change to deferential regard, to esteem, to respect? The lad’s ability, for he truly was a prodigy. He had the entire musical score in his head. More than that, he knew what to expect from each instrumentalist, for he could detect at once whenever any one of them played a wrong note. In spite of his age, he had what it took to be a conductor. Incidentally, that was some twenty years ago. Today Maazel is still conducting.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Not only orchestra conductors, but ever so many persons in everyday life are, by reason of their positions, entitled to respect, that is, added respect, for every honest individual is entitled to a measure of respect. In particular are parents and schoolteachers, overseers and ministers—to name but a few—entitled to respect. However, while these could depend solely upon their position or office, it is far better for all concerned when they truly earn the respect due them.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">God’s Word, the Bible, throws light on this matter of earning respect, even as it does on every other aspect of life. Thus it tells us of angels not pursuing a certain course—out of respect for Jehovah God. No question about it, Jehovah, the Creator of all things seen and unseen, is entitled to the greatest respect of all his creatures.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964200/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Pet. 2:11</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In the Bible we also read of one of God’s creatures who at one time enjoyed great respect, namely, Job. As he himself tells us: “When I went forth to the gate by the town, . . . even the aged ones rose up, they stood. Princes themselves restrained words . . . The voice of the leaders themselves was hidden. . . . I was sitting as head; and I resided as a king.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964200/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 29:7-10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964200/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 25</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">And why was such great respect tendered <span id="page164" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="164" data-before-text="164"></span>Job? He himself tells us: “For I would rescue the afflicted one crying for help, and the fatherless boy and anyone that had no helper. With righteousness I clothed myself, and it was clothing me. My justice was like a . . . turban. And I would break the jawbones of the wrongdoer, and from his teeth I would tear away the prey.” More than that, Job goes on to enumerate all the selfish or wicked things he had not done. In short, as “the greatest of all the Orientals,” he “proved to be blameless and upright, and fearing God and turning aside from bad.” No question about it, Job earned the great respect that was tendered him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964200/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 29:12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964200/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964200/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964200/2/3" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 1:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964200/2/4" data-bid="3-5" class="b"> 3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964200/2/5" data-bid="3-6" class="b"> 31:5-40</a>.</p>
