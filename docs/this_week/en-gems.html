<strong>“Serve Jehovah with Rejoicing”</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">So, then, should not people of all nations exult in Jehovah? That is what the inspired psalmist encouraged, saying: “Shout in triumph to Jehovah, all you people of the earth. Serve Jehovah with rejoicing. Come in before him with a joyful cry.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979768/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 100:1, 2</a>) In agreement with this admonition, our expressions of praise should not be weak but strong and forceful, comparable to the ‘triumphant shout’ of an army that has gained a decisive victory. The position of God’s servants is not that of fearful, cringing slaves. Service to God is not burdensome and oppressive, causing one to become unduly serious and gloomy. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979768/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 John 5:3</a>) That service is refreshing, invigorating, and should rightly be accompanied by rejoicing. For this reason the psalmist urged people to come into God’s presence “with a joyful cry.”</p>

<strong>A Letter From the Governing Body</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Bible appropriately invites us: “Serve Jehovah with rejoicing. . . . Come into his gates with thanksgiving, into his courtyards with praise. Give thanks to him, bless his name. For Jehovah is good; his loving-kindness is to time indefinite, and his faithfulness to generation after generation.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/302001001/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 100:2-5</a>) Serving Jehovah with rejoicing is directly related to having a strong personal relationship with him. He makes possible such a relationship, and we are privileged to cultivate it. When we have that kind of relationship, we know that Jehovah is always available to help and strengthen us in times of need. We are confident that he will provide the spiritual strength and direction needed to meet the challenges of living in the last days of this system of things. Regardless of the pressures that we face, we are joyful in our ministry, and we thank <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>Jehovah every day because, as his Word reminds us, ‘he cares for us.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/302001001/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:7</a>.</p>

Nor have we become world famous as entertainers. Likely, we are common folk who must face the daily anxieties and hardships of life. Our experiences prove that “man, born of woman, is short-lived and glutted with agitation,” and doubtless we agree that “all creation keeps on groaning together and being in pain together.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982803/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 14:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982803/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Romans 8:22</a>) For that matter, we may well wonder whether anyone on earth can have true joy​—that “emotion of great delight or happiness caused by something good or satisfying.” What is your thought?

Indeed it was, for we are told: “I came to be the one he [Jehovah] was specially fond of day by day, I being <em>glad</em> before him all the time.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982803/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 8:22-31</a>) While on earth as a man Jesus found delight in doing God’s will.

Yes, and the afflicted man mentioned earlier indicates how in saying: “I have found it true that the greatest happiness is in serving God. This makes life genuinely rewarding and meaningful. Being a paralytic has not robbed me of the privileges and blessings of serving the Creator.” Genuine joy is found among those wholeheartedly devoted to Jehovah God. And why not? They declare “good news” from “the happy God”​—a heartening message about endless life amid grand blessings under the rule of the “kingdom of the heavens.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982803/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982803/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 1 Timothy 1:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982803/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Matthew 5:3</a>) So they have reason to “serve Jehovah with rejoicing,” to “come in before him with a joyful cry.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982803/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 100:2</a>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 7, 8.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982803/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Romans 5:12</a>) For instance, when Esau took Hittite women as wives, “they were a source of bitterness of spirit to [his God-fearing parents] Isaac and Rebekah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982803/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Genesis 26:34, 35</a>) Moreover, by outright persecution and indirect “crafty acts,” Satan the Devil endeavors to destroy the Christian’s precious relationship with Jehovah.

Yet these difficulties do not overwhelm Jehovah’s people. They draw “comfort from the Scriptures” and confidently pray for God’s spirit and aid in cultivating its fruit of joy.

<strong>“Serve Jehovah with Rejoicing”</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">So, then, should not people of all nations exult in Jehovah?

The position of God’s servants is not that of fearful, cringing slaves. Service to God is not burdensome and oppressive, causing one to become unduly serious and gloomy.

We can gain strength and encouragement by considering the situation and faith of those who served Jehovah back there. They had to maintain obedience to the Law, which held the highest standard of morality and which, by its sanitary and dietary laws, tended to keep faithful Jews from association with those not worshipers of the true God. They were surrounded by these pagan nations, which practiced every form of immorality, often in connection with their unclean idol worship. At times they were called on to fight these people who, generally, desired to destroy Israel and take their land.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Imagine the faith and courage it took to go out in battle against these nations, their soldiers being hardened warriors, while the Israelites, for the most part, spent their time in peaceful farming pursuits. Picture yourself having to go out and fight hand to hand against these mighty enemy warriors. And it was not personal strength, but faith in God that enabled Israel to win, for, when they lost faith in God, these nations were too much for them.

Boys will both tire out and grow weary, and young men themselves will without fail stumble, but those who are hoping in Jehovah will regain power. They will mount up with wings like eagles.

<strong>“Serve Jehovah with Rejoicing”</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Basic to one’s wanting to render sacred service is that Jehovah is God and man’s Maker. The psalmist declared: “Know [recognize, acknowledge] that Jehovah is God. It is he that has made us, and not we ourselves. We are his people and the sheep of his pasturage.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979768/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 100:3</a>) By reason of his being the Creator, he owns us, as a shepherd owns his sheep. Besides Jehovah’s Godship and his Creatorship, the kind of God that he is provides strong incentive for people of all nations to enter the courtyards of his sanctuary, there to offer up thanksgiving and praise. Moreover, we should bless his name, that is, speak well of the Most High, the One represented by the name. The psalmist urges: “Come into his gates with thanksgiving, into his courtyards with praise. Give thanks to him, bless his name. For Jehovah is good; his loving-kindness is to time indefinite, and his faithfulness to generation after generation.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979768/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 100:4, 5</a>.</p>

<strong>Why Should They Believe?</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The theory of evolution says that mankind is a product of the working of natural laws, but it does not explain who the “lawmaker” is. In effect, it says that we made ourselves. But is it not more logical—more according to the way we know things <em>really</em> happen—to follow the reasoning of the Bible writer who proclaimed: “In a fear-inspiring way I am wonderfully made”? And: “Know that Jehovah is God. It is he that has made us, and not we ourselves”?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101979803/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 139:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101979803/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 100:3</a>.</p>

Children can see, for example, that men build houses and women bake cakes. These things have makers. Why, then, children may understandably reason, do not beautiful flowers or bright stars have a maker? Children need to be taught the reasonable explanations in the Bible: “Of course, every house is constructed by someone, but <em>he that constructed all things is God.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973682/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Heb. 3:4</a>) They need to be shown that the Bible does not unreasonably teach that no one made us, but says: “Know that Jehovah is God.

<strong>Taking Liberties with the Truth</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">In this same magazine article, which is now being reprinted in pamphlet form, Whalen charges Jehovah’s witnesses with teaching that “Caesar is Satan.” But not so. It is one thing to say that Caesar is a part of the world whose god, according to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963361/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>, is Satan, and something entirely different to say that Caesar is Satan himself. Jehovah’s witnesses have always held that they must “pay back Caesar’s things to Caesar,” and so must be subject to Caesar so long as he does not require anything that directly conflicts with God’s law, in which case the rule applies: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men.” But as for Satan the Devil, they have always held that they must resist him at all times. Therefore, to say that Jehovah’s witnesses believe that Caesar is Satan is to prejudice the governments against Jehovah’s witnesses and obviously is taking liberties with the truth. It is of interest to note that the religious leaders in Jesus’ day took like liberties with the truth in order to prejudice the rulers <span id="page295" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="295" data-before-text="295"></span>against him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963361/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Mark 12:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963361/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Acts 5:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963361/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Luke 23:2</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>IN THE NAME OF SCIENCE</strong></p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">There is also much taking of liberties with the truth in the name of science, especially by evolutionists. Sweeping, groundless assertions are stated as facts regarding man’s origin and ascent or descent from the lower animals. A scientist who with righteous indignation comes to grips with this matter of taking liberties with the truth is Ivar Lissner, Ph.D., whose books have been published in fourteen languages. In his latest book, published in 1961, and entitled “But God Was There,”<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1963361/0">a</a> he speaks of “the ineffable stupidity of all attempts to reconstruct Neanderthal or even Peking man. Exaggeratedly hirsute [hairy] plaster figures of bestial mien glower savagely at us in museums all over the world, their features usually chocolate-brown in color, their hair wild and unkempt, their jaws prognathous [sticking forward] and their foreheads receding—and this despite the fact that we have absolutely no idea what color Paleolithic man’s skin was or how his hair grew and virtually no idea of his physiognomy” or facial features. “The American authority T. D. Stewart rightly pointed out in 1948 the impossibility of reconstructing hair, eyes, nose, lips or facial expression. ‘The probabilities are that the expression of early man was not less benign than our own,’ he wrote.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">“When a museum displays models of Peking man, Neanderthal man and modern Homo sapiens [man] side by side, it encourages a conception of physical and intellectual development which is not in accord with the views of contemporary science. Those who make such models tend to give their imagination free rein. . . . The exhibition of these half-human, half animal figures is symptomatic of the moral arrogance of our era and latently inspired by a smug feeling of ‘look how far we’ve come!’” In his book scientist Lissner shows that man at all times was far removed from the lower creation and at all times had some form of religion. In one of his closing chapters he therefore asks, “Why do we cling so stubbornly to outmoded theories? Why do we prefer to look for our origins in the animal rather than in God?” Obviously because they do not want to recognize the debt of gratitude they owe the Creator nor their need to be in subjection to him. They refuse to admit the truth that “Jehovah is God. It is he that made us, and not we ourselves.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963361/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 100:3</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The foregoing illustrations, which could be multiplied many times over, certainly do incriminate certain ones of being guilty of stretching the truth, and that from motives that are suspect. Since this is so, the principle of <em>caveat emptor,</em> “Let the buyer beware,” is one that all should keep in mind when hearing or reading anything that claims to be the truth and upon which belief or actions are to be based. As the Bible, the Word of God, says: “Make sure of all things; hold fast to what is fine.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963361/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:21</a>.</p>

This is even more true of what might be called spiritual light, light for the mind and the heart. Without this light men are blind, lost, do not know which way to go, for it simply is not in man himself to direct his own steps. Proof of this is seen in the sorry state of affairs in which men find themselves today. Look where we may, we find confusion, strife and wickedness due to selfishness and conflicting theories as to what is best for man in science and art, in religion and politics.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jer. 10:23</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Who is to blame for this sorry state of affairs? Not the Creator, for he has provided man with spiritual light, with an infallible guide, his Word, the Bible. Concerning it the one man whose life more greatly affected mankind for good than any other one that ever lived, Jesus Christ, once said, “Your word is truth.” It is, as a psalmist long ago expressed it, ‘a lamp for our feet, a light for our roadway.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 17:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ps. 119:105</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">This Word of God is known as The Book and itself consists of sixty-six books. The term “books” here is used in a special sense, since twenty-eight of these are less than six pages in length, and the five shortest average less than a page each of the ordinary Bible. The largest as well as perhaps the best known among the sixty-six books is the book of Psalms, it accounting for about 8 percent of the entire inspired Scriptures.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In the original Hebrew this book was known as <em>T<sup>e</sup>·hil·limʹ,</em> meaning “Praises.” There are 150 of these psalms, almost half of which are credited to David, the shepherd king. Written over a period of more than a thousand years, they do indeed have as their theme the praises of Jehovah God. In them their writers praise Jehovah God, call on others to praise him and give many, many reasons for doing so. Interwoven in among these many psalms is what might be termed an epitome of the Hebrew Scriptures, for in them much is found to throw light on life’s roadway in the way of Bible history, Bible prophecy, Bible doctrine and exhortation to right conduct.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>THE LIGHT OF BIBLE HISTORY</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Information concerning God’s mighty deeds and his dealings with human creatures in times past throws light on life’s roadway.

To help us understand we might ask, “Why is it so important to know and obey the laws of the government under which we live?” What would happen if we should refuse to pay our taxes or if we should steal? If we got caught we would have to pay a fine or go to jail. We could not say to the judge, “Judge, you cannot fine me; you cannot put me in jail. I did not know what the laws were.” The judge would say, “Ignorance of the law is no excuse.” The laws have been recorded in writing for all to know, to understand and to obey.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> The same is true with God’s laws. Jehovah has laid down certain requirements for man to meet. If he fails to meet them or breaks them, he surely will get caught and be punished, because Jehovah’s “eyes are roving about through all the earth,” and no lawbreaker can escape his notice. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961043/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Chron. 16:9</a>) Nor can any plead ignorance of God’s laws or requirements, because at least portions of the Bible have been published in 1,151 languages and dialects. Jehovah is also sending forth his ministers by the hundreds of thousands to help all people who will listen to understand his book of laws. There have been more copies of the Bible sold throughout the world than any other book, yet for it to be the best seller means nothing. One statement from it will tell why: “All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961043/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:16, 17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961043/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Matt. 28:19, 20</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>WHY GOD’S REQUIREMENTS NOT UNDERSTOOD</strong></p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu">7, 8.

People wonder how this could be possible with so many different religious organizations supposedly teaching and instructing from God’s Word. Many people feel that if God’s requirements are not known or understood, it is because people are not attending and supporting the churches. Yet when we consider the facts we find that Christendom, with its hundreds of sects and cults, is partly responsible for the prevailing misconceptions concerning God’s requirements.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Consider some of the requirements of the religions of this world and see if they are helping the people gain a knowledge and understanding of God. Most religious leaders contend that you must be a member of a church and contribute at least ten <span id="page43" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="43" data-before-text="43"></span>percent of your income in order to be saved. When asked which one of the many different religious sects and cults you should choose, many have answered, “It does not make any difference. All will take you to the same place, only over different roads.” This is not the understanding we get from God’s Word. Did God say there are hundreds of faiths to choose from and whichever one we select or whichever one suits our fancy will be all right with him? Read the following words of Paul: “One Lord, one faith, one baptism.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961043/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Eph. 4:5</a>) Since that narrows it down to one true form of worship and we desire to find that true faith, it will take seeking.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/1397/0">7/15/1998, p. 31</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Do You Have “an Obedient Heart”?</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The psalmist showed that even inside his house, where others did not see him, he ‘walked about in the integrity of his heart.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998528/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Psalm 101:2</a>) While sitting in your house, you may turn on the television and start watching a movie. Right there, your obedience could be tested. The movie may become immoral in content. Will you keep on watching, rationalizing that this is the type of movie being shown these days? Or will your obedient heart move you to comply with the Scriptural injunction, ‘do not let fornication and uncleanness even be mentioned among you’? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998528/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:3-5</a>) Will you turn off the TV, even if the story is intriguing? Or will you switch channels if a program becomes violent? “Jehovah himself examines the righteous one as well as the wicked one,” sang the psalmist, “and anyone loving violence His soul certainly hates.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998528/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Psalm 11:5</a>.</p>

<strong>Be Faithful to God “Who Looks On in Secret”</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> To become true Christians we had to work at overcoming serious faults and sins, even as did the early Christians. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985283/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:9-11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985283/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Acts 26:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985283/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 1 Peter 4:1-4</a>) Yet what about faults that may not be known to other humans? That these failings are not publicly known does not make them any less significant. This is indicated by David’s words: “Anyone slandering his companion in secrecy, him I silence. Anyone of haughty eyes and of arrogant heart, him I cannot endure.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985283/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 101:5</a>) Even if it was done secretly, to just one listener, slander was wrong.

<strong>Does It Matter Who Your Friends Are?</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">So, it is good to have a friendly disposition toward people in general; but if you want genuine friends you need to be selective about those you accept for close companions. David was. He says: “Anyone slandering his companion in secrecy, him I silence. Anyone of haughty eyes and of arrogant heart, him I cannot endure. . . . There will dwell inside my house no worker of trickiness. As for anyone speaking falsehoods, he will not be firmly established in front of my eyes.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973521/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 101:5-7</a>) Why is it so important for young people today to be selective as to close companions?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>WHY SELECTIVITY IS VITAL</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">It is a basic principle of social relations that you tend to become what those around you are if you associate with them long enough. There is a Spanish proverb that says: “Tell me with whom you walk and I’ll tell you who you are.” (<em>Dime con quién andas y te diré quién eres.</em>) Your <span id="page423" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="423" data-before-text="423"></span>choice of friends tells a lot about what kind of person you want to be.

<strong>Light on Life’s Roadway from the Psalms</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Wisely the Psalms show us the need to concern ourselves with the law of God, with the other parts of God’s Word as well: “Happy is the man” whose “delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.” “I shall certainly meditate on all your activity, and with your dealings I will concern myself.” “How I do love your law! <span id="page552" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="552" data-before-text="552"></span>All day long it is my concern.”—1:1, 2; 77:12; 119:97.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">While such admonition, either direct or indirect, either explicit or implied, is to be expected in the book of the Psalms, what is often overlooked is that it is also filled with wise admonition as to daily conduct. For example, time and again its writers show that they appreciate that “bad associations spoil useful habits.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:33</a>) “I have hated the congregation of evildoers, and with the wicked ones I do not sit.” “In his eyes anyone contemptible is certainly rejected.” “Anyone of haughty eyes and of arrogant heart, him I cannot endure.” “Get away from me, you evildoers, that I may observe the commandments of my God.”—26:5; 15:4; 101:5; 119:115.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">The Psalms also throw light on life’s roadway by their wise counsel as to what should be our attitude when we see the wicked prosper: “Be agitated, but do not sin. Have your say in your heart, upon your bed, and keep silent. Sacrifice the sacrifices of righteousness, and trust in Jehovah.” “Do not show yourself heated up because of the evildoers. Do not be envious of those doing unrighteousness. For evildoers themselves will be cut off, but those hoping in Jehovah are the ones that will possess the earth.”—4:4, 5; 37:1, 9.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Then again, the Psalms enlighten by showing what God approves and what he disapproves: “O Jehovah, who will be a guest in your tent? . . . He who is walking faultlessly and practicing righteousness and speaking the truth in his heart. He has not slandered with his tongue. To his companion he has done nothing bad, and no reproach has he taken up against his intimate acquaintance. . . . A bribe against the innocent one he has not taken.” (15:1-3, 5) “Safeguard your tongue against what is bad, and your lips against speaking deception. Turn away from what is bad, and do what is good; seek to find peace, and pursue it.” “Lovers of Jehovah, hate what is bad.”—34:13, 14; 97:10.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">We have further light on our roadway by the very things the psalmist prays for: “Mistakes—who can discern? From concealed sins pronounce me innocent. Also from presumptuous acts hold your servant back; do not let them dominate me. In that case I shall be complete, and I shall have remained innocent from much transgression. Let the sayings of my mouth and the meditation of my heart become pleasurable before you, O Jehovah.” (19:12-14) “O Jehovah, my heart has not been haughty, nor have my eyes been lofty.” “Do set a guard, O Jehovah, for my mouth; do set a watch over the door of my lips. Should the righteous one strike me, it would be a loving-kindness; and should he reprove me, it would be oil upon the head, which my head would not want to refuse.”—131:1; 141:3, 5.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">Truly, today there is need of light, spiritual light for guidance on life’s roadway. Such light certainly is to be found in the book of Psalms, along with other books of the Bible, for the Psalms contain much history, many prophecies, right doctrine and an abundance of fine admonition in addition to its many songs of praise to and expressions of trust in Jehovah God. “Make melody to God, make melody. Make melody to our King, make melody. For God is King of all the earth; make melody, <em>acting with discretion.”</em>—47:6, 7.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Helpers Toward Walking Wisely</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> Di·otʹre·phes was chattering or gossiping about the apostle John behind his back, but he was doing so “with wicked words.” He was thus slandering John. For this reason he deserved apostolic taking in hand. Hence John said that, should he himself come to that congregation, he would call to remembrance the works that Di·otʹre·phes was doing, which would be accompanied by appropriate action against Di·otʹre·phes. This wicked chatterer had no right or authority to do some excommunicating on his own account, throwing hospitable brothers out of the congregation. In speaking about the apostle John slanderously, Di·otʹre·phes was “disregarding lordship and speaking abusively <span id="page178" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="178" data-before-text="178"></span>of glorious ones.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959203/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Jude 8</a>) Di·otʹre·phes himself deserved to be thrown out.</p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">22.

He asked Eve a leading question for information, and then made this comment upon her answer: “You positively will not die. For God knows that in the very day of your eating from it your eyes are bound to be opened and you are bound to be like God, knowing good and bad.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959203/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Gen. 3:4, 5</a>) That devilish statement was not gossip. It was what Jesus pronounced it to be—slander, a lie, maliciously designed to hurt the reputation or name of Jehovah God and induce rebellion against Him and cause distrust and disunity within His organization. Said Jesus to those who copied Satan the Devil: “You are from your father the Devil and you wish to do the desires of your father. That one was a manslayer when he began, and he did not stand fast in the truth, because truth is not in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks according to his own disposition, because he is a liar and the father of the lie.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959203/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">John 8:44</a>) Let us make no mistake about it: it was slander, not gossip, for which that unfaithful one was called Devil (<em>Diábolos</em>), meaning “Slanderer.” It was a malicious lie against Jehovah God that killed God’s reputation with Eve and that betrayed the fact that this spirit son had rebelled against the Sovereign of the universe and should be disfellowshiped from Jehovah’s holy universal organization, thus being disowned as a son of God.</p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">23.

Let them first determine the nature or quality of the gossip. If it is light, inconsequential newsmongering, with personalities involved, there is no ground Scripturally for disfellowshiping and thereby showing oppressiveness. But if it amounts to slander with the malicious design to injure the reputation and standing of another, then it is time to take the matter under advisement and determine whether disfellowshiping the apparent slanderer is right and Scriptural and is for the protection of the congregation. Two or more witnesses will be needed to establish the fact of slander and to protect the service committee.</p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">24. In being careful as to the matter of disfellowshiping, how should the committee be like Jeremiah?</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> A service committee should not use its power of disfellowshiping dangerously. It should veer away from bringing itself under condemnation in this matter. Said King David prophetically: “Anyone slandering his companion in secrecy, him I silence. . . . Every morning I shall silence all the wicked ones of the earth, to cut off from the city of Jehovah all the practicers of what is hurtful.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959203/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ps. 101:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959203/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 8</a>) For our guidance with respect to slanderers it is written: “He that is going about as a slanderer is uncovering confidential talk; and with one that is enticed [or, possibly, that is wide open] with his lips you must have no fellowship.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959203/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Prov. 20:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959203/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 11:13</a>) A service committee has to draw a sharp distinction between mere gossip and slander. In this regard they should be like a metal tester, as Jeremiah the prophet was: “You will take note and you must examine their way. All of them are the most stubborn men, walking about as slanderers—copper and iron. They are all of them ruinous. . . . Rejected silver is what people will certainly call them, for Jehovah has rejected them.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959203/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Jer. 6:27-30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959203/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 9:4-8</a>.</p><p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu">25.

But it is not Scripturally authorized to disfellowship for mere gossip that is light, trivial, superficial, motivated by human interest, but not malicious, not bringing false accusation.</p>

<strong>Faithfulness—A Way of Life</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> The responsibility and administrative duties of a steward suitably illustrate the ministry of a Christian overseer. Faithfulness is strictly required of them, as emphasized by what the apostle Paul wrote to the Corinthians, when he said: “What is looked for in stewards is for a man to be found faithful.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974645/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Cor. 4:2</a>) This same apostle wrote to Titus, saying: “For an overseer must be free from accusation as God’s steward . . . hospitable, a lover of goodness, sound in mind, righteous, loyal, self-controlled.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974645/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Titus 1:7, 8</a>) It follows, then, that any ability a steward may have, natural or acquired, if it is to be of real value to God, must be coupled with the sterling quality of faithfulness. Even David, who pictured Christ Jesus, said: “My eyes are upon the faithful ones of the earth, that they may dwell with me. The one walking in a faultless way, he it is who will minister to me.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974645/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 101:6</a>.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">20. Why is faithfulness, and not ability, the thing Jehovah is looking for among those he approves?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> Ability is something that one can receive from Jehovah as a gift. In Exodus, for example, we read how Jehovah gave wisdom, understanding and knowledge to certain ones who worked in building the beautiful tabernacle there in the wilderness. (See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974645/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Exodus 35:30–36:1</a>.) But when it comes to faithfulness, this is not something that God gives a person. Nor is it something that is inherited or that is automatically received at baptism. It must be worked at, developed. It takes time, effort, endurance to build up a record testifying <span id="page532" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="532" data-before-text="532"></span>to one’s way of life. It is up to the worshiper himself to display it as he does his work, carrying out his stewardship in faithfulness.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974645/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:10</a>.</p>

<strong>Helpers Toward Walking Wisely</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> Di·otʹre·phes was chattering or gossiping about the apostle John behind his back, but he was doing so “with wicked words.” He was thus slandering John. For this reason he deserved apostolic taking in hand. Hence John said that, should he himself come to that congregation, he would call to remembrance the works that Di·otʹre·phes was doing, which would be accompanied by appropriate action against Di·otʹre·phes. This wicked chatterer had no right or authority to do some excommunicating on his own account, throwing hospitable brothers out of the congregation. In speaking about the apostle John slanderously, Di·otʹre·phes was “disregarding lordship and speaking abusively <span id="page178" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="178" data-before-text="178"></span>of glorious ones.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959203/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Jude 8</a>) Di·otʹre·phes himself deserved to be thrown out.</p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">22. Was it mere gossip of which Satan the Devil was guilty in Eden, and why was he called Devil?</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> Remember, it was not mere gossip of which Satan the Devil was guilty in the garden of Eden. He asked Eve a leading question for information, and then made this comment upon her answer: “You positively will not die. For God knows that in the very day of your eating from it your eyes are bound to be opened and you are bound to be like God, knowing good and bad.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959203/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Gen. 3:4, 5</a>) That devilish statement was not gossip. It was what Jesus pronounced it to be—slander, a lie, maliciously designed to hurt the reputation or name of Jehovah God and induce rebellion against Him and cause distrust and disunity within His organization. Said Jesus to those who copied Satan the Devil: “You are from your father the Devil and you wish to do the desires of your father. That one was a manslayer when he began, and he did not stand fast in the truth, because truth is not in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks according to his own disposition, because he is a liar and the father of the lie.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959203/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">John 8:44</a>) Let us make no mistake about it: it was slander, not gossip, for which that unfaithful one was called Devil (<em>Diábolos</em>), meaning “Slanderer.” It was a malicious lie against Jehovah God that killed God’s reputation with Eve and that betrayed the fact that this spirit son had rebelled against the Sovereign of the universe and should be disfellowshiped from Jehovah’s holy universal organization, thus being disowned as a son of God.</p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">23.

Let them first determine the nature or quality of the gossip. If it is light, inconsequential newsmongering, with personalities involved, there is no ground Scripturally for disfellowshiping and thereby showing oppressiveness. But if it amounts to slander with the malicious design to injure the reputation and standing of another, then it is time to take the matter under advisement and determine whether disfellowshiping the apparent slanderer is right and Scriptural and is for the protection of the congregation. Two or more witnesses will be needed to establish the fact of slander and to protect the service committee.</p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">24. In being careful as to the matter of disfellowshiping, how should the committee be like Jeremiah?</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> A service committee should not use its power of disfellowshiping dangerously. It should veer away from bringing itself under condemnation in this matter. Said King David prophetically: “Anyone slandering his companion in secrecy, him I silence. . . . Every morning I shall silence all the wicked ones of the earth, to cut off from the city of Jehovah all the practicers of what is hurtful.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959203/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ps. 101:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959203/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 8</a>) For our guidance with respect to slanderers it is written: “He that is going about as a slanderer is uncovering confidential talk; and with one that is enticed [or, possibly, that is wide open] with his lips you must have no fellowship.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959203/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Prov. 20:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959203/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 11:13</a>) A service committee has to draw a sharp distinction between mere gossip and slander. In this regard they should be like a metal tester, as Jeremiah the prophet was: “You will take note and you must examine their way. All of them are the most stubborn men, walking about as slanderers—copper and iron. They are all of them ruinous. . . . Rejected silver is what people will certainly call them, for Jehovah has rejected them.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959203/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Jer. 6:27-30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959203/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 9:4-8</a>.</p><p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu">25.

But it is not Scripturally authorized to disfellowship for mere gossip that is light, trivial, superficial, motivated by human interest, but not malicious, not bringing false accusation.</p>

<strong>Owl</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Also included among the ‘unclean’ birds is the Hebrew <em>kohs,</em> rendered by some as the “little owl” and designated as <em>Athene noctua.</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003352/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">De 14:16</a>, <em>KJ, NW, RS;</em> see also <em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros,</em> by L. Koehler and W. Baumgartner, Leiden, 1958, p. 428) The little owl, about 25 cm (10 in.) in length, is one of the most widely distributed owls in Palestine, found in thickets, olive groves, and desolate ruins. The psalmist in his lonely affliction felt like “a little owl of desolated places.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003352/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps 102:6</a>) Appropriately, the Arabic name for this variety of owl means the “mother of ruins.”</p>

<strong>Pelican</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">When the pelican is gorged with food, it often flies away to a lonely place, where it takes a melancholy posture, with its head sunk on its shoulders, so motionless that it might be mistaken from a distance for a white stone. The bird assumes this attitude for hours at a time, thus befitting the melancholy inactivity to which the psalmist refers when he illustrates the poignancy of his grief by writing: “I do resemble the pelican of the wilderness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003425/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps 102:6</a>) Here “wilderness” does not necessarily connote a desert, but simply an area away from human habitations, perhaps a swamp. During certain seasons, swamps in the northern Jordan Valley are still the home of pelicans. Three varieties of pelicans are found in Israel. The most common is the eastern white pelican (<em>Pelecanus onocrotalus</em>); the Dalmatian pelican (<em>Pelecanus crispus</em>) and the pink-backed pelican (<em>Pelecanus rufescens</em>) are seen less often.</p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">It is not essential, however, that the <em>qippôd</em> be able to climb to the top of standing columns, since the allusion is rather to the fallen pillars of Nineveh’s palaces, not the capitals of standing columns. <em>The New World Translation</em> renders Zephaniah’s prophecy: “He will make Nineveh a desolate waste, a waterless region like the wilderness. And in the midst of her, droves will certainly lie stretched out, all the wild animals of a nation. Both pelican and porcupine will spend the night right among her pillar capitals. A voice will keep singing in the window. There will be devastation at the threshold.” The thought is that wild creatures would make their home among the fallen pillar capitals of Nineveh, which porcupines might easily do, since they often make their home between rocks. As to the third point, the <em>King James Version</em> says “their voice shall sing in the windows,” but the word “their” is not in the original Hebrew; so the <em>New World Translation</em> <span id="page384" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="384" data-before-text="384"></span>says: “A voice will keep singing in the window,” which could be a reference to any bird that would perch in the deserted window or to the sound of wind. The “voice” does not refer back to the pelican or the porcupine, neither of which can be said to have “singing” voices.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The bittern also does not have a singing voice but a booming cry, and this wading bird is not likely to fit in with Nineveh’s foretold “waterless region like the wilderness.” The porcupine and the pelican, however, would fit in here. The pelican, though being a flying water fowl, is also a bird of the wilderness, as the psalmist wrote: “I do resemble the pelican of the wilderness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964447/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 102:6</a>) The pelican, an unclean bird according to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964447/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Leviticus 11:18</a>, not infrequently retires inland to a wilderness spot and sits in a melancholy attitude, its head sunk on its shoulder and its bill resting on its breast. The pelican also selects desert islands and rocky shores remote from the haunts of men as breeding places. The intent of the prophecy is that Nineveh would become utterly desolate. New York, London and Paris would need to become utterly desolate before the pelican and the porcupine could be at home in the midst of these places.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">So for both the wilderness of Nineveh and the ruins of Babylon, the porcupine would be a fitting denizen. Indeed, <em>The Imperial Bible Dictionary</em> says of the porcupine: “It is abundant throughout Palestine, Syria, and the Euphrates valley. It is a nocturnal animal, and therefore fit to associate with the ‘doleful creatures’ which are the companions of the <em>kippod.</em> It habitually conceals itself in dark and lonely places, and, as a matter of fact, is found in the ruins of Idumea [<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964447/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isa. 34:11</a>] and of Babylon. Mr. Rich [a former British resident of Baghdad] expressly says in his attempts to explore the burned mounds of ancient Babylon, which are full of passages and galleries, ‘I found <em>quantities</em> of porcupine quills.’”</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Porcupines, the inhabitants of Babylon’s ruined palaces—how fitting! What a terrible end for so great a city! By reason of its habits and its quill-bristling armament the creeping porcupine is a fitting creature to express what has befallen Babylon, as well as Nineveh, in harmony with Jehovah’s prophetic Word—absence of man, utter desolation.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"></p>

Ask God to hear your prayer not only so that you may experience some relief from your distress but also “so that the name of Jehovah will be declared.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2014204/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Ps. 102:20, 21</a>.</p>

He has brought us to his holy city, the modern counterpart of ancient Zion or Jerusalem, his established kingdom under Christ. To us former prisoners he has given religious freedom with a view to our using our liberty aright, in harmony with his expressed will. Ancient Israel, in being freed from ancient Babylon, was a historical illustration of this; and the prophecy that once applied to that ancient illustration now applies to the modern thing that was illustrated. “This is written for the future generation; and the people that is to be created will praise Jah. For he has looked down from his holy height, from the very heavens Jehovah himself has looked even at the earth, to hear the sighing of the prisoner, to loosen those appointed to death [by the enemy Babylon], for the name of Jehovah to be declared in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem, when the peoples are collected all together, and the kingdoms, to serve Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960924/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ps. 102:18-22</a>) Political Zionism as expressed in the Republic of Israel is not fulfilling this prophecy, for it does not bear Jehovah’s name; it does not declare his name in either the old or the modern city of Jerusalem, nor does it praise and serve him.

That the physical heavens are dependent on God’s will and sustaining power is indicated at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/124/0" data-bid="125-1" class="b">Psalm 148</a>, where, after referring to sun, moon, and stars, along with other parts of God’s creation, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/125/0" data-bid="126-1" class="b">verse 6</a> states that God “keeps them standing forever, to time indefinite.

This is because God’s only-begotten Son was God’s personal Agent employed in creating the physical universe. Paul contrasts the Son’s permanence with that of the physical creation, which God, if he so designed, could ‘wrap up just as a cloak’ and set aside.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/127/0" data-bid="128-1" class="b">Heb 1:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/127/1" data-bid="128-2" class="b"> 8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/127/2" data-bid="128-3" class="b"> 10-12</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/128/0" data-bid="129-1" class="b">1Pe 2:3</a>, ftn.</p>

<strong>Who Made the Laws That Govern Our Universe?</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>3. Eternal or Subject to Decay?</strong></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Aristotle believed that there was an enormous distinction between the heavens and the earth. The earth, he said, is subject to change, decay, and deterioration, whereas the ether of which the starry heavens are made is utterly changeless, eternal. Aristotle’s crystalline spheres and the heavenly bodies attached to them could never change, wear out, or die.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Is that what the Bible teaches? <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011489/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 102:25-27</a> reads: “Long ago you laid the foundations of the earth itself, and the heavens are the work of your hands. They themselves will perish, but you yourself will keep standing; and just like a garment they will all of them wear out. Just like clothing you will replace them, and they will finish their turn. But you are the same, and your own years will not be completed.”</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Note that this psalmist, writing perhaps two centuries before Aristotle’s time, does not contrast the earth with the starry heavens, as if the earth is subject to decay while the stars are eternal. Rather, he sets both heaven <em>and</em> earth in contrast with God, the mighty Spirit who directed their creation.<a id="footnotesource4" data-fnid="4" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2011489/3">d</a> This psalm suggests that the stars are as subject to decay as anything on the earth.

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Jehovah’s eternal existence stands in stark contrast to the brevity of the psalmist’s own life. “Your years are throughout all generations,” he says to Jehovah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006009/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 102:24</a>) The psalmist next states: “Long ago you laid the foundations of the earth itself, and the heavens are the work of your hands.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006009/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 102:25</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Yet, even the great age of the earth and the heavens cannot be compared with Jehovah’s eternal existence. The psalmist adds: “They [earth and heavens] themselves will perish, but you yourself will keep standing.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006009/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 102:26</a>) The physical earth and heavens are perishable. True, Jehovah stated elsewhere that they will last forever. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006009/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 119:90;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006009/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Ecclesiastes 1:4</a>) But they <em>could be</em> destroyed if this was God’s purpose. In contrast, God cannot die. The physical creations keep “standing forever” only because God maintains them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006009/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 148:6</a>) If Jehovah ever stops renewing the physical creations, then “just like a garment they will all of them wear out.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006009/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 102:26</a>) As a man outlives his clothes, so Jehovah could outlive his creation​—if he chose to do so. However, we know from other scriptures that such is not his will. God’s Word assures us that Jehovah has determined that the literal earth and heavens will remain forever.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006009/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 104:5</a>.</p>

Because the Son is the one <em>through whom</em> God performed the creative works there described by the psalmist.

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>● Why is it that</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 102:25, 26 and</strong></a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> <strong>Hebrews 1:10, 11</strong></a> <strong>speak of the heavens and the earth as ‘perishing’ and as ‘being replaced like a worn-out garment’?​—Hawaii.</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In answering this question, some persons may point to the fact that the terms “heavens” and “earth” are not always applied to the literal heavens and earth. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 96:1</a>, for example, the “earth” is encouraged to sing a “new song.” Obviously in this case the people of the earth are meant. The Bible also speaks of “wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Eph. 6:12</a>) This would suggest that such wicked spirit forces constitute a ‘heaven’ over the wicked human society. In fact, the Devil is referred to as the “god of this system of things.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:4</a>) On this basis, some might conclude that the heavens and the earth mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 102:25, 26</a> (quoted at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:10, 11</a>) refer to the wicked heavens composed of Satan and his demons and which control the earth made up of mankind alienated from God. But does the passage itself allow for this application?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 102:25, 26</a> reads: “Long ago you [God] laid the foundations of the earth itself, and the heavens are the work of your hands. They themselves will perish, but you yourself will keep standing; and just like a garment they will all of them wear out. Just like clothing you will replace them, and they will finish their turn.” This gives rise to the question, How could God possibly be the Creator of wicked heavens and a wicked earth?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Well, it might be argued that God did create the spirit creatures who rebelled and eventually became a wicked heavens over mankind, and that God created Adam and Eve, from whom all persons alienated from God have descended. However, it should be noted that neither the passage itself nor the context readily lead to this conclusion. Then, too, there are no other scriptures that speak of Jehovah’s laying the foundation for a wicked human society or creating wicked heavens. Reasonably, therefore, we should look for an explanation that more naturally and logically fits the context.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">As revealed in the <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">superscription of Psalm 102</a>, this psalm is “a prayer of the afflicted in case he grows feeble and pours out his concern before Jehovah himself.” Such an afflicted one could logically think about the everlastingness <span id="page480" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="480" data-before-text="480"></span>of Jehovah in relationship to the physical heavens and earth. Yes, the physical creation of heavens and earth is perishable. It <em>could</em> be destroyed, if such were God’s purpose. Unlike God’s eternal existence, the permanence of any part of his physical creation is not independent. As seen in the earth, the physical creation must undergo a continual renewing process if it is to endure or retain its existing form. That the physical heavens are dependent on God’s will and sustaining power is indicated at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 148</a>. After referring to sun, moon and stars as well as other parts of God’s creation, this <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 148 (verse 6</a>) states that God <em>“keeps</em> them standing forever, to time indefinite. A regulation he has given, and it will not pass away.”</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:10, 11</a> the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Psalm 102:25, 26</a> are applied to Jesus Christ. He, too, could be said to have ‘laid the foundations of the earth’ and produced the heavens as ‘the work of his hands’ because God’s only-begotten Son was God’s personal Agent employed in creating the physical universe. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">John 1:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Col. 1:15, 16</a>) In highlighting the greatness of the Son of God, who now enjoys incorruptibility, an “indestructible life” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Heb. 7:15, 16</a>), the writer of the letter to the Hebrews contrasts the Son’s permanence with that of the physical creation, which God, <em>if he so designed,</em> could ‘wrap up just as a cloak’ and set it aside.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Heb. 1:12</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Accordingly, greater permanence is ascribed to Jehovah God (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 102:25, 26</a>) and to his glorified Son Jesus Christ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Heb. 1:10, 11</a>) than to the physical creation, which is corruptible and could perish. Other scriptures also support this conclusion. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Luke 21:33</a>, for example, Jesus said that “heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away.” Jesus here contrasted the stability and eternal truthfulness of his words as compared with the perishable nature of the physical heavens and earth. Not that God purposes to destroy them, but that they are destructible. So, the sense of this expression seems to be like that of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Matthew 5:18</a>: “Truly I say to you that <em>sooner would</em> heaven and earth pass away [or, “it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away,” <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Luke 16:17</a>] than for one smallest letter or one particle of a letter to pass away from the Law by any means and not all things take place.”</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Since Jehovah God and his Son possess greater permanence than the physical heavens and earth, this gives us full assurance that Jesus is always alive to plead for afflicted ones and God is always alive to hear and answer such pleas. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Hebrews 7:25</a>.) This knowledge should encourage us to trust completely in every promise of God, with full assurance that it will be fulfilled, no matter what may appear to stand in the way.</p>

The physical heavens also praise their Creator, in the same way that a beautifully designed product brings praise to the craftsman producing it.

As the article on ELIJAH shows, Elijah did not die at the time of such ascension, but continued to live for a number of years after his heavenly transportation away from his successor Elisha. Nor did Elijah upon death ascend to the spiritual heavens, since Jesus, while on earth, clearly stated that “no man has ascended into heaven.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/141/0" data-bid="142-1" class="b">John 3:13</a>) At Pentecost Peter likewise said of David that he “did not ascend to the heavens.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/142/0" data-bid="143-1" class="b">Acts 2:34</a>) In reality, there is nothing in the Scriptures to show that a heavenly hope was held out to God’s servants prior to the coming of Christ Jesus.

<strong>Outdated or Ahead of Its Time?</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="su"><strong>Are the physical heavens subject to decay?</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Greek scientist Aristotle, of the fourth century B.C.E., taught that decay happens only on the earth, while the starry heavens could never change or decay. That view prevailed for many centuries. But in the 19th century, scientists formulated the concept of entropy. It suggests that all matter, whether heavenly or earthly, tends to decay. One of the scientists who helped to advance this concept, Lord Kelvin, noted that the Bible says about heaven and earth: “Just like a garment they will all wear out.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018029/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 102:25, 26</a>) Kelvin believed, as the Bible teaches, that God could choose to prevent such decay from destroying His creations.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018029/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 1:4</a>.</p>

<strong>Heaven</strong><br/><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">That the physical heavens are permanent is shown by the fact that they are used in similes relating to things that are everlasting, such as the peaceful, righteous results of the Davidic kingdom inherited by God’s Son. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/117/0" data-bid="118-1" class="b">Ps 72:5-7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/117/1" data-bid="118-2" class="b"> Lu 1:32, 33</a>) Thus, texts such as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/118/0" data-bid="119-1" class="b">Psalm 102:25, 26</a> that speak of the heavens as ‘perishing’ and as ‘being replaced like a worn-out garment’ are not to be understood in a literal sense.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/119/0" data-bid="120-1" class="b">Luke 21:33</a>, Jesus says that “heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away.” Other scriptures show that “heaven and earth” will endure forever.

Unlike God’s eternal existence, the permanence of any part of his physical creation is not independent. As seen in the earth, the physical creation must undergo a continual renewing process if it is to endure or retain its existing form. That the physical heavens are dependent on God’s will and sustaining power is indicated at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/124/0" data-bid="125-1" class="b">Psalm 148</a>, where, after referring to sun, moon, and stars, along with other parts of God’s creation, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/125/0" data-bid="126-1" class="b">verse 6</a> states that God “keeps them standing forever, to time indefinite.

This is because God’s only-begotten Son was God’s personal Agent employed in creating the physical universe. Paul contrasts the Son’s permanence with that of the physical creation, which God, if he so designed, could ‘wrap up just as a cloak’ and set aside.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/127/0" data-bid="128-1" class="b">Heb 1:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/127/1" data-bid="128-2" class="b"> 8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/127/2" data-bid="128-3" class="b"> 10-12</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/128/0" data-bid="129-1" class="b">1Pe 2:3</a>, ftn.</p>

<strong>Who Made the Laws That Govern Our Universe?</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>3. Eternal or Subject to Decay?</strong></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Aristotle believed that there was an enormous distinction between the heavens and the earth. The earth, he said, is subject to change, decay, and deterioration, whereas the ether of which the starry heavens are made is utterly changeless, eternal. Aristotle’s crystalline spheres and the heavenly bodies attached to them could never change, wear out, or die.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Is that what the Bible teaches? <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011489/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 102:25-27</a> reads: “Long ago you laid the foundations of the earth itself, and the heavens are the work of your hands. They themselves will perish, but you yourself will keep standing; and just like a garment they will all of them wear out. Just like clothing you will replace them, and they will finish their turn. But you are the same, and your own years will not be completed.”</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Note that this psalmist, writing perhaps two centuries before Aristotle’s time, does not contrast the earth with the starry heavens, as if the earth is subject to decay while the stars are eternal. Rather, he sets both heaven <em>and</em> earth in contrast with God, the mighty Spirit who directed their creation.<a id="footnotesource4" data-fnid="4" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2011489/3">d</a> This psalm suggests that the stars are as subject to decay as anything on the earth. And what has modern science found?</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">The science of geology supports both the Bible and Aristotle in saying that the earth is subject to decay. In fact, the rocks of our earth are ever wearing down through erosion and being replenished through volcanic and other geologic activity.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">What, though, about the stars? Are they naturally subject to decay, as the Bible suggests, or are they inherently eternal, as Aristotle taught? European astronomers began to doubt Aristotle’s notion of eternal stars in the 16th century C.E. when, for the first time, they observed a supernova, the spectacular explosion of a star. Scientists have since observed that stars may die violently in such <span id="page28" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>explosions or burn out slowly or even collapse on themselves. However, astronomers have also observed new stars forming in ‘stellar nurseries,’ clouds of gas enriched by the explosions of old stars. Hence, the Bible writer’s image of clothing wearing out and being replaced is entirely appropriate.<a id="footnotesource5" data-fnid="5" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2011489/4">e</a> How remarkable that this psalmist of ancient times managed to write words that harmonize so well with modern-day discoveries!</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Still, you might wonder: ‘Does the Bible teach that the earth or the starry heavens as a whole will one day come to an end or need replacing?’ No, the Bible promises that they will last forever. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011489/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 104:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011489/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 119:90</a>) But that is not because such creations are eternal in themselves; rather, the God who created them promises to sustain them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011489/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 148:4-6</a>) He does not say how, but does it not stand to reason that the One who created the universe would have the power to sustain it? In a similar way, a master builder might lovingly maintain a house he built for himself and his family.</p>

<strong>Will Our Earth Ever Be Destroyed?</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Long before scientists recognized the “tendency toward disorder” in all physical things, a Bible psalmist wrote: “You [that is, God] laid the foundations of the earth itself, and <span id="page12" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>the heavens are the work of your hands. They themselves will perish, but you yourself will keep standing; and just like a garment they will all of them wear out. Just like clothing you will replace them, and they will finish their turn. But you are the same, and your own years will not be completed.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008245/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 102:25-27</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">In recording these words, the psalmist was not contradicting God’s everlasting purpose for the earth. Rather, he was contrasting God’s eternal existence with the perishability of all the matter that God had created. Without God’s eternal renewing power, the universe​—including the solar system that we depend on for stability, light, and energy—​would descend into total disorder and ultimate destruction. Thus, <em>if left to itself,</em> our earth would “wear out,” or come to a permanent end.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>● Why is it that</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 102:25, 26 and</strong></a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> <strong>Hebrews 1:10, 11</strong></a> <strong>speak of the heavens and the earth as ‘perishing’ and as ‘being replaced like a worn-out garment’?​—Hawaii.</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In answering this question, some persons may point to the fact that the terms “heavens” and “earth” are not always applied to the literal heavens and earth. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 96:1</a>, for example, the “earth” is encouraged to sing a “new song.” Obviously in this case the people of the earth are meant. The Bible also speaks of “wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Eph. 6:12</a>) This would suggest that such wicked spirit forces constitute a ‘heaven’ over the wicked human society. In fact, the Devil is referred to as the “god of this system of things.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:4</a>) On this basis, some might conclude that the heavens and the earth mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 102:25, 26</a> (quoted at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:10, 11</a>) refer to the wicked heavens composed of Satan and his demons and which control the earth made up of mankind alienated from God. But does the passage itself allow for this application?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 102:25, 26</a> reads: “Long ago you [God] laid the foundations of the earth itself, and the heavens are the work of your hands. They themselves will perish, but you yourself will keep standing; and just like a garment they will all of them wear out. Just like clothing you will replace them, and they will finish their turn.” This gives rise to the question, How could God possibly be the Creator of wicked heavens and a wicked earth?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Well, it might be argued that God did create the spirit creatures who rebelled and eventually became a wicked heavens over mankind, and that God created Adam and Eve, from whom all persons alienated from God have descended. However, it should be noted that neither the passage itself nor the context readily lead to this conclusion. Then, too, there are no other scriptures that speak of Jehovah’s laying the foundation for a wicked human society or creating wicked heavens. Reasonably, therefore, we should look for an explanation that more naturally and logically fits the context.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">As revealed in the <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">superscription of Psalm 102</a>, this psalm is “a prayer of the afflicted in case he grows feeble and pours out his concern before Jehovah himself.” Such an afflicted one could logically think about the everlastingness <span id="page480" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="480" data-before-text="480"></span>of Jehovah in relationship to the physical heavens and earth. Yes, the physical creation of heavens and earth is perishable. It <em>could</em> be destroyed, if such were God’s purpose. Unlike God’s eternal existence, the permanence of any part of his physical creation is not independent. As seen in the earth, the physical creation must undergo a continual renewing process if it is to endure or retain its existing form. That the physical heavens are dependent on God’s will and sustaining power is indicated at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 148</a>. After referring to sun, moon and stars as well as other parts of God’s creation, this <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 148 (verse 6</a>) states that God <em>“keeps</em> them standing forever, to time indefinite. A regulation he has given, and it will not pass away.”</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:10, 11</a> the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Psalm 102:25, 26</a> are applied to Jesus Christ. He, too, could be said to have ‘laid the foundations of the earth’ and produced the heavens as ‘the work of his hands’ because God’s only-begotten Son was God’s personal Agent employed in creating the physical universe. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">John 1:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Col. 1:15, 16</a>) In highlighting the greatness of the Son of God, who now enjoys incorruptibility, an “indestructible life” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Heb. 7:15, 16</a>), the writer of the letter to the Hebrews contrasts the Son’s permanence with that of the physical creation, which God, <em>if he so designed,</em> could ‘wrap up just as a cloak’ and set it aside.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Heb. 1:12</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Accordingly, greater permanence is ascribed to Jehovah God (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 102:25, 26</a>) and to his glorified Son Jesus Christ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Heb. 1:10, 11</a>) than to the physical creation, which is corruptible and could perish. Other scriptures also support this conclusion. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Luke 21:33</a>, for example, Jesus said that “heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away.” Jesus here contrasted the stability and eternal truthfulness of his words as compared with the perishable nature of the physical heavens and earth. Not that God purposes to destroy them, but that they are destructible. So, the sense of this expression seems to be like that of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Matthew 5:18</a>: “Truly I say to you that <em>sooner would</em> heaven and earth pass away [or, “it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away,” <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Luke 16:17</a>] than for one smallest letter or one particle of a letter to pass away from the Law by any means and not all things take place.”</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Since Jehovah God and his Son possess greater permanence than the physical heavens and earth, this gives us full assurance that Jesus is always alive to plead for afflicted ones and God is always alive to hear and answer such pleas. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Hebrews 7:25</a>.) This knowledge should encourage us to trust completely in every promise of God, with full assurance that it will be fulfilled, no matter what may appear to stand in the way.</p>

<strong>Heaven</strong><br/><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">Peter’s quotation, however, shows that a future fulfillment was to be anticipated, on the basis of God’s promise.

Since this vision is initially stated to be of “a new heaven and a new earth” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/86/0" data-bid="87-1" class="b">Rev. 21:1</a>), it follows that both are represented in what is thereafter described. Hence the “new heaven” must correspond to Christ together with his “bride,” the “New Jerusalem,” and the “new earth” is seen in the ‘peoples of mankind’ who are their subjects and who receive the blessings of their rule, as depicted in verses 3 and 4.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="ss"><strong><em>Passing away of the former heaven and the former earth</em></strong></p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">John’s vision refers to the passing away of the “former heaven and the former earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/87/0" data-bid="88-1" class="b">Rev. 21:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/87/1" data-bid="88-2" class="b"> compare 20:11</a>.) In the Christian Greek Scriptures the superior ruling power over human society that is destined to pass away is shown to be Satanic and demonic. Earthly governments and their peoples are shown to be subject to such Satanic rule. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/88/0" data-bid="89-1" class="b">Matt. 4:8, 9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/88/1" data-bid="89-2" class="b"> John 12:31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/88/2" data-bid="89-3" class="b"> 2 Cor. 4:3, 4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/88/3" data-bid="89-4" class="b"> Rev. 12:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/88/4" data-bid="89-5" class="b"> 16:13, 14</a>) The apostle Paul referred to the “wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places,” with their governments, authorities and world rulers.

Jehovah is said to have “thrown down from heaven to earth the beauty of Israel” at the time of its desolation. That beauty included its kingdom and princely rulers and their power, and such beauty was devoured as by fire. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/94/0" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Lam. 2:1-3</a>) But Israel’s conqueror, Babylon, later experienced an agitation of her own “heaven” and a rocking of her “earth” when the Medes and Persians overthrew Babylon and her heavenly gods proved false and unable to save her from the loss of her dominion over the land.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/95/0" data-bid="96-1" class="b">Isa. 13:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/95/1" data-bid="96-2" class="b"> 10-13</a>.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">Similarly, it was prophesied that the heaven-high position of Edom would not save her from destruction and Jehovah’s sword of judgment would be drenched in her heights or “heavens,” with no help for her from any heavenly or exalted source.

The city of Capernaum had reason to feel highly favored due to the attention it received by Jesus and his ministry. However, since it failed to respond to his powerful works, Jesus asked, “Will you perhaps be exalted to heaven?” and foretold instead, “Down to Hades you will come.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/100/0" data-bid="101-1" class="b">Matt. 11:23</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="ss"><strong>DARKENING OF THE HEAVENS</strong></p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">The darkening of the heavens or of the stellar bodies is often used to represent the removal of prosperous, favorable conditions, and their being replaced by foreboding, gloomy prospects and conditions, like a dark day when clouds blot out all light.

This use of the physical heavens in connection with the mental outlook of humans is somewhat similar to the old Arabic expression, “his heaven has fallen to the earth,” meaning that one’s superiority or prosperity is greatly diminished. Also similar is the modem German expression, <em>“Aus allen Himmeln fallen”</em> (literally, to fall out of all heavens), conveying the idea of bitter disappointment and utter disillusionment.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb">Upon Judah such a day of darkness came in fulfillment of Jehovah’s judgment through his prophet Joel, and reached its culmination in Judah’s desolation by Babylon.

In that day, he says, “I shall answer the heavens, and they, for their part, will answer the earth; and the earth, for its part, will answer the grain and the sweet wine and the oil; and they, for their part, will answer Jezreel.” Evidently this represents Israel’s petition for Jehovah’s blessing as being routed through the chain of things of Jehovah’s creation here named. For that reason these things are viewed as personified; hence, as if able to make a request or petition. Israel asks for grain, wine and oil; these products, in turn, seek their plant food and water from the earth; the earth, in order to supply this need, requires (or figuratively calls for) sun, rain and dew from the heavens; and the heavens (till now “shut up” due to the withdrawal of God’s blessing) can respond only if God accepts the petition and restores his favor to the nation, thereby putting the productive cycle in motion.

This expresses the delicate finery of such heavenly canopy. On a clear night the thousands of stars do, indeed, form a lacy web stretched over the black velvet background of space. It may also be noted that even the enormous galaxy known as the Via Lactea or “Milky Way,” in which our solar system is located, has a filmy gauzelike appearance from earth’s viewpoint.</p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="sb">It can be seen from the foregoing that the context must always be considered in determining the sense of these figurative expressions.

That the physical heavens are dependent on God’s will and sustaining power is indicated at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/124/0" data-bid="125-1" class="b">Psalm 148</a>, where, after referring to sun, moon, and stars, along with other parts of God’s creation, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/125/0" data-bid="126-1" class="b">verse 6</a> states that God “keeps them standing forever, to time indefinite. A regulation he has given, and it will not pass away.”</p>

The psalmist did so by shifting attention to his relationship with Jehovah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2014204/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ps. 102:12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2014204/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 27</a>) He found comfort in knowing that Jehovah would always be there to sustain His people through trials. So if negative feelings temporarily keep you from doing as much as you want to in God’s service, pray about it. Ask God to hear your prayer not only so that you may experience some relief from your distress but also “so that the name of Jehovah will be declared.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2014204/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Ps. 102:20, 21</a>.</p>

<strong>Who Made the Laws That Govern Our Universe?</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>3. Eternal or Subject to Decay?</strong></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Aristotle believed that there was an enormous distinction between the heavens and the earth. The earth, he said, is subject to change, decay, and deterioration, whereas the ether of which the starry heavens are made is utterly changeless, eternal. Aristotle’s crystalline spheres and the heavenly bodies attached to them could never change, wear out, or die.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Is that what the Bible teaches? <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011489/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 102:25-27</a> reads: “Long ago you laid the foundations of the earth itself, and the heavens are the work of your hands. They themselves will perish, but you yourself will keep standing; and just like a garment they will all of them wear out. Just like clothing you will replace them, and they will finish their turn. But you are the same, and your own years will not be completed.”</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Note that this psalmist, writing perhaps two centuries before Aristotle’s time, does not contrast the earth with the starry heavens, as if the earth is subject to decay while the stars are eternal. Rather, he sets both heaven <em>and</em> earth in contrast with God, the mighty Spirit who directed their creation.<a id="footnotesource4" data-fnid="4" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2011489/3">d</a> This psalm suggests that the stars are as subject to decay as anything on the earth. And what has modern science found?</p>

Hence the “new heaven” must correspond to Christ together with his “bride,” the “New Jerusalem,” and the “new earth” is seen in the ‘peoples of mankind’ who are their subjects and who receive the blessings of their rule, as depicted in verses 3 and 4.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="ss"><strong><em>Passing away of the former heaven and the former earth</em></strong></p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">John’s vision refers to the passing away of the “former heaven and the former earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/87/0" data-bid="88-1" class="b">Rev. 21:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/87/1" data-bid="88-2" class="b"> compare 20:11</a>.) In the Christian Greek Scriptures the superior ruling power over human society that is destined to pass away is shown to be Satanic and demonic.

Jehovah is said to have “thrown down from heaven to earth the beauty of Israel” at the time of its desolation. That beauty included its kingdom and princely rulers and their power, and such beauty was devoured as by fire.

The city of Capernaum had reason to feel highly favored due to the attention it received by Jesus and his ministry. However, since it failed to respond to his powerful works, Jesus asked, “Will you perhaps be exalted to heaven?” and foretold instead, “Down to Hades you will come.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/100/0" data-bid="101-1" class="b">Matt. 11:23</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="ss"><strong>DARKENING OF THE HEAVENS</strong></p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">The darkening of the heavens or of the stellar bodies is often used to represent the removal of prosperous, favorable conditions, and their being replaced by foreboding, gloomy prospects and conditions, like a dark day when clouds blot out all light.

This use of the physical heavens in connection with the mental outlook of humans is somewhat similar to the old Arabic expression, “his heaven has fallen to the earth,” meaning that one’s superiority or prosperity is greatly diminished.

That the physical heavens are dependent on God’s will and sustaining power is indicated at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/118/0" data-bid="119-1" class="b">Psalm 148</a>, where, after referring to sun, moon and stars, along with other parts of God’s creation, verse six states that God “keeps them standing forever, to time indefinite. A regulation he has given, and it will not pass away.”</p>
