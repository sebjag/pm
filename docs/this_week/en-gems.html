<strong>Illustrations</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Frequently the prophets used a word or an expression in speaking of a person or a group with a view to imparting its characteristics to the individual or the group, that is, metaphorically. For example, Jehovah is described as “the Rock of Israel,” as a “crag,” and as a “stronghold,” thus conveying the idea that God is a solid source of security. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002147/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">2Sa 23:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002147/35/1" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> Ps 18:2</a>) Judah is said to be “a lion cub.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002147/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Ge 49:9</a>) The Assyrians are said to be “the rod” for God’s anger.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002147/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Isa 10:5</a>.</p>

<strong>Word Pictures in the Bible—Do You Understand Them?</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The Bible also likens Jehovah to inanimate things. He is described as “the Rock of Israel,” as a “crag,” and as a “stronghold.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009326/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Samuel 23:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009326/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Psalm 18:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009326/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Deuteronomy 32:4</a>) What is the point of similarity? Just as a large rock is solidly placed, unmovable, so Jehovah God can be a solid Source of security for you.</p>

And what is a stronghold? It is a fortified place, one of security or survival. David of ancient Israel considered God to be his stronghold. For instance, consider the song that David directed to the Most High “in the day that Jehovah had delivered him out of the palm of all his enemies and out of the hand of Saul,” the king of Israel.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995043/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 18, superscription</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> David began that moving song with the words: “I shall have affection for you, O Jehovah my strength.

(a) The <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">superscription of Psalm 18</a> may remind us of what?

Please turn to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 18</a> and note that <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">the Ps 18 superscription</a> says it was composed by David “in the day that Jehovah had delivered him out of the palm of all his enemies and out of the hand of Saul.” Just the mention of Israel’s first human king, Saul, may well remind us of how often David must have felt that death was staring him in the face. Why, three times the king tried to pin David to the wall with a spear! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Sam. 18:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 19:10</a>) Thereafter, for several years David was kept on the run, relentlessly hunted down by Saul. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Sam. 26:20</a>) With this in mind, we can well imagine the depth of feeling with which David uttered the opening words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 18</a>, where we read: “I shall have affection for you, O Jehovah my strength. Jehovah is my crag and my stronghold and the Provider of escape for me. My God is my rock. I shall take refuge in him, my shield and my horn of salvation, my secure height. On the One to be praised, Jehovah, I shall call, and from my enemies I shall be saved. The ropes of death encircled me; flash floods of good-for-nothing men also kept terrifying me. . . . In my distress I kept calling upon Jehovah, and to my God I kept crying for help. Out of his temple he proceeded to hear my voice, and my own cry before him for help now came into his ears.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps 18 Vss. 1-6</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 4.

Indeed he <span id="page17" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>did, for after describing mighty deeds of Jehovah, David went on to say: “He was delivering me from my strong enemy, and from those hating me; because they were stronger than I was. They kept confronting me in the day of my disaster, but Jehovah came to be as a support for me. And he proceeded to bring me out into a roomy place; he was rescuing me, because he had found delight in me.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 18:17-19</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu">5, 6.

In four of the Psalms, he calls Jehovah the “Provider of escape.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 18:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 40:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 70:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/8/3" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> 144:2</a>) When we, as Jehovah’s Witnesses, talk to others about Jehovah’s fine qualities and purposes, we often refer to portions of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 37</a>. But note now its grand conclusion: “The salvation of the righteous ones is from Jehovah; he is their fortress in the time of distress. And Jehovah will help them and provide them with escape. He will provide them with escape from wicked people and save them, because they have taken refuge in him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps 37 Vss. 39, 40</a>) How these words should move Jehovah’s people to place their confidence in him!</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 70</a> vividly conveys a sense of urgency. It was when David felt in desperate need that he pleaded: “O God, to deliver me, O Jehovah, to my assistance do make haste. . . . I am afflicted and poor. O God, do act quickly for me. You are my help and the Provider of escape for me. O Jehovah, do not be too late.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 70:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 5</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 7. With what attitude can we fittingly pray to Jehovah when in urgent need of help?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Have you ever felt that way? It is both comforting and faith-strengthening to know that we, as servants of Jehovah, can have confidence that he will “act quickly” for us. He knows our needs and how to supply them. Our loving heavenly Father is indeed “the Provider of escape” just when we need it. Sometimes, like David, we realize that our own shortcomings have brought us into a bad situation. But, like David, we can approach Jehovah in sincerity, perhaps with “a broken spirit,” confident that He will hear and answer our prayer. We can plead, even as David did: “Create in me even a pure heart, O God, and put within me a new spirit, a steadfast one.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 51:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 17</a>.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 8.

(a) When only did Jesus speak of “escaping”? (b) What two things must be observed when making an escape?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> According to the Gospel records, only once did Jesus Christ, the Greater David, mention “escaping.” When he was discussing “the conclusion of the system of things,” he urged his disciples: “Keep awake, then, all the time making supplication that you may succeed in <em>escaping</em> all these things that are destined to occur, and in standing before the Son of man.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Luke 21:36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Matt. 24:3</a>) However, before examining that passage in detail, we will review certain exciting accounts of escape recorded in the Hebrew Scriptures, noting some of the important lessons that we should learn and apply to ourselves. When we are in danger, invariably there are essential steps that must be taken and certain things that must be avoided in order to succeed in escaping. This we shall see as we consider historical incidents.</p>

Among these, to name two, are: Ezekiel’s boring a hole through a wall, going out with his face covered (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ezek. 12:1-16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 25:1-7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/27/2" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> 11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/27/3" data-bid="28-4" class="b"> Jer. 52:1-15</a>), and Abraham’s attempt to sacrifice Isaac but receiving him back by God’s intervention (these illustrations were also actual occurrences, carried out in drama-like manner). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Gen. 22:9-13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> Heb. 11:19</a>) Others, particularly many spoken by Jesus Christ, are explained <span id="page815" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="815" data-before-text="815"></span>afterward by Jesus himself. In many cases, the understanding of Bible illustrations is aided by modern events in fulfillment.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="ss"><strong>IN THE HEBREW SCRIPTURES</strong></p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">The Hebrew prophets and Bible writers, moved by Jehovah’s spirit, recorded countless apt illustrations. Illustrative language appears in Genesis, in Jehovah’s promise that he would multiply Abra-ham’s seed “like the stars of the heavens and like the grains of sand that are on the seashore.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Gen. 22:15-18</a>) To emphasize the sinful state of his people in Judah, Jehovah moved Isaiah to compare it to a loathsome physically diseased condition, saying: “The whole head is in a sick condition, and the whole heart is feeble. . . . Wounds and bruises and fresh stripes—they have not been squeezed out or bound up, nor has there been a softening with oil.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Isa. 1:4-6</a>) God himself compelled the prophet Balaam against his will to make a “proverbial utterance” of blessing for Israel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Num. 24:3-9</a>) To King Nebuchadnezzar, Jehovah conveyed prophetic messages with visions of a huge image and a towering tree, and Daniel saw certain governments of earth depicted as beasts.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Dan. chaps. 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/32/1" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> 4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/32/2" data-bid="33-3" class="b"> 7</a>.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Frequently the prophets used a word or an expression in speaking of a person or a group with a view to imparting its characteristics to the individual or the group, that is, metaphorically. For example, Jehovah is described as “the Rock of Israel,” as a “crag” and a “stronghold,” so conveying the idea that God is a solid source of security. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">2 Sam. 23:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/33/1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> Ps. 18:2</a>) Judah is said to be “a lion cub.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Gen. 49:9</a>) The Assyrians are said to be “the rod” for God’s anger.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Isa. 10:5</a>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">On numerous occasions, the prophets acted out the message they had been commissioned to deliver, thus reenforcing the impact of the spoken word. Jeremiah foretold calamity for Jerusalem, and emphasized it by breaking a flask before the eyes of assembled older men of the people and of the priests. He foretold servitude to Babylon, and made it vivid by sending bands and yoke bars to various kings. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Jer. chaps. 19,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/36/1" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 27</a>) Isaiah walked about naked and barefoot to emphasize to the Israelites that it would be in this manner that the Egyptians and the Ethiopians, to whom they were looking for help, would be led away into exile. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Isa. chap. 20</a>) Ezekiel engraved an illustration of Jerusalem on a brick, built a siege rampart against it, put an iron griddle between himself and his model and lay on his side facing it, to depict the coming siege of Jerusalem.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Ezek. chap. 4</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">At times stories were related to emphasize the point to be conveyed. Jotham did this to show the landowners of Shechem their folly in selecting so vile a man as Abimelech for their king. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Judg. 9:7-20</a>) In the book of Ezekiel an account was woven around two eagles and a vine, to illustrate the course of Judah in relation to Babylon and Egypt. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Ezek. chap. 17</a>) Similarly, Ezekiel used two sisters, Oholah and Oholibah, who became prostitutes, to illustrate the course of Samaria (the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel) and Jerusalem (Judah).—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Ezek. chap. 23</a>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">The illustrations mentioned here are only a few of the many illustrations of the Hebrew Scriptures. Virtually every Bible writer and prophet used illustrations, some being given to them directly by God himself in the form of visions, some in words, and some by means of actual realities, as, for instance, the tabernacle, which is called an “illustration.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Heb. 9:9</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="ss"><strong>IN THE GREEK SCRIPTURES</strong></p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">The Christian Greek Scriptures, too, are filled with vivid illustrations. Jesus Christ, of whom it was said, “never has another man spoken like this,” had the greatest resources of knowledge from which to draw of any man who had ever lived on earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">John 7:46</a>) He is the one through whom everything was made by God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">John 1:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/44/1" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> Col. 1:15-17</a>) He was intimately acquainted with all creation. Understandably, therefore, his comparisons were most apt, and his portrayal of human emotions reflected deep understanding. He was like the wise man of old, who said: “And besides the fact that the congregator had become wise, he also taught the people knowledge continually, and he pondered and made a thorough search, that he might arrange many proverbs in order. The congregator sought to find the delightful words and the writing of correct words of truth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Eccl. 12:9, 10</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">Jesus appropriately identified his disciples as “the salt of the earth” and “the light of the world.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Matt. 5:13, 14</a>) He urged them to “observe intently the birds of heaven” and to “take a lesson from the lilies of the field.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Matt. 6:26-30</a>) He likened himself to a shepherd who was willing to die for his sheep. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">John 10:11-15</a>) To Jerusalem he said: “How often I wanted to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her chicks together under her wings! But you people did not want it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Matt. 23:37</a>) Hypocritical religious leaders he called “blind guides, who strain out the gnat and gulp down the camel!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Matt. 23:24</a>) And concerning a person who would stumble others, he declared: “It would be of more advantage to him if a millstone were suspended from his neck and he were thrown into the sea.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Luke 17:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">While the illustrations used by Jesus could be short, terse expressions similar to the “proverbial sayings” found in the Hebrew Scriptures, they were usually longer and often were of story length and character. Jesus generally drew his illustrations from the surrounding creation, from familiar customs of everyday life, from occasional happenings or not-impossible situations, and from recent events well known to his hearers.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="ss"><strong><em>Some of Jesus Christ’s prominent illustrations</em></strong></p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">In the material that follows, you will find helpful information concerning the background and context of thirty of the illustrations used by Jesus Christ in his earthly ministry and recorded by the Gospel writers:</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="ss"><strong>1. <em>The two debtors</em></strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Luke 7:41-43</a>)</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">Spoken in Galilee, 31 C.E. The purpose of the parable of the two debtors, one of whom owed ten times as much as the other, as well as the parable’s application are found in the context, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Luke 7:36-40,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/53/1" data-bid="54-2" class="b"> 44-50</a>.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb">The illustration was prompted by the attitude of Jesus’ host Simon toward the woman who came in and greased Jesus’ feet with perfumed oil. The presence of such an uninvited person was not regarded as unusual, for it seems that on some occasions uninvited persons could enter the room during a meal and sit along the wall, from there conversing with those reclining at the table in the center of the room. Jesus made fitting application of the situation of the two debtors, pointing out that Simon had failed to provide water for his feet, to greet him with a kiss and to grease his head with oil; these were courtesies customarily accorded a guest. But the woman who had many sins showed the greater love and hospitality toward Jesus, even though she was not his hostess. He then told her: “Your sins are forgiven.”</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="ss"><strong>2. <em>The sower</em></strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Matt. 13:3-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/54/1" data-bid="55-2" class="b"> Mark 4:3-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/54/2" data-bid="55-3" class="b"> Luke 8:5-8</a>)</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">Spoken at the Sea of Galilee, apparently in 31 C.E. There are no clues to the interpretation in the illustration itself; but the explanation is plainly given at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Matthew 13:18-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/55/1" data-bid="56-2" class="b"> Mark 4:14-20 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012098/55/2" data-bid="56-3" class="b"> Luke 8:11-15</a>. Attention is focused on the circumstances affecting the soil, or heart, and the influences that can hinder the growth of the seed, or the word of the kingdom.</p>

With dignity and splendor you have clothed yourself, enwrapping yourself with light as with a garment, stretching out the heavens like a tent cloth, the One building his upper chambers with beams in the very waters, making the clouds his chariot, walking upon the wings of the wind, making his angels spirits, his ministers a devouring fire.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971003/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 104:1-4</a>) Of course, Jehovah does not make the literal clouds of earth his chariot, but he can use them as his agencies for doing certain things to or for mankind on earth. What Ezekiel saw in vision resembled a four-wheeled chariot more than clouds do.

<strong>Nations Come to Jehovah’s House to Pray</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> A lady minister of Jehovah’s witnesses in California reports that she had only a few minutes left to complete her three-hour preaching program one Sunday. Being somewhat tired, she was inclined to return home, intending to make up the few minutes yet required some other time. However, the nearby address of a person who was not at home on her first call kept coming into her mind. So she finally felt urged to make this visit. On calling, the woman householder was found to be at home. The lady manifested great interest in the Bible, so much so that she desired to share in a home Bible study immediately. At the <span id="page557" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="557" data-before-text="557"></span>close of this first home Bible study the householder told the minister that the night before she had prayed to God for help to understand the Bible. She was now sure that her prayer had been answered. In the months that followed she progressed rapidly as to a knowledge of Jehovah’s purposes. Finally she became dedicated and baptized and is now an active witness of Jehovah herself in happy association with the society of Jehovah’s Christian witnesses. Like dedicated Cornelius, she now fully enjoys the privilege of prayer to Jehovah and confidently can be expected to be heard regularly.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="ss"><strong>NEED FOR PRAYER</strong></p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">15, 16. (a) Why do people go to the Bible for counsel on prayer? (b) Who demonstrated our need for prayer, and on what matters?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> Where better can one go for counsel on prayer than to the Bible? The Bible is the greatest textbook on prayer. It contains record of 159 prayers in the Hebrew Scriptures. Twenty of Jesus’ masterful prayers are recorded in the four Gospels. Prayer as a subject is referred to 98 more times in the rest of the Christian Greek Scriptures. From Jesus’ many prayers we observe his great need to maintain communication with his Father during his earthly life course. It is written: “In the days of his flesh Christ offered up supplications and also petitions to the one who was able to save him out of death, with strong outcries and tears, and he was favorably heard for his godly fear.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964682/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Heb. 5:7</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> We, too, have constant need to pray as did Jesus. From experience Jesus comes to be our master teacher of prayer. In the model prayer he emphasized right matters for which to pray, such as, for God’s name to be sanctified, for God’s kingdom to come, for God’s will to be done on earth and finally for basic necessities of life. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964682/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Matt. 6:9-13</a>) As was indicated previously, Jesus has come to be and now is the sole avenue of approach to the living God by means of prayer. John writes: “Jesus said to [Thomas]: ‘I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.’” “If you ask anything in my name, I will do it.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964682/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">John 14:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964682/40/1" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> 14</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>WHAT IS PRAYER?</strong></p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">17. What is prayer, and how does this arrangement operate?</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Prayer is actually one-way communication with the true God in heaven. No telephone lines or radio waves are necessary to make such communications to Jehovah in heaven. From ancient time to the present Jehovah has made available a medium of transmission far more effective than either telephone or radio. That medium available to man is nothing other than God’s holy spirit. Holy spirit is not bound by time or space in detecting messages to be conveyed to Jehovah’s reception arrangement. Such reception is spoken of in the Bible as God’s ‘hearing ears.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964682/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Ps. 18:6</a>) Jehovah does not answer audibly at the other end. There is no two-way conversation with God in the prayer arrangement. Rather, God gives answer in the form of spiritual guidance and by granting eventual performances of right requests made.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong>APPROPRIATE EXPRESSIONS</strong></p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">18. Give some appropriate expressions for prayers to Jehovah.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> What are some of the expressions a true worshiper might make in his one-way communication with Jehovah? First, he might express words of devotion in which his heart pours out responses of love to God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964682/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Ps. 18:1, 2</a>) Then, there might be words of praise uttered for the many manifestations of God’s greatness and works of mercy. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964682/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Acts 4:24-30</a>) The one praying might desire to speak words of appreciation for the many opportunities and privileges of service that have come one’s way. <span id="page558" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="558" data-before-text="558"></span>(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964682/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">2 Sam. 7:27</a>) Expressions of gratitude are always proper in giving thanks to Jehovah for the flow of goodnesses and gifts that have been received. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964682/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Col. 1:3</a>) Since all of us are imperfect and continually make mistakes, it would always seem proper to request God’s pardon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964682/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Luke 11:4</a>) Such request indicates one’s repentant attitude to merit God’s mercy further. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964682/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Luke 18:11-13</a>) Words of concern as to the welfare of our brothers and requests for blessing upon their performance of Kingdom service are always fitting to communicate.

<strong>Mount, Mountain</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">At Mount Sinai the revelation of Jehovah’s presence was attended by such physical manifestations as lightning, smoke, and fire. Also the mountain trembled.

<strong>Does a Great Heavenly Organization Exist?</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">What, then, does the chariot picture or represent symbolically? Jehovah’s heavenly organization, composed of all the holy spirit creatures, angels, in that heavenly realm. In Ezekiel’s vision, cherubs accompanied the chariot, just as ancient kings had chariot runners. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972164/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Ki. 1:5</a>) David portrayed Jehovah’s use of these angels to help his people when he wrote: “In my distress I kept calling upon Jehovah, and to my God I kept crying for help. Out of his temple he proceeded to hear my voice, and my own cry before him for help now came into his ears. . . . And he proceeded to bend the heavens down and descend. And thick gloom was beneath his feet. And he came riding upon a cherub and came flying, and he came darting upon the wings of a spirit.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972164/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 18:6-10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972164/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 2 Sam. 22:7-11</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Jehovah ‘rides,’ not just upon one spirit person or angel, but upon all of them, in the sense that he dominates them and uses them according to his purpose.

By having his spirit (his invisible active force) accompany that messenger, operating through that one, Jehovah in effect ‘rides’ that spirit creature. An example of such use of an angel accompanied by God’s holy spirit is found in the experience of the evangelizer Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972164/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts chapter eight, verses 26 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972164/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 29</a>.</p>

<strong>Cherub</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">These were not grotesque figures fashioned after the monstrous winged images worshiped by pagan nations round about, as some contend.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000945/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ex 25:9</a>) The apostle Paul describes them as “glorious cherubs overshadowing the propitiatory cover.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000945/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb 9:5</a>) These cherubs were associated with the presence of Jehovah: “And I will present myself to you there and speak with you from above the cover, from between the two cherubs that are upon the ark of the testimony.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000945/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ex 25:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000945/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Nu 7:89</a>) Hence, Jehovah was said to be “sitting upon [or, between] the cherubs.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000945/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1Sa 4:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000945/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 2Sa 6:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000945/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 2Ki 19:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000945/6/3" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> 1Ch 13:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000945/6/4" data-bid="7-5" class="b"> Ps 80:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000945/6/5" data-bid="7-6" class="b"> 99:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000945/6/6" data-bid="7-7" class="b"> Isa 37:16</a>) In symbol, the cherubs served as “the representation of the chariot” of Jehovah upon which he rode (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000945/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1Ch 28:18</a>), and the wings of the cherubs offered both guarding protection and swiftness in travel. So David, in poetic song, described the speed with which Jehovah came to his aid, like one who “came riding upon a cherub and came flying” even “upon the wings of a spirit.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000945/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2Sa 22:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000945/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Ps 18:10</a>.</p>

<strong>Does a Great Heavenly Organization Exist?</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">What, then, does the chariot picture or represent symbolically? Jehovah’s heavenly organization, composed of all the holy spirit creatures, angels, in that heavenly realm. In Ezekiel’s vision, cherubs accompanied the chariot, just as ancient kings had chariot runners. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972164/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Ki. 1:5</a>) David portrayed Jehovah’s use of these angels to help his people when he wrote: “In my distress I kept calling upon Jehovah, and to my God I kept crying for help. Out of his temple he proceeded to hear my voice, and my own cry before him for help now came into his ears. . . . And he proceeded to bend the heavens down and descend. And thick gloom was beneath his feet. And he came riding upon a cherub and came flying, and he came darting upon the wings of a spirit.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972164/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 18:6-10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972164/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 2 Sam. 22:7-11</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Jehovah ‘rides,’ not just upon one spirit person or angel, but upon all of them, in the sense that he dominates them and uses them according to his purpose. He is the Most High God, the Supreme Being. Instead of personally and directly going to any place himself, he can send a cherub or seraph (angels of specific rank or duty) or any angel. By having his spirit (his invisible active force) accompany that messenger, operating through that one, Jehovah in effect ‘rides’ that spirit creature. An example of such use of an angel accompanied by God’s holy spirit is found in the experience of the evangelizer Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972164/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts chapter eight, verses 26 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972164/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 29</a>.</p>

The ancient psalmist was inspired to say: “Bless Jehovah, O my soul. O Jehovah my God, you have proved very great. With dignity and splendor you have clothed yourself, enwrapping yourself with light as with a garment, stretching out the heavens like a tent cloth, the One building his upper chambers with beams in the very waters, making the clouds his chariot, walking upon the wings of the wind, making his angels spirits, his ministers a devouring fire.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971003/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 104:1-4</a>) Of course, Jehovah does not make the literal clouds of earth his chariot, but he can use them as his agencies for doing certain things to or for mankind on earth. What Ezekiel saw in vision resembled a four-wheeled chariot more than clouds do. Jehovah did not inspire Ezekiel to envision that celestial chariot just to entertain him with something fantastic in appearance. He showed Ezekiel that unusual, self-propelling chariot as a picture of something still greater. There is profit for us in knowing what it signifies.</p><p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="qu">29, 30.

By the appearance of the four cherubic living creatures that had symbolic features and that accompanied the four wheels like chariot runners, we are reminded of what the psalmist David wrote, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971003/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 18:6-10</a>:</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[82]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"><sup>30</sup></span> “In my distress I kept calling upon Jehovah, and to my God I kept crying for help.

He rides upon all his spirit creatures, whether cherubs, seraphs or general angels. He is the Most High God, the Supreme Being. They are all subject to him, and so he rides them in the sense of dominating them and using them according to his purpose. Instead of personally and directly going to any place himself, he can send a cherub or seraph or angel there, and by having his spirit (his invisible active force) accompany that messenger to operate through that one, Jehovah in effect rides that spirit creature. All cherubs, seraphs and angels, together, make up his united, coordinated, harmonious, obedient heavenly organization. This superhuman, spirit organization is like the celestial chariot seen in Ezekiel’s vision and is pictured by it. As on a chariot he rides this organization, causing it to move to wherever his spirit impels it to move.</p><p id="p84" data-pid="84" class="qu">32.

Daniel here makes prominent the vast body of attendants that are subject to Jehovah in heaven in the following description: <span id="page50" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="50" data-before-text="50"></span>“I kept on beholding until there were thrones placed and the Ancient of Days sat down.

<strong>Cherethites</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">An affinity between the Cherethites and the Philistines seems indicated by their mention together at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010932/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezekiel 25:15-17 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010932/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Zephaniah 2:5-7</a>. The <em>Septuagint</em> rendering of these verses substitutes the term “Cretans” for “Cherethites,” perhaps attempting thereby to link them with the Philistines who came “out of Crete [Caphtor].” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010932/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Amos 9:7</a>) Because of this, and the apparent connection of the Cherethites with “the land of the Philistines” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010932/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Samuel 30:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010932/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 16</a>, <span id="page310" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="310" data-before-text="310"></span>most scholars conclude that the Cherethites and Philistines were either the same people or two closely associated peoples. Others reason that the Cherethites may have been a “principal Philistine tribe.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">One suggestion advanced is that, though originally two peoples, the Philistines were either the more powerful of the two or were the earlier arrivals in Canaan. And so they eventually predominated, giving their name to the section of land called Philistia, although the name “Cherethites” did not entirely fade out. According to this view, the meaning of the above-cited prophecies of Ezekiel and Zephaniah would be that Jehovah was going to bring “vengeance” and “woe” upon all the inhabitants of the cities of Philistia, both the Philistines and the Cherethites, prophecies apparently brought to fulfillment by the Babylonians.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Some of the Cherethites came to be among David’s armed forces and they and the Pelethites (often mentioned with them) may have served as the royal bodyguard under Benaiah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010932/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Sam. 8:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010932/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 20:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010932/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 1 Chron. 18:17</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010932/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Samuel 23:22, 23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010932/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 1 Chronicles 11:25</a>.) In view of this, scholars often seek to connect them with the “Carian bodyguard” of the time of priest Jehoiada, more than a hundred years later. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010932/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Ki. 11:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010932/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 19</a>; see CARIAN BODYGUARD.) Though apparently foreign born, the Cherethites of David’s day were not mere mercenaries, acting solely out of personal gain (as is often wrongly argued), but were genuinely devoted to David as Jehovah’s anointed. This was amply demonstrated by their faithfully sticking with David when he was forced to evacuate Jerusalem because “the heart of the men of Israel” had come to be with rebel Absalom. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010932/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Sam. 15:13,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010932/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 18</a>) Similarly, the Cherethites later obediently aided in suppressing the revolt of Sheba the Benjamite, and in supporting Solomon, David’s choice as Israel’s royal successor.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010932/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Sam. 20:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010932/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 1 Ki. 1:38, 39,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010932/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 44</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"></p>

I myself was very much afflicted.” In those words, please, note the continual association of Sheol with death, not with immortal life. Once while under affliction as a Christian the apostle Paul quoted from those words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 116:10</a> and linked them up with the resurrection of Jesus from the dead, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:13, 14</a>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 7.

The very ropes of Sheol surrounded me; the snares of death confronted me.” A violent death stared David in the face; the common grave of dead mankind seemed a certainty for him. But he called to the Almighty God and was spared from death and from Sheol or Haʹdes. It was as if he had been resurrected from the dead by the power of Jehovah God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 18:8-19</a>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 8.

So the prophet’s account of his experience says: “Then Jonah prayed to Jehovah his God from the inward parts of the fish and said: ‘Out of my distress I called out to Jehovah, and he proceeded to answer me. Out of the belly of Sheol I cried for help. You heard my voice. To the bottoms of the mountains I went down [inside the fish]. As for the earth, its bars [like those of a grave] were upon me for time indefinite. But out of the pit you proceeded to bring up my life, O Jehovah my God.”’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Jonah 2:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 6</a>) For three days Jonah was as if dead in the grave or Sheol or Haʹdes. The Lord Jesus Christ showed this when he referred to his own death and burial and said: “Just as Jonah was in the belly of the huge fish three days and three nights, so the Son of man will be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 12:40</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 9. Of what was the deliverance of Jonah from the fish’s belly a prophetic picture, and through whom is escape from Sheol possible?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> It was Almighty God, whose name is Jehovah, who miraculously brought up Jonah the prophet out of the belly of the huge fish on the third day. This same God, Jehovah, brought up his faithful prophet <span id="page46" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="46" data-before-text="46"></span>Jesus Christ out of the “heart of the earth” on the third day. Hence the deliverance of Jonah was a prophetic picture of the resurrection of the Son of God from the dead. After his resurrection the “keys of death and of Haʹdes” were given to Jesus Christ, that he might be God’s Agent in raising all the others who are in Haʹdes or Sheol and in the condition of death. No man can, by his own means and arrangements, escape death and Sheol or Haʹdes, the grave that is common to dead mankind in the dust of the earth.</p>

The very ropes of Sheol surrounded me; the snares of death confronted me.” A violent death stared David in the face; the common grave of dead mankind seemed a certainty for him. But he called to the Almighty God and was spared from death and from Sheol or Haʹdes. It was as if he had been resurrected from the dead by the power of Jehovah God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 18:8-19</a>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 8.

So the prophet’s account of his experience says: “Then Jonah prayed to Jehovah his God from the inward parts of the fish and said: ‘Out of my distress I called out to Jehovah, and he proceeded to answer me. Out of the belly of Sheol I cried for help. You heard my voice. To the bottoms of the mountains I went down [inside the fish]. As for the earth, its bars [like those of a grave] were upon me for time indefinite. But out of the pit you proceeded to bring up my life, O Jehovah my God.”’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Jonah 2:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 6</a>) For three days Jonah was as if dead in the grave or Sheol or Haʹdes. The Lord Jesus Christ showed this when he referred to his own death and burial and said: “Just as Jonah was in the belly of the huge fish three days and three nights, so the Son of man will be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 12:40</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 9. Of what was the deliverance of Jonah from the fish’s belly a prophetic picture, and through whom is escape from Sheol possible?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> It was Almighty God, whose name is Jehovah, who miraculously brought up Jonah the prophet out of the belly of the huge fish on the third day. This same God, Jehovah, brought up his faithful prophet <span id="page46" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="46" data-before-text="46"></span>Jesus Christ out of the “heart of the earth” on the third day. Hence the deliverance of Jonah was a prophetic picture of the resurrection of the Son of God from the dead. After his resurrection the “keys of death and of Haʹdes” were given to Jesus Christ, that he might be God’s Agent in raising all the others who are in Haʹdes or Sheol and in the condition of death. No man can, by his own means and arrangements, escape death and Sheol or Haʹdes, the grave that is common to dead mankind in the dust of the earth.</p>

So the prophet’s account of his experience says: “Then Jonah prayed to Jehovah his God from the inward parts of the fish and said: ‘Out of my distress I called out to Jehovah, and he proceeded to answer me. Out of the belly of Sheol I cried for help. You heard my voice. To the bottoms of the mountains I went down [inside the fish]. As for the earth, its bars [like those of a grave] were upon me for time indefinite.

The Lord Jesus Christ showed this when he referred to his own death and burial and said: “Just as Jonah was in the belly of the huge fish three days and three nights, so the Son of man will be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 12:40</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 9.

Hence the deliverance of Jonah was a prophetic picture of the resurrection of the Son of God from the dead. After his resurrection the “keys of death and of Haʹdes” were given to Jesus Christ, that he might be God’s Agent in raising all the others who are in Haʹdes or Sheol and in the condition of death. No man can, by his own means and arrangements, escape death and Sheol or Haʹdes, the grave that is common to dead mankind in the dust of the earth.</p>

Please turn to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 18</a> and note that <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">the Ps 18 superscription</a> says it was composed by David “in the day that Jehovah had delivered him out of the palm of all his enemies and out of the hand of Saul.” Just the mention of Israel’s first human king, Saul, may well remind us of how often David must have felt that death was staring him in the face. Why, three times the king tried to pin David to the wall with a spear! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Sam. 18:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980885/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 19:10</a>) Thereafter, for several years David was kept on the run, relentlessly hunted down by Saul.

<strong>How Can You Be ‘Perfect as Your Heavenly Father Is Perfect’?</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Bible does not present perfection in such an impractical, unreasonably demanding way, but in a sensible, realistic way. In fact, the very same Greek word (<em>teʹlei·os</em>) rendered “perfect” in the record of Jesus’ speech (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971684/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 5:48</a>) can also be translated “complete” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971684/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:10</a>), “full-grown” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971684/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Cor. 14:20</a>) and “mature.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971684/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 5:14</a>) The same is true of the Hebrew words translated “perfect” in the Bible. So, in Funk and Wagnalls’ <em>A New Standard Bible Dictionary</em> (p. 694) we read this statement about “perfection” in the Bible:</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="si">“When applied to impersonal objects [such as commercial weights (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971684/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Deut. 25:15</a>)] . . . the word is the synonym of ‘complete,’ . . . The notion does not, however, occur with an attempt at precision, but with the same freedom and approximation to exactness as outside the Bible. . . . When used of man it denotes, first of all, conformity to the ideal entertained at the time, and is there a relative and quite variable and expansive term. David claims to be perfect [faultless] in this sense (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971684/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps 18:23</a>), tho[ugh] elsewhere confessing sinfulness (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971684/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps 51:3</a>ff.).”</p>

In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 18:25</a> David said to God: “With someone loyal you will act in loyalty.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Sam. 22:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 26</a>) So, if we are dedicated to the interests of God’s kingdom and are seeking it first, then we too, like David, will strive to be loyal to God, whose kingdom it is. In that case we can be sure of God’s loyalty to us. How wonderful it is to think that God is loyal to us! Yet, despite its wonderfulness, we read: “‘I am loyal,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Jer. 3:12</a>) It is right for us to be loyal to God, who is loyal to us.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">13. From what organ does loyalty proceed, and so what must we do as regards loyalty?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> Loyalty is from the heart. We cannot be loyal if our hearts are divided in their affections, their love, their attachment. We cannot be loyal if we fear anyone who opposes the object of our love and devotion and who persecutes us for this reason. Our persecutors and opposers act as servants of Satan the Devil, and their purpose is to break our loyalty to God and his kingdom. If we want to seek first his kingdom and to preach it as Jesus Christ did, it becomes necessary for us to cultivate loyalty and always to nurture it, feed it, and to put away the fear of the enemy. David indicated for us how to do this when he said, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 86:10, 11</a>: “You are God, you alone. Instruct me, O Jehovah, about your way. I shall walk in your truth. Unify my heart to fear your name.”</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">14. (a) What does the expression “Unify my heart” suggest as to the heart condition? (b) Why did King Saul prove disloyal?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> What a singular expression, “Unify my heart”! That suggests that the heart is not in a condition of oneness, that it is divided in itself with regard to its affections and its fears. It seems to confess that there is some fear of man in the heart, which takes away something from the complete fear of God. “Trembling at men is what lays a snare,” says <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Proverbs 29:25</a>; and such a snare means being captured for our death at the hands of those who want to devour or destroy us. David’s persecutor, King Saul, was one who feared men; and because of such fear he forgot his fear of God and overstepped God’s orders and commands. King Saul said to God’s prophet Samuel: “I have sinned; for I have overstepped the order of Jehovah and your words, because I feared the people and so obeyed their voice.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Sam. 15:24</a>) Such fear led to disloyalty to Jehovah God.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">15. When sending out his apostles to preach, what instruction in this regard did Jesus give them, and why?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> David did not want to yield to such fear. When Jesus Christ, the Son of David, sent out his twelve apostles as missionaries to preach, saying: “The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near,” he warned them against such fear of men. It would keep them from boldly preaching the Kingdom. Jesus said: “Do not become fearful of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; but rather be in fear of him that can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 10:5-7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961723/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 27, 28</a>) To this One it was therefore correct for David to pray: “O do guard my soul, for I am loyal.”</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">16, 17. (a) What did Jehovah have to do to unify David’s heart to fear His name? (b) On having His name brought to the attention of Jehovah’s witnesses, why does fear envelop their whole heart, and to what does this lead?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> David’s inspired psalm was preserved for our benefit today. What, then, are we to understand by David’s prayer to Jehovah: <span id="page588" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="588" data-before-text="588"></span>“Unify my heart to fear your name”? What did Jehovah God have to do to answer that prayer? It meant for God to remove all other fear that would divide David’s heart and obstruct his fear of Almighty God, who can destroy both soul and body in the Gehenna of annihilation. It meant to make David’s heart all one in fearing the name of Jehovah. Men of this world may have impressive names or reputations, and the bare mention of their names might strike terror to the heart of anyone who did not know a higher fear. Today men do not tremble at the mention of God. But threateningly mention to them the name of some gangster boss, or some dictator, some witch doctor, and they grow sober; they tremble; they fear for life and body.</p>

<strong>How to Cope Successfully With Anxiety</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">David understood that to cope successfully with anxiety, he needed Jehovah’s help. He appreciated Jehovah’s support so much that he was moved to say: “By God’s power I can scale a wall. The true God is the one who clothes me with strength.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022360/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 18:29,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022360/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 32</a>) We may feel that our trials are like unscalable walls. But with Jehovah’s help, we can scale any wall-like trials! Yes, when we <strong><em>pray</em></strong> to Jehovah for help, <strong><em>reflect</em></strong> on all that he has done for us, and <strong><em>act</em></strong> on his direction, we can be confident that he will give us the strength and the wisdom we need to cope successfully with our anxieties!</p>

Joy and happiness are among these blessings. Even though “you accepted the word under much tribulation,” you did so “with joy of holy spirit,” the Scriptures say.

They will walk on from vital energy to vital energy.” This joy and happiness is not a superficial mirth inspired by the world’s “funny men.” Rather, it is a genuine, deep, inward feeling of satisfaction and contentment enjoyed even if tears from physical pain are streaming down the cheeks because of being unmercifully beaten in a soundproof vault in a musty prison. It is the happiness that comes to those making Jehovah’s heart happy, to those sharing in the vindication of his great Name and Holy Word.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961524/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ps. 84:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961524/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961524/27/2" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> Prov. 27:11</a>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sd">“And in the last days,” God says, “I shall pour some of my spirit out upon every kind of flesh.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961524/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Acts 2:17</a></p>

<strong>Humility</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><strong>A Quality of God.</strong> Jehovah God himself includes humility among his qualities. This is not because there is any inferiority on his part or any submission to others. Rather, he shows humility in exercising mercy and great compassion upon lowly sinners. That he deals with sinners at all and has provided his Son as a sacrifice for mankind’s sins is an expression of his humility. Jehovah God has permitted evil for some 6,000 years and let mankind be brought forth, even though their father Adam had sinned. Through undeserved kindness, mercy was thereby shown to Adam’s offspring, giving them opportunity for everlasting life. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002102/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ro 8:20, 21</a>) All of this displays, along with other fine qualities of God, his humility.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">King David saw and appreciated this quality in God’s undeserved kindness to him. After Jehovah had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, he sang: “You will give me your shield of salvation, and it is your humility that makes me great.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002102/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2Sa 22:36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002102/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Ps 18:35</a>) Though in his great dignity he sits in his exalted place in the highest heavens, it can nevertheless be said of Jehovah: “Who is like Jehovah our God, him who is making his dwelling on high? He is condescending to look on heaven and earth, raising up the lowly one from the very dust; he exalts the poor one from the ashpit itself, to make him sit with nobles, with the nobles of his people.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002102/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps 113:5-8</a>.</p>

David realized that if he was to find salvation​—and even, eventually, achieve a measure of greatness as a king—​it would be only because of Jehovah’s willingness to humble Himself in this way. Really, who of us would have any hope of salvation if Jehovah were not humble, willing to lower himself in order to deal with us as a mild and loving Father?</p>

To Jehovah, King David said: “You will give me your shield of salvation, and your own right hand will sustain me, and your own humility will make me great.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004562/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 18:35</a>) In describing Jehovah as humble, David drew on a Hebrew root word that means “be bowed down.” Besides the word “humility,” other words that are related to the same root include “lowliness,” “meekness,” and “condescension.” So Jehovah displayed humility when he lowered himself to have dealings with the imperfect man David and used him as His representative king. As the <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004562/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">superscription of Psalm 18</a> shows, Jehovah protected and supported David, delivering him “out of the palm of all his enemies and out of the hand of Saul.” David, in turn, knew that any greatness or glory that he might achieve as king depended on Jehovah’s humbly acting in his behalf. This realization helped David to remain humble.</p>

<strong>Christian Modesty—Proof of Wisdom</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> There is a difference between being humble and being modest.

Thus we also read regarding Jehovah: “Who is like Jehovah our God, him who is making his dwelling on high? He is condescending to look on heaven and earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984045/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 113:5, 6</a>) There is no question about it​—the Creator is so highly exalted that he has to condescend to take notice of things in the heavens and upon earth.</p>

<strong>“Wisdom Is with the Modest Ones”</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The Hebrew word here rendered “modest” is also found at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962326/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Micah 6:8</a>, where it usually is translated “humbly.” But says the Soncino Bible of the expression “walk humbly”: “One is reluctant to question a phrase which has sunk so deeply into the religious consciousness of mankind; yet it is doubtful whether <em>humbly</em> is an adequate translation of the Hebrew. In the Bible the root <em>tsana</em> is found only here and in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962326/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Prov. xi. 2</a> (elsewhere <em>anaw</em> is used to express humility). The lexicon turns to Rabbinic Hebrew for elucidation of its meaning, and there the word signifies ‘modesty,’ . . . ” But is it “modesty” in the sense of decency or chastity, as the Rabbinic Hebrew <span id="page282" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="282" data-before-text="282"></span>goes on to say? No, for the context of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962326/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Micah 6:8</a> makes it very evident that here, as at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962326/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 11:2</a>, what is stressed is not modesty in the sense of chasteness and propriety, but modesty in the sense of an awareness of one’s limitations, of one’s relationship with his Maker. And so correctly, and perhaps uniquely, the <em>New World Translation</em> reads: “He has told you, O earthling man, what is good. And what is Jehovah asking back from you but to exercise justice and to love kindness and to be modest in walking with your God?”</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>MODESTY AND HUMILITY</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Modesty and humility are closely related, but they are not the same. The opposite of humility is pride; the opposite of modesty is presuming too much, vanity and conceit. “Humility” comes from the root <em>humus,</em> meaning earth, and has the thought of lowliness. “Modesty” comes from the root <em>modestus,</em> meaning moderate.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Modesty may be said to be an aspect of humility, which is the more basic quality. A humble person who has good sense, who is wise, who uses a sound mind, will also be modest. A humble person will not resent suggestions or criticism, but a modest person is more likely to ask, Wherein can I improve? Have you anything to offer?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Since modesty means being aware of one’s limitations, it is a quality of persons who are finite. All creatures have their limitations, and therefore modesty is becoming to them. But the Creator, being infinite, has no limitations, and so nowhere do we read in his Word of his being modest, but we do read of his humility: “Your own humility will make me great.” “Who is like Jehovah our God, him who is making his dwelling on high? He is condescending to look on heaven and earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962326/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 18:35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962326/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 113:5, 6</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Does this mean that God is immodest? Not at all. It merely means that modesty is a virtue that has no application to him.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Modesty being an aspect of humility that involves sound thinking, we find it implicit in Paul’s counsel to the Romans: “I tell everyone there among you not to think more of himself than it is necessary to think; but to think so as to have a sound mind.” Yes, just as it is necessary to love ourselves and yet not to love ourselves too much, it is necessary for us to think something of ourselves but not too much.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962326/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rom. 12:3</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Helping us to appreciate the distinction between modesty and humility is the Scriptural record which shows that, while God’s faithful servants were ever humble, at times they erred as to being modest. For one thing, they may have erred because of not being aware of their weaknesses. The apostle Peter was certainly a humble man, yet he repeatedly thought to improve on what his perfect Master said and did. His lack of modesty he especially betrayed when he said: “Even if all the others are stumbled, yet I will not be.” He was humble, but erred as to modesty, because he was not aware of his own limitations.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962326/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Mark 14:29</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">At times great pressure may cause a humble servant of God to err in this respect. Moses, though the meekest man in all the earth, on one occasion, when sorely tried, presumed too much: “Hear, now, you rebels! Is it from this crag that we shall bring out water for you?” God took this error on Moses’ part seriously: “Because you did not . . . sanctify me before the eyes of the sons of Israel,” but immodestly took the credit to yourself, “you will not bring this congregation into” the Promised Land.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962326/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Num. 20:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962326/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 12</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>GOD FAVORS MODEST ONES</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Why is it said that “wisdom is with the modest ones”? First of all, because Jehovah God can best use those who are modest, <span id="page283" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="283" data-before-text="283"></span>who are not self-confident, who are aware of their own limitations. Such ones will not draw attention away from Jehovah God to themselves and such are also more likely to look to Jehovah God for guidance and strength.</p>

<strong>Humility—an Aid to Patience</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Jehovah God is also slow to anger, or patient, with this present wicked generation. He has long had sufficient grounds to destroy this corrupt old world. But some people consider him slow in fulfilling his promises to end wickedness. Yet, he is not slow; he simply “is patient . . . because he does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101973160/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:9</a>) Since humility and patience go together, can it be said that the Most High, the Sovereign Lord of the universe, is humble? Yes, it can, even as his Word tells us: “Who is like Jehovah our God, him who is making his dwelling on high? He is condescending to look on heaven and earth, raising up the lowly one from the very dust.” And as the psalmist David testified: “You will give me your shield of salvation, . . . and your own humility will make me great.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101973160/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 113:5-7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101973160/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 18:35</a>.</p>

And he kept praying to Him, so that He let himself be entreated by him and He heard his request for favor and restored him to Jerusalem to his kingship; and Manasseh came to know that Jehovah is the true God.” Thus Manasseh learned humility.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Chron. 33:9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 12, 13</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Kings 21:27-29</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>PROVIDES RIGHT GUIDANCE</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">One who humbles himself before God can expect to have God’s guidance. Ezra had a heavy responsibility in leading back from Babylon to Jerusalem more than 1,500 men, besides the priests and the sons of David, the Nethinim and the women and children. Additionally, they carried with them a great amount of gold and silver for beautifying the temple in Jerusalem. They needed protection on the journey, but Ezra did not want to ask the king of Persia for a military escort and thereby show reliance on human might. Besides, he had previously said to the king: “The hand of our God is over all those seeking him for good.” Therefore he proclaimed a fast, so that the people would humble themselves before Jehovah. They made request of God, and he listened and provided them with protection from enemy ambushes on the way, so that they completed the hazardous trip successfully. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ezra 8:1-14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 21-32</a>) The prophet Daniel, a slave in Babylonian exile, was highly favored by having an angel of God sent to him with a vision because of Daniel’s humbling himself before God in his search for guidance and understanding.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Dan. 10:12</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Humility will guide a person in the proper path and will bring him into glory, for God it is who exalts one and puts down another. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 75:7</a>) “Before a crash the heart of a man is lofty, and before glory there is humility.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Prov. 18:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 22:4</a>) So, one seeking glory by haughtiness will fail, as did King Uzziah of Judah, who became presumptuous and unlawfully usurped priestly duties: “As soon as he was strong, his heart became haughty even to the point of causing ruin, so that he acted unfaithfully against Jehovah his God and came into the temple of Jehovah to burn incense upon the altar of incense.” When he became enraged at the priests for correcting him, he was stricken with leprosy. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:16-21</a>) Lack of humility caused Uzziah to be misguided to his downfall.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>AIDS ONE IN TIME OF ADVERSITY</strong></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Humility can aid one greatly in meeting the challenge of adversity. If calamity comes, humility enables one to hold up and endure as well as to continue his service to God. King David underwent many adversities. He was hunted as an outlaw by King Saul. But he never complained against God or exalted himself above Jehovah’s anointed one. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Sam. 26:9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/13/2" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 23</a>) When he sinned against Jehovah in the affair with Bath-sheba and was most severely reproved by God’s prophet Nathan, he humbled himself before God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Sam. 12:9-23</a>) Afterward, when a certain Benjamite named Shimei began publicly calling down evil on David, and David’s officer Abishai wanted to kill the man for so disrespecting the king, David displayed humility. He replied to Abishai: “Here my own son, who has come forth out of my own inward parts, is looking for my soul; and how much more now a Benjaminite! . . . Perhaps Jehovah will see with his eye, and Jehovah will actually restore to me goodness instead of his malediction this day.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Sam. 16:5-13</a>) Later, David numbered the people, contrary to Jehovah’s will. The account reads: “And David’s heart began to beat him after he had so numbered the people. Consequently David said to Jehovah: ‘I have sinned very much in what I have done. . . . I have acted very foolishly.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Sam. 24:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 10</a>) Although he suffered punishment, David was not removed as king; his humility played a large part in his restoration to Jehovah’s favor.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>A QUALITY OF GOD</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Jehovah God himself includes humility among his qualities. Not that there is any inferiority on his part or any submission to others, but that he exercises mercy and great compassion upon lowly sinners. It is an expression of his humility that he deals with sinners at all, and that he has provided his Son as a sacrifice for mankind’s sins. Jehovah God has permitted evil for six thousand years and let mankind be brought forth, even though their father Adam had sinned. Through undeserved kindness mercy was thereby shown to Adam’s offspring, giving them opportunity for everlasting life. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Rom. 8:20, 21</a>) All of this displays, along with other fine qualities of God, his humility.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">King David saw and appreciated this quality in God’s undeserved kindness to him. After Jehovah had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, he sang: “You will give me your shield of salvation, and it is your humility that makes me great.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Sam. 22:36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Ps. 18:35</a>) Though he sits in his exalted place in the highest heavens, and in his great dignity, it can nevertheless be said of Jehovah: “Who is like Jehovah our God, Him who is making his dwelling on high? He is condescending to look on heaven and earth, raising up the lowly one from the very dust; he exalts the poor one from the ashpit itself, to make him sit with nobles, with the nobles of his people.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 113:5-8</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>JESUS CHRIST’S HUMILITY</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Jesus Christ, when on earth, set the greatest example of a humble servant of God. On the evening before his death Jesus girded himself with a towel and washed and dried the feet of each of his twelve apostles, a service customarily performed by menials and slaves. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">John 13:2-5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 12-17</a>) He had told his disciples: “Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Matt. 23:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Luke 14:11</a>) The apostle Peter, present that night, remembered Jesus’ fine example in living up to his words. And in counseling and encouraging the overseers and shepherds of the flock of God, Peter told them: “All of you gird yourselves with lowliness of mind toward one another. . . . Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:5, 6</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The apostle Paul encourages Christians to have the same mental attitude as Jesus Christ, pointing to the high position of the Son of God in his prehuman existence with his Father Jehovah in the heavens, and his willingly emptying himself, taking a slave’s form, and coming to be in the likeness of men. Paul adds: “More than that, when he [Jesus] found himself in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient as far as death, yes, death on a torture stake.” Jesus’ own words as to the reward of humility are powerfully proved true in his own case, as the apostle goes on to say: “For this very reason also God exalted him to a superior position and kindly gave him the name that is above every other name.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Phil. 2:5-11</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">More outstandingly, Christ, even with such a highly exalted position, when he wields ‘all authority in heaven and on the earth’ to bring about God’s will concerning the earth (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matt. 28:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 6:10</a>) still will have the same humility at the end of his thousand-year reign. Thus, the Scriptures tell us: “When all things will have been subjected to him, then the Son himself will also subject himself to the One who subjected all things to him, that God may be all things to everyone.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:28</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Jesus Christ said of himself: “I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Matt. 11:29</a>) When he presented himself to the people of Jerusalem as their king, he fulfilled the prophecy that said of him: “Look! Your <span id="page803" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="803" data-before-text="803"></span>king himself comes to you. He is righteous, yes, saved; humble, and riding upon an ass, even upon a full-grown animal the son of a she-ass.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Zech. 9:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> John 12:12-16</a>) In his exalted heavenly position when he goes forth against the enemies of God, the command is prophetically given to him: “In your splendor go on to success; ride in the cause of truth and humility and righteousness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ps. 45:4</a>) Therefore those who have humility can rejoice, even though the have been crushed and mistreated by the proud any haughty, and they can take comfort in the words: “Seek Jehovah, all you meek ones of the earth who have practiced His own judicial decision. Seek righteousness, seek meekness. Probably you may be concealed in the day of Jehovah’s anger.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012053/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Zeph. 2:3</a>.</p>

Their God-given work continues to grow and prosper, to the utter dismay and consternation of tyrannical dictators.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">23.

Observe how they have broken down all national, racial, social and religious barriers which divide. Note their oneness and unity in activity and form of worship. See how they are viciously opposed by the entire world, yet how they continue to maintain their integrity under trial. Look at their organizational prosperity and expansion in numbers. Observe their consuming zeal and love for Jehovah’s kingdom of righteousness. Consider all this carefully and you are bound to know for a certainty that a powerful invisible force, yes, Jehovah’s holy spirit, is activating this people. It is a demonstration of “the oneness of the spirit” on a grand global scale!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961524/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Eph. 4:3</a>.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">24.

Joy and happiness are among these blessings. Even though “you accepted the word under much tribulation,” you did so “with joy of holy spirit,” the Scriptures say. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961524/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">1 Thess. 1:6</a>) Furthermore, the promise is: “Happy are the men whose strength is in you . . . They will walk on from vital energy to vital energy.” This joy and happiness is not a superficial mirth inspired by the world’s “funny men.” Rather, it is a genuine, deep, inward feeling of satisfaction and contentment enjoyed even if tears from physical pain are streaming down the cheeks because of being unmercifully beaten in a soundproof vault in a musty prison. It is the happiness that comes to those making Jehovah’s heart happy, to those sharing in the vindication of his great Name and Holy Word.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961524/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ps. 84:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961524/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961524/27/2" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> Prov. 27:11</a>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sd">“And in the last days,” God says, “I shall pour some of my spirit out upon every kind of flesh.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961524/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Acts 2:17</a></p>

<strong>A Bridegroom Goes to War</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">What a fine thing for the Bridegroom <span id="page380" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="380" data-before-text="380"></span>to be able to act on behalf of his Bride, sparing those members of the Bride who are still invited to attend the marriage and are in anticipation of it! He is privileged to fight a war that will vindicate the name of his Father Jehovah, clearing the illustrious name and the family of that illustrious one from reproach. But there is yet more to say about the fight. We often read of historical battles and victories. We rarely get a close picture of the actual forces involved and a close-up view of the fight itself. By reading the few remaining verses of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967445/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Revelation chapter 19</a> now, you will find even more enjoyable the article in our next issue discussing these verses.</p>

Therefore, to ‘have one’s hand on the back of the neck’ of his enemies was to conquer or subdue them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013132/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 49:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013132/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2 Sam. 22:41;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013132/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Ps. 18:40</a>) With similar significance, it was the ancient custom to place one’s foot upon the neck of a conquered foe. On monuments of Egypt and Assyria, monarchs are represented in battle scenes as treading on the necks of their enemies. Likewise, Joshua ordered his army commanders: “Come forward. Place your feet on the back of the necks of these kings.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013132/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Josh. 10:24</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A yoke upon the neck indicated servitude, submission or bondage.

In the early morning of that day the glorified Jesus channeled the holy spirit of Jehovah God upon about 120 disciples at Jerusalem. As a result of their preaching that day, about 3,000 Jews and Jewish proselytes accepted the Kingdom tidings and got baptized in water. Afterward these recipients of the holy spirit joined in the ambassadorial work as substitutes for Christ. After persecution broke out in Jerusalem some began ‘openly acknowledging’ Jehovah among the Samaritans and still later among uncircumcised Gentiles of Roman nationality and others. As they heard Jehovah being openly acknowledged and lauded among them, people of all nationalities could call upon his name through Christ for merciful salvation.</p>

<strong>Answering the Roman Governor’s Question, “What Is Truth?”</strong><br/><p id="p48" data-pid="48" data-rel-pid="[109]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="40"><sup>40</sup></span> When on earth as a man, Jesus was determined to bear witness to the truth of God’s recorded word in the Hebrew Scriptures. On the night of falling into the hands of his enemies he said to his faithful apostles: “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">John 14:6</a>) Was he not correct in saying this? Yes, for he was indeed the Truth. He was no <em>shadow</em> Messiah or Christ. He was the <em>real</em> one promised. <span id="page655" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="655" data-before-text="655"></span>He was no <em>shadow</em> king-priest. He was substantially the <em>true</em> one that had been prefigured. As such, he benefits not only the circumcised Jews but also all the non-Jewish nations. Hence the apostle Paul says:</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" data-rel-pid="[109]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="41"><sup>41</sup></span> “I say that Christ actually became a minister of those who are circumcised in behalf of God’s truthfulness, so as to verify the promises He made to their forefathers, and that the nations might glorify God for his mercy. Just as it is written: ‘That is why I will openly acknowledge you among the nations and to your name I will make melody.’ And again he says: ‘Be glad, you nations, with his people.’ And again: ‘Praise Jehovah, all you nations, and let all the peoples praise him.’ And again Isaiah says: ‘There will be the root of Jesse [father of King David], and there will be one arising to rule nations; on him nations will rest their hope.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Rom. 15:8-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/37/1" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> Ps. 18:49;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/37/2" data-bid="38-3" class="b"> 117:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/37/3" data-bid="38-4" class="b"> Deut. 32:43;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/37/4" data-bid="38-5" class="b"> Isa. 11:10</a>.</p><p id="p110" data-pid="110" class="qu">42. (a) How did Jesus actually become “a minister of those who are circumcised”? (b) How did Jesus “verify” God’s promises made to the forefathers?</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" data-rel-pid="[110]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="42"><sup>42</sup></span> Once when he encountered a Phoenician woman, Jesus Christ said: “I was not sent forth to any but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” When sending out his twelve apostles to preach the kingdom of the heavens, Jesus said to them: “Do not go off into the road of the nations, and do not enter into a Samaritan city; but, instead, go continually to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Matt. 15:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/38/1" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> 10:5, 6</a>) Thus, because he was born and circumcised as a Jew under the Mosaic law, Jesus “actually became a minister of those who are circumcised.” This ministry of Jesus Christ to the circumcised Jews was rendered “in behalf of God’s truthfulness,” because Jehovah God had said to the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob that all the nations of the earth would bless themselves by means of their seed. Naturally, by human birth, their “seed” would be Israelites or Jews, Hebrews. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Gen. 22:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/39/1" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> 26:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/39/2" data-bid="40-3" class="b"> 28:14</a>) Hence according to the natural order of things it was necessary for Jesus Christ to establish “God’s truthfulness” as regards those promises made to the three Hebrew patriarchs; how? By offering first to Jews the opportunity to receive the Abrahamic blessing and become the spiritual seed of Abraham. It was absolutely obligatory upon Jesus to respect the sworn oath of Jehovah God, because God had sworn with an oath that his promises to the patriarchs were truthful, and Jesus had to “verify” those promises.</p><p id="p111" data-pid="111" class="qu">43.
