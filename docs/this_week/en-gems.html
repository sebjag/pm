<strong>Mouth</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>The Palate.</strong> The <em>palate</em> is the roof of the mouth, which separates the mouth from the nasal cavities; it has a soft part that forms a curtain between the mouth and the pharynx. In the Scriptures, “palate” is, in some cases, used synonymously with “mouth.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003129/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Pr 8:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003129/32/1" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> Ho 8:1</a>, ftn.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Both Job and Elihu make a comparative use of the word when they liken the palate’s ability to discriminate taste to man’s judgment as to what is right and wise.

This can be seen by observing the part played by the palate in swallowing. Food is pressed by the tongue against the palate and spread out as it moves back into the pharynx, which is a cone-shaped tube leading toward the stomach and connecting also with the nasal passages. This brings about better diffusion of the aroma of the food into the nasal passages, which greatly contributes to what is commonly called taste.</p>

Job did not possess the knowledge that God was allowing Satan to put his integrity to the test, to see whether he would be faithful to God. Job kept his integrity to God despite his sufferings. Yet, lacking knowledge of the great issue involved, he declared “his own soul righteous rather than God.” And in his distress he said: “I certainly am in the right, but God himself has turned aside the judgment of me.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 32:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 34:5</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">However, Elihu told Job wherein he had not been in the right: “Only you have said in my ears, and the sound of your words I kept hearing, ‘I am pure without transgression; clean I am, and I have no error. Look! Occasions for opposition to me he [God] finds, he takes me for an enemy of his. He puts my feet in the stocks, he watches all my paths.’ Look! In this you have not been in the right.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 33:8-12</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">To give Job a proper understanding of the matter, the Almighty spoke to Job out of the windstorm. In a series of questions the Almighty asked Job how he could account for the wisdom in God’s manifold works of creation. Could he even fathom it all? The many examples drawn from the visible creation, including animals, showed Job that man was utterly incompetent to judge the ways of God. We can benefit by noting God’s questions regarding</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>THE HORSE AND ITS QUALITIES</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“Can you give to the horse mightiness? Can you clothe its neck with a rustling mane? Can you cause it to leap like a locust? The dignity of its snorting is frightful. It paws in the low plain and exults in power; it goes forth to meet armor. It laughs at dread, and is not terrified; nor does it turn back on account of a sword. Against it a quiver rattles, the blade of a spear and a javelin. With pounding and excitement it swallows up the earth, and it does not believe that it is the sound of a horn. As soon as the horn blows it says Aha! And from far off it smells the battle, the uproar of chiefs and the war cry.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 39:19-25</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Did Job endow the horse with these remarkable qualities? Did he give the horse its mightiness or clothe its neck with the rustling mane? Who gave the horse its ability to leap like a locust? Not man. Further, “the dignity of its snorting is frightful”; so much so that <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jeremiah 8:16</a> says: “From Dan has been heard the snorting of his horses. Due to the sound of the neighing of his stallions the whole land has begun to rock.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The monuments of antiquity abound with pictorial representations of the warhorse, and the horse is often referred to in the Bible as a symbol for war equipment. Horses were used to draw chariots <span id="page486" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="486" data-before-text="486"></span>in which the driver and one or two fighting men rode or as mounts for the warriors who fought from horseback. Israel for a long time won its battles without horses, but later they became common in Israel and Judah and were used in battle.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Ki. 22:4</a>.</p>

<strong>Ridicule</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Job was a man righteously maintaining his integrity through great ridicule. But he developed the wrong viewpoint and made a mistake, for which he was corrected. Elihu said of him: “What able-bodied man is like Job, who drinks up derision like water?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003732/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Job 34:7</a>) Job became too concerned with his own justification rather than God’s, and he tended to magnify his own righteousness more than God’s. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003732/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Job 35:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003732/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 36:24</a>) In receiving the severe ridicule of his three “companions,” Job tended to count it directed toward himself rather than toward God. In this he was like a person who gives himself up to derision and ridicule and delights in it, taking it in as though he were drinking water with enjoyment. God later explained to Job that these ridiculers were actually (in the final analysis) speaking untruth against <em>God.</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003732/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Job 42:7</a>) Similarly, Jehovah told the prophet Samuel when Israel demanded a king: “It is not you whom they have rejected, but it is I whom they have rejected from being king over them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003732/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">1Sa 8:7</a>) And Jesus said to his disciples: “You will be objects of hatred by all the nations [not on your own account, but] on account of <em>my name.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003732/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Mt 24:9</a>) Keeping these things in mind will enable the Christian to endure ridicule in the right spirit and will qualify him to receive a reward for his endurance.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003732/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Lu 6:22, 23</a>.</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013642/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Gen. 21:9</a>) Paul gives the prophetic application, saying: “Now we, brothers, are children belonging to the promise the same as Isaac was. But just as then the one born in the manner of flesh began persecuting the one born in the manner of spirit [God having intervened to bring about Isaac’s birth], so also now.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013642/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Gal. 4:28, 29</a>) Later Paul writes: “In fact, all those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013642/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:12</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong><em>Enduring ridicule with the proper viewpoint</em></strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Jesus Christ knew all along that he would face ridicule, and that it would culminate in his being put to death. But he recognized that the reproaches were actually against Jehovah, whom he represented, and this was all the more painful to him who ‘always did the things pleasing to his Father’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013642/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">John 8:29</a>), and who was more concerned with the sanctification of his Father’s name than anything else. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013642/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matt. 6:9</a>) Accordingly, “when he was being reviled, he did not go reviling in return. When he was suffering, he did not go threatening, but kept on committing himself to the one who judges righteously.” The apostle Peter expresses this point when writing to Christians, particularly to slaves, exhorting them not to let such treatment incite them to retaliate, for Christ is their example, “a model,” Peter says, “for you to follow his steps closely.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013642/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:18-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013642/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Rom. 12:17-21</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Jeremiah the prophet of God said, at one point in his career, “I became an object of laughter all day long; everyone is holding me in derision.” Momentarily he weakened and considered stopping his prophetic work because of the unceasing reproach and jeering. But he too recognized that it was “for the word of Jehovah” that the derision came, and God’s word in his heart proved to be like a burning fire that he could not endure to hold in. For his faithfulness Jehovah was with him “like a terrible mighty one,” and Jeremiah was strengthened to keep on loyally.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013642/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Jer. 20:7-11</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Job was a man righteously maintaining his integrity through great ridicule. But he developed the wrong viewpoint and made a mistake, for which he was corrected. Elihu said of him: “What able-bodied man is like Job, who drinks up derision like water?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013642/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Job 34:7</a>) Job became too concerned with his own justification rather than God’s, and tended to magnify his own righteousness more than God’s. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013642/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Job 35:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013642/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 36:24</a>) In receiving the severe ridicule of his three “companions,” Job tended to count it directed toward himself rather than toward God. In this he was like a person drinking water with enjoyment, like one who gives himself up to derision and ridicule and delights in it. God later explained to Job that these ridiculers were actually (in the final analysis) speaking untruth against <em>God.</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013642/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Job 42:7</a>) Similarly, Jehovah told the prophet Samuel when Israel demanded a king: “It is not you whom they have rejected, but it is I whom they have rejected from being king over them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013642/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">1 Sam. 8:7</a>) And Jesus said to his disciples: “You will be objects of hatred by all the nations [not on your own account, but] on account of <em>my name.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013642/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Matt. 24:9</a>) These things, kept in mind, will enable the Christian to endure ridicule in the right spirit and will qualify him to receive a reward for his endurance.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013642/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Luke 6:22, 23</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>JUSTIFIABLE RIDICULE</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Ridicule may be deserved and well justified. One not exercising foresight or who neglects good counsel may take a foolish course that makes him the object of ridicule. Jesus gave such an example, of a man who started to build a tower without first counting the cost.

He writes to the Galatian Christians: “For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he is deceiving his own mind. . . . Do not be misled: God is not one to be mocked. For whatever a man is sowing, this he will also reap; because he who is sowing with a view to his flesh will reap corruption from his flesh, but he who is sowing with a view to the spirit will reap everlasting life from the spirit.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013642/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Gal. 6:3-8</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Here the apostle shows that a person should not deceive himself with a false estimate of his own worth, thereby ignoring God and his Word. He should clean up his life to walk by the spirit as the Word directs. If one does not do this, but instead goes on sowing with a view to fleshly desires, he will be ‘accepting the undeserved kindness of God and missing its purpose,’ and treating God’s instruction as contemptible. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013642/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">2 Cor. 6:1</a>) He may deceive himself into thinking that he is safe. Nevertheless, God knows his heart and will judge him accordingly.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Can God Do Everything?</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Jehovah God, however, cannot act contrary to what he is​—the holy, all-wise and almighty God. That is why there are things that he simply cannot and will not do.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">For instance, Jehovah cannot be unrighteous. The Bible tells us: “Far be it from the true God to act wickedly, and the Almighty to act unjustly!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101977051/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Job 34:10</a>) For this reason it is impossible for him to look approvingly upon the deeds of wicked men. The Hebrew prophet Habakkuk wrote of him: “You are too pure in eyes to see what is bad; and to look on trouble [with approval] you are not able.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101977051/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Hab. 1:13</a>) He is also a God of truth and, therefore, the Christian apostle Paul spoke of him as the ‘God who cannot lie.’​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101977051/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Titus 1:2</a>.</p>

But what of other Bible accounts about which we may not have so much information? When, for instance, we read in the Bible that Jehovah or persons under his direction executed some wicked people, cities or nations, will we copy Job’s companions and proceed “to pronounce God wicked”? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976405/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Deut. 9:1-5</a>) How much wiser and more modest it would be to conclude that even though we do not know all the facts or issues involved, what took place must have been consistent with Jehovah’s being a “lover of righteousness and justice.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976405/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Deut. 7:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976405/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 23-26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976405/27/2" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> Lev. 18:21-27</a>) That was the conviction of Elihu, a young man who corrected Job and his companions.

<strong>Where Are the Dead?</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> From <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101968005/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Job 34:14, 15</a> we learn that there are two things that man (or any other conscious earthly creature) must have in order to be and stay alive: spirit and breath. There we read: “If he [God] sets his heart upon anyone, if that one’s spirit [Hebrew, <em>ruʹahh</em>] and breath [Hebrew, <em>neshamahʹ</em>] he gathers to himself, all flesh will expire together, and earthling man himself will return to the very dust.” We know that the first man was formed by God out of the “dust of the ground,” that is, the elements taken from the soil. At the time of Adam’s creation, God caused the billions of cells in his body to live, to have in them the force of life. This active life force is what is meant here by the word “spirit” (<em>ruʹahh</em>). But for the life force to continue in each of Adam’s billions of cells, they needed oxygen, and this was to be provided by breathing. So, God next “breathed into his nostrils the breath [<em>neshamahʹ</em>] of life.” Then Adam’s lungs began to function and thereby sustain by breathing the life force in his body cells.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101968005/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Genesis 2:7</a>, <em>AV.</em></p>

<strong>‘The Spirit Returns to God’</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Likewise, the spirit or life-force that makes it possible for man to carry on functions of life in no way differs from the spirit that enables animals to carry on functions of life. On leaving man’s body at death, the spirit does not retain any of the characteristics of the cells. For example, in the case of brain cells, the spirit does not retain the information stored there and continue thought processes apart from these cells. The Bible tells us: “His spirit goes out, he goes back to his ground; in that day his thoughts do perish.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101972572/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 146:4</a>) “If he [the Almighty] sets his heart upon anyone, if that one’s spirit and breath he gathers to himself, all flesh will expire together, and earthling man himself will return to the very dust.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101972572/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 34:14, 15</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">That the spirit or life-force is impersonal is evident in the case of persons that were resurrected from the dead. Nowhere do we read of their remembering a conscious existence during the period of their death. Lazarus, who was dead for four <span id="page28" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>days, said nothing of a conscious existence. Surely, if he had experienced even a semblance of conscious existence, he would have spoken about this, as it would have been of great interest to others, revealing otherwise unknown information.</p>

<strong>Your Soul, Your Spirit and the Hereafter</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Consistent with this basic truth, not once in any of its verses does the Bible say that either human or animal souls are immortal, deathless, cannot be destroyed or cannot perish. There are, however, dozens of scriptures that show that the soul can die or be killed. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968804/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Lev. 23:30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968804/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Jas. 5:20</a>) Even of Jesus Christ the Bible says: “He poured out his soul to the very <span id="page661" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="661" data-before-text="661"></span>death.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968804/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Isa. 53:12</a>) We see, then, that the human soul is the person himself, and when the person dies, it is the human soul that dies.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Much of the misunderstanding about death has been due to the confusion in many persons’ minds as to the meaning of “soul” and “spirit.” The Bible shows they are not the same, as we shall see.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>WHAT IS THE SPIRIT IN LIVING CREATURES?</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">From <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968804/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Job 34:14, 15</a> we learn that there are two things that man (or any other conscious earthly creature) must have in order to be and stay alive: spirit and breath. There we read: “If he [God] sets his heart upon anyone, if that one’s spirit [Hebrew, <em>ruʹahh</em>] and breath [Hebrew, <em>neshamahʹ</em>] he gathers to himself, all flesh will expire together, and earthling man himself will return to the very dust.” Also the Bible speaks of Jehovah God as “the One laying out the earth and its produce, the One giving breath to the people on it, and spirit to those walking in it.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968804/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Isa. 42:5</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">We know that the first man was formed by God out of the “dust of the ground,” that is, the elements taken from the soil. At the time of Adam’s creation, God caused the billions of cells in his body to live, to have in them the force of life. This active life force is what is meant here by the word “spirit” (<em>ruʹahh</em>). But for the life force to continue in each of Adam’s billions of cells, they needed oxygen, and this was to be provided by breathing. So, God next “breathed into his nostrils the breath [<em>neshamahʹ</em>] of life.” Then Adam’s lungs began to function and thereby sustain by breathing the life force in his body cells.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968804/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Gen. 2:7</a>, <em>AV.</em></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">This was similar to the case of certain newborn babies. Although there is life in the baby when born, it sometimes does not begin to breathe right after birth. The doctor finds it necessary to spank the child to make it start breathing, for without breath the child would soon die. So, too, the life in Adam’s body cells had to be sustained by the breathing process in order for Adam to carry on the activities of a living person.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Whereas the human soul is the living person himself, the spirit is simply the life force that enables that person to be alive. The spirit has no personality, nor can it do the things a person can do. It cannot think, speak, hear, see or feel. In that respect, it might be likened to the electric current of a car’s battery. That current can ignite the fuel to make the engine produce power, cause the headlights to shine, sound the horn, or cause the car’s radio to produce voices and music. But, without the engine, headlights, horn or radio, could that battery current do any of these things by itself? No, for it is merely the force that enables the equipment to perform and do such things.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">This spirit or life force is found in all living creatures, being passed on from parents to offspring at the time of conception. Thus, God told Noah that he would cause a flood of waters “to bring to ruin all flesh, in which the active force [<em>ruʹahh,</em> spirit] of life is,” both of animals and men.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968804/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Gen. 6:17</a>, <em>margin,</em> 1953 edition; see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968804/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ge 7:15,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968804/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 22</a>, <em>AV,</em> marginal reading.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Because they all have this same life force or spirit, man and the animals die in a similar manner. For that reason, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968804/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 3:19, 20</a> says: “There is an eventuality as respects the sons of mankind and an eventuality as respects the beast, and they have the same eventuality. As the one dies, so the other dies; and they all have but one spirit [<em>ruʹahh</em>] . . . All are going to one place. They have all <span id="page662" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="662" data-before-text="662"></span>come to be from the dust, and they are all returning to the dust.”</p>

Notice that Elihu, in describing Jehovah, did not limit his remarks to God’s dealings with Job. He made the all-encompassing declaration: “God himself does not act wickedly, and the Almighty himself does not pervert justice.” Then Elihu added that Jehovah “has not shown partiality to princes and has not given more consideration to the noble one than to the lowly one, for all of them are the work of his hands.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976405/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Job 34:19</a>.</p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">23.

In making provision for human judges to deal with the problems and possible misconduct of individuals, Jehovah commanded the judges: “You must not be partial in judgment. You should hear the little one the same as the great one.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976405/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Deut. 1:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976405/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 16:18-20</a>) Was that required simply to avoid a cause of unrest? No, it was expected because in that way these judges would properly reflect the characteristics of their God. We read: “It is not for man that you judge but it is for Jehovah; and he is with you in the matter of judgment. . . . For with Jehovah our God there is no unrighteousness or partiality or taking of a bribe.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976405/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">2 Chron. 19:6, 7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976405/31/1" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> Ex. 23:6, 7</a>.</p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">24.

We should also see it as an indication that even regarding matters that are yet future we can be sure that He will act in accord with the standards He has set and followed in the past.</p>

<strong>Jehovah Healed His Pain</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>Elihu offered Job some frank counsel: “You said in my hearing, . . . ‘I am pure, without transgression; I am clean, without error. But God finds reasons to oppose me.’” Elihu went right to the heart of the problem, asking: “Are you so convinced that you are right that you would say, ‘I am more righteous than God’?” He could not allow such reasoning to pass. “You are not right in saying this,” the young man said.

<strong>A Lesson in How to Handle Problems</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Was the righteousness of Job really the main issue? Elihu drew Job’s attention to an unbalanced viewpoint. “You have said, ‘My righteousness is more than God’s,’” he explained. “Look up to heaven and see, and behold the clouds, that they are indeed higher than you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995126/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Job 35:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995126/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 5</a>) Just as the clouds are much higher than we are, so Jehovah’s ways are higher than our ways. We are not in a position to judge the way he does things. “Therefore let men fear him. He does not regard any who are wise in their own heart,” Elihu concluded.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995126/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Job 37:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995126/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Isaiah 55:9</a>.</p>

All intelligent creatures in the heavens and on earth owe their existence to him. Nothing anyone can do could change the supreme position Jehovah God occupies toward all creation.

If you are righteous, what do you give him, or what does he receive from your hand?

And yet no one has said, ‘Where is God my Grand Maker?’ . . . He is the One teaching us more than the beasts of the earth, and he makes us wiser than even the flying creatures of the heavens.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101998030/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 35:9-11</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Elihu’s words underscore that we humans are not the true center of meaning.

<strong>God’s Wisdom Evident in Nature</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“He is the One teaching us more than the beasts of the earth, and he makes us wiser than even the flying creatures of the heavens.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008321/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">JOB 35:11</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">BIRDS possess amazing abilities. They perform aerial maneuvers that are the envy of aircraft designers. Some species navigate thousands of miles of featureless ocean and arrive unerringly at their destination.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Another outstanding talent of birds​—one that further reveals the wisdom of their Maker—​is the ability to communicate by means of calls and songs. Consider some examples.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>Bird Talk</strong></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Some species of birds start to communicate even before they are hatched. A female quail, for instance, lays up to eight eggs, at the rate of one egg a day. If all the eggs developed at a uniform rate, they would hatch over an eight-day period. The mother would then face the difficult task of keeping track of active, week-old chicks while still incubating an unhatched egg. Instead, a clutch of eight quail chicks will all break out of their shells within a six-hour period. How is that possible? A key reason, researchers have suggested, is that quail embryos communicate with one another from inside the eggs and somehow orchestrate the almost simultaneous hatch.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">When birds mature, it is usually the male of the species that sings. He does so particularly during mating season to mark his territory or to attract a mate. Each of the thousands of species of birds has its own language, so to speak, and this helps the females identify mates of their own species.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span id="page5" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>Birds sing mainly in the early morning and at sunset, and for good reason. There is less wind and background noise at those times. Researchers have discovered that the songs of birds carry up to 20 times better in the morning and in the evening than they do in the middle of the day.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">While males are most often the singers, both males and females utter a variety of calls, or short bursts of sound, that have distinct meanings. Chaffinches, for instance, have a vocabulary of nine different calls. They utter one type of call to warn of a threat from the air​—such as a patrolling bird of prey—​but emit a different call to warn of a threat approaching from the ground.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>A Superior Gift</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The instinctive wisdom of birds is certainly impressive. But when it comes to communication skills, humans are much more impressive. God has made humans “wiser than even the flying creatures of the heavens,” says <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008321/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 35:11</a>. Unique to humans is the ability to convey abstract, complex thoughts and ideas through sounds produced by the vocal cords or by gestures.</p>

No one ever taught him: “How unsearchable his judgments are and past tracing out his ways are! For ‘who has come to know Jehovah’s mind, or who has become his counselor?’” No one! “Jehovah himself gives wisdom; out of his mouth there are knowledge and discernment.” He is the omniscient One, the all-knowing One, “the One telling from the beginning the finale.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 11:33, 34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Prov. 2:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Isa. 46:10</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Rightly Elihu exclaimed: “Who is an instructor like him?” For he is “the One teaching us more than the beasts of the earth, and he makes us wiser than even the flying creatures of the heavens.” Most fittingly he is termed “your Grand Instructor.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 36:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 35:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Isa. 30:20</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">To be taught by Jehovah means to have insight and enjoy peace; it means knowing how to benefit ourselves truly by being made to walk in the right ways: “I shall make you have insight and instruct you in the way you should go.” “All your sons will be persons taught by Jehovah, and the peace of your sons will be abundant.” “I, Jehovah, am your God, the One teaching you to benefit yourself, the One causing you to tread in the way in which you should walk.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 32:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Isa. 54:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 48:17</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>WHAT JEHOVAH TEACHES</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">What does Jehovah teach those who are willing to be taught by him?

<strong>Jehovah Healed His Pain</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>Above all, Elihu spoke in defense of Jehovah God. Powerfully he summarized a profound truth: “It is unthinkable for the true God to act wickedly, for the Almighty to do wrong! . . . The Almighty does not pervert justice.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502019376/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 34:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502019376/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 12</a>) As an example of Jehovah’s merciful justice, Elihu reminded Job that Jehovah had not stepped in and punished Job for uttering rash and disrespectful words. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502019376/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 35:13-15</a>) And rather than pretending to have all the answers, Elihu humbly acknowledged: “God is greater than we can know.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502019376/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 36:26</a>.</p>
