Babylon, by her military conquests, brought other lands to ruin and is, therefore, called a “ruinous mountain.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Jer. 51:24, 25</a>) A psalm relating Jehovah’s activities against warring men depicts him as being “enveloped with light, more majestic than the mountains of prey.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Ps. 76:4</a>) The “mountains of prey” may represent aggressive kingdoms.

Regarding Jehovah, David said: “You have made my mountain to stand in strength,” probably meaning that Jehovah had exalted David’s kingdom and firmly established it.

With reference to this choosing, David wrote: “The mountainous region of Bashan is a mountain of God [that is, created by God]; the mountainous region of Bashan is a mountain of peaks. Why do you, O you mountains of peaks, keep watching enviously the mountain that God has desired for himself to dwell in? Even Jehovah himself will reside there forever. . . . Jehovah himself has come from Sinai [where he first revealed his presence to the entire nation of Israel] into the holy place.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Ps. 68:15-17</a>) The mountainous region of Bashan may be said to reach its crest in Mount Hermon and, therefore, this mountain may be meant by the words the “mountain of God” and the “mountain of peaks.” Although Mount Hermon towers far above Mount Zion, Jehovah chose the less conspicuous location for his place of dwelling.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">After the temple was built on Mount Moriah, the term “Zion” came to include the temple site and therefore Zion remained God’s holy mountain.

There is no evidence that such a thing ever took place in connection with the literal temple at Jerusalem. But there is evidence of a fulfillment upon the Christian congregation of spiritual Israel, which is associated with the spiritual temple of Jehovah God. The invitation to become part of spiritual Israel began to be extended to non-Jews in the year 36 C.E. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/63/0" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Acts 10:34, 35</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:9, 10</a>.)

The fact that the “mountain of the house of Jehovah” was to be above mountains and hills would point to the exalted position of true worship, for mountains and hills anciently served as sites for idolatrous worship and for sanctuaries of false deities.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/0" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Deut. 12:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/1" data-bid="68-2" class="b"> Jer. 3:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/2" data-bid="68-3" class="b"> Ezek. 18:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/3" data-bid="68-4" class="b"> 11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/4" data-bid="68-5" class="b"> 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/5" data-bid="68-6" class="b"> Hos. 4:13</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong><em>Obstacles</em></strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">At times mountains represent obstacles.

Therefore, when the psalmist spoke of Jehovah’s righteousness as being like “mountains of God” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/72/0" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Ps. 36:6</a>) he may have meant that Jehovah’s righteousness is immovable. Or, since mountains are lofty, this may point to the fact that God’s righteousness by far transcends that of man.

The truth is that we all need help at times​—to cope with a weighty problem, to endure a painful loss, to bear up under a difficult trial. When needing help, people often turn to a caring friend. Sharing a burden with such a friend may make it easier to bear. But there is only so much that a fellow human can do to help. Besides, others may not always be in a position to respond when help is needed.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> There is, however, a Helper who has unlimited power and resources. Furthermore, he assures us that he will never forsake us. He is the One identified by the psalmist who with full confidence declared: “My help is from Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004923/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 121:2</a>) Why was this psalmist convinced that Jehovah would help him? To answer that question, let us examine <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004923/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 121</a>. Doing so will enable us to see why we too can confidently look to Jehovah as our Helper.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>An Unfailing Source of Help</strong></p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 3.

When these words were recorded, Jehovah’s temple was situated in Jerusalem. That city, located high in the mountains of Judah, was Jehovah’s figurative place of dwelling. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004923/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 135:21</a>) The psalmist may have raised his eyes to the mountains of Jerusalem on which Jehovah’s temple was built, confidently looking to Jehovah for help. Why was the psalmist so sure that Jehovah could help him? Because He is “the Maker of heaven and earth.” In effect, the psalmist was saying, ‘Surely there is nothing that can prevent the all-powerful Creator from helping me!’​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004923/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:26</a>.</p>

In a representative sense, therefore, that city was the place of his residence. So the psalmist raised his eyes to the mountains, evidently those of Jerusalem, and appealed to the grand Creator, Jehovah, for aid.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979886/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Ki. 8:30,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979886/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 44, 45;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979886/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Dan. 6:10</a>.</p>

<strong>Children, Do You Obey Jehovah?</strong><br/><p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"><sup>26</sup></span> We are living in a momentous time in human history, not from the standpoint of the remarkable inventions man has produced, but from the standpoint of Jehovah’s purposes. It is the long-foretold time of the end for the present wicked world. Shortly Jehovah will terminate its existence in the battle of Armageddon and usher in a new world of righteousness. It is a serious time for children as well as adults, because children that do not obey Jehovah will not be among the survivors of that battle. God will not preserve them into his new world merely because they are children. This is evident from the fact that he did not preserve the young children through the flood of Noah’s day just because they were children. It is also shown in the book of Ezekiel that just because you are young is no reason for God’s keeping you alive. Ezekiel wrote: “Slay utterly the old man, the young man and the virgin, and little children and women; <span id="page495" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="495" data-before-text="495"></span>but come not near any man upon whom is the mark.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962603/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ezek. 9:6</a>, <em>AS</em>) Your being children who worship and serve Jehovah as he has commanded and who have the mark of protection—ah yes, that will mean preservation and life for you.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">27.

If you cannot, then take immediate steps so that you can. Gain an extensive knowledge of Jehovah’s written Word and purposes and use that knowledge regularly in the ministry. Do not fail to be at congregational meetings of the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses. Be wise by walking the path of obedience to Jehovah before Armageddon, that you may be alive after Armageddon.</p>

But though we are in the period of moral darkness and spiritual thick gloom of the earthly national groups, Jehovah never gets drowsy and falls asleep as a guardian of his people. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974925/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Isa. 60:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974925/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Ps. 121:4</a>) So he is never unaware of wicked things that His enemies try to do secretly as under cover of darkness. The covert dreadful or dread-inspiring things by which the enemy tries to damage and destroy our spirituality are not to be feared.

<strong>Word Pictures in the Bible—Do You Understand Them?</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The book of Psalms is packed with word pictures that describe different facets of Jehovah’s personality. For example, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009326/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 84:11</a> speaks of Jehovah as “a sun and a shield” because he is the Source of light, life, energy, and protection.

Jehovah is like a shade to his people, protecting them from the scorching heat of calamity. Note that Jehovah is said to be at the “right hand.” In ancient warfare, the soldier’s right hand was to some extent unprotected by the shield, which was held in the left hand. A loyal friend might provide protection by standing and fighting at the soldier’s right. Like such a friend, Jehovah loyally stands beside his worshipers, ever ready to help them.</p>

Protection was generally furnished by a loyal friend standing on the warrior’s right. Like such a dependable friend, Jehovah God provides ‘shade on the right hand.’</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">With Jehovah as guardian, a person will be protected from adversity comparable to sunstroke during the day and freezing cold during the night, when the moon is seen in the sky. In fact, Jehovah will guard his servants from all calamities that could result in their lasting hurt. Both now and in the future, he will provide such protection when a person goes out of his home and when he returns.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Surely, then, all who have Jehovah as their Helper need not be anxious.

So they will continue standing firmly as his approved servants.</p>

<strong>Moon</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">While guided by the moon as a time indicator in determining their months and festival seasons, the Israelites were to remain free from the practice of moon worship that was prominent in the nations around them. The moon-god Sin was the city god of Ur, the capital of Sumer, from whence Abraham and his family departed for the Promised Land. Though the inhabitants of Ur were polytheistic, the moon-god Sin, a male deity, was the supreme god to whom their temple and altars were primarily devoted. Abraham <span id="page1177" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1177" data-before-text="1177"></span>and his party traveled from Ur to Haran, which was another major center of moon worship. Abraham’s father, Terah, who died in Haran, apparently practiced such idolatrous worship. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Gen. 11:31, 32</a>) In any case these circumstances add weight to the significance of Joshua’s warning to Israel prior to their entry into the Promised Land, as recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Joshua 24:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 14</a>: “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel has said, ‘It was on the other side of the River [Euphrates] that your forefathers dwelt a long time ago, Terah the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor, and they used to serve other gods.’ And now fear Jehovah and serve him in faultlessness and in truth, and remove the gods that your forefathers served on the other side of the River and in Egypt, and serve Jehovah.”</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Job also lived among moon worshipers and he faithfully rejected their practice of kissing the hand to the moon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 31:26-28</a>) The neighboring Midianites used moon-shaped ornaments, even placing them on their camels. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Judg. 8:21,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 26</a>) In Egypt, where both Abraham and later the people of Israel resided, moon worship was prominently practiced in honor of the moon-god Thoth, the Egyptian god of measures. Every full moon the Egyptians sacrificed a pig to him. He came to be worshiped in Greece under the title of Hermes Trismegistus (Hermes Thrice Greatest). Moon worship, in fact, extended all the way to the western hemisphere, where ancient ziggurat temples dedicated to the moon have been found in Mexico and Central America. Note, too, that in English the second day of the week still derives its name from the Anglo-Saxon worship of the moon, Monday originally meaning “moon-day.”</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The moon worshipers attributed powers of fertility to the moon and looked to it to make their crops and even their animals grow. In Canaan, where the Israelites finally settled, the worship of the moon was carried on by the Canaanite tribes with the accompaniment of immoral rites and ceremonies. There the moon was sometimes worshiped under the symbol of the goddess Ashtoreth (Astarte). Ashtoreth was said to be the female consort of the male god Baal, and the worship of these two frequently ensnared the Israelites during the period of the Judges. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Judg. 2:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 10:6</a>) King Solomon’s foreign wives brought the contamination of moon worship into Judah. Foreign-god priests directed the people of Judah and Jerusalem in making sacrificial smoke to the sun, moon and stars, a practice that continued until King Josiah’s time. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Ki. 11:3-5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/20/2" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> 2 Ki. 23:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/20/3" data-bid="21-4" class="b"> 13, 14</a>) When Jezebel, the daughter of the pagan king Ethbaal who ruled the Sidonians, married King Ahab of Israel she also brought with her the worship of Baal and, apparently, of the moon-goddess Ashtoreth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Ki. 16:31</a>) The Israelites again met up with moon worship during their exile in Babylon, where the times of the new moons were considered propitious by the Babylonian astrologers for making forecasts of the future.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Isa. 47:12, 13</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">God’s Word should have served as a protection for the Israelites against such moon worship. It showed the moon to be simply a luminary and a convenient time indicator, but devoid of personality. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Gen. 1:14-18</a>) At the time of their approaching Canaan Jehovah specifically warned the nation of Israel that they should not worship him as being represented by his heavenly creations. Anyone practicing such worship was to be stoned to death. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Deut. 4:15-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 17:2-5</a>) By his prophet Jeremiah, God later declared that whether they were kings, priests, prophets or of the common people, such ones should become as “manure upon the face of the ground.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Jer. 8:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Some have tried to read into the text at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 33:14</a> an evidence of pagan influence or a superstitious attitude toward the moon. In the <em>Authorized Version</em> this text speaks of the “precious things put forth by the moon.” However, as more modern translations show, the sense of the word “moon” here is actually “months” or “lunar months” and basically refers to the monthly periods in which the fruits ripen.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Similarly, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Psalm 121:6</a> has been held by some to indicate a belief in the idea of illness caused by exposure to the moonlight. By reading the entire Psalm, however, it becomes evident that such assumption is unfounded, since the Psalm rather expresses in poetical form the assurance of God’s protection against adversity’s stroke under all circumstances and at all times, whether in the sunlit day or the moonlit night.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Still others have taken exception to the term “lunatick” found in the <em>Authorized Version</em> at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Matthew 4:24 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> Matthew 17:15</a>. This expression comes from the Greek word <em>se·le·ni·aʹzo·mai</em> and literally means “stricken by the moon.” In modern translations it is rendered by the word “epileptic.” Matthew’s use of this common Greek term for an epileptic on these two occasions does not mean that he attributed such illness to the moon nor that the Bible so teaches, but simply indicates that he used the word that was evidently, among Greek-speaking people of that time, the currently understood name for an epileptic. In this regard, we might note that the term “lunacy” is today primarily a legal term used by the courts to designate a degree of insanity, even though they do not attribute such insanity to the effects of the moon. Christians today similarly continue to use the name Monday for the second day of the week even though they do not view it as a day sacred to the moon.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>IN THE COMMON ERA</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">In the days of Christ Jesus and the apostles, moon worship was not in practice among the Jewish people. They did, of course, observe the new moons in accord with the Law covenant. The new moon of each month is still observed by Orthodox Jews as a minor day of atonement for sins committed during the month just ended.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Nisan 14, when the moon was approaching fullness, marked the time of the celebration of the Passover and also the time of the initiation by Jesus of the memorial supper or the Lord’s Evening Meal in memory of his death.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matt. 26:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 20,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/29/2" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> 26-30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/29/3" data-bid="30-4" class="b"> 1 Cor. 11:20-26</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">With the entrance of the new covenant, replacing the Law covenant, some of the Jewish Christians, as well as others, tended to hold to the practice of the celebration of the new moons as well as of the sabbath days, as shown by Paul’s corrective counsel at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Colossians 2:16, 17 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013040/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> Galatians 4:9-11</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"></p>

You people are so happy!” The observation was by no means unique. Time and again the public press has commented upon the happiness of the Witnesses at their assemblies, that they seem to get so much joy out of their religion.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Their joyful state being noticed by men of goodwill toward God attracts these to the New World society. Like the psalmist, they long to ‘see the goodness to God’s chosen ones, that they may rejoice with the rejoicing of his nation.’ As these progress they feel about New World associations as did David: “I rejoiced when they were saying to me: ‘To the house of Jehovah let us go.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962408/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 106:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962408/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 122:1</a>.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1962408/0">a</a></p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">This is as it should be, for in ancient times Jehovah’s people were specifically commanded to rejoice: “You must . . . rejoice in every undertaking of yours, you and your households, because Jehovah your God has blessed you.” And the apostolic command to Jehovah’s Christian witnesses is: “Always rejoice in the Lord. Once more I will say, Rejoice!”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962408/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deut. 12:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962408/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Phil. 4:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962408/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 3:1</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">No question about it, Jehovah God has blessed his people in modern times. He gives them many reasons for rejoicing. To mention but a few of them: The establishment of God’s kingdom, the manifestation of Christ’s presence, the return to their “land” of pure worship from bondage to modern Babylon, the holy spirit poured out upon God’s people, the appearance of a “great crowd” of desirable ones from all nations, the ever-increasing light and the prosperity of the New World society.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962408/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hag. 2:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962408/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Rev. 7:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962408/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 11:15</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Knowledge alone is not sufficient to have enduring joy. For joy to continue it must be cultivated. It must have the right soil. It is the result of a right course of conduct in the climate of peace and harmony with God’s people. Among the things that will cause one to have joy is generosity. At the same time generosity is the result of joy. Israel’s generosity in contributing material for the temple brought them joy; the joy of the brothers of Macedonia caused them to manifest generosity.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962408/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962408/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962408/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 2 Cor. 8:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">And so we find it today. Joyful Witnesses are eager to help; helping results in further joy. When they build a Kingdom Hall, work at an assembly or voluntarily give of their time and means on other occasions, joy results. Jesus said that there was more happiness in giving, and this is especially true of giving the truth about God’s kingdom to men of goodwill from house to house and in their homes by means of Bible studies.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962408/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Association is another great aid to joy. All of us need it, for it is not good for us to be alone. But let us exercise care that seeking association of others is not from any materialistic motives.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">True, one may have preferences and there is nothing wrong with that since even Jesus had preferences. The twelve apostles were preferred by Jesus to the rest of his disciples; but even of these Jesus preferred three: Peter, James and John; and of these three one was Jesus’ favorite: the beloved apostle John. But Jesus freely spent himself for all as he had opportunity and as they appreciated their need.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962408/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Mark 6:31-34</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">So let us also be concerned with others in seeking association. Let us take note of the weak, the irregular ones, the shy, the backward and humble “lambs” and go out of our way to greet them with a smile, a cheery handshake and edifying, upbuilding conversation. And, best of all, let us try to draw them out, to get them to express themselves and so receive the greater joy of giving.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962408/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:14</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">For our New World associations to be conducive to joy they must be kept wholesome. The human heart is deceitful, the flesh is weak, and unless we are careful we can easily be ensnared by our weaknesses, to our lasting regret. We also want to guard against becoming burdensome to others or letting our associations be limited to mere mundane things such as food and drink.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">And finally, for our associations to be joyful let us make allowances for others, not rejecting any because of immaterial peculiarities, and being natural ourselves.

<strong>Congregating All Nations at Jehovah’s House</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> “But who were all those witnesses of Jehovah at Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds the year you assembled a quarter of a million people in New York city? That was no little flock!” That’s correct, they were a great crowd, part of those Jesus called his “other sheep.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">John 10:16</a>) They hope to live here on earth in God’s new world, under the righteous rule of Christ Jesus and his heavenly congregation.

That there would be a great crowd associated with the true congregation we have further proof, in the words of John, another apostolic foundation: “I saw, and, look! <em>a great crowd,</em> which no man was able to number, out of all nations and tribes and <span id="page560" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="560" data-before-text="560"></span>peoples and tongues, . . . crying with a loud voice, saying: ‘Salvation we owe to our God, who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Rev. 7:9, 10</a>) No mention is made of attributing salvation to any mysterious third person of a supposed “trinity,” for the Christian congregation does not hold to Christendom’s mistaken belief in this regard. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">John 14:28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/33/1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 11:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/33/2" data-bid="34-3" class="b"> 15:28</a>) The congregation does rely on God’s holy spirit or active force to perform its ministry, of course, but salvation comes from Jehovah God through Christ.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>PRIVATE STUDY NOT ENOUGH</strong></p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 9. Is it enough for one to stay at home and read the Bible? Why do you answer thus?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> “If I have my Bible and read it, is that not enough? Why must I congregate?” Because it is Jehovah’s will for you. If you really study your Bible closely you will soon learn this. You must be congregated to be part of God’s “household.” Christians are commanded to “consider one another to incite to love and right works, not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and all the more so as you behold the day drawing near.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Heb. 10:24, 25</a>) If it is your custom to absent yourself from meetings of the congregation, how can you encourage and incite others to love Jehovah and fulfill his will? How can others encourage and incite you? Jehovah did not inspire the Scriptures in order to isolate believers. Paul said he wrote to Timothy in order “that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in God’s household, which is the congregation of the living God, a pillar and support of the truth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">1 Tim. 3:15</a>) You serve as part of the pillar supporting God’s Word of truth in your community when you are congregated, working closely with the congregation. Moreover, a wise person must do more than <em>read</em> God’s law. Jehovah says he must also <em>listen:</em> “A wise person will listen and take in more instruction.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Prov. 1:5</a>) In order to listen he must be assembled where Jehovah’s servants are speaking. To keep away from Jehovah and the doing of his will is to show an adulterous spirit. “Look! the very ones keeping away from you will perish. You will certainly silence every one adulterously leaving you. But as for me, the drawing near to God is good for me. In the Sovereign Lord Jehovah I have placed my refuge, to declare all your works.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Ps. 73:27, 28</a>) No adulterer will inherit God’s kingdom.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Eph. 5:5</a>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu">10.

Dozens of families in the rural sections have abandoned their homes and moved to larger cities, because, where they lived, it became nearly impossible to meet together and even more difficult to witness for God’s kingdom. What practical wisdom! Evidently their viewpoint is that of the psalmist: “I rejoiced when they were saying to me: ‘To the house of Jehovah let us go.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Ps. 122:1</a>) If, as a Christian, you are determined to walk with Jesus, you must go where he is. The Revelation shows he is walking in the midst of his congregation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Rev. 2:1</a>) Wherever two or three are congregated in his name, he is among them.

Read about it at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Luke 10:1-12</a>. Specific instructions are given on how to effectively preach and teach Jehovah’s law to men of good will. First-century Christians also gave close attention to “public reading, to exhortation, to teaching.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:13</a>) You will rejoice to find this same studious attention to Bible reading and study at each of the five weekly meetings of the Christian congregation today. The theocratic ministry school is a good example. Men and women, young and old, give practice sermons, followed by personal counsel. Isaiah’s words have come true: They will all be “taught by Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Isa. 54:13</a>) Early in the week, usually on a Tuesday night, the congregation copies the early Christian example and meets in a private home in your community; in fact, in several homes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Rom. 16:5</a>) Find out where the nearest group meets in your neighborhood. Become a regular participant. Jehovah will pour you out such a blessing in wisdom and understanding that you will not be able to contain it. The desire to communicate what you learn to others will well up in you. Go along with the members of that service center and learn how they say “Come” to others. Do this and you will take the first steps toward becoming a true Christian. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Rom. 10:10</a>) Your godly devotion will prove to have power.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960684/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:5</a>.</p>

The city’s defenders did not have to cover an extensive area, leaving certain parts vulnerable to enemy attack. Furthermore, Jerusalem was surrounded by mountains and steep valleys on the east, south and west, greatly limiting the space available for building. Since the city’s inhabitants were living close together and depended upon one another for help and protection, the physical closeness could well represent the spiritual unity of the whole nation when all the tribes of Israel assembled for worship.

The answer is the same in each instance—to <span id="page534" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="534" data-before-text="534"></span>obtain fruitage to his praise. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952646/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 61:3</a>, <em>AS</em>) That is the purpose. Jesus’ words are straight to the point, using the illustration of the vine: “Every branch in me not bearing fruit he takes away, and every one bearing fruit he cleans, that it may bear more fruit.” Make no mistake! The heavenly Father, as owner and cultivator, looks for and expects fruit, then more fruit; for, said Jesus, “My Father is glorified in this, that you <em>keep bearing much fruit</em> and [thus] prove yourselves my disciples.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952646/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 15:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952646/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 8</a>, <em>NW</em>) That is to say, continual increase as a result of mature growth. This is not an unreasonable expectation, for the Father graciously makes every provision through his Word, and through his organization, and by the aid of his spirit, for such to be accomplished. Do not get in a panic because you have only just come to a knowledge of these things. God is not impatient. He is like the farmer who “keeps waiting for the precious fruit of the earth, exercising patience over it . . . You, too, exercise patience; make your hearts firm”.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952646/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jas. 5:7, 8</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 5, 6.

Many religious sects, both Christian and non-Christian, teach that good living and development of character, evidenced by patience, kindness, etc., are the fruitage of godly devotion. Do not be deceived. Let us see how Jesus himself answered the question. After speaking of the vine, he explained to his disciples (and to us) how he had brought them into a very close relationship as friends and had appointed them to “keep bearing fruit”. Finally he defines exactly what he means by bearing fruit: “You, in turn [after receiving the spirit], are to <em>bear witness.”</em> He later confirmed this when he said: “You will be witnesses of me . . . to the most distant part of the earth.” Today, that means the witness respecting the enthroned King and his kingdom, as Jesus foretold.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952646/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 15:16,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952646/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952646/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Acts 1:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952646/4/3" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> Matt. 24:14</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Additionally and inseparably linked with bearing witness is the result, namely, the increase in the number of those who respond and also become disciples.

It is “a city that is compact together”, “a true city all joined together as one.” (<em>Ro</em>) Because Jehovah’s house, the temple, is therein, it is the center of united worship. It is also the governing center for the whole nation, with its throne of judgment and of the reigning King. It is not a silent city; it resounds with praise and thanksgiving. Jehovah’s people flock to it for that very purpose. This is the strong bond that unites all true Israelites, both the “brethren” (the spiritual house) and their “companions”, their “friends” (<em>Ro</em>), constraining all to continually seek and pray for its peace and prosperity, knowing “they shall prosper who love thee”.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 8.

Are you seeking to play your part in publicizing Jehovah’s name in the spirit of thanksgiving, never doing anything to mar the company’s peace and unity, but always seeking its prosperity and increase? Or do you, though long enough in the truth to know better, hold an undying grudge against someone in the company who, in the ancient past, did you some injury, which has never been cleared up (perhaps through wounded pride on both sides)? If, however, that person continues to be a member of the company, attending the meetings and sharing in the witness work, then, for the sake of peace and unity in that company, you should sincerely accept that person as a fellow member. Leave his judgment with the Lord. We are not asking you to make a special friend of that one, but we do say you should not adopt an attitude of perpetual disfellowship personally, unless the company as a whole does so. Are you not yourself an undeserving recipient of mercy and long-suffering? Your own prosperity and growth to maturity in Jehovah’s service and favor depend on your love for him and his organization and all keeping within its bounds.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952646/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 122:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952646/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Heb. 12:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952646/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 1 John 4:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952646/9/3" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> 20, 21</a>, <em>NW.</em></p>

Hence, Paul’s words about the free “Jerusalem above” can now be applied to “the remaining ones of her seed” against whom the “dragon,” Satan the Devil, continues to “wage war.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985204/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Galatians 4:26</a>) Earthly Jerusalem was strongly built and closely knit together in the days of David, who said: “I rejoiced when they were saying to me: ‘To the house of Jehovah let us go.’ Our feet proved to be standing within your gates, O Jerusalem.

Especially was unity evident at national festivals, when the 12 tribes of Israel joined in united worship of Jehovah at the sacred tabernacle in Jerusalem. And during the reign of their shepherd-king David, the tribes remained united not just due to fleshly ties but primarily because of the organized worship of their God. Yes, Jerusalem was the divinely approved center of united, organized worship under the one priesthood taken from the tribe of Levi and the family of Israel’s first high priest, Aaron, the older brother of the prophet Moses. Moreover, all 12 tribes were in the one Law covenant that divided them off from all the demon-worshiping nations.</p>

<strong>The Joy of Sharing in True Worship</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">From what follows, though, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979928/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 122</a> doubtless was designed to express the sentiments of any worshiper going up to Jehovah’s sanctuary. We read: “Our feet proved to be standing within your gates, O Jerusalem. Jerusalem is one that is built like a city that has been joined together in oneness, to which the tribes have gone up, the tribes of Jah, as a reminder to Israel to give thanks to the name of Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979928/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 122:2-4</a>) Thus, this psalm represents the worshipers as coming from outside Jerusalem, then pausing immediately after entering through the gates to view the city. What greets their eyes? Jerusalem is a city “joined together in oneness.” Houses were built close together, as if ‘joined in oneness.’ This was the usual arrangement for a city in ancient <span id="page29" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>times. Compact and surrounded by strong fortifications, such a city was easier to defend than a large, sprawled-out metropolis would have been. The city’s defenders did not have to cover an extensive area, leaving certain parts vulnerable to enemy attack. Furthermore, Jerusalem was surrounded by mountains and steep valleys on the east, south and west, greatly limiting the space available for building. Since the city’s inhabitants were living close together and depended upon one another for help and protection, the physical closeness could well represent the spiritual unity of the whole nation when all the tribes of Israel assembled for worship. Their giving “thanks to the name of Jehovah” meant their thanking the Most High, the One represented by the name.</p>

<strong>Lasting Rule Depends on Promoting True Worship</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">King David was now like a cornerstone laid in Zion on which a royal house of rulers <span id="page541" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="541" data-before-text="541"></span>was to be built to represent the heavenly King, Jehovah. He expressed appreciation in prayer.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Sam. 7:18-29</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">David’s successor was his son named Solomon, meaning “Peaceable.” He was also called by Jehovah Jedidiah, meaning “Beloved of Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Sam. 12:24, 25</a>) What an honor it was for Solomon to be born in Zion! It greatly surpassed the honor of being born in famous Babylon. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 87:2-6</a> describes this honor: “Jehovah is more in love with the gates of Zion than with all the tabernacles of Jacob [Israel].

Jehovah himself will declare, when recording the peoples: ‘This is one who was born there.’”</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Solomon could actually be said to be born as king in 1037 B.C.E. Then, according to the covenant with David, Jehovah especially became a Father to him. David had subdued all the nations within the God-ordained boundaries of the Promised Land; so Solomon reigned from the river of Egypt on the south to Kadesh on the Orontes, eighty miles north of Damascus.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:23</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Jehovah gave David inspired plans for building the temple. Besides this, David gathered together much material and great contributions of money by himself and the people. He also contributed the exact piece of land for the temple structure. <em>He realized that the nation’s prosperity depended on God,</em> and that they were really only giving God glory with the things He himself owned and provided for them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:10-16</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The temple plot was more than 2,400 feet above the Mediterranean sea level, on Mount Moriah, where Abraham had built an altar to offer up his son Isaac. A spur extending southward that came to be called “Ophel” connected it with Mount Zion. From any direction the worshipers would have to go <em>up</em> to the temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ps. 122:1-4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Isa. 2:2</a>) At the time that David had bought the plot a plague was on, and Jehovah’s angel had directed the building of an altar there. David offered a sacrifice and said: “This is the house of Jehovah the true God, and this is an altar for burnt offering for Israel.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Chron. 21:14 to 22:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 2 Sam. 24:10-25</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="ss"><strong>WORSHIP OF JEHOVAH EXALTED</strong></p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">David had Solomon anointed as king when David’s fourth son Adonijah planned to take over the throne.

<strong>The Joy of Sharing in True Worship</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Not only was Jerusalem the center of true worship but the city also was the seat of government.

Love for the city because of what it was would be in harmony with God’s will. Therefore, all lovers of the city, that is, all lovers of true worship and justice, could rest assured of divine favor and would enjoy security, ‘freedom from care’ or anxiety. The prayerful expression of the psalmist is that within the rampart or fortifications of Jerusalem there would be peace, that the welfare of the city be secure. This security would include the dwelling towers or the fortified royal residences.</p>

<strong>Why Expect God to Listen to Prayer?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The Bible also gives us a number of reasons why we may expect God to listen to prayer. And let it not be overlooked that <span id="page70" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="70" data-before-text="70"></span>prayer not only includes petitions, supplications and requests, but also praise and thanksgiving.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>GOD COMMANDS US TO PRAY</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">First of all, we may expect God to listen to prayer because he himself commands that his people pray to him, and his Word gives many examples of faithful servants of God praying; so much so that the Bible may well be said to be The Book of Prayer. Thus the psalmist commands: “Pray for the peace of Jerusalem!” And Jesus told his apostles: “Pray continually, that you may not enter into temptation.” The apostle Paul repeatedly urged those to whom he wrote to pray and to continue in prayer: “Persevere in prayer.” “Pray incessantly.” And the disciple James, a half brother of Jesus, wrote: “Therefore openly confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may get healed. A righteous man’s supplication, when it is at work, has much force.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 122:6</a>, <em>RS;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 26:41;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Rom. 12:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 1 Thess. 5:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/1/3" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> Jas. 5:16</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">As for examples of prayer, we find these in the Bible from the first book to the last. Abel’s sacrificial offering might be said to have been a prayer acted out, and it most likely was accompanied by a verbal petition. And the apostle John closes the book of Revelation with two brief prayers. And what a man of prayer David was! Of his more than seventy psalms, nearly all are either prayers or contain prayers in the form of praise directed to God, thanksgiving and/or petition.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Prayer occupied a prominent place in the life of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Repeatedly we read of his praying, when he was baptized, when he fed the multitudes, just before he chose the twelve apostles, at which time he continued all night in prayer, as well as of his going off by himself time and again to meditate and pray. Especially do we note his praying on the last day that he was on earth as a man: at the institution of the memorial of his death, then afterward the prayer recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 17</a>, three times in the garden of Gethsemane and twice on the torture stake.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Then there is the example of the apostle Paul. He touches on the subject of prayer some seventy-five times in his letters. How important he considered praying can be seen by his urging Christians to pray right after he had told them to put on the whole armor of God: “With every form of prayer and supplication you carry on prayer on every occasion . . . and with supplication in behalf of all the holy ones, also for me, that ability to speak may be given me with the opening of my mouth, with all freeness of speech to make known the sacred secret of the good news. . . . that I may speak in connection with it with boldness as I ought to speak.” Did King David, Jesus Christ and the apostle Paul expect God to listen to prayer?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eph. 6:18-20</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>FOR THE SAKE OF HIS NAME</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The fact that God commands us to pray and fills his Word, the Bible, with examples of his servants praying should suffice to show that they can expect God to listen to prayers. But, it may be asked, Why? Why should this great Eternal One, the Most High and Universal Sovereign, listen to the prayers of his servants? One overriding or compelling reason is that the reputation of his name is involved. Thus Moses repeatedly pleaded with God successfully on the basis of God’s name and fame being involved: “Why, O Jehovah, should your anger blaze against your people. . . ? Why should the Egyptians say, ‘With evil intent he brought them out in order to kill them’?” “Were you to put this people to death as one man, then the <span id="page71" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="71" data-before-text="71"></span>nations who have heard of your fame would certainly say this, ‘Because of Jehovah’s not being able to bring this people into the land about which he swore to them he proceeded to slaughter them in the wilderness.”’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex. 32:11, 12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Num. 14:15, 16</a>.</p>

May peace continue within your rampart, freedom from care within your dwelling towers. For the sake of my brothers and my companions I will now speak: ‘May there be peace within you.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959922/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 122:6-8</a>) Agreeably with such prayer, the name Jerusalem means “The Possession of Peace,” or, “Founded Peaceful.” It was there at the site of Jerusalem that the priest Melchizedek was King of Salem, which title means “King of Peace.” Jehovah God swore that his Son Jesus Christ was to be a priest-king like Melchizedek forever. In harmony with this, one of the names of the glorified Son of God was to be Prince of Peace. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959922/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. 14:18-20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959922/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Ps. 110:1-4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959922/12/2" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> Heb. 6:20 to 7:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959922/12/3" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> Isa. 9:6, 7</a>) With such a title, how could Jesus Christ as Princely King of Peace be the spiritual head of a congregation that becomes split, disturbed and uproarious with dissension, enmity, jealousy, competition, rivalry and sectarianism, as Christendom is today and has ever been? He could not. But as King he can enforce and does maintain peace within the “congregation, which is his body.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959922/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Eph. 1:22, 23</a>) By his angels he gathers out peace-disturbers.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959922/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 13:41</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 9.

So Paul wrote this exhortation to the Christian overseer Timothy: “I therefore exhort first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, offerings of thanks, be made concerning all kinds of men, concerning kings and all those who are in high station, in order that we may go on leading a calm and quiet life with full godly devotion and seriousness. This is right and acceptable in the sight of our Savior, God, whose will is that all kinds of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959922/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:1-4</a>) Praying that way, the obedient servants of Jehovah God our Savior could never take part in revolts, revolutions, uprisings, rebellions, secessions, conspiracies and any kind of popular action, disturbance or violence against persons in high political or governmental station. Under any and all sorts of government, even under ban and proscription, faithful witnesses of Jehovah lead a calm and quiet life.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu">10.

If Christians seek to pursue peace with people outside the congregation, then certainly they ought to pursue it with those inside the congregation, who are their own dedicated brothers.

<strong>The Joy of Sharing in True Worship</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In view of the importance of Jerusalem, the psalmist continues: “Ask, O you people, for the peace of Jerusalem. Those loving you, O city, will be free from care. May peace continue within your rampart, freedom from care within your dwelling towers.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979928/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 122:6, 7</a>) It would be most appropriate for the Israelites to pray for the peace or welfare of Jerusalem as the capital of the nation and the center of worship. Love for the city because of what it was would be in harmony with God’s will. Therefore, all lovers of the city, that is, all lovers of true worship and justice, could rest assured of divine favor and would enjoy security, ‘freedom from care’ or anxiety. The prayerful expression of the psalmist is that within the rampart or fortifications of Jerusalem there would be peace, that the welfare of the city be secure. This security would include the dwelling towers or the fortified royal residences.</p>

And how can we make sure that our eyes remain fixed on him as we face life’s complex challenges? Centuries ago, a psalmist acknowledged the need for us to raise our eyes to Jehovah for help in times of need. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018483/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 123:1-4</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> He compared our looking to Jehovah with the way a servant looks to his master. What did the psalmist mean by that? Well, not only does a servant look to his master for food and protection but the servant needs constantly to watch his master to discern his wishes and then to carry them out. In a similar way, we daily need to search God’s Word to ascertain what Jehovah’s will is for us personally and then to follow that direction. Only then can we be <span id="page13" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>sure that Jehovah will show us favor in our time of need.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018483/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eph. 5:17</a>.</p>

<strong>Where Are Your Eyes?</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">This is the encouragement we can draw from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980007/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 123</a>.

<strong>Obedience Leads to Life</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> The nation of Israel walked in the same way as King Saul. It was obedience from the heart God required. Israel showed no disposition to attend to his counsel, and God well knew it. They never learned that Jehovah always laid greater stress upon sincere and willing obedience than on external observances. Paul, writing on the same matter to the Hebrews, says, “Hence when he comes into the world he says: ‘“You did not desire sacrifice and offering, but you prepared a body for me. You did not approve of whole burnt-offerings and sin offering.” Then I said, “Look! I am come (in the roll of the book it is written about me) to do your will, O God.”’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952683/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Heb. 10:5-7</a>, <em>NW</em>) Here with singular <span id="page561" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="561" data-before-text="561"></span>beauty is expressed the heart condition of Christ Jesus and the great truth that all outward observances are valueless without obedience and the servant’s full concurrence in the will of God. Christ Jesus surrendered himself completely to the doing of God’s will. From henceforth all his mind, heart, soul and strength would be devoted to the accomplishment of Jehovah’s will. From this time forward he would claim no rights, for he was wholly dedicated to God’s holy service. Everything he had, all human hopes and ambitions, were all placed on God’s altar to be used in the precious ministry, and he gave them with gratitude of heart.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 8. What are some of God’s commands for us today, and why must we obey?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Even as he always performed Jehovah’s command, we must do the same. The Scriptures bring to our attention the commands which in this time of the end we must obey in order to have his approval. If we disregard them we shall meet with his displeasure. For example, we are commanded to “declare good news to the poor, . . . to preach a release to the captives”; to “sing [praise] unto Jehovah”; to ‘bring good tidings, publish peace and salvation’; to ‘preach this good news of the kingdom in all the inhabited earth’; to ‘make a path for the returning exiles, bank up a causeway, clear out the stones; signal to the nations’; to “warn the wicked of his way to turn from it, . . . [lest he] die in his iniquity”; and to say “to them that are bound, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Show yourselves”. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952683/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Luke 4:18, 19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952683/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Matt. 24:14</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952683/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Isa. 12:5, 6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952683/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 52:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952683/27/2" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> 62:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952683/27/3" data-bid="28-4" class="b"> Ezek. 2:3-5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952683/27/4" data-bid="28-5" class="b"> 33:7-9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952683/27/5" data-bid="28-6" class="b"> Isa. 49:9</a>, <em>AS</em>) These are just a few of the many commands Jehovah God and Christ Jesus have laid upon the faithful ones. We cannot disobey. Faithful performance is mandatory. The Most High voices the instructions through the King Christ Jesus, and he, the greater-than-Moses, will see God’s will is done. The word from the throne of Jehovah in the heavens sounds to all God’s people today: ‘Hear ye him!’ Peter emphasized this by saying: “In fact, Moses said: ‘Jehovah God will produce for you from among your brothers a prophet like me. You must listen to him according to all the things he speaks to you. Indeed, any soul that does not listen to that Prophet will be completely destroyed from among the people.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952683/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Acts 3:22, 23</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>JOYFUL AND WILLING OBEDIENCE</strong></p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 9. With whom is Jehovah pleased, and what question should we ask ourselves?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Those who obey Jehovah’s command with a joyful and willing spirit and who do not complain are the ones who please <em>him.</em> Such a person keeps his ears open to Jehovah’s commands and watches for opportunities of service. “Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maid unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes look unto Jehovah our God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952683/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ps. 123:2</a>, <em>AS</em>) Such responsive hearts are delightful. Earthly parents find a great deal of pleasure in prompt and cheerful obedience, for it is rightly accepted as the measure of the child’s love. Their enforced obedience is not an expression of love. Strict disciplinary penalties for misconduct compel soldiers in armies to be obedient to their superiors, whether they like it or not. Servants have to be obedient to their masters, or some form of punishment results. Jehovah has endowed his human creatures with freedom to obey or disobey that thereby he may prove them, and rewards will depend upon joyful obedience. Each one, therefore, should ask himself the question, Am I joyfully and willingly obeying Jehovah’s commands?</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu">10. Should one examine himself? How? Offer examples and show what should result.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Let us also remember that to perform this world-wide preaching service much <span id="page562" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="562" data-before-text="562"></span>equipment is necessary. For instance, literature and all forms of advertising are used, which means printing presses and other machinery to produce them. An organization created to operate in all parts of the world supervises and directs the Lord’s work now performed by hundreds of thousands of Christian people who have escaped this doomed evil system of things, and who now form one great unified congregation. So some are invited to share in such work as attending to tables, cleaning floors, windows, clothes, or operating machines, packing literature for shipment to other parts of the field, general maintenance, or on Kingdom farms. This is all necessary because these faithful slaves of the Lord have to be fed, housed, clothed, prepared for other duties and made responsible for the services which have to be performed in the field. Sometimes a person’s usefulness might be hindered by his own attitude toward the Lord’s work entrusted to him. He may have allowed his assignment to become commonplace, like any other job a person might obtain in the world. By losing sight of the grand privilege he has of demonstrating his love for Jehovah by willing, joyful service, he may be inclined to murmur and complain, or begin to think no one else works as hard or has as little time to himself. Perhaps it would be well for such a person to examine himself. Why should he be feeling sorry for himself? Did he not dedicate all he had to Jehovah? Is he not glad that his life is filled then with privileges of service to Jehovah? After sober consideration, he will be grateful that he has much to do. Is it not better that way than having too little? Of course it is! Let more come, for all we want to do is to serve Jehovah and not let discomforts or personal inconveniences interfere. Then and only then can we say Yes to the question, Am I joyfully obeying Jehovah’s commands?</p>

<strong>“Our Help Is in the Name of Jehovah”</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">On the third day the clatter of the commander’s boots, jangling with spurs, echoed through the corridors. Cries of “Heil Hitler!” from the guards were followed by the footsteps of the official commission. “Are you still a Bible Student?” “Yes.” “And do you plan to remain one?” “Of course!” Bang! The door was slammed shut. Several cells farther along: “Still a Bible Student?” The brother gave a lengthy witness. The same thing happened at the third cell. Then cell 6, the fourth door bearing the posted instructions: “Utmost solitary confinement!” No questions were asked here. Instead the commander explained to the commission; “The one in there must definitely be sent along, because he tried to desert his working group by excusing himself from a rattle-brained guard and then trying to go out to preach the gospel.” The SS officer’s “thumbs down” sign with both hands told everything. There was no mistaking it, we were to be taken away. But where? Those gestures with the arms and hands looked like <span id="page670" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="670" data-before-text="670"></span>something was to be sunk into the water or into a pit. Did it mean that all 500 or perhaps even more of our brothers would be murdered?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">To our surprise nothing happened and the talk about taking the Bible Students away began to die out. How strange! All the plans had been made, lists had been drawn up, plans of march had been devised, instructions had been given and now all was quiet. Five or six days after the commander’s visit we heard a voice cry out from cell 20: “Head watchman, have you already read? A whole transport of prisoners from a concentration camp had an accident in the Polish swamps, caused by a misplaced switch. All prisoners were killed to the very last man.”</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">A trainload of prisoners from a concentration camp? Killed in the Polish swamps? What were they doing there? They could not have been Witnesses, because we would have missed such a large group by now. Could it be that a shipment of prisoners scheduled to follow Jehovah’s witnesses had left first by mistake? Had they met death intended for us? We were reminded of Jehovah’s words at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962806/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 43:4, 5</a>: “Owing to the fact that you have been precious in my eyes, you have been considered honorable, and I myself have loved you. And I shall give men in place of you, and national groups in place of your soul. Do not be afraid, for I am with you.”</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">It would fill volumes to relate how secret baptisms were carried out in camp, how the bread and wine for the Memorial were smuggled in to us, how Jehovah provided spiritual food that strengthened us, and how much sacrifice, vigilance and tact were necessary. Even through indescribable tortures Jehovah enabled his servants to preserve their integrity. Often he provided escape from the most critical situations.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">How glad I was that years before the storm broke I made use of every opportunity to attend meetings and impress upon my mind the various Bible prophecies and their present-day fulfillments! I wrote them down and often repeated them during lectures. This helped me to remember them. Later, during the years of persecution, I had many opportunities to recount many of these things to those who were hungering and thirsting for spiritual food. The Nazis were unable to rob me of the riches stored away in my mind, because it had become part of me.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The fall of the Nazis freed us from our tormentors. Immediately we began to fulfill our preaching commission on a larger scale. It was then that my wish to become a full-time minister became a reality, without any neglect of my family responsibilities. This was real cause for joy. My former employer offered me a well-paid position, but I decided that there could be no better job than serving only Kingdom interests. In 1946 I became a member of the German Bethel family and was soon joined there by my wife. What a wonderful privilege to serve the God of eternity here in the Bethel home in Wiesbaden, where we still live!</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Serving Jehovah is the way of immeasurable happiness, no matter what momentary tests are permitted to come upon faithful Christians. We need have no fear of what man can do, for we have seen the truth of the psalmist’s words: “Had it not been that Jehovah proved to be for us when men rose up against us, then they would have swallowed us up even alive. when their anger was burning against us. Blessed be Jehovah, who has not given us as a prey to their teeth. Our soul is like a bird that is escaped from the trap of baiters. The trap is broken, and we ourselves have escaped. Our help is in the name of Jehovah, the Maker of heaven and earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962806/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 124:2, 3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962806/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 6-8</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"></p>

Then there would have passed over our soul the waters of presumptuousness.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980045/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 124:1-5</a>) If Jehovah had not come to the aid of his people, the destruction that their enemies would have brought upon them would have been comparable to the ground’s splitting apart during an earthquake and swallowing up everyone alive in the affected area. It also would have been similar to the effects of an overwhelming deluge that sweeps away everything in its path. The proud, swelling waves would have engulfed the Israelites completely.</p>

<strong>“Our Help Is in the Name of Jehovah”</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">On the third day the clatter of the commander’s boots, jangling with spurs, echoed through the corridors. Cries of “Heil Hitler!” from the guards were followed by the footsteps of the official commission. “Are you still a Bible Student?” “Yes.” “And do you plan to remain one?” “Of course!” Bang! The door was slammed shut. Several cells farther along: “Still a Bible Student?” The brother gave a lengthy witness. The same thing happened at the third cell. Then cell 6, the fourth door bearing the posted instructions: “Utmost solitary confinement!” No questions were asked here. Instead the commander explained to the commission; “The one in there must definitely be sent along, because he tried to desert his working group by excusing himself from a rattle-brained guard and then trying to go out to preach the gospel.” The SS officer’s “thumbs down” sign with both hands told everything. There was no mistaking it, we were to be taken away. But where? Those gestures with the arms and hands looked like <span id="page670" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="670" data-before-text="670"></span>something was to be sunk into the water or into a pit. Did it mean that all 500 or perhaps even more of our brothers would be murdered?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">To our surprise nothing happened and the talk about taking the Bible Students away began to die out. How strange! All the plans had been made, lists had been drawn up, plans of march had been devised, instructions had been given and now all was quiet. Five or six days after the commander’s visit we heard a voice cry out from cell 20: “Head watchman, have you already read? A whole transport of prisoners from a concentration camp had an accident in the Polish swamps, caused by a misplaced switch. All prisoners were killed to the very last man.”</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">A trainload of prisoners from a concentration camp? Killed in the Polish swamps? What were they doing there? They could not have been Witnesses, because we would have missed such a large group by now. Could it be that a shipment of prisoners scheduled to follow Jehovah’s witnesses had left first by mistake? Had they met death intended for us? We were reminded of Jehovah’s words at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962806/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 43:4, 5</a>: “Owing to the fact that you have been precious in my eyes, you have been considered honorable, and I myself have loved you. And I shall give men in place of you, and national groups in place of your soul. Do not be afraid, for I am with you.”</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">It would fill volumes to relate how secret baptisms were carried out in camp, how the bread and wine for the Memorial were smuggled in to us, how Jehovah provided spiritual food that strengthened us, and how much sacrifice, vigilance and tact were necessary. Even through indescribable tortures Jehovah enabled his servants to preserve their integrity. Often he provided escape from the most critical situations.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">How glad I was that years before the storm broke I made use of every opportunity to attend meetings and impress upon my mind the various Bible prophecies and their present-day fulfillments! I wrote them down and often repeated them during lectures. This helped me to remember them. Later, during the years of persecution, I had many opportunities to recount many of these things to those who were hungering and thirsting for spiritual food. The Nazis were unable to rob me of the riches stored away in my mind, because it had become part of me.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The fall of the Nazis freed us from our tormentors. Immediately we began to fulfill our preaching commission on a larger scale. It was then that my wish to become a full-time minister became a reality, without any neglect of my family responsibilities. This was real cause for joy. My former employer offered me a well-paid position, but I decided that there could be no better job than serving only Kingdom interests. In 1946 I became a member of the German Bethel family and was soon joined there by my wife. What a wonderful privilege to serve the God of eternity here in the Bethel home in Wiesbaden, where we still live!</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Serving Jehovah is the way of immeasurable happiness, no matter what momentary tests are permitted to come upon faithful Christians.

<strong>Freedom from Fear of Spiritual Dangers</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> The language here is figurative, pictorial, for we are not literal birds in danger of the trap of a literal “birdcatcher.” But the likening of us to birds “under the very shadow of the Almighty One” is carried forward here. The psalmist David likens himself and his companions to birds that have actually been caught in the trap, but from which they have been delivered. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 124:1-8</a> he says: “Let Israel now say, ‘Had it not been that Jehovah proved to be for us when men rose up against us, then they would have swallowed us up even alive, . . . Blessed be Jehovah, who has not given us as a prey to their teeth. Our soul is like a bird that is escaped from the trap of baiters. The trap is broken, and we ourselves have escaped. Our help is in the name of Jehovah, the Maker of heaven and earth.’” In this case the “baiters” were not literal “birdcatchers,” and the “bird” that escaped from their broken trap was not a literal bird, but refers to “our soul,” the soul or life of the nation of Israel.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">16.

It was the trap sprung by Babylon the Great and her political, judicial, military accomplices. In the spring of the postwar year of 1919 Jehovah broke that trap for his repentant remnant and did not let the “baiters,” the symbolic birdcatchers, sink their teeth into the flesh of the trapped “bird.” Thereafter the escaped remnant of spiritual Israel were taken into the “secret place of the Most High,” and “under the very shadow of the <span id="page732" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="732" data-before-text="732"></span>Almighty One.” Yet a “trap” is still set for them by a “birdcatcher,” and Jehovah must deliver them from being caught in it.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">17. Who is the symbolic “fowler” or “birdcatcher” as pointed out in <em>Watch Tower</em> issues of 1904 and 1927?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Who, then, is that “birdcatcher,” and what is his “trap”? It has long been discerned and agreed to that the symbolic “birdcatcher” is Satan the Devil. Away back in the issue of March 1, 1904, of the <em>Watch Tower,</em> the article entitled “Under His Wings!” commented on <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Psalm 91:3</a> and said regarding “the snare of the fowler,” that this was “the deceptions of Satan, in which all those not protected shall stumble.” (Page 74, column 2) A much later issue of <em>The Watch Tower</em> agreed with that and said: “It seems certain that ‘the fowler’ here named by the prophet is the Devil, and that his snare consists of his methods employed, and by his organization, working in divers and numerous deceptive ways to entrap those who claim to be servants of the Most High God.” (Page 231, paragraph 37, of the <em>Watch Tower</em> issue of August 1, 1927, presenting the first of a series of three articles on <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalm 91</a>, <em>Authorized Version</em>) Of all the symbolic “fowlers” or “birdcatchers” referred to in the Bible, Satan the Devil is the outstanding one.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">18. Who are likened to birdcatchers by Jeremiah and Hosea, and what are their methods?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Describing the method of the symbolic birdcatcher, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Jeremiah 5:26</a> says: “For among my people there have been found wicked men. They keep peering, as when birdcatchers crouch down. They have set a ruinous trap. It is men that they catch.” How false prophets acted like birdcatchers in the apostate nation of Ephraim (the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel), <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Hosea 9:8</a> said: “As regards a prophet, there is the trap of a birdcatcher on all his ways.” The great “fowler” or “birdcatcher,” Satan the Devil, is out to catch men, those who are lodging “under the very shadow of the Almighty One.”</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">19.

The symbolic “trap” that Satan the Devil has set for those who trust in Jehovah God as their “refuge” and “stronghold” is the earthly organization that is opposed to God’s organization, namely, Satan’s visible organization.

(b) According to direct statement, to which organization did Jesus and his disciples belong?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> Notably from the year 1922 onward it was pointed out from the inspired Scriptures that Jehovah God has an organization, including his organized “remnant” on earth, and that there is an enemy <span id="page733" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="733" data-before-text="733"></span>organization, Satan’s organization, with an invisible demonic part and a visible earthly part. It was pointed out that, if one does not belong to Jehovah’s visible organization, then one belongs to the Adversary’s organization. Jesus Christ, to whom <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Psalm 91</a> applies in the first instance, belonged to the organization of Jehovah God. His faithful disciples also belonged to that same divine organization. That was why, when leading his eleven faithful apostles in prayer, he said to God: “They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">John 17:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 16</a>) This, he said, was why the world hated them.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">John 15:18-20</a>.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">21, 22.

Generally, the trapper sets out some bait to lure the unsuspecting creature within range of the trap and to trigger the trap by nibbling at the bait. The “birdcatcher” Satan the Devil is a great Baiter. What bait does he use to lure people into his visible worldly organization, to become victimized in it as in a trap? The bait is the selfish attractions of this world, its promising opportunities for selfishly gaining wealth, fame, position and power. Warning against such deceptive bait, Jehovah God inspired the Christian apostle John to write to those lodging “under the very shadow of the Almighty One”:</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> “Do not be loving either the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him; because everything in the world​—the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one’s means of life—​does not originate with the Father, but originates with the world. Furthermore, the world is passing away and so is its desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">1 John 2:15-17</a>.</p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">23.

Those of us who have come out of Satan’s visible organization into the “secret place of the Most High,” why should we desire to be lured back into that doomed organization? We do not care to be like the onetime Christian Demas, concerning whom the apostle Paul in a final letter before his death said: “Demas has forsaken me because he loved the present system of things, and he has gone to Thessalonica.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">2 Tim. 4:10</a>) Religious Babylon the Great, including Christendom, has been caught and is held fast in the trap of Satan’s visible organization and will suffer early destruction with it. In obedience to God’s command in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Revelation 18:4</a> we have come out of Babylon the Great and out of Satan’s trap in which she is caught. By not going back to her, we can keep on enjoying the benefits of our deliverance from the “trap of the birdcatcher.” Under the “very shadow of the Almighty One” we have spiritual security.</p>

<strong>“Our Help Is in the Name of Jehovah”</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">On the third day the clatter of the commander’s boots, jangling with spurs, echoed through the corridors. Cries of “Heil Hitler!” from the guards were followed by the footsteps of the official commission. “Are you still a Bible Student?” “Yes.” “And do you plan to remain one?” “Of course!” Bang! The door was slammed shut. Several cells farther along: “Still a Bible Student?” The brother gave a lengthy witness. The same thing happened at the third cell. Then cell 6, the fourth door bearing the posted instructions: “Utmost solitary confinement!” No questions were asked here. Instead the commander explained to the commission; “The one in there must definitely be sent along, because he tried to desert his working group by excusing himself from a rattle-brained guard and then trying to go out to preach the gospel.” The SS officer’s “thumbs down” sign with both hands told everything. There was no mistaking it, we were to be taken away. But where?

Five or six days after the commander’s visit we heard a voice cry out from cell 20: “Head watchman, have you already read?

<strong>Survival Depends upon God</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In view of the danger, there certainly was good reason to thank the Most High for his help. Appropriately, the psalmist continued with an expression of gratitude in behalf of Israel: “‘Blessed be Jehovah, who has not given us as a prey to their teeth. Our soul is like a bird that is escaped from the trap of baiters. The trap is broken, and we ourselves have escaped. Our help is in the name of Jehovah, the Maker of heaven and earth.’”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980045/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 124:6-8</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The enemy, like a predatory beast, desired to devour the Israelites. But Jehovah did not permit that to happen. The Israelites were like a bird caught in a trap. Then, suddenly, Jehovah provided escape. Truly, God’s people had sound reason for looking to the name of Jehovah for aid, that is, to the person represented by that name. This One will never fail his people, for he is the Almighty Creator.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">When experiencing great difficulties, God’s servants today can take comfort in the words of this psalm. It may look as though all of them will perish off the earth. But Jehovah God will never permit the enemy to exterminate his people. Relief is certain to come.</p>

<strong>The Security of God’s Servants</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">While Jehovah God may permit his people to suffer, he will not allow the situation to continue to a point of hopelessness. The psalmist expressed this conviction: “For the scepter of wickedness will not keep resting upon the lot of the righteous ones, in order that the righteous ones may not thrust out their hand upon any wrongdoing.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980204/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 125:3</a>) The seeming triumph of the wicked and their domination will end. The oppressive rule will not be prolonged to such an extent that righteous persons crack under the strain and, perhaps in desperation, resort to improper ways for gaining relief or even turn their back on the Creator, becoming wicked themselves.​—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980204/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 7:7</a>.</p>

<strong>Theocratic Organization Re-established</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span id="page727" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="727" data-before-text="727"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Peace must govern Jehovah’s people, and righteousness must rule them. This is possible only when we have Jehovah’s King ruling over us in righteousness by means of a theocratic organization. Jehovah God has raised up the great Signal on high by installing Christ Jesus as King, and all lovers of theocratic government have assembled to that one gathering point, to his feet as his subjects. The King now reigns in righteousness over them. In behalf of peace among them and for the sake of righteousness he has established a visible arrangement among them to fulfill the prophecy that “princes shall rule in justice”. This prophecy sets up the standard of conduct in office for such “princes”, in order that the organization on earth may be kept clean, righteous. Those theocratically made servants in the organization must exercise justice and impartiality, with heavenly wisdom. Only in that way can they be faithful representatives of the King of righteousness, the Greater Melchizedek, Christ Jesus, and be permitted by him to continue in office. He has angels at hand to usher out those who turn unjust.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu">10. So what standards are not followed, and who not set in office?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> In harmony with this, no false, hypocritical, selfish standards are followed in the appointment of servants, and no improper men are honored with official, responsible service. Stubborn fools and base, impious, knavish persons are recognized for what they are and are rejected as unfit for good service of any kind. It is just as chapter thirty-two of Isaiah goes on to say, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951882/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa 32 verses 5-8</a> (<em>AT</em>): “No more will the fool be called noble, nor the knave be counted princely. For the fool will speak folly, and his mind will plot mischief, so as to practice ungodliness, and to utter falsehood regarding the LORD [Jehovah], to leave the hungry unsatisfied, and to hold back drink from the thirsty. The arts also of the knave are evil; he hatches plans to ruin the needy with lying words, even when the poor man’s plea is right. But the noble man plans noble things, and on noble things he takes his stand.”</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">11. How is <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951882/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 125:3</a> thus carried into effect?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> There is no room for religious hypocrites among Jehovah’s theocratic people. If they want to practice ungodliness and the foolishness of this world; if they utter falsehood against Jehovah and do not want to work but selfishly enjoy things for themselves while they leave those who hunger and thirst after truth and righteousness unsatisfied, they have no place in official position, no, no place among Jehovah’s witnesses. The King of Righteousness will have his angels pitch them out from those who are lifting up the Signal of the Kingdom. In these days of warfare waged by the Greater Assyrian, Satan the Devil, against the remnant, Jehovah by his reigning King is protecting his organized people, just as the mountains surrounded faithful Jerusalem of old. For our day Jehovah has decreed: “The sceptre of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; that the righteous put not forth their hands unto iniquity.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951882/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 125:3</a>, <em>AS</em>) He keeps the organized ruling powers of this world from overwhelming his people and from wielding influence over them to force them into iniquity or lawlessness against Jehovah God leading to their being cast away by Him. He will also watch over the internal condition of his people and see that no lawless person rises up and stays in control among his people who are seeking righteousness and meekness as subjects of the King of righteousness. And the “princes” whom the King has appointed by his theocratic organization to “rule in justice” <span id="page728" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="728" data-before-text="728"></span>will be watchful, too. Each one will serve as a protection.</p>

They set themselves to rebuilding Jerusalem and its temple and making their long-desolate homeland like a paradise. No longer was there any reason for them to beat themselves upon the breasts in “lamentation over the desirable fields, over the fruit-bearing vine,” that had been left to desolation by the Babylonian conquerors in 607 B.C.E.

Upon such restored Christians, who were spiritual Israelites, there came an outpouring of spirit from on high. It reminded Bible Students of the Pentecost of 33 C.E., although it was not accompanied by visible “tongues as if of fire” that sat upon the heads of the disciples miraculously enabling them to speak different, unlearned foreign languages.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976806/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 2:1-4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976806/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Joel 2:28, 29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976806/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Isa. 32:15</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 8.

That was now their main purpose in living. According to the Bible, that was the reason why God preserved them alive through World War I and freed them from bondage to Babylon the Great. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976806/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 24:9-14</a>) So they reassembled their scattered members and reorganized for carrying out the Kingdom witnessing world wide down to the end.

All of this they did free from the “spirit of cowardice.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976806/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Tim. 1:7</a>) So now, with the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976806/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isaiah 43:10</a> ringing in their ears, those anointed champions of Jehovah and of his kingdom by Christ took up the Bible-supported name “Jehovah’s Witnesses.”</p>

<strong>More Liberation Prophecy to Be Fulfilled</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> At this eventful time the seventh angel blows his trumpet, that is, after the 1,260 days ended in 1918. Then it is that these wonders can come to pass. “And the seventh angel blew his trumpet. And loud voices occurred in heaven saying: ‘The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will rule as king for ever and ever.’ And the twenty-four persons of advanced age who were seated before God upon their thrones fell upon their faces and worshiped God, saying: ‘We thank you, Jehovah God, the Almighty, the one who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and begun ruling as king. But the nations became wrathful, and your own wrath came, and the appointed time for the dead to be judged, and to give their reward to your slaves the prophets and to the holy ones and to those fearing your name, the small and the great, and to bring to ruin those ruining the earth.’ And the temple sanctuary of God that is in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen in his temple sanctuary. And there occurred lightnings and voices and thunders and an earthquake and a great hail.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951526/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Rev. 11:15-19</a>, <em>NW</em>) Is it not so very clear to God’s children how now the many waters, that is, the peoples, the nations, the tongues, have all come under Christ Jesus? The quicker people recognize this fact, the better it will be for them. This is a day of <span id="page441" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="441" data-before-text="441"></span>judgment. It is a day of deliverance. Some know enough of the truth to fight it because it brings responsibilities, but this is taking a very unwise course, since Jehovah offers nothing else. Where else can you go, for Christ Jesus is in control and God makes known his will through his faithful Servant, and that will is the word of life.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 8.

But the “wicked shall do wickedly”, and their hatred for the children of the Most High increases. They know they have no part with the revelations, favors and privileges of the Kingdom, and they see that Jehovah has brought these wonders to pass in our midst, inside the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses. The great, long-standing and marvelous prophecies have been fulfilled in us. Therefore with an unmistakable identity Jehovah’s witnesses are being pointed to by Jehovah’s Word and the facts in modern fulfillment thereof. They are his beloved ones. The wicked know this and see themselves cast out, and so wail and gnash their teeth in chagrin.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 9.

Year after year it becomes more evident. Visions and prophecies are coming to pass through the wonderful things Jehovah is doing for us. “Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the nations, Jehovah hath done great things for them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951526/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 126:2</a>, <em>AS</em>) No one else has been chosen of all the organizations of the world. Jehovah’s witnesses are for signs and wonders in the land. “Bind thou up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples. And I will wait for Jehovah, that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him. Behold, I and the children whom Jehovah hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from Jehovah of hosts, who dwelleth in Mount Zion.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951526/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isa. 8:16-18</a>, <em>AS</em>) Those who profess to love God and claim to be doing his will and are not serving and worshiping with those who know the new world is at hand would be wise to consider their position quickly. If these would simply ask themselves one or two simple questions: Am I conscious of Jehovah’s favor upon the work that I am doing? Do I expect judgment from him as a result of the service being performed, and can I prove from His holy Word that my works are in obedience thereto? Or am I performing some service selfishly? Is it for my own praise or Jehovah’s? Am I learning more about God’s kingdom and its establishment? Can I appreciate the fulfillment of prophecy? If you are still in mystic Babylon, then consider the truths set before you and make haste to leave the condemned organization. “And I heard another voice out of heaven say: ‘Get out of her, my people, if you do not want to share with her in her sins, and if you do not want to receive part of her plagues.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951526/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Rev. 18:4</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">10.

It was intensified from 1933 until the second world war broke out, which provided an opportunity for enemies of Zion to rush at us in a great offensive. This attack was terrific, for all parts of the organization were besieged, but the organization of God took the shock, reeled only momentarily under the world pressure, but the stronghold of Zion stood fast. Satan the ruler of the opposition hordes forcibly took some brothers into his prisons and concentration camps, some he put to death, while on thousands of others he brought privation and much mental as well as physical suffering. But with what result?</p>

<strong>Sower, Sowing</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"></span><strong>Illustrative Use.</strong> Illustrating Jehovah’s care for and blessing on the remnant that returned from Babylon, the psalmist wrote: “Those sowing seed with tears will reap even with a joyful cry. The one that without fail goes forth, even weeping, carrying along a bagful of seed, will without fail come in with a joyful cry, carrying along his sheaves.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004197/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps 126:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004197/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 5, 6</a>) Those returning from Babylon were very happy at their release, but they may have wept when sowing seed in the desolate ground that had been unworked for 70 years. Nevertheless, Jehovah had gathered them back for his name’s sake, and those who went ahead with the sowing and reconstruction work enjoyed fruitage from their labor. For a while, when the temple construction was stopped, Jehovah withheld the land’s fruitage, but through the prophets Haggai and Zechariah the people again were stirred to activity and again received God’s favor.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004197/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Hag 1:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004197/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 9-11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004197/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 2:15-19</a>.</p>

<strong>Share Joyfully with Jesus Christ in Jehovah’s Work</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> Along the same line, take a look at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978406/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 126</a>, entitled “A Song of the Ascents,” one of a group of psalms that the Israelites likely sang on their way up to Jerusalem when they joyfully attended the three annual festivals held there. Like <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978406/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah chapter 12</a>, it tells of those who have come into Zion, God’s organization. Notice how it reads: “When Jehovah gathered back the captive ones of Zion, we became like those who were dreaming.” It seemed too good to be true! And the account goes on to say: “At that time our mouth came to be filled with laughter, and our tongue with a joyful cry.” Then notice the encouraging change in occupation mentioned in the last two verses of the psalm: “Those sowing seed with tears will reap even with a joyful cry. The one that without fail goes forth, even weeping, carrying along a bagful of seed, will without fail come in with a joyful cry, carrying along his sheaves.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978406/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 126:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978406/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 5, 6</a>) Though at first this one had a hard time of it, with seemingly nothing to show for his labor, his diligence in patiently continuing to sow is at last rewarded with a harvest more bountiful than his fondest expectation.</p>

<strong>Sower, Sowing</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The spiritual condition of Israel determined the kind of harvest they received. Jehovah said to them before they entered the Promised Land: “If you continue walking in my statutes and keeping my commandments and you do carry them out, . . . your threshing will certainly reach to your grape gathering, and the grape gathering will reach to the sowing of seed.” The crops would be so bountiful that the harvest would not be finished before the time to sow the next crop. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Amos 9:13</a>.) On the other hand, God warned: “If you will not <span id="page1539" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1539" data-before-text="1539"></span>listen to me nor do all these commandments, . . . you will simply sow your seed for nothing, as your enemies will certainly eat it up.” And he added, “your earth will not give its yield.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Lev. 26:3-5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 14-16,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 20</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Haggai 1:6</a>.) Later, in the prophet Jeremiah’s day Jehovah’s warning proved true for, describing their bad condition, Jehovah said: “They have sown wheat, but thorns are what they have reaped.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jer. 12:13</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>ISRAEL’S LAW GOVERNING SOWING</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In the Law given through Moses, God commanded that the land was to be sown for six years, but no sowing or harvesting was to be done during the seventh year (sabbath year) nor on the Jubilee year. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ex. 23:10, 11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Lev. 25:3, 4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 11</a>) This served to test their faith and to give them more time for pursuit of spiritual things, and also was good for the soil.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Since the land was Jehovah’s, it was, in a sense, holy, and his people were holy. Therefore care had to be taken to prevent any kind of defilement. The touching of a dead body was considered as making a person unclean. Similarly, if the dead body of an unclean animal, for example, a rat or a lizard, fell upon seed when the seed was wet, it was unclean for use, whereas if the seed was dry, it was clean. This was no doubt because the wetness would tend to spread throughout and permeate the seed with the uncleanness.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Lev. 11:31,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 37, 38</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Also, the mixing of different seeds in sowing was not permitted, though seeds of different kinds could be sown, each kind in separate places in the same field. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Lev. 19:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Isa. 28:25</a>) This may have been to keep the Israelites mindful of their separateness and distinctness as God’s people, under his Kingship. If an Israelite violated this law, mixing two sorts of seeds, the entire produce of his field or vineyard became as something “devoted.” It was therefore forfeited to the sanctuary.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Deut. 22:9</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Leviticus 27:28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Numbers 18:14</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>ILLUSTRATIVE USE</strong></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Illustrating Jehovah’s care for and blessing on the remnant that returned from Babylon, the psalmist wrote: “Those sowing seed with tears will reap even with a joyful cry. The one that without fail goes forth, even weeping, carrying along a bagful of seed, will without fail come in with a joyful cry, carrying along his sheaves.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 126:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 5</a>) Those returning from Babylon were very happy at their release, but they may have wept when sowing seed in the desolate ground that had been unworked for seventy years. Nevertheless, Jehovah had gathered them back for his name’s sake, and those who went ahead with the sowing and reconstruction work enjoyed fruitage from their labor. For a while, when the temple construction was stopped, Jehovah withheld the land’s fruitage, but through the prophets Haggai and Zechariah the people again were stirred to activity and again received God’s favor.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Hag. 1:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 9-11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 2:15-19</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong><em>Diligence and generosity</em></strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Solomon set forth a principle in connection with generosity and doing one’s work industriously when he wrote: “He that is watching the wind will not sow seed; and he that is looking at the clouds will not reap.” One who holds back, waiting for a time to come when everything seems to him fully and exactly favorable for the work God has set before him, or who is looking for an excuse to avoid the work, will not receive anything from God. Rather, Solomon counsels to be diligent for, he says in verse five, it is God who “does all things,” and man does not understand all God’s ways of working. Accordingly, he advises: “In the morning sow your seed and until the evening do not let your hand rest; for you are not knowing where this will have success, either here or there, or whether both of them will alike be good.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Eccl. 11:4-6</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The apostle Paul seems to be thinking similarly when he encourages the Christians at Corinth in their generosity in connection with the relief ministration for the brothers at Jerusalem, who had suffered hardships and had lost many of their possessions through persecution leveled against them by the Jews. Paul said: “He that sows sparingly will also reap sparingly; and he that sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. . . . God, moreover, is able to make all his undeserved kindness abound toward you, that, while you always have full self-sufficiency in everything, you may have plenty for every good work. . . . Now he that abundantly supplies seed to the sower and bread for eating will supply and multiply the seed for you to sow and will increase the products of your righteousness.” Then Paul points out the good thing that results in addition to God’s favor and bounty in a material way, namely, that such generosity results in thanks to God and glorification of God, along with the love and prayers of those being helped, in behalf of those extending help. Such develops great unity, with an increase of love in the congregation.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Cor. 9:6-14</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong><em>Preaching the good news</em></strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Jehovah uses the sowing and growing process to illustrate the sure effectiveness of his word. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isa. 55:10, 11</a>) Jesus Christ likened the sowing of seed to preaching the word, the good news of the Kingdom. He was the Sower of the Kingdom truths and John the Baptist had also worked as a sower. Jesus’ disciples were sent out to reap in the fields that had been sown and were white for harvesting. Therefore he said to them: “Already the reaper is receiving wages and gathering fruit for everlasting life, so that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together. . . . One is the sower and another the reaper. I dispatched you to reap what you have spent no labor on. Others have labored [in sowing], and you have entered into the benefit of their labor [by reaping].”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">John 4:35-38</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Again, Jesus likened the preaching work to sowing, in the illustration of the sower. In this parable he pointed out that the conditions under which the seed is sown can affect the sprouting and growing of the seed in the hearts of men.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matt. 13:1-9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 18-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/19/2" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> Luke 8:5-15</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong><em>The wheat and the weeds</em></strong></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">In another illustration Jesus likened himself to a sower of fine seed, and the seed to “sons of the kingdom.” Another sower, an enemy who sows weeds in the field, is the Devil. Here he was evidently foretelling an apostasy to come, when, in and among the Christian congregation, there would be men falsely claiming to be servants of God and attempting to defile the congregation and to draw away the disciples.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Matt. 13:24-30,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 36-43</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Acts 20:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 2 Corinthians 11:12-15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/21/2" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> 2 Thessalonians 2:3-9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/21/3" data-bid="22-4" class="b"> 1 Timothy 4:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/21/4" data-bid="22-5" class="b"> 2 Timothy 4:3, 4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014101/21/5" data-bid="22-6" class="b"> 2 Peter 2:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="ss"><strong><em>‘Sowing with a view to the flesh’</em></strong></p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">The apostle Paul, after enumerating the fruits of the spirit and the works of the flesh, and admonishing each one to prove his own work, said: “Do not be misled: God is not one to be mocked.

<strong>Consolation for the Depressed</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">If your saddened state is due to bitter disappointment in yourself or others, or results from tribulation, remember that trial accomplishes much good when endured. Peter declares that “the person that has suffered in the flesh has desisted from sins, to the end that he may live the remainder of his time in the flesh, no more for the desires of men, but for God’s will.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:1, 2</a>) Yes, tribulation makes us see that our sure hope is in doing God’s will; we come through trial more appreciative of that fact. Apart from discipline, the Christian expects various trials of his faith: “In this fact you are greatly rejoicing, though for a little while at present, if it must be, you have been grieved by various trials, in order that the tested quality of your faith, of much greater value than gold that perishes despite its being proved by fire, may be found a cause for praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:6, 7</a>) Of course, Jehovah is not bringing trials and depression upon you. He is the God of all comfort and it is not desirable with him “for <span id="page184" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="184" data-before-text="184"></span>one of these little ones to perish.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 18:14</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>DOUBTS</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">But what if depression and doubts leave you uncomforted by the Scriptures? Do not assume that Jehovah has become your foe because your faith is weak. Doubts were not unknown among his faithful servants in Bible times. He did not abandon the Israelites for not believing at the beginning, but delivered them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ex. 12:51</a>) Instead of having the apostle Thomas disfellowshiped for doubting eyewitness reports of the Lord’s resurrection, Jesus lovingly helped Thomas get over his unbelief. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">John 20:24-29</a>) Jesus’ fleshly brothers James and Jude did not exercise faith in him until after his death and resurrection, yet their early doubts did not prevent them from becoming devoted and useful servants of his later on. With understanding James could compare the doubting man to “a wave of the sea driven by the wind and blown about.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Jas. 1:6</a>) Sympathetically Jude could instruct Christians by his inspired letter to “continue showing mercy to some that have doubts; save them by snatching them out of the fire.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Jude 22, 23</a>) That one can survive such fiery ordeal is indicated by Paul when writing at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 3:10-15</a>: “But let each one keep watching how he is building on it. For no man can lay any other foundation than what is laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if anyone builds on the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood materials, hay, stubble, each one’s work will become manifest, for the day will show it up, because it will be revealed by means of fire; and the fire itself will prove what sort of work each one’s is. If anyone’s work that he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward; if anyone’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved; yet, if so, it will be as through fire.”</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">In the unhealthy spiritual state where your own prayers seem ineffective, obey James’ instruction and ‘call the older men of the congregation to you, and let them pray over you, greasing you with oil in the name of Jehovah. And the prayer of faith will make you well, and Jehovah will raise you up.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Jas. 5:14, 15</a>) Jehovah’s mature overseers understand your condition. They will rub in the soothing “oil” of comfort from Jehovah’s Word and prescribe a schedule of Bible study and service plus association with zealous Christians, all of which in time will get you over your depressing doubts.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Because there is always happiness in Christian giving, one of the surest antidotes for a depressed, cheerless frame of mind is to seek out others who are “sighing and groaning over all the detestable things that are being done” in this pre-Armageddon era. By comforting them you will bring comfort to yourself. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ezek. 9:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 1:3-7</a>) Many mature Christians can testify to the truthfulness of this, calling to mind <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Psalm 126:5, 6</a>: “Those sowing seed with tears will reap even with a joyful cry. The one that without fail goes forth, even weeping, carrying along a bagful of seed, will without fail come in with a joyful cry, carrying along his sheaves.” Whether in favorable season or in trial and depression, sow the Kingdom seed and reap a happy reward!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Mark 4:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 20</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">We have seen that periods of depression have been endured by faithful servants of Jehovah in pre-Christian, Christian and modern times. Since it is a condition that responds to assistance from Jehovah, his Word and organization, as well as to proper care of the physical man, depressed souls have every reason to be consoled and courageous. Remember, faithful Job was not actually abandoned by Jehovah; Hannah’s disappointment and vexation passed <span id="page185" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="185" data-before-text="185"></span>with the birth of Samuel and five other children; Peter’s denial of the Lord was not unpardonable; Paul’s pressed-down feeling gave way to rejoicing and Thomas’ doubts did not disqualify him in the race for eternal life. Neither must depression or any other test be allowed to disqualify you. Rather, as Paul declared, “no temptation has taken you except what is common to men. But God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear, but along with the temptation he will also make the way out in order for you to be able to endure it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:13</a>) No less is this true of depression. So do not give up in doing what is right. And “may the God who gives hope fill you with all joy and peace by your believing, that you may abound in hope with power of holy spirit.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Rom. 15:13</a>.</p>

<strong>Press On in the Harvest Work!</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> Of great comfort to God’s harvest workers, and especially to those who suffer persecution, are the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001524/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 126:5, 6</a>: “Those sowing seed with tears will reap even with a joyful cry. The one that without fail goes forth, even weeping, carrying along a bagful of seed, will without fail come in with a joyful cry, carrying along his sheaves.” The psalmist’s words about sowing and reaping illustrate Jehovah’s care for and blessing on the <span id="page19" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>remnant that returned from captivity in ancient Babylon. They were very happy at their release, but they may have wept when sowing seed in the desolate ground that had not been worked during their 70-year exile. However, those who went ahead with their sowing and construction activities enjoyed fruitage and satisfaction from their labor.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> We may shed tears when under trial or when we or our fellow believers are suffering for righteousness’ sake.

But if we continue to sow and water, God will make things grow, often beyond our expectations. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001524/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 3:6</a>) This is well illustrated by the results of our distribution of Bibles and Scriptural publications.</p>

<strong>Share Joyfully with Jesus Christ in Jehovah’s Work</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> Along the same line, take a look at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978406/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 126</a>, entitled “A Song of the Ascents,” one of a group of psalms that the Israelites likely sang on their way up to Jerusalem when they joyfully attended the three annual festivals held there. Like <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978406/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah chapter 12</a>, it tells of those who have come into Zion, God’s organization. Notice how it reads: “When Jehovah gathered back the captive ones of Zion, we became like those who were dreaming.” It seemed too good to be true! And the account goes on to say: “At that time our mouth came to be filled with laughter, and our tongue with a joyful cry.” Then notice the encouraging change in occupation mentioned in the last two verses of the psalm: “Those sowing seed with tears will reap even with a joyful cry. The one that without fail goes forth, even weeping, carrying along a bagful of seed, will without fail come in with a joyful cry, carrying along his sheaves.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978406/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 126:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978406/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 5, 6</a>) Though at first this one had a hard time of it, with seemingly nothing to show for his labor, his diligence in patiently continuing to sow is at last rewarded with a harvest more bountiful than his fondest expectation.</p>

<strong>Consolation for the Depressed</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">If your saddened state is due to bitter disappointment in yourself or others, or results from tribulation, remember that trial accomplishes much good when endured. Peter declares that “the person that has suffered in the flesh has desisted from sins, to the end that he may live the remainder of his time in the flesh, no more for the desires of men, but for God’s will.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:1, 2</a>) Yes, tribulation makes us see that our sure hope is in doing God’s will; we come through trial more appreciative of that fact. Apart from discipline, the Christian expects various trials of his faith: “In this fact you are greatly rejoicing, though for a little while at present, if it must be, you have been grieved by various trials, in order that the tested quality of your faith, of much greater value than gold that perishes despite its being proved by fire, may be found a cause for praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:6, 7</a>) Of course, Jehovah is not bringing trials and depression upon you. He is the God of all comfort and it is not desirable with him “for <span id="page184" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="184" data-before-text="184"></span>one of these little ones to perish.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 18:14</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>DOUBTS</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">But what if depression and doubts leave you uncomforted by the Scriptures? Do not assume that Jehovah has become your foe because your faith is weak. Doubts were not unknown among his faithful servants in Bible times. He did not abandon the Israelites for not believing at the beginning, but delivered them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ex. 12:51</a>) Instead of having the apostle Thomas disfellowshiped for doubting eyewitness reports of the Lord’s resurrection, Jesus lovingly helped Thomas get over his unbelief. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">John 20:24-29</a>) Jesus’ fleshly brothers James and Jude did not exercise faith in him until after his death and resurrection, yet their early doubts did not prevent them from becoming devoted and useful servants of his later on. With understanding James could compare the doubting man to “a wave of the sea driven by the wind and blown about.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Jas. 1:6</a>) Sympathetically Jude could instruct Christians by his inspired letter to “continue showing mercy to some that have doubts; save them by snatching them out of the fire.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Jude 22, 23</a>) That one can survive such fiery ordeal is indicated by Paul when writing at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 3:10-15</a>: “But let each one keep watching how he is building on it. For no man can lay any other foundation than what is laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if anyone builds on the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood materials, hay, stubble, each one’s work will become manifest, for the day will show it up, because it will be revealed by means of fire; and the fire itself will prove what sort of work each one’s is. If anyone’s work that he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward; if anyone’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved; yet, if so, it will be as through fire.”</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">In the unhealthy spiritual state where your own prayers seem ineffective, obey James’ instruction and ‘call the older men of the congregation to you, and let them pray over you, greasing you with oil in the name of Jehovah. And the prayer of faith will make you well, and Jehovah will raise you up.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Jas. 5:14, 15</a>) Jehovah’s mature overseers understand your condition. They will rub in the soothing “oil” of comfort from Jehovah’s Word and prescribe a schedule of Bible study and service plus association with zealous Christians, all of which in time will get you over your depressing doubts.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Because there is always happiness in Christian giving, one of the surest antidotes for a depressed, cheerless frame of mind is to seek out others who are “sighing and groaning over all the detestable things that are being done” in this pre-Armageddon era.
