<strong>Samuel, Books of</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="ss"><span id="page1440" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1440" data-before-text="1440"></span><strong>WRITERS AND TIME COVERED</strong></p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Ancient Jewish tradition credits Samuel with the writership of the first part of the book, and Nathan and Gad with the remaining portion. That these three prophets did write is confirmed at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013736/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 29:29</a>. The book itself reports: “Samuel spoke to the people about the rightful due of the kingship and wrote it in a book and deposited it before Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013736/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Sam. 10:25</a>) However, on the basis of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013736/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Samuel 27:6</a>, where there is reference to the “kings of Judah,” numerous scholars place the final compiling of the books of Samuel sometime after the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel came into existence. If the expression “kings of Judah” denotes only Judean kings of the <em>two-tribe kingdom,</em> this would show that the writings of Samuel, Nathan and Gad must have been into final form by someone else. On the other hand, if “kings of Judah” simply means kings from the <em>tribe</em> of Judah, these words could have been recorded by Nathan, since he lived under the rulership of two Judean kings, David and Solomon.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013736/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Ki. 1:32-34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013736/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 9:29</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The fact that Hannah and an unnamed “man of God” used the expressions “king” and/or “anointed one” years before a king actually ruled over Israel does not support the argument of some that these passages date from a period later than indicated in the book. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013736/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Sam. 2:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013736/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 35</a>) The idea of a future king was by no means foreign to the Hebrews. God’s promise concerning Sarah, the ancestress of the Israelites, was that “kings of peoples” would come from her. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013736/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gen. 17:16</a>) Also, Jacob’s deathbed prophecy (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013736/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 49:10</a>), the prophetic words of Balaam (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013736/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Num. 24:17</a>) and the Mosaic law (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013736/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Deut. 17:14-18</a>) pointed to the time when the Israelites would have a king.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The historical narrative contained in the two books of Samuel commences with the judgeship of High Priest Eli and concludes with events from David’s reign. It therefore covers a period of approximately 140 years (c. 1180-c. 1040 B.C.E.). As David’s death is not mentioned in the record, the account (possibly with the exception of editorial additions) was probably completed about 1040 B.C.E.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>AUTHENTICITY</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The authenticity of the account contained in the books of Samuel is well established. Christ Jesus himself, when refuting an objection raised by the Pharisees, cited the incident recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013736/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Samuel 21:3-6</a> about David’s receiving showbread from Ahimelech the priest.

What a fine example for us when we face hardships! Whether we are at school, at work, with fellow Christians, or in the public ministry, our uppermost desire should be to praise Jehovah. Just think of the countless reasons we have to do so! For example, there is no end to what we can discover and enjoy in Jehovah’s marvelous works of creation. And consider what he has accomplished by means of the earthly part of his organization! Although they are imperfect, Jehovah has used faithful humans mightily in modern times. How do God’s works compare with those of men who are idolized by the world? Do you not agree with David, who also wrote: “There is none like you among the gods, O Jehovah, neither are there any works like yours”?​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007163/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Psalm 86:8</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Like David, we feel impelled to praise Jehovah constantly because of his incomparable works.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007163/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Revelation 11:15</a>) This means that the end of this system of things is close. The everlasting future of over six billion humans is at stake. Never before has there been such a need to tell others about God’s Kingdom and what it will soon do for mankind and to help them praise Jehovah with us. Surely our priority in life should be to use every opportunity to encourage others to accept this “good news” before it is too late.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007163/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>.</p>

<strong>“Taste and See that Jehovah Is Good”</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Stop and ask yourself: What do I really want out of life? Is it my goal to be a faithful servant of Jehovah? Or does my life course reveal that other interests are more important to me? In the opening words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978608/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 34</a>, David expressed the attitude that all of us should have: “I will bless Jehovah at all times; constantly his praise will be in my mouth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978608/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 34:1</a>) Is this, too, our heartfelt desire? Are we moved to use our health, abilities and resources to give praise to Jehovah? What can we do to bless and praise Jehovah?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>IS LIVING “A GOOD LIFE” ENOUGH?</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Some persons believe that simply living “a good life”​—being kind to their neighbors, loving their brothers and sisters, keeping a clean home, developing a fine personality—​is all that is necessary to bless and praise Jehovah. But, really, more is involved. Praise must issue from the <em>mouth,</em> as David said. To praise Jehovah in this way is a particular requirement of true Christians. Jesus Christ showed this by carrying on a public preaching campaign that magnified his Father’s name and kingdom.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978608/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 4:43</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Then, toward the end of his earthly life, Jesus said: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978608/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>) Who would do this preaching? The apostle Peter told the army officer Cornelius and his household: “[Christ] ordered us to preach to the people and to give a thorough witness.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978608/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Acts 10:42</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Was this an order applicable only to the apostles and other Christian elders? No, all Christians were to be imitators of Christ, doing the preaching work as he did it. To accomplish the preaching on the worldwide scale that Jesus said it would be done requires the cooperative efforts of all Christians​—men, women and children. And among Jehovah’s Witnesses this cooperative effort is manifest​—all share unitedly in this great Kingdom proclamation.</p>

Stop and think. If you get in only two hours instead of three, due to helping three weak ones, think how much more praise this means to Jehovah. Four times two equals eight hours instead of your individual three. Maybe <em>you</em> will be praised more by men if you put in more hours working by yourself, but <em>Jehovah</em> is praised more when more praisers are in the field.

To them Jehovah continues to reveal himself, and they know Jehovah and they must express themselves concerning him. He has shown Jehovah’s witnesses immeasurable kindness, and has been forgiving and long-suffering with them as well as with all mankind. We who know the happy God and his truth have felt his mercy; we have been endowed with his tenderness. With David (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954001/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 34:1-3</a>, <em>AS</em>), therefore, we have reason joyously to say: “I will bless Jehovah at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth.

One who has come to Jehovah and keeps on devoting his life in service will talk regularly, and the meek will hear his talk; and then they are going to be invited to magnify Jehovah with him, and to exalt his name together. And then the meek will respond to the invitation: “Let us exalt his name together.” Now, are you going to do this praising and exalting of Jehovah God in this fortieth year of his established kingdom? The New World society is globally organized to do just that “in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954001/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>, <em>NW</em>) As a society for such witness-bearing each of such associated preachers will talk “from house to house.” There is no question about it. The power of that organization we now see, but not because of the 510,228 praisers who are now in the New World society. No, its power is not in numbers. While the organization is great in numbers, the power, the backing, the support these numbers get is Jehovah’s holy spirit. You individually feel that power, that active force, because you have come into Jehovah’s organization. His favor is seen upon his witnesses. They all move forward in service under Jehovah’s appointed Shepherd-Prince, Christ Jesus.</p><p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="qu">24.

We are not asking them to magnify Jehovah’s name just to get <em>them</em> to be called “Jehovah’s witnesses,” as the religious organizations do to get members throughout this earth. No, it is because we want talking ministers who will promote true worship of Almighty God and who will want to magnify Jehovah and exalt his name, not hide it. We want all persons of good will to appreciate the glory of Jehovah’s kingdom and to get from it all the blessings in store for them, and to allow the glory of Jehovah’s kingdom to be reflected through them in the true worship they give to Jehovah God. We want to see them “bless Jehovah at all times” and bear witness to the world of the glory of Jehovah’s kingdom. That glory we could see at Yankee Stadium July 19-26, 1953, during the New World Society Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses. With people present there from all nations, kindreds, tongues and families of the earth, having one mind and spirit, one love for Jehovah God, you could see it. It was a glorious feast. If you were there you enjoyed it and talked of the Kingdom to others and, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, you will continue to do so.</p>

<strong>The 1,290 and 1,335 Days of Daniel’s Prophecy</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[26]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> This means that since 1918, which had ended the 1,260-day period, two great wonders had happened. First, the Devil had set up his makeshift kingdom which was to take the place of God’s kingdom by Christ and was striving to make all people worship it. Secondly, he was successful for a time in causing God’s holy ones to cease offering the continual sacrifice of praise <span id="page433" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="433" data-before-text="433"></span>to Jehovah God. These events so clearly fulfill the angel’s prophecy to Daniel of the 1,290 days: “Many shall purify themselves, and make themselves white, and be refined; but the wicked shall do wickedly; and none of the wicked shall understand; but they that are wise shall understand. And from the time that the continual burnt-offering shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Dan. 12:10, 11</a>, <em>AS</em>) “From the time of the taking away of the continual ascending-sacrifice, and the placing of the horrid abomination that astoundeth shall be one thousand two hundred and ninety days.” (<em>Ro</em>) “And from the time of the removal of the perpetual sacrifice, when the abomination of desolation shall be set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.” (<em>LXX</em>) “Twelve hundred and ninety days shall pass, after the daily offering has been stopped and the appalling abomination has been set up.” (<em>Mo</em>) This sacrifice need not be a literal everyday offering, but rather continual. The Hebrew word “taw-meed” is the same thought as in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isaiah 21:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Isaiah 62:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Psalm 34:1 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/9/3" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> Psalm 71:6</a>. It pertains to the continual, faithful service of Jehovah’s people.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[26]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> These two things are in evidence together, namely, (1) placing of the horrid abomination that astounds, and (2) the taking away of the continual sacrifice. There is no Scriptural reason for concluding that the 1,290 days should run at the same time as the 1,260 days. The 1,290 days are therefore reckoned from the date of the setting up of the abomination, which was in the latter part of January, 1919. This period of 3 years and 7 months ends at September, 1922—the very time of the Cedar Point Convention mentioned above. Let it be kept in mind that this convention was not arranged for this date with a view to fulfilling any prophecy, for at that time it was not known that these dates were important. The “continual sacrifice” had been restored by 1922. The Isaiah class had been cleansed of lip and now they are wholly devoted to singing praises to Jehovah. “And in his temple everything saith, Glory.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 29:9</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="qu"> 6. What facts point to the accomplishment of the 1,290-day period in September, 1922?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[27]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> At the end of this 1,290-day period the whole world was to come to know that the League of Nations was not approved of God and would come to nought. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa. 8:9, 10</a>) Its doom was to be pronounced. Any build-up of the same system would be likewise doomed to failure. Three years and seven months passed from the time the abomination was set up until it was publicly pronounced as condemned, there at the Cedar Point Convention of September, 1922. There, too, another situation ceased, from the time the continual sacrifice of praise to Jehovah was interfered with and taken away until it was restored, and the sacrifice of praise was again being offered in God’s temple, and the obnoxious abomination exposed as a subterfuge, standing in the place where it never should be. So ended the 1,290 days.—See <em>The Watchtower,</em> Nov. 1, 1922.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>1,335 DAYS</strong></p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="qu"> 7. Is it reasonable to think that these three time periods mentioned in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Daniel 12</a> cover many centuries of time? Why do you so answer?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[28]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Daniel 12:12</a> (<em>AS</em>) announces: “Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.” From 1922 there was a forward movement, new truths were opening to the view of the faithful. No halting now, for, with the vision of the Lord at the temple, the work of advertising the King and his kingdom was on. There are those who may think it strange that these 2,500-year-old prophecies are now receiving fulfillment in a few short years. But we must realize that they must come to pass sometime, and <span id="page434" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="434" data-before-text="434"></span>why not now? Some may prefer to think of these 1,260, 1,290 and 1,335 “days” of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Daniel 12:7-12</a> as covering many centuries of time, just as though that would add to their importance. But is that reasonable? Why not question yourself: Why were these wonders given? It was certainly not just to record or set forth historical facts, so that Bible students could point with confidence to God’s Word as being true. Rather, these visions are for the comfort, edification and guidance of God’s people in these “last days”, so they would really know the sign of the times and when their deliverance from Babylonish captivity would come. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Rom. 15:4</a>, <em>NW</em>) How possibly could these wonders guide us today if we merely knew that certain prophecies had been fulfilled during the Middle Ages? It is true certain prophecies received a partial or miniature fulfillment at the first advent of Christ Jesus, and this was to identify God’s Son and to fulfill God’s purposes concerning him, so giving the church confidence and complete assurance in him as the Messiah.</p>

<strong>“Taste and See that Jehovah Is Good”</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>PROPER BASIS FOR BOASTING</strong></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">David helps us to appreciate this, as he continues in the 34th Psalm: “In Jehovah my soul will make its boast.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978608/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 34:2</a>) Knowing Jehovah and being one of his servants is certainly something worth boasting about.

<strong>In What Do You Boast?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Pertinent, therefore, are the words: “When I was a babe, I used to speak as a babe, to think as a babe, to reason as a babe; but now that I have become a man, I have done away with the traits of a babe.” Appreciating that boasting or bragging about oneself is a sign of immaturity will help you to avoid its pitfalls. In passing, <span id="page196" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="196" data-before-text="196"></span>it is of interest that the Greek word rendered “babe” in the foregoing text is <em>népios,</em> regarding which an authority states: “Immaturity is always associated with this word.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965240/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:11</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Bragging or boasting about yourself is unwise, immature. But there is a still stronger reason for avoiding it. And that is? Because such bragging is unloving: “Love . . . does not brag.” That is the very best reason not to boast or brag about ourselves. As has already been noted, what we have we have received—from whom? From God, in the final analysis. To take credit to ourselves for what belongs to him would be most unloving. In fact, everything depends upon him, even as we read: “Unless Jehovah himself builds the house, it is to no avail that its builders have worked hard on it. Unless Jehovah himself guards the city, it is to no avail that the guard has kept awake.” So to the extent that we love God we will not be calling attention to ourselves.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965240/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965240/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Ps. 127:1</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Boasting about ourselves is also unloving as far as our fellow human creatures are concerned. By doing so we are exalting ourselves and may well arouse jealousy and envy, and certainly that is not loving, for it makes others unhappy. It is bound to be that way, for the effect of exalting ourselves is to lower others by comparison or in relation to us. Everyone is conscious of his own weaknesses and shortcomings and struggles to keep self-respect and confidence, and so needs to be encouraged, helped, built up, not discouraged, not pushed down, not lowered. Love gives words of encouragement to others instead of complimenting itself.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The very fact that bragging or boasting is often used as a means of intimidation should help us to appreciate its unloving nature. Even as the Philistine giant Goliath sought to strike fear in the young shepherd lad David, so today world rulers in the cold war between the East and the West resort to bragging to instill fear into each other.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965240/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Sam. 17:41-51</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">However, there is a right kind of boasting, even as the Bible shows. As the psalmist David expressed it: “In Jehovah my soul will make its boast.” One who did so was the prophet Elijah. He challenged the prophets of Baal to a test as to who was the true God, Jehovah or Baal. The true God was to be the one who caused fire to come down from heaven. The prophets of Baal first had their opportunity, and though they implored their god for hours on end, he did not respond with any miracle. True to God’s Word, those making their boast in valueless gods were ashamed. But not Elijah, who had made his boast in the one true God and was vindicated by fire coming down from heaven and consuming the sacrifice.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965240/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 34:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965240/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 1 Ki. 18:21-40</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Not that our boasting need be limited to the Creator, Jehovah God. The apostle Paul told the Corinthian Christians that he boasted to the Macedonian Christians about the zeal, the “readiness of mind” of the Christians at Corinth. The loving principle that there is more happiness in giving than in receiving would apply here also. Even as love does not brag, it does not seek praise for itself but delights to praise or make its boast in others who are truly deserving, following the counsel: “In showing honor to one another take the lead.” By having good things to say about your deserving neighbor you will build him up, encourage him. Doing so, you work for peace, unity and harmony in the family, in the congregation, or wherever it may be.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965240/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Cor. 9:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965240/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Rom. 12:10</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">So, while “love . . . does not brag” about itself, it does make its boast in Jehovah and it is not averse to praising or making a boast about others who are deserving.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"></p>

We who know the happy God and his truth have felt his mercy; we have been endowed with his tenderness.

One who has come to Jehovah and keeps on devoting his life in service will talk regularly, and the meek will hear his talk; and then they are going to be invited to magnify Jehovah with him, and to exalt his name together. And then the meek will respond to the invitation: “Let us exalt his name together.” Now, are you going to do this praising and exalting of Jehovah God in this fortieth year of his established kingdom? The New World society is globally organized to do just that “in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954001/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>, <em>NW</em>) As a society for such witness-bearing each of such associated preachers will talk “from house to house.” There is no question about it. The power of that organization we now see, but not because of the 510,228 praisers who are now in the New World society. No, its power is not in numbers. While the organization is great in numbers, the power, the backing, the support these numbers get is Jehovah’s holy spirit. You individually feel that power, that active force, because you have come into Jehovah’s organization. His favor is seen upon his witnesses. They all move forward in service under Jehovah’s appointed Shepherd-Prince, Christ Jesus.</p><p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="qu">24.

We are not asking them to magnify Jehovah’s name just to get <em>them</em> to be called “Jehovah’s witnesses,” as the religious organizations do to get members throughout this earth. No, it is because we want talking ministers who will promote true worship of Almighty God and who will want to magnify Jehovah and exalt his name, not hide it. We want all persons of good will to appreciate the glory of Jehovah’s kingdom and to get from it all the blessings in store for them, and to allow the glory of Jehovah’s kingdom to be reflected through them in the true worship they give to Jehovah God. We want to see them “bless Jehovah at all times” and bear witness to the world of the glory of Jehovah’s kingdom. That glory we could see at Yankee Stadium July 19-26, 1953, during the New World Society Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses. With people present there from all nations, kindreds, tongues and families of the earth, having one mind and spirit, one love for Jehovah God, you could see it. It was a glorious feast. If you were there you enjoyed it and talked of the Kingdom to others and, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, you will continue to do so.</p>

<strong>Maintaining Personal Integrity</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> There was more than one reason why King David thought it was important to walk in God’s ways. It was not just because his own life was involved that he <span id="page368" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="368" data-before-text="368"></span>was so interested in keeping integrity, nor just for the good example that he would set for the Israelite nation over whom he was king. Nor was it only because he wanted to obtain a good report from the heathen nations around him. The primary reason was that the name of the God whom he loved and served was involved. David said: “O magnify Jehovah with me, you people, and let us exalt his name together.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 34:3</a>) Regardless of what other men thought, regardless of the opposition of his enemies, David was determined to serve Jehovah wholeheartedly. Prayerfully he said: “As for me, in my integrity I shall walk. . . . Among the congregated throngs I shall bless Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 26:11, 12</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 5. Why do we owe Jehovah our wholehearted devotion?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Do we not owe our pure worship to Jehovah, who is our Creator and who promises to be our everlasting Preserver in his new world of righteousness that is so near at hand? We answer yes, because not only has God given us the life that we have at present, but he has given us the promise of life in the future. The apostle Paul had faith in this promise as a reward for serving Jehovah, because, when he wrote to Timothy, he said: “I have fought the fine fight, I have run the course to the finish, I have observed the faith. From this time on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Tim. 4:7, 8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Rom. 6:23</a>.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 6, 7.

(b) How is this demonstrated in the case of Achan?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> To maintain personal integrity one must appreciate that Jehovah will judge the person or the individual. It is true that today Jehovah deals with us through his visible organization. He teaches us through that organization. He corrects and chastises us through that organization. The good news of the Kingdom is being preached throughout the world by means of that organization. But, while he promises that the integrity of the organization will be preserved and maintained, this does not guarantee that just because we are associated with that organization we will maintain personal integrity.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45-47</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Achan was a part of a whole nation that was faithful to God and was then keeping national integrity. But his being born into the nation of God’s people, and his being associated with the nation that had just conquered the city of Jericho and was moving into the land of Canaan to possess it by means of God’s spirit, did not guarantee for him that God would overlook his sin of covetous disobedience and bless him in that promised land of milk and honey. Achan had failed to keep personal integrity by stealing and then lying about it, and he suffered the penalty of being tracked down, exposed, humiliated and finally permanently disfellowshiped in being stoned to death.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Josh. 7:1-26</a>.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 8.

Like these integrity-keepers, we are interested in magnifying Jehovah’s name by our conduct and example to the world before our fellow Christians, just as the Thessalonians were good examples to the believers in Macedonia. Paul wrote concerning them: “You came to be an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Thess. 1:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Matt. 24:1-15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b">1 Tim. 3:7</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>HOW TO MAINTAIN PERSONAL INTEGRITY</strong></p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 9.

To be helped, we must be able to see ourselves spiritually as Jehovah God and others see us. To see how we appear to others physically we will stand in front of a mirror. That mirror will reflect to us in detail just exactly how we appear to others. We cannot be fooled in maintaining our personal appearance, because we have something to reflect to us what needs correction and by that reflection we are able to improve any defects or flaws.</p>

They were confident that God was backing David, and their faces were radiant. In a similar way, newly interested ones as well as those who have been true Christians for a long time look to Jehovah for support. Since they have personally experienced his help, their radiant faces reflect their determination to remain faithful.</p>

<strong>Always Throw Your Burden on Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">This does not mean, however, that there will never be times of intense pain, anxiety, and even fear, as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 55</a> clearly shows. Some years after this fearless display of confidence in Jehovah, for example, David experienced great fear in the face of his enemies. He lost favor with King Saul and had to flee for his life. Try to imagine the emotional turmoil this must have caused David, the questions it must have raised in his mind about the outworking of Jehovah’s purpose.

<strong>Always Throw Your Burden on Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">This does not mean, however, that there will never be times of intense pain, anxiety, and even fear, as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 55</a> clearly shows. Some years after this fearless display of confidence in Jehovah, for example, David experienced great fear in the face of his enemies. He lost favor with King Saul and had to flee for his life.

True, David was Jehovah’s anointed, Israel’s future king; but he knew that Jehovah uses his angels to watch over all of his faithful worshippers, regardless of whether they are prominent or lowly. In our modern day, true worshippers have also experienced the protection that Jehovah provides. In Nazi Germany​—as well as in Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, and many other lands—​authorities have waged campaigns to wipe out Jehovah’s Witnesses. Their efforts have been in vain. Instead, Jehovah’s people in those lands continue to thrive as they exalt God’s name together. Why? Because Jehovah uses his holy angels to protect and guide his people.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007163/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:14</a>.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">17.

Most important, they guide us in the work of declaring “everlasting good news” to all mankind, including in places where the preaching work is carried out under dangerous circumstances.

Angels are God’s spirit messengers, and their services are often in behalf of humans. Jesus Christ described what great concern they have for God’s servants, when he said: “See to it that you men do not despise one of these little ones; for I tell you that their angels in heaven always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.” The psalmists also gave the comforting assurance: God “will give his own angels a command concerning you, to guard you in all your ways.” And again: “The angel of Jehovah is camping all around those fearing him, and he rescues them.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965880/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 18:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965880/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Ps. 91:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965880/12/2" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> 34:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965880/12/3" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> Heb. 1:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965880/12/4" data-bid="13-5" class="b"> 14</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Two outstanding examples of rescue by God’s angels are recorded in the Bible book of Daniel. The first occurred when the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar had three young Hebrew servants of God seized and thrown into a superheated furnace because they would not bow down to his huge golden image. When a fourth figure appeared in the furnace to protect the men, Nebuchadnezzar said: “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who sent his angel and rescued his servants that trusted in him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965880/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Dan. 3:19-28</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The other instance occurred when the aged Daniel, a friend of those three faithful Hebrews, was thrown into a pit of lions because he refused to stop praying to his God Jehovah. The next morning the king hurried to the lions’ pit and inquired: “‘O Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God whom you are serving with constancy been able to rescue you from the lions?’ Immediately Daniel himself spoke even with the king: ‘O king, live on even to times indefinite. My own God sent his angel and shut the mouth of the lions, and they have not brought me to ruin.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965880/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Dan. 6:16-22</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Angels also ministered in behalf of Jesus. After his being tempted by the Devil at the beginning of his earthly ministry, “look! angels came and began to minister to him.” And on the very last night of his earthly life, while he was praying to his heavenly Father, “an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him.” The angels were right at hand to serve Jesus, causing him to say: “Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father to supply me at this moment more than twelve legions of angels?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965880/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 4:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965880/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Luke 22:43;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965880/15/2" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> Matt. 26:53</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">An outstanding example that shows in what particular activity the angels have been assigned to assist God’s servants is found in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965880/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Acts chapter five</a>. Jesus’ apostles had been zealously preaching the good news of God’s kingdom and of his Christ, and so to stop this activity the Jewish “high priest and all those with him, . . . laid hands upon the apostles and put them in the public place of custody.” Ah, but note what happened! “During the night Jehovah’s angel opened the doors of the prison, brought them out and said: ‘Be on your way, and, having taken a stand in the temple, keep on speaking to the people all the sayings about this life.’” God’s angel took an active part in seeing that the preaching work was not interfered with.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965880/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Acts 5:17-20</a>; see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965880/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Acts 12:3-11</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">But more than that, the angels even directed God’s servants to come in contact with righteously disposed persons. For example, on one occasion “Jehovah’s angel spoke to Philip, saying: ‘Rise and go to <span id="page710" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="710" data-before-text="710"></span>the south to the road that runs down from Jerusalem to Gaza.’ . . . With that he rose and went, and, look! an Ethiopian eunuch . . . was sitting in his chariot and reading aloud the prophet Isaiah.” Philip was directed to approach the chariot, and when he explained the Bible truths concerning Jesus, the man happily embraced them and was baptized.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965880/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Acts 8:26-38</a>; see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965880/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Acts 10:1-22</a>.</p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jehovah’s hand is not short. He can protect, deliver and sustain those who love him. “Look!” said Isaiah, “The hand of Jehovah has not become too short that it cannot save, nor has his ear become too heavy that it cannot hear.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964090/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 59:1</a>) Just think of what occurred when wicked King Herod jailed Peter nineteen centuries ago. What a thrilling release the apostle experienced! <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964090/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 12:6-11</a> vividly recounts the event, saying in part: “But, look! Jehovah’s angel stood by, and a light shone in the prison cell. Striking Peter on the side, he roused him, saying: ‘Rise quickly!’ And his chains fell off his hands.” The amazed apostle heeded instructions received and followed his angelic visitor. The account continues: “Going through the <span id="page95" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="95" data-before-text="95"></span>first sentinel guard and the second they got to the iron gate leading into the city, and this opened to them of its own accord. And after they went out they advanced down one street, and immediately the angel departed from him. And Peter, coming to himself, said: ‘Now I actually know that Jehovah sent his angel forth and delivered me out of Herod’s hand and from all that the people of the Jews were expecting.’” There was no question about it. Jehovah, by means of his angel, had effected Peter’s release from prison.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">What, then, are we to conclude? Surely, that Jehovah can provide deliverance and he can also spare one if that is his will. Thus the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964090/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">James 4:15</a> are noteworthy: “You ought to say: ‘If Jehovah wills, we shall live and also do this or that.’” While Jehovah can certainly provide protection and deliverance, he may permit certain things to occur. For example, while Peter experienced a marvelous deliverance from prison, just a little earlier Herod “did away with James the brother of John by the sword.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964090/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 12:2</a>) Well, was James less worthy of deliverance than Peter? The Scriptures do not infer this. Actually, in that case, as in others, matters worked out as Jehovah willed or allowed.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In view of the foregoing, is it proper to ask Jehovah’s protection over our loved ones now if we and they are Christians? Yes. As Christians we can make all matters in life suitable subjects of prayer. Let us illustrate. Daily we give thanks to Jehovah for the food that is served upon the table, although we know that we have had to work in order to get that food. Nevertheless, in the provision of such food there is an element that man cannot supply. This only Almighty God Jehovah can supply. Fittingly, then, we give thanks to him for providing the food which we have asked him to supply in harmony with the model prayer of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964090/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9-13</a>. We acknowledge God’s hand in the provision of the food, above and beyond what we can do to get it. It should be the same with protection.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">We may properly pray to Jehovah regarding protection and related matters. Yet we should not assume that God is obligated to work miracles in our behalf. We should exercise good judgment respecting the preservation of our health, for example, and should take suitable measures to assure our safety. Such is required even though unseen angels minister to God’s servants in our day. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964090/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Heb. 1:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964090/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Ps. 34:7</a>) Do not think that they are hovering at our side each moment so as to intervene miraculously if we do something foolish or if we are careless and thus place ourselves in a position wherein we may suffer some accident or disaster.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">As with food provided by God, for which we thank him, so also with protection, there is a point beyond which we cannot go, in spite of all we do to protect ourselves. Therefore, after a journey or after a perilous experience, we can properly give thanks to Jehovah God that he has protected us. Certainly the whole result of survival and salvation is not to be attributed solely to what we ourselves or others do personally to bring about safe results. It may not truly be possible for one person to determine specifically whether another experienced protection from Jehovah on an occasion or not. Yet if an individual personally has reason to believe that his life has been spared or he has experienced protection from God he should humbly thank Jehovah for this in prayer. In fact, it is always good to give God credit. Paul said: “In connection with everything give thanks.” Why, we can properly thank Jehovah for our surviving even a night of bodily rest.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964090/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:18</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">But what if another Christian may not have been delivered during some crisis or may not have escaped death in an accident or at the hands of persecutors? Some are not spared, but that does not prove that they were unfaithful. Think of James, who was put to death by Herod, while Peter was spared and escaped from prison with angelic help. James did not die on account of any unfaithfulness. In fact, by his martyr’s death he proved his integrity. Why, it pleased God to permit his only-begotten Son to suffer an ignominious death. By it Christ proved his integrity and furnished the foremost example of faithfulness unto death.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Moreover, Jesus declared concerning those who would be his disciples: “If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake and continually follow me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964090/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 16:24</a>) Jesus did not say that God would protect his followers from picking up their torture stake, but he did say: “Whoever wants to save his soul will lose it; but whoever loses his soul for my sake will find it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964090/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 16:25</a>) So, if our fellow Christians die at the hands of their violent persecutors, let us not view this as a case of unfaithfulness on their part or of partiality on Jehovah’s part. <span id="page96" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="96" data-before-text="96"></span>Such death in faithfulness assures one of a resurrection and the opportunity to gain everlasting life in the new order of God’s promise.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964090/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rev. 2:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964090/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 2 Pet. 3:13</a>.</p>

As to the <em>New World Translation</em> rendering, it is true that the expression “mild-tempered ones” might have been rendered another way, such as “meek ones.” Why, then, “mild-tempered ones”?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Many persons are familiar with the <em>King James Version</em> rendering of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963651/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 5:5</a>, “Blessed are the meek.” Many have also got the idea that what Jesus meant was ‘blessed are the teachable.’ So the expression has often been made that to be meek is to be teachable. True, he who is meek is teachable, but being teachable is only one of the qualities a meek person has. Moreover, the basic meaning of the original Greek word at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963651/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 5:5</a> is not “teachable.” According to the two-volume Greek-English <em>Lexicon</em> by Liddell and Scott the Greek word in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963651/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 5:5</a> means, respecting persons, “mild, gentle, meek,” and the adverbial form of it means “mildly, gently.” Interestingly, <em>The New English Bible,</em> at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963651/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 5:5</a>, reads: “How blest are those of a gentle spirit.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Also the Greek-English <em>Lexicon</em> by Westcott and Hort states regarding this Greek word, <em>praús</em> or <em>práos:</em> “Mild temper, and, of animals, tame, gentle. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963651/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matthew 5:5</a> (Here the <em>AV</em> and <em>AS</em> render it meek, but the words never did, at any time, or in any passage of any other author signify <em>meek.</em>)”</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><em>The New World</em> Translation Committee, by rendering the Greek word “mild-tempered,” believes it has attained a far superior rendering than “meek.” The <em>New World Translation</em> rendering defines the Greek word and does not leave it up to any reader to attach an arbitrary meaning to the word, such as saying that “meek” means “teachable.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn"><strong>● Does the scripture at</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963651/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 34:7</strong></a><strong>, “The angel of Jehovah is camping all around those fearing him, and he rescues them,” have application to rescue from natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes?—R. E., United States.</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">This scripture must be understood in the light of its context. The superscription to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963651/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 34 sup</a> says: “Of David, at the time of his disguising his sanity before Abimelech, so that he drove him out, and he went away.” So David is speaking against a background of his being in enemy territory, where he had to disguise himself by pretending to be insane before King Abimelech (also called Achish) in order not to be executed by this Philistine king, who might otherwise have viewed David as an intelligent, scheming, spying Israelite. Under such circumstances Jehovah’s angel preserved David and rescued him. This is very different from rescuing one from a flood or an earthquake. The circumstances are entirely different, and they have no relationship to each other.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963651/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Sam. 21:10-15</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">When it comes to floods and storms, Jehovah’s people have to heed storm warnings just like everyone else. True, the tendency of many persons is to ignore warnings, as some have done regarding hurricanes and floods, so losing their lives. Those who choose to ignore warnings, thinking ‘it cannot happen to me,’ must accept the consequences.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Protection after Armageddon is something else. Even Armageddon may not end earthquakes. We cannot be dogmatic and say that Armageddon will immediately bring the entire globe, internally and externally, to its finished condition and hence there will not need to be any alterations in the interior or on the surface of the earth. But should these be necessary during the progress of the thousand years, God can direct the course of these, and he can bring about the protection of his people from any harm or loss, in harmony with the promise at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963651/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Revelation 21:4</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Angels—God’s Spirit Messengers</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">It might be argued, as the modernists do, that there is no need for a ladder of angels leading from earth to heaven as Jacob saw in his dream. God could well accomplish his purposes by other means. But Jehovah God simply has not chosen to do so. He also could have created everything himself, even as by himself he brought forth his only-begotten Son, the Word, later to be known as Jesus Christ. But God chose to let his Son serve as the active agent in the creation of all other creatures and things, thereby giving his Son much pleasure as well as receiving joy himself as he noted his Son’s dutiful course. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Prov. 8:22-30</a>) This wise course Jehovah also pursued with the angels. They are not indispensable, <span id="page59" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="59" data-before-text="59"></span>but God has seen fit to create them for the purpose of giving them happiness and to serve his purposes in carrying out his will for them.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">For one thing, angels are shown as ministering to God: “There were a thousand thousands that kept ministering to him.” Repeatedly they are pictured as being in his presence: “Seraphs were standing above him.” “I heard a voice of many angels around the throne.” Often they were sent to bring good news to man, thus serving as evangelists, as when they announced the birth of the Savior. God used angels to communicate his will to such of his servants as Abraham, Moses, Joshua, Daniel, Peter, Paul and others. And in that their messages became part of God’s written Word, they contributed toward the writing of the Bible.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Dan. 7:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Isa. 6:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/25/2" data-bid="26-3" class="b"> Rev. 5:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/25/3" data-bid="26-4" class="b"> Luke 2:13</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Note also God’s use of angels in the life of Jesus. Angels announced his conception and birth. They ministered to him after his forty-day fast and strengthened him in his final trial. When the mob came to arrest him, twelve legions of angels were at his call had he chosen to ask for them.

The facts recorded in the Scriptures support this conclusion. Jehovah took immediate control of the garden of Eden and placed its care in the hands of other mighty cherubs who were loyal to him.

Referring to Satan, Jesus said, “He has no hold on me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952321/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Col. 1:13 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952321/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> John 14:30</a>, <em>NW</em>) Then there is Peter’s case when he was delivered out of Herod’s murderous hands by Jehovah’s angel.

It is only those who have shown a lack of faith and who compromised that would take themselves out from under God’s special care. Even today all those who form the nucleus of the new world society, both the anointed remnant and those of the “other sheep”, have in fact come out from Babylonish bondage and have escaped the clutches of Satan.

Satan was not the all-powerful sovereign that he originally thought he was going to be. The fact that <span id="page265" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="265" data-before-text="265"></span>God calls him to question by saying, “Where have you been?” indicates that Jehovah had the upper hand. Satan in fear was being put on the spot, so to speak. The further fact that Satan complains of the “hedge” put around Job indicates that he was nettled at Jehovah’s displays of superior power not only in defense of his true worshipers on earth, but also on special occasions, such as, for example, at the Flood, where with no difficulty God washed away Satan’s angelized earthly civilization; at Babel, where God confused the speech of Satan’s first earthly kingdom; and in Egypt, where Jehovah brought the first world power to its knees to deliver the Israelites with a high hand. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952321/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Gen. 7:21-24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952321/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 11:7-9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952321/30/2" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> Ex. 14:8</a>) Finally Jehovah placed a limitation as to how far Satan could go in his testing of Job’s integrity. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952321/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Job 1:12</a>) Notice, too, that Satan displayed due respect for Jehovah’s power by complying with that order. He was taking no chances in needlessly arousing Jehovah’s far superior forces. All this was reducing the sham sovereign to a helpless inferior and demonstrated that his control on earth was not all-embracing. In fact, he merely controlled those parts where he had blinded the inhabitants with his false religions and had kept them in line by means of his various makeshift governments. Never has he enjoyed undisputed control and power over all mankind, because at all times there have been those who have clung to the true worship of Jehovah God and who have looked forward to a restoration of a divine, sovereign-empowered government over all the earth.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952321/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Heb. 11:10</a>.</p>

And now their good-will companions are beloved with them. Having the God of Jacob as our lofty retreat, there is no need for us to organize refuge farms in isolated places, retire to ourselves there and quit the field of activity as Kingdom publishers.

That way we stay inside the organization of his theocratic people who are scattered all over the earth.

It takes the viewpoint of a survivor after the world calamity of Armageddon: “Come view the doings of Jehovah, who hath set desolations in the earth: causing wars to cease unto the end of the earth, the bow he breaketh and cutteth asunder the spear, waggons he burneth with fire.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps. 46:8, 9</a>, <em>Ro.

This invitation, uttered by those within the visible organization of Jehovah God, positively assures us there will be survivors on earth after Armageddon will have swept away this old world with the broom of destruction and cleansed the earth for the righteous new world. The survivors will be informed and will know it is Jehovah by his mighty Warrior Jesus Christ who has set the then visible desolations in the earth. Such desolations will not have destroyed the earth or ruined it beyond restoration to a paradise state like the garden of Eden. They will only have ‘brought to ruin those ruining the earth’.

Serve Jehovah with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, for his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all they that take refuge in him.” After decades of testimony we may not now expect political and religious rulers to appreciate and follow this advice and learn to know that Jehovah is God in a way that means salvation to them. But we may look for individuals of all nations to desist from all acts against Jehovah and his theocratic organization and to give in, be still and learn to know him and do good to Christ’s brothers. This means everlasting life.</p>

Mighty forces of destruction are held in restraint by angels until the last of the spiritual Israelites, the slaves of God, are sealed with his final approval and also until the “great crowd” of fellow worshipers of God are gathered out and brought under the care of the Right Shepherd Jesus Christ.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951443/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Heb. 12:22, 23</a>, <em>NW</em>) This angelic guardianship, however, does not relieve us of being just as careful as we can, to guard against accidents. We cannot expect the angels to protect us against our own carelessness, rashness and foolhardiness. In the midst of wolves, we are instructed to be as cautious as serpents and to beware of men. We must not test God too far with what is unreasonable. The Devil quoted a Scriptural truth, when he said to Jesus at the temptation in the wilderness: “He will give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.” But this was no basis for the Devil to suggest that Jesus defy the known laws of gravity and hurl himself from the high temple battlement and force God to save his Son by means of the angels. That was unreasonable and contrary to other scriptures. It was a tempting of God or putting him to the test beyond what he had really promised. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951443/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 91:11, 12</a>, <em>AS;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951443/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Matt. 4:5-7</a>, <em>NW</em>) So with us today, who are God’s children, but not nearly as important as Jesus. While we have angelic protection for the sake of God’s work and cause, yet we dare not put God to the test with irrational actions and carelessness and expect his angels to keep us from harm and accident in spite of it.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>A BOOK FOR CONSULTATION AND ADVICE</strong></p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">16. In view of our having what may we not expect miraculous intervention in deciding our problems, and why not?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> We are therefore not to look for miraculous intervention by these innumerable holy angels to help us decide what is God’s will in personal matters and problems. God has given us his written Word, and he provided it for us to consult. If we do not consult it, it will not serve us as a guide. In his Word he reveals himself to us. He opens up his mind and heart to us, telling us what he thinks, what he has already done and is now doing and will yet <span id="page370" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="370" data-before-text="370"></span>do, and informing us what he would like us to do in order to gain his favor and the gift of eternal life in his new world. We need his Word, because in our flesh it is impossible for us to see him. He makes known to us that his name is Jehovah, meaning the One who causes to be; and he shows us his attributes of wisdom, justice, power and love and how all four attributes work together without clash. So the only way we definitely know about him is by his written Word. Getting to know him through the Word we learn to develop confidence in Him and to respect his advice and to see that his commands are authoritative. We build up faith that his Word is right and without mistake or misdirection. This makes us consult it in our problems and take its advice.</p>

You could learn something about it by looking at it, smelling it, getting the recipe, or asking others for their opinion about it.

But we will gain a real understanding of how good Jehovah is when we “taste” his goodness for ourselves. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021526/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 34:8</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Let us illustrate one way we can do that. Suppose we want to engage in some form of the full-time ministry, but in order to reach that goal, we will need to simplify our life. Perhaps we have often read Jesus’ promise that if we put Kingdom interests first, Jehovah will provide the things we really need, but we personally have never experienced the fulfillment of that promise. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021526/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 6:33</a>) Nevertheless, with faith in Jesus’ promise, we reduce our expenses, cut down on our secular work, and focus on our ministry. As we do so, we learn through our own experience that Jehovah really does care for our needs. We “taste” Jehovah’s goodness personally.</p>

Are you a shy person? Many of Jehovah’s people are. Perhaps before you became one of Jehovah’s servants, you could never have imagined yourself knocking on the door of a perfect stranger and sharing an unpopular message with him. Yet, today you do that on a regular basis. What is more, with Jehovah’s help, you have learned to enjoy the preaching work! You have felt Jehovah’s support in a number of ways. He has helped you to keep calm when faced with an opposer. He has also helped you to recall just the right scripture to share with an interested householder. And he has given you the strength to continue when you have been met with indifference in the territory.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021526/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jer. 20:7-9</a>.</p>

At first, we may be a bit apprehensive about trying something new, but when we do, we may find that the new approach appeals to those in our territory. We are also encouraged at meetings and conventions to engage in forms of the ministry that we might never have tried before. Once again, that will mean leaving our comfort zone, but when we do, we give Jehovah something to bless. Let us consider some of the blessings that result when we explore new ways to give Jehovah our best, regardless of our circumstances. Then let us review ways in which we might expand our ministry.</p><h2 id="p12" data-pid="12"><strong>JEHOVAH BLESSES THOSE WHO PUT THEIR TRUST IN HIM</strong></h2>

This couple enjoyed pioneering in their home congregation, but they wanted to expand their ministry by helping a congregation that had a greater need. To reach that goal, they had to make some sacrifices. “We applied <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021526/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 6:33</a> and stopped making unnecessary purchases,” says Samuel. “But the hardest step was leaving our apartment <span id="page28" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>behind. It was designed just for us, and it was mortgage-free.” In their new assignment, the couple found that they were able to live on just one-sixth of their former income. “We have seen how Jehovah guides our steps and answers our prayers,” says Samuel. “We feel his approval and love in ways that we never experienced before.” Are you able to expand your ministry in some way? If so, you can be sure that you will draw closer to Jehovah and that he will care for you.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2021526/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 18:25</a>.</p>

She has many return visits and Bible studies, some of whom she contacts by telephone. What motivated Mirreh to reach out? “My heart overflows with love for Jehovah and Christ Jesus.

<strong>Young Ones—“Keep Working Out Your Own Salvation”</strong><br/><h2 id="p22" data-pid="22"><strong>THE VALUE OF PERSONAL EXPERIENCE</strong></h2>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"><strong>12, 13.</strong><strong> Why is it important to think of how you personally have tasted Jehovah’s goodness?</strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> Ancient King David, who had been delivered from many grievous trials, expressed these words in song: “Taste and see that Jehovah is good; happy is the man who takes refuge in him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017689/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 34:8</a>) That verse highlights the value of personal experience. When you read the Bible and our publications and when you attend Christian meetings, you hear encouraging experiences of how God has helped others to stay faithful. But as you grow spiritually, you need to see Jehovah’s hand in your own life. How have you personally tasted Jehovah’s goodness?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> There is one way that all Christians have tasted Jehovah’s goodness. It is by being invited to draw close to God and his Son. Jesus said: “No man can come to me unless the Father, who sent me, draws him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017689/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">John 6:44</a>) Do you feel that those words apply to you? A youth might reason, ‘Jehovah drew <em>my parents,</em> and I merely followed.’ But when you dedicated yourself to Jehovah and got baptized, you showed that you had come into a privileged relationship with him. Now you are truly known by him. The Bible assures us: “If anyone loves God, this one is known by him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017689/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Cor. 8:3</a>) Try always to treasure, to appreciate, your place in Jehovah’s organization.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>14, 15.</strong><strong> How can the ministry help you to strengthen your faith?</strong></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> Another way you can taste Jehovah’s goodness is by experiencing his support as you share your faith with others. You can do that in the ministry as well as at school. Some find it difficult to preach to their peers at school. You likely can understand why. You have no idea how they will react. It can be especially challenging when speaking to a large group rather than to a classmate one-on-one. What can help you?</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> First, think about why you are convinced of your beliefs. Are the study guides found on jw.org available in your language? If you are not sure, take the time to look for them. They are designed to help you reflect on what you believe, why you believe it, and how you can explain <span id="page27" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span>your beliefs to others. When your conviction is strong and you are well-prepared, you will feel impelled to give a witness for Jehovah’s name.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017689/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Jer. 20:8, 9</a>.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>16.</strong><strong> What might help you overcome hesitancy to speak up about your beliefs?</strong></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> Even with preparation, however, you may be hesitant to speak up about your beliefs. An 18-year-old sister, baptized when she was 13, admits, “I know what I believe, but sometimes I have trouble putting my thoughts into words.” How does she deal with this obstacle? “I just try to be casual,” she says. “My classmates talk freely about the things that they do. I should feel free to do the same. So I’ll mention something in passing, such as, ‘I was teaching the Bible the other day, and . . .’ Then I continue with the point of my story. Although the immediate point is not in itself about the Bible, often others are curious about what I do when teaching the Bible. Sometimes they ask questions about it. The more I use this approach, the easier it gets. And afterward, I always feel great!”</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>17.</strong><strong> How can your view of your faith help you to speak to others?</strong></p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> As you show respect for others and take a personal interest in them, it is more likely that they will respond in kind. “I had always been afraid that if I worked the Bible into a conversation, people would view me as a fanatic.” That is a comment made by Olivia, who is 17 and who got baptized as a preteen. Then she started to think differently. Rather than give too much thought to her fears, Olivia reasoned: “A lot of young people don’t know anything about Jehovah’s Witnesses. We are the only Witnesses they are exposed to. So the way we act can determine how they will respond. What if we are shy or timid or have a hard time speaking up about our faith, or what if we cringe when we do speak up? Then they may look at us as if we aren’t proud of who we are. They may even respond unkindly because of our lack of confidence. However, if we talk with ease and assurance about what we believe, making it a normal part of conversation, it’s more likely that they will respect us.”</p>

<strong>How Can I Become God’s Friend?</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">There’s another aspect of your friendship with God that you shouldn’t ignore. The psalmist David wrote: “Taste and see that Jehovah is good.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102008141/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 34:8</a>) When David composed the 34th Psalm, he had just been through a frightening experience. He was on the run from murderous King Saul​—a harrowing ordeal in itself. But then he had to take refuge among his enemies the Philistines. Faced with what seemed to be certain death, David cleverly disguised his sanity and was able to get away.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102008141/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Samuel 21:10-15</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">David didn’t attribute his narrow escape to his own ingenuity. Instead, he gave credit to Jehovah. Earlier in the psalm mentioned above, he wrote: “I inquired of Jehovah, and he answered me, and out of all my frights he delivered <span id="page296" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="296" data-before-text="296"></span>me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102008141/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 34:4</a>) It was from <em>personal experience,</em> then, that David could urge others to “taste and see that Jehovah is good.”<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1102008141/0">a</a></p>

For many, that means a change in lifestyle. All who make the necessary change experience the truthfulness of the psalmist David’s words: <em>“Taste and see that Jehovah is good, O you people; happy is the able-bodied man that takes refuge in him.</em> <em>Fear Jehovah, you holy ones of his, for there is no lack to those fearing him.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007164/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 34:8, 9</a>) Because they have a good relationship with God, all who fear Jehovah lack nothing of lasting value.</p>

<strong>How Should We View Trials?</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">How can we gain Jehovah’s support?

It is an encouragement to serve Jehovah and conform our lives fully to his will. Such a course means giving up some of our freedom, making sacrifices. In some cases, it can even lead to trials​—persecution and suffering. Yet, those who wholeheartedly accept Jehovah’s invitation need never regret doing so. Jehovah will be very good to them. He will guide them and care for them spiritually. He will sustain them through trials by means of his Word, his holy spirit, and the Christian congregation. And he will eventually reward them with everlasting life.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002646/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 23:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002646/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 25:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002646/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Isaiah 30:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002646/2/3" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> Romans 15:5</a>.</p>

With help from some in the congregation and by taking part-time work when available, this family of four managed. A year after the accident, the mother reflected: “We can fool ourselves into thinking that we are relying upon Jehovah, when we are really relying upon our own abilities, our mate, or our job. We, though, really learned to trust just Him. These other things can be taken away, but Jehovah never left us​—not for one moment. Though we have just the bare necessities, our relationship with Jehovah as a family is much closer.”</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978608/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 34:8</a>) Have you accepted the invitation? How can you do so?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">First, it is necessary that we know what is said in God’s Word. This is because it is in the Bible that Jehovah tells of the good things he will provide for his servants. “The gift God gives is everlasting life,” the Bible says. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978608/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rom. 6:23</a>) But God offers more than this to his faithful servants. He also promises them inner peace and real satisfaction in living, even at the present time.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">How, then, do we “taste” and find out whether Jehovah really will come through with such good things? We need to submit to him in humble obedience, as he invites: “My son, my law do not forget, and my commandments may your heart observe.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978608/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Prov. 3:1</a>) By living our lives in harmony with Jehovah’s laws and commands we are, in effect, tasting and seeing if this results in our good.</p>

<strong>Getting God’s Law on Your Heart</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> So when we know what is the right <span id="page88" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="88" data-before-text="88"></span>thing to do we should do it, even if our heart desires something else. We should discipline ourselves, make ourselves do it, and in time our hearts will be won over to righteousness and gain peace and serenity. Otherwise, our hearts will become set in a wrong course. If there is no discipline, no forcing into right conduct, the heart sets in an evil way and cannot be softened for reshaping or for taking upon itself the impression of writing, the receiving of Jehovah’s law: “Because sentence against an evil deed is not executed speedily, the heart of the sons of men is fully set to do evil.” This clearly implies that if disciplinary action was executed the heart meditating evil would relinquish this view, would turn away from it in a change for the better. So if we do not let our hearts get away with it they will not become set in it.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957087/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Eccl. 8:11</a>, <em>RS</em>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>“TASTE AND SEE”</strong></p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">10. What invitation should be heeded relative to Bible reading?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957087/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 34:8</a> (<em>AS</em>) invites: “Oh taste and see that Jehovah is good.” Do you have a Bible? Do you read it? Do you feed your mind on the spiritual food it contains? Do you taste Jehovah’s Word to see how good it is? Do not confuse this with listening to an orthodox sermon or following religious tradition or believing some set creed. Such things often conflict with the Bible, as Jesus said to religious leaders: “You have made the word of God invalid because of your tradition.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957087/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 15:6</a>, <em>NW</em>) Read the Bible for yourself, without preconceived ideas or prejudices, and see how good it is. Many openly admit that they do not believe the Bible, not because they have read it, but because they believe evolution, or have been soured on the Bible by what some say it contains, or by the way some act who are supposed to be Christians. They have not tasted for themselves. They are like persons who say they do not like a certain food before they ever taste it, and who steadfastly refuse to try it.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">11. After reading and studying the Bible, what additional food should be tasted to learn of its deliciousness?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Many who say they believe the Bible and who read it somewhat fail to follow its teachings. They talk God but serve Satan. Jesus said: “Not everyone saying to me, ‘Master, Master,’ will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957087/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 7:21</a>, <em>NW</em>) They should get a taste of doing Jehovah’s will. They might learn to like it, might find it is a strengthening food for them. Jesus said: “My food is for me to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work.” But so many see the meal of work set out for the Christian and immediately say to themselves: “I would not like that food. I would not want to go preach to the people and be snubbed or scorned or rudely used.” But why do they not taste the work and see what a delightful food it can be? Jesus found it so, as foretold: “I delight to do thy will, O my God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957087/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">John 4:34</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957087/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ps. 40:8</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">12. When a sincere person disciplines himself to taste both the studying of God’s Word and the doing of his will, what occurs that results in a changed heart for him?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> They should discipline themselves, make themselves study Jehovah’s Word, learn its truths, and preach them to others. After tasting it, they may delight in the peace and contentment, the serenity and clear conscience, that come from this food. At first the person may not want to, only knowing in his mind that he should do it but not desiring to in his heart. But suppose he determines to taste and see if it is good. Without his heart being in it, he lives his daily life like a Christian and preaches God’s Word to others. He continues to do it for a time, and then begins to see the good results, experiences the good that follows from this course, and <span id="page89" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="89" data-before-text="89"></span>gradually he appreciates it in his heart, comes into heart sympathy with it, and a desire to do it sprouts and grows in his heart. Not only in his intellect but in his heart also God’s law is being written. By his learning it, weighing it, trying it, practicing it, enjoying its good results, thrilling to the joy he sees in others as a result of his preaching, his heart comes to appreciate it and desire it and he is impelled by his feelings and emotions to do it. So the heart is written on, changed, and what once had to be forced is now done by emotional choice and desire, with no further battling with the heart necessary because it has been conquered, has been purged of its former desires and now motivates its possessor into the course prescribed by Jehovah’s law. And all because it was disciplined to taste what it thought it could never like.</p>

Godly fear is noble and <span id="page26" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="26" data-before-text="26"></span>uplifting, not depressing or terrifying.

Saul, the powerful king of Israel, was determined to put him to death. When David needed provisions, he stopped at the city of Nob, where he made a modest request for five loaves of bread. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022240/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Sam. 21:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022240/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 3</a>) Later, he and his men found refuge in a cave.

Saul also knew that his own disobedience had led to Jehovah’s rejecting him as king of Israel and that Jehovah had selected David for the throne. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022240/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>1 Samuel 23:16, 17</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Still, as king of Israel, Saul had a large army and many supporters, so David had to flee for his life. Did Saul really think that he could fight against God’s expressed purpose for David? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022240/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 55:11</a>) The Bible does not say, but we can be sure of one thing: Saul was putting himself in a dangerous position. Those who fight against God always lose!</p>

But David did not blame Jehovah for <span id="page3" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="3" data-before-text="3"></span>the danger he was in; nor did he complain about having a limited food supply and a cave for shelter. On the contrary, it might have been while he was hiding in that very cave that he composed the beautiful song of praise that includes the words of our theme text: “Those seeking Jehovah will lack nothing good.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022240/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 34:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>4.</strong><strong> What questions will we consider, and why are they important?</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Today many of Jehovah’s servants have experienced a shortage of food and other necessities of life.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2022240/1">b</a> This has been especially true during the recent pandemic. And with the “great tribulation” looming, we can expect to face even more difficult times. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022240/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 24:21</a>) With those facts in mind, let us answer four questions: In what way did David “lack nothing good”? Why must we learn to be content? Why can we be confident that Jehovah will care for us? And how can we prepare now for the future?</p><h2 id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>“I WILL LACK NOTHING”</strong></h2>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>5-6.</strong><strong> How does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022240/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 23:1-6</a> help us understand what David meant when he said that God’s servants would “lack nothing good”?</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> What did David mean when he said that Jehovah’s servants would “lack nothing good”? We can get an idea by considering the similar wording found in the 23rd Psalm. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022240/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 23:1-6</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> David introduces that psalm with the words: “Jehovah is my Shepherd. <strong><em>I will lack nothing.”</em></strong> In the rest of the psalm, David mentions things that are truly of lasting value​—the abundant spiritual blessings he enjoys by accepting Jehovah as his Shepherd. Jehovah leads him “in the paths of righteousness,” and He loyally supports David in good times and in bad times. David acknowledges that his life in Jehovah’s <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>“grassy pastures” will not be trouble free. At times, he may get discouraged, as if walking “in the valley of deep shadow,” and he will have enemies. But with Jehovah as his Shepherd, David will “fear no harm.”</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> So here we have the answer to our question: In what way did David “lack nothing good”? Spiritually speaking, he had everything he needed. His happiness was not dependent on material things. David was satisfied with what Jehovah provided. What mattered most to him was the blessing and the protection of his God.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong><strong> According to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022240/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Luke 21:20-24</a>, what challenging situation did the first-century Judean Christians face?</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> From David’s words we can see how important it is for us to have a proper view of material things. We can certainly enjoy whatever material possessions we have, but we should not make them the focus of our life. That was a vital truth that first-century Christians living in Judea came to understand. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022240/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>Luke 21:20-24</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Jesus had warned them that the time would come when the city of Jerusalem would be “surrounded by encamped armies.” When that occurred, they needed to “begin fleeing to the mountains.” Their flight would lead to their salvation, but it would come at a high cost. Some years ago, <em>The Watchtower</em> put it this way: “They left fields and homes, not even gathering their possessions from their houses. Confident of the protection and support of Jehovah, they put his worship ahead of everything else that might seem important.”</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>8.</strong><strong> What sobering lesson can we learn from what happened to the first-century Christians living in Judea?</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> What sobering lesson can we learn from what happened to the first-century Christians living in Judea? <em>The Watchtower</em> just mentioned said: “There may be tests ahead as to how we view material things; are they the most important thing, or is the salvation that will come for all on God’s side more important?

It took faith on their part to rely on Jehovah for their basic needs. But they were not without help. Five years before the Romans surrounded Jerusalem, the apostle Paul gave the Hebrews some valuable advice: “Let your way of life be free of the love of money, <strong><em>while you are content</em></strong> with the present things. For he has said: ‘I will never leave you, and I will never abandon you.’ So that we may be of good courage and say: ‘Jehovah is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022240/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Heb. 13:5, 6</a>) No doubt those who took to heart Paul’s advice before the Roman invasion found it easier to adapt to what might have been a modest lifestyle in their new home. They were certain that Jehovah would care <span id="page5" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>for their basic needs. Paul’s words assure us that we can have the same confidence.</p><h2 id="p16" data-pid="16"><strong>“WE WILL BE CONTENT WITH THESE THINGS”</strong></h2>

David often relied on Jehovah, and his God never <span id="page7" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>disappointed him. When young, David faced the Philistine giant Goliath and told that formidable warrior: “This very day Jehovah will surrender you into my hand.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022240/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Sam. 17:46</a>) Later, David was in the service of a king, Saul, who tried a number of times to murder him.

It takes faith and a willingness to rely on Jehovah to ask our employer for time off so that we can attend an assembly or a convention or to ask for an adjusted work schedule so that we can attend all our meetings and spend more time in the ministry. Suppose our employer refuses our request and we lose our job. Do we have faith that Jehovah will never leave us or abandon us and that he will always supply our basic needs? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022240/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Heb. 13:5</a>) Many who are in full-time service can relate experiences that show how Jehovah came to their aid when they needed him most.

They were also risking their lives to follow David. Although they were on the run from King Saul, David was confident that Jehovah would continue supplying their basic needs. David wrote: <em>“The maned young lions themselves have had little on hand and gone hungry; but as for those seeking Jehovah, they will not lack anything good.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007164/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 34:10</a>) Jesus gave similar assurance to his followers.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007164/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matthew 6:33</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 5.

To do so, they would need to cultivate the fear of Jehovah, not of men. Jesus said: “Do not fear those who kill the body and after this are not able to do anything more. But I will indicate to you whom to fear: Fear him who after killing has authority to throw into Gehenna. Yes, I tell you, fear this One. Five sparrows sell for two coins of small value, do they not?

At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995203/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:2, 3</a>, what do we learn about the fear of Jehovah?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Furthermore, concerning Jesus as Messianic King, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995203/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:2, 3</a> states: “Upon him the spirit of Jehovah must settle down, the spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the spirit of counsel and of mightiness, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Jehovah; and there will be enjoyment by him in the fear of Jehovah.” How beautifully that is expressed! The fear of Jehovah is nothing unpleasant. It is positive and constructive. It is a quality that will pervade the entire domain over which Christ rules as King. He is ruling now, and to all who are being gathered as his subjects, he is giving instruction in the fear of Jehovah. How?</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 9.

Thus he endeavors to deepen our appreciation for it so that we will learn to find enjoyment in the fear of Jehovah just as he does.</p>

However, it is easy to make the claim, “I fear God.” It is another matter to prove it by our conduct. Hence, David proceeds to explain how we can show godly fear.</p>

Jehovah expects his friends to be honest too. But this is not easy in a world where many people are dishonest. What benefits come from being honest in all things?</p><h3 class="du-color--turquoise-700 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>1. What is the most important reason to be honest?</strong></h3><p id="p5" data-pid="5">When we are honest with others, we show Jehovah that we love and respect him. Consider: Jehovah knows everything we think and do. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021236/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:13</a>) He notices when we choose to be honest, and he appreciates it. His Word states: <strong>“Jehovah detests a devious person, but His close friendship is with the upright.”</strong>​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021236/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:32</a>.</p><h3 class="du-color--turquoise-700 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>2.

Whether we are speaking to our family, workmates, Christian brothers and sisters, or government officials, we do not lie or give misleading information. Honest people do not steal from others or defraud them. (Read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021236/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 24:28</a> and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021236/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:28</a>.)

<strong>How Can We Enjoy Peaceful Relations with Others?</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">To begin with, it shows us that it is not enough just to want to live free from strife. We have to <em>work</em> at enjoying peace with others. As the psalmist put it: “Who is the man that is delighting in life, that is loving enough days to see what is good? Safeguard your tongue against what is bad, and your lips against speaking deception. . . . seek to find peace, and pursue it.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972080/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 34:12-14</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">From your own experience, would you not put ‘unrestrained tongues and lips’ near the top of the list of peace wreckers? Many persons profess some religion. But what does their claim to worship God mean if their tongue is not truthful, if it cuts and lashes at others, or spreads remarks that damage others’ reputations? No wonder the disciple James wrote: “If any man seems to himself to be a formal worshiper and yet does not bridle his tongue, but goes on deceiving his own heart, this <span id="page68" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="68" data-before-text="68"></span>man’s form of worship is futile.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972080/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jas. 1:26</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>SELF-RESTRAINT A SIGN OF STRENGTH</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">A problem here is that many look on the course of refusing to trade insult for insult as a sign of weakness. The Bible shows that the truth is just the opposite. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972080/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 16:32</a> we read: “He that is slow to anger is better than a mighty man, and he that is controlling his spirit than the one capturing a city.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Yes, a person may outwardly appear powerful but inside be a moral weakling. Moral strength is far harder to come by than any other kind of power. Many, lacking strength to control their feelings, fit the description at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972080/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 25:28</a>: “As a city broken through, without a wall, is the man that has no restraint for his spirit.” They are vulnerable to every passing provocation.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Really, which makes more sense: to “let off steam” now and then to relieve inner pressure or to cool down the fire that is building up the steam? Why not work on the <em>source</em> of the problem? More often than not we find that the real problem is our pride, selfishness, shortsightedness or ignorance of the best way to solve personal problems. These produce hasty, excited words and acts. By contrast the Bible, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972080/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 7:8, 9</a>, says:</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">“Better is the end afterward of a matter than its beginning. Better is one who is patient than one who is haughty in spirit. Do not hurry yourself in your spirit to become offended, for the taking of offense is what rests in the bosom of the stupid ones.”</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">No one, of course, likes being the object of slighting remarks or actions. But is it worth it to let these cause us to erupt in violence? Men have become crippled or have crippled others, even lost their lives or caused others to lose theirs, because of the hastiness spawned by haughtiness and pride. They may ruin their lives to avenge a few words​—words possibly not intended to offend in the first place. Is this not “stupidity”?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The Bible’s counsel aids us to see and weigh the consequences <em>before</em> we act​—rather than to have to learn them by painful experience later. It helps us to build up the inner strength we need to succeed in ‘seeking peace and pursuing it.’ One way it does that is by helping us to make a right estimate of things​—recognizing what the really big things in life are and what things merit only minor importance.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">For example, many today go ‘all out’ to gain as many luxuries as they can. But often they rob their mate or children of the attention they need. Then friction and quarrels fill the home. Do you value luxuries​—rich food, for instance—​more than love and peace in your home? The Bible counsels: “Better is a dish of vegetables where there is love than a manger-fed bull [with its filet mignon and T-bone steaks] and hatred along with it.” “Better is a dry piece of bread with which there is quietness than a house full of the sacrifices of quarreling.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972080/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Prov. 15:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972080/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 17:1</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Some persons quickly gain our respect by the fine qualities they demonstrate. What about strangers, or some persons <span id="page69" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="69" data-before-text="69"></span>we know but whose qualities we do not find admirable? What will help us to maintain peaceful relations with these? This is not always easy to do. But here again the Bible comes to our aid. It shows us that we owe such ones fundamental respect as fellow members of the human family.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Thousands of years before modern scientists reached the conclusion that “all the peoples of the earth are a single family and have a common origin” (<em>The Races of Mankind,</em> 1951, pages 3, 4), the Bible contained that fact. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972080/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 1:26, 27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972080/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 3:20</a>) And by showing that God “made out of one man every nation of men, to dwell upon the entire surface of the earth,” and that “God is not partial, but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him,” the Bible knocks down any reason for pride or prejudice based on race or nationality.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972080/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 17:26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972080/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 10:34, 35</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>NEIGHBOR LOVE</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">More than respect is needed, however. We need to be motivated by love for our neighbor as for ourselves. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972080/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 22:39</a>) As far back as King Solomon’s time people were saying: “Just as he did to me, so I am going to do to him. I shall repay to each one according to his acting.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972080/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Prov. 24:29</a>) Many still follow the same selfish rule today. Others follow the rule given by Chinese sage Confucius: “Do not do to others what you would not want them to do to you.” But even this is based on a negative principle. How superior is the <em>positive</em> principle stated by Jesus: “Just as you want men to do to you, do the same way to them.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972080/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 6:31</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Yes, this positive principle shows that the way to ‘seek peace’ is not just by holding back from doing harmful things but by doing helpful things for others, things we ourselves would appreciate having done for us. A smile, a friendly greeting, expressions of courtesy as simple as opening a door for another, or expressions of gratitude for courtesies shown​—these and hundreds of other acts of human kindness can make a tremendous difference in our relations with others. Putting this principle to work in small ways prepares us for those times when doing so calls for greater effort and sacrifice.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Some may say: “Putting up with minor or occasional provocations or irritations is not so hard. But what about situations where pressure is severe and prolonged?” In such circumstances many drop the pursuit of peace and give in to bitterness or resort to acts designed to do harm.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Then it is a question of either trusting in human ability to gain relief or trusting in God to do so. It takes real faith to apply the words: “Do not avenge yourselves, beloved, but yield place to the wrath; for it is written: ‘Vengeance is mine; I will repay, says Jehovah.’ . . . Do not let yourself be conquered by the evil, but keep conquering the evil with the good.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972080/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Rom. 12:19-21</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Do you have such faith in God as the supreme Judge and in his declared purpose to establish justice in all the earth? Do you believe the Bible’s promise of a righteous government headed by God’s own Son, a Kingdom rule that will bring lasting peace? Only by gaining knowledge of the Bible’s teachings and then applying them in your daily life, proving to yourself their trueness and practicality, can you have such faith.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Would you appreciate help in doing this?

Learn how true the words are: “Abundant peace belongs to those loving your law, and for them there is no stumbling block.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972080/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 119:165</a>.</p>

<strong>Proving Faithful in Small Matters</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Reflect, too, on the future blessings of dependable ones, as you read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964565/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Luke 8:18</a>: “Therefore, pay attention to how you listen; for whoever has, more will be given him, but whoever does not have, even what he imagines he has will be taken away from him.” Suppose a dedicated servant of God does not want to take care of some little things in the congregation, but feels too tied down and wants to enjoy freedom from any responsibilities. Now, what effect will this have on his children whom he says he wants to train up to serve God? A person is not born to be a good father or overseer, but, through knowledge, training, experience and applying himself, with Jehovah’s help he can do well in either position. If he does well in one, he will most likely do well in the other. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964565/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Luke 16:10</a> records this statement by Jesus: “The person faithful in what is least is faithful also in much, and the person unrighteous in what is least is unrighteous also in much.” Clarke’s <em>Commentary,</em> Volume V, page 462, makes this interesting observation: “He who has the genuine principles of fidelity in him will make a <em>point of conscience</em> of carefully attending to even the <span id="page474" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="474" data-before-text="474"></span><em>smallest</em> thing; and it is by habituating himself to act uprightly in <em>little things</em> that he acquires the gracious habit of acting with propriety, fidelity, honour, and conscience, in matters of the greatest concern. On the contrary, he who does not act uprightly in <em>small</em> matters will seldom feel himself bound to pay much attention to the dictates of honour and conscience, in cases of <em>high</em> importance. Can we reasonably expect that a man who is continually falling by <em>little things</em> has power to resist temptations to <em>great evils?”</em></p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu">11, 12. (a) Where do Jehovah’s witnesses take care of little matters that really are important? (b) How are “sheep” fed and introduced to the organization?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Hundreds of thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses prove themselves faithful in small matters when they share in their house-to-house preaching activity. In fact, 1,040,836 publishers of God’s kingdom reported they had shared in this work. (See 1964 <em>Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses,</em> page 38.) In this ministerial work they find people who want to know more about God and his purposes. They want some help in studying the Bible. Well, Jehovah’s witnesses are happy to find such persons and oftentimes feel like the prospector finding the gold strike, for these meek ones are described as sheep in the Bible. Note the value placed upon these by Jehovah, as explained at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964565/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matthew 18:14</a>: “Likewise it is not a desirable thing with my Father who is in heaven for one of these little ones to perish.” Will Jehovah’s witnesses forget to make a note of the “sheep’s” address or write down the questions to be answered at the next call? Will they keep their promise and call back? And soon, within a few days? Jesus impressed upon Peter the need to feed the “sheep” by telling him three times: “Feed my sheep.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964565/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">John 21:15-17</a>) Jehovah’s witnesses have been instructed on ‘feeding the sheep.’ So they will be back. This is doing God’s work, and you thereby prove yourself faithful in small matters.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> From this point on the new-found “sheep” take in little things: details of doctrines, pieces of Bible prophecy, minute views of the organization, points of Bible principles, a bit of the clean living standards of the theocratic society. Should we view these as crumbs and not important enough to warrant a regular feeding program? No, but we will faithfully serve these meek persons, patiently teaching them how to serve Jehovah. These small matters add up to something very big—life, and everlasting life at that.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964565/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu">13, 14. (a) Can our speech be as revealing as our dependability? (b) Should we ignore downgrading trends in conversations? (c) How will the tide be turned to upbuilding discussions?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> Examine our conversation. Parts of speech, yes, words and phrases, true, but what meaning is conveyed? What attitude is revealed? Our speech will tell on us, make us known. “For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964565/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Matt. 12:34</a>) Our language, then, should come under supervision; we control it. There are certainly occasions for light conversation, for humor, and for relating experiences and events and for Scriptural discussions. But for a servant of God, in all these occasions one does not use speech to complain, to murmur, to find fault, to spread gossip or to use profanity or to brag. It is not necessary to gag oneself and smother conversation; rather, do as urged at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964565/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Psalm 34:13</a>: “Safeguard your tongue against what is bad, and your lips against speaking deception.”</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> It is when groups of people get to talking about someone that often immature ones will start the conversation going in the wrong direction by bringing up some shortcoming of that individual. Others will add to it and then we have a problem. Who in the group will have the courage to direct <span id="page475" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="475" data-before-text="475"></span>the conversation back to an upbuilding plane? Who will be loyal to Jehovah’s organization in this small matter and protect one of its members? Sometimes it takes only a word, a change of subjects, but it takes someone to do it. If a small rudder can steer a large ship and keep it sailing in safe waters, a small tongue can direct conversation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964565/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Jas. 3:4</a>) It is a big thing really, because if one finds fault with a person serving God he will soon be complaining about the position God has set up to get something done.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964565/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Jas. 5:9</a>.</p>

<strong>How Can We Enjoy Peaceful Relations with Others?</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">To begin with, it shows us that it is not enough just to want to live free from strife. We have to <em>work</em> at enjoying peace with others. As the psalmist put it: “Who is the man that is delighting in life, that is loving enough days to see what is good? Safeguard your tongue against what is bad, and your lips against speaking deception. . . . seek to find peace, and pursue it.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972080/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 34:12-14</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">From your own experience, would you not put ‘unrestrained tongues and lips’ near the top of the list of peace wreckers? Many persons profess some religion. But what does their claim to worship God mean if their tongue is not truthful, if it cuts and lashes at others, or spreads remarks that damage others’ reputations? No wonder the disciple James wrote: “If any man seems to himself to be a formal worshiper and yet does not bridle his tongue, but goes on deceiving his own heart, this <span id="page68" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="68" data-before-text="68"></span>man’s form of worship is futile.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972080/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jas. 1:26</a>.</p>

Who wants life, even everlasting life, without peace? Not the average man or woman. Life with no quietness or freedom from nagging disturbances makes one long to get away. This was well pictured in the proverbs of the much-married King Solomon: “The contentions of a wife are as a leaking roof that drives one away.” ‘Better is it to dwell upon a corner of a roof than with a contentious wife, although in a house in common.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959921/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 19:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959921/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 21:9</a>) Although living in a big, roomy house, a person would prefer to take refuge in the most remote corner of it to escape from the irritator and disturber.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 2.

That question is old, no doubt as old as the existence of trouble and injustice on our earth. Happy was the man who raised the question, not in hopelessness and helplessness, but with the ability to give the proved answer to the urgent question. His answer was something to sing about with musical accompaniment, and so it was included in the inspired Book of Psalms. It has been preserved for more than three thousand years for our benefit in this day of world trouble, distress and fear of more terrible things yet to come. Speaking as an experienced teacher to his pupils, the psalmist David, who became king of Jerusalem and the father of King Solomon, said:</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 3.

Turn away from what is bad and do what is good; seek to find peace and pursue it. The eyes of Jehovah are toward the righteous ones, and his ears are toward their cry for help. The face of Jehovah is against those doing what is bad, to cut off the mention of them from the very earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959921/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 34:11-16</a>.</p>

<strong>Walking in Good Behavior</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> Joy is first mentioned after love, and where are we going to find joy today and how are we going to find the best opportunity of bearing this fruit? There is only the one answer, and that is, in Jehovah’s organization, Zion, wherein his own loving heart finds joyful satisfaction. Does not the prophecy of Zephaniah call upon those in Zion to “be glad and rejoice with all <span id="page664" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="664" data-before-text="664"></span>the heart,” and then go on to tell how even Jehovah himself “will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love; he will joy over thee with singing”? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954807/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Zeph. 3:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954807/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 17</a>, <em>AS</em>) As specific evidence in support of this, many thousands of our readers will readily recall the tremendous and sustained joy and happiness that was experienced during the eight days of that great international gathering at Yankee Stadium in 1953. Literally, for those eight days, that was the best place on earth to experience real joy, and the same is true in principle of all special assemblies of Jehovah’s people.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 4, 5. What was the joy set before Jesus, and in what practical ways can we share therein?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> We know, too, that Christ Jesus has entered into “the joy that was set before him” in being made the chosen instrument, as King, to bring to full fruition his heavenly Father’s glorious purpose and the complete vindication of his Father’s name. In this happy work all the Lord’s true followers are invited to share. Indeed, that is why it is God’s “good pleasure” “to gather all things together again in the Christ” and in the organization under him, in order “that we should serve for the praise of his glory.” Let us therefore be faithful in the service of whatever Kingdom interests have been committed into our hands so that we may have the thrill of hearing and responding to that invitation: “Enter into the joy of your master.” And what greater joy is to be found than in seeking and finding and then feeding one of the Lord’s “other sheep”?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954807/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 12:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954807/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Eph. 1:9-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954807/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Matt. 25:21</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Speaking personally, have you not known what it is sometimes for some trial or difficult condition to get on top of you so that you feel that life is pretty grim, and then you go to a meeting where you can share with your brothers in the fellowship of Kingdom truths and Kingdom service, or perhaps have a look at <em>The Watchtower</em> that has just come? You know the effect it has, as if a burden were lifted from your mind. It takes you out of yourself (which is a splendid thing), and perhaps gives you a new outlook on how to meet your problem. In other words, as explained in our previous study, you have taken advantage of the provisions made through the organization, resulting in Jehovah’s spirit’s operating afresh in your heart and mind, along with its fruitage of joy.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>Peace</strong></p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 6.

Involving what?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Next in the list comes peace. And what can be said about that? A great deal, of course, but if we were to use an illustration of a huntsman first seeking out his prey and then going after it in hot pursuit, it would certainly not appear to be a picture of peace, would it? Yet listen to what David wrote at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954807/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 34:14</a>: “Seek peace, and pursue it.” Does that mean that peace is an elusive bird, like the “dove of peace” is to the nations today? No. It is the importance of peace that is the thing stressed. First, we must gain peaceful relations with God, through Jesus Christ, and with his family of devoted people. Then we must see the necessity of pursuing and maintaining that peace, praying for it and always working to that end, as David said in another psalm: “Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee. For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee. For the sake of the house of Jehovah our God [the center of pure worship] I will seek thy good.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954807/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 122:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954807/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 8, 9</a>, <em>AS</em>) This may mean, on your part, sacrificing something, perhaps some relationship into which you have entered, that is quite legitimate in your own eyes but that you know <span id="page665" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="665" data-before-text="665"></span>very well is only causing uneasiness and talk among your brothers, to say nothing of providing a source of gossip among those not in the truth.

If so, you are not alone. Millions are struggling to cope with the day-to-day pressures of living in this wicked system of things. For some, it seems almost unbearable. They feel very much as did the psalmist David, who wrote: “I have grown numb and become crushed to an extreme degree; I have roared due to the groaning of my heart. My own heart has palpitated heavily, my power has left me, and the light of my own eyes also is not with me.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 38:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 10</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> As Christians, we are not surprised by the distresses of life. We understand that “pangs of distress” are part of the foretold sign of Jesus’ presence.

How accurately that describes the intensity of people’s suffering in these “critical,” or “fierce,” times that are so “hard to deal with”!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1</a>; <em>Kingdom Interlinear.</em></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>Jehovah Understands Our Distresses</strong></p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 3.

In addition to what is experienced by mankind in general, as God’s servants we also face an “adversary, the Devil,” who is determined to undermine our faith. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:8</a>) How easy it would be to feel as David did: “Reproach itself has broken my heart, and the wound is incurable. And I kept hoping for someone to show sympathy, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none”!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 69:20</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 4.

No. Notice his further words in that psalm: “Jehovah is listening to the poor ones, and he will indeed not despise his very own prisoners,” or “those of his who are prisoners.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 69:33</a>; ftn.) In a broad sense, we may at times feel as if we were prisoners held captive by our distresses or afflictions. It may appear that others do not truly understand our situation​—and perhaps they do not. But like David, we can be comforted in knowing that Jehovah fully understands our distresses.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 34:15</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 5.

Solomon expressed his confidence that God would not only hear their prayers but also act in their behalf. Why? Because he truly knows what is in “the heart of the sons of mankind.”</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 6.

We should be comforted in knowing that he understands our distresses and that he cares about us. The apostle Peter confirmed this when he said: “Throw all your anxiety upon him, because he cares for you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:7</a>) It matters to Jehovah what happens to us. Jesus emphasized Jehovah’s loving care, saying: “Do not two sparrows sell for a coin of small value? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father’s knowledge. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Therefore have no fear: you are worth more than many sparrows.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 10:29-31</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>Rely on Jehovah’s Help</strong></p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 7.

Notice what we are counseled to do: “Throw <em>all</em> your anxiety upon him.” This means that we figuratively hand over to Jehovah the responsibility for all our cares and concerns. We try to stop worrying and patiently trust in him to care for our needs. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 6:25-32</a>) Such trust requires humility, not relying on our own strength or wisdom. By humbling ourselves “under the mighty hand of God,” we acknowledge our lowly position. (<em>Read</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><em>1 Peter 5:6</em></a><em>.</em>) In turn, this helps us to cope with whatever God permits. We may yearn for immediate relief, but we trust that Jehovah knows precisely when and how to act in our behalf.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 54:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Isa. 41:10</a>.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 9.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 55:4</a>) It is understood that this psalm was written when his son Absalom schemed to steal the kingship from him. David’s most trusted counselor, Ahithophel, joined in the conspiracy. David had to flee Jerusalem for his life. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Sam. 15:12-14</a>) Even under those distressing circumstances, David continued to trust in God, and he was not disappointed.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">10. What must we do when facing distresses?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> It is imperative that we, like David, approach Jehovah in prayer concerning whatever distresses we may be experiencing. Let us consider what the apostle Paul urged us to do in this regard. (<em>Read</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><em>Philippians 4:6, 7</em></a><em>.</em>) What will result from such intense prayer? <span id="page14" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>“The peace of God that excels all thought will guard [our] hearts and [our] mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.”</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">11. How does “the peace of God” protect our hearts and our mental powers?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Will prayer lead to a change in your situation? It may. We should realize, though, that Jehovah does not always answer our prayers in the manner that we may want. Nevertheless, prayer helps us to keep our mental balance, so that our distresses do not overwhelm us. “The peace of God” can stabilize us when we are burdened down with distressing emotions. Like a garrison of soldiers assigned to protect a city from hostile invasion, “the peace of God” will protect our hearts and our mental powers. It will also allow us to rise above our doubts, fears, and negative thoughts and prevent us from reacting rashly and unwisely.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 145:18</a>.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">12.

Consider an illustration that in some respects matches our situation. An employee may work under an abusive manager. However, the employee has an opportunity to express his feelings to the owner of the company, who is a kind, reasonable man. The owner assures the employee that he understands the situation and reveals that the manager will soon be removed from his position. How does that make the employee feel? Believing that assurance and knowing what is about to take place will strengthen his resolve to continue on, even if he has to face a few more difficulties in the meantime. Similarly, we know that Jehovah understands our situation, and he assures us that soon “the ruler of this world will be cast out.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">John 12:31</a>) How comforting that is!</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">13.

No. More is required. We need to act in harmony with our prayers. When King Saul sent men to David’s home to put him to death, David prayed: “Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; from those rising up against me may you protect me. Deliver me from the practicers of what is hurtful, and from bloodguilty men save me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ps. 59:1, 2</a>) In addition to praying, David listened to his wife and took the necessary action to escape. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Sam. 19:11, 12</a>) In a similar way, we can pray for practical wisdom to help us deal with and perhaps improve our distressing circumstances.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Jas. 1:5</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>How We Can Have Strength to Endure</strong></p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">14.

They may even continue for some time. If that is the case, what will help us to endure? First, remember that when we continue to serve Jehovah faithfully despite difficulties, we prove our love for him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Acts 14:22</a>) Keep in mind Satan’s accusation concerning Job: “Would Job worship you if he got nothing out of it? You have always protected him and his family and everything he owns. You bless everything he does, and you have given him enough cattle to fill the whole country. But now suppose you take away everything he has​—he will curse you to your face!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Job 1:9-11</a>, <em>Today’s English Version</em>) By means of his integrity, Job proved that accusation to be a base lie. By our enduring <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>under distressing circumstances, we too have an opportunity to prove Satan a liar. In turn, our endurance strengthens our hope and confidence.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Jas. 1:4</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">15. What examples can strengthen us?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> Second, keep in mind that “the same things in the way of sufferings are being accomplished in the entire association of your brothers in the world.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:9</a>) Yes, “no temptation has taken you except what is common to men.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:13</a>) You can therefore gain strength and courage by meditating on the examples of others rather than focusing on your own difficulties.

It makes us <em>“fully</em> competent” and <em>“completely</em> equipped.” The original-language word rendered “completely equipped” literally means “having been fitted out.” This word could have been used in ancient times of a boat that was fitted out with everything needed for a voyage or of a machine that was capable of performing whatever was expected of it. Similarly, Jehovah through his Word provides us with all that we need to handle whatever may come <span id="page16" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>our way. Accordingly, we can say, “If God permits it, I can take it, with his help.”</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong>Deliverance From <em>All</em> Our Distresses</strong></p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">18.

How is faithful endurance possible?</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> Until that time, we continue to deal with the distressing conditions of this wicked world.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Ps. 55:6-8</a>) Let us remember that our faithful endurance proves the Devil a liar. May we gain strength from our prayers and our Christian brotherhood, keeping in mind that our brothers are experiencing trials similar to ours. Continue to be fully competent and completely equipped by making good use of God’s Word. Never allow your trust in the loving care provided by “the God of all comfort” to waver. Remember that “the eyes of Jehovah are toward the righteous ones, and his ears are toward their cry for help.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008203/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Ps. 34:15</a>.</p>

<strong>“The Tender Compassion of Our God”</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> Today, too, our loving God is deeply concerned about us as individuals. We can be sure that he is keenly aware of any suffering we may undergo. The psalmist David wrote: “The eyes of Jehovah are on the righteous, and his ears listen to their cry for help. Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted; he saves those who are crushed in spirit.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002050/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 34:15,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002050/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 18</a>) Regarding those described by these words, one Bible commentator notes: “They are of a broken heart and a contrite spirit, that is, humbled for sin, and emptied of self; they are low in their own eyes, and have no confidence in their own merit.” Such ones may feel that Jehovah is far away and that they are too insignificant for him to care about them. But that is not the case. David’s words assure us that Jehovah does not abandon those who are “low in their own eyes.” Our compassionate God knows that at such times, we need him more than ever, and he is near.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> Consider an experience. A mother in the United States rushed her two-year-old son to the hospital because he was suffering from a bad case of croup. After examining the boy, the doctors informed the mother that they would have to keep him in the hospital overnight. Where did the mother spend that night? In a chair in the hospital room, right next to her son’s bed! Her little boy was sick, and she just had to be near him. Surely we can expect even more from our loving heavenly Father!

Under divine inspiration, one of God’s worshippers, David, said to him: <strong>“Your eyes even saw me as an embryo.”</strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021238/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 139:16</a>) Jehovah greatly values your life.

<strong>Comfort for the Brokenhearted</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Comfort for the Brokenhearted</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">‘JEHOVAH could never love me.’ So said one Christian woman who has struggled with depression much of her life. She convinced herself that Jehovah must be distant from her. Is Jehovah really far from those of his worshippers who may be depressed? The comforting answer is found in the inspired words of the psalmist David, as recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011409/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 34:18</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">David knew the effect that extreme distress can have on a faithful worshipper of Jehovah. As a young man, David lived as a fugitive, relentlessly pursued by Saul, a jealous king bent on killing him. David sought refuge in what he might have thought to be the last place that Saul would look​—the enemy city of Gath, in Philistine territory. But after being recognized, David narrowly escaped by feigning insanity. David credited God with delivering him, and based on this experience, he wrote <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011409/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 34</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Did David believe that God is far away from those who in the face of distress become dejected or feel unworthy of His notice? David writes: “Jehovah is near to those that are broken at heart; and those who are crushed in spirit he saves.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011409/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Verse 18</a>) Let us see how those words convey comfort and hope.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong><em>“Jehovah is near.”</em></strong> One reference work says that this phrase is “an expressive way of saying that the Lord is attentive and watchful, always ready to help and to save his people.” It is reassuring to know that Jehovah watches over his people. He sees what they are going through in these “critical times,” and he knows their innermost feelings.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011409/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011409/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Acts 17:27</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong><em>“Those that are broken at heart.”</em></strong> In some cultures, “a broken heart” has reference to unrequited love. But the psalmist’s words refer to “more general grief and sorrow,” says one scholar. Yes, even faithful worshippers of God may at times experience extreme hardships that break their heart.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong><em>“Those who are crushed in spirit.”</em></strong> Discouraged ones may become so low in their own eyes that they momentarily lose all hope. A handbook for Bible translators says that this expression may be rendered “those who have nothing good to look forward to.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">How does Jehovah respond to those who are “broken at heart” and “crushed in spirit”? Does he keep distant from them, feeling that they are unworthy of his love and attention? On the contrary! Like a loving parent who holds and comforts a child in distress, Jehovah is near to his worshippers who cry out to him for help. He is eager to comfort and soothe their broken heart and crushed spirit. He can give them the wisdom and strength needed to cope with any trials they may face.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011409/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011409/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> James 1:5</a>.</p>

<strong>Enjoy Life in the Fear of Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Meanwhile, to continue obeying Jehovah in a corrupt and hostile world requires endurance. Godly fear is a great aid as we cultivate obedience. Because of the critical times in which we live, some servants of Jehovah experience extreme hardships that break their heart and crush their spirit, as it were. However, they can be absolutely sure that if they look to Jehovah, he will help them to endure. David’s words convey true comfort: <em>“Jehovah is near to those that are broken at heart; and those who are crushed in spirit he saves.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007164/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Psalm 34:18</a>) Encouragingly, David went on to say: <em>“Many are the calamities of the righteous one, but out of them all Jehovah delivers him.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007164/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Psalm 34:19</a>) No matter how many calamities befall us, Jehovah is strong enough to deliver us.</p>

<strong>Do You Respect Their Dignity?</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">What if guilt over our mistakes refuses to fade away? Or what if memories of abuses suffered continue to be painful? These can crush our personal dignity and bring on intense depression. How comforting are the words of King David found at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998247/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Psalm 34:18</a>: “Jehovah is near to those that are broken at heart; and those who are crushed in spirit he saves”! Jehovah is ready and willing to sustain his servants when they have to cope with depression and feelings of worthlessness. Supplication to him along with seeking the help of those spiritually qualified, such as Christian parents, elders, and other mature ones in the congregation, is the lifeline to restoring self-respect and personal dignity.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998247/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">James 5:13-15</a>.</p>

There is a heartfelt wanting to come back into God’s favor, motivated by a love for him that comes from knowing him and his splendid qualities and righteous purposes. Appreciation for his goodness and greatness makes genuinely repentant wrongdoers feel keen remorse at having brought reproach on his name. Love for neighbor also makes them rue the harm they have done to others, the bad example set, the hurt caused, perhaps the way they have sullied the reputation of God’s people among outsiders, thereby hindering persons from recognizing the true congregation of God. These things, and not just the shame of being ‘found out’ or the prospect of discipline, cause them to feel “broken at heart” and “crushed in spirit.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972524/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 34:18</a>.</p>

Good counsel regarding this is given at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 4:7</a>: “Wisdom is the prime thing. Acquire wisdom; and with all that you acquire, acquire understanding.”</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Knowing the various meanings of expressions used in the Bible is an important factor in acquiring understanding. The word “spirit,” for example, has at least seven different meanings. Unless a person knows these meanings he cannot gain an accurate understanding of the Scripture texts in which the word is used.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the Hebrew and Greek languages from which the Bible was translated, the word “spirit” carries the basic thought of something windlike, something that is invisible and forceful like air in motion. For this reason Jehovah God, Jesus Christ and angels are called spirits. They cannot be seen by man but they have power that can be made perceptible to man by the effects it produces in the earth. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 4:24</a> we are told that “God is a Spirit,” and at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:45</a> the resurrected Jesus Christ is called “a life-giving spirit.” Regarding angels, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:7</a> states: “He makes his angels spirits.”</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Hebrew word for spirit is <em>ruʹahh</em> and the Greek word is <em>pneuʹma.</em> Some Bible translations render the Hebrew word <em>n<sup>e</sup>shamahʹ</em> as spirit at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 26:4 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Proverbs 20:27</a>, but more careful translations use the word “breath” here rather than spirit. This word <em>n<sup>e</sup>shamahʹ</em> is the one that is used at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Genesis 2:7</a> for the vital breath that was put into Adam at the time of his creation. Its use here indicates that what God blew into the nostrils of Adam was literal breath. However, the active life force that God gave him, causing him to have a conscious existence, was his <em>ruʹahh</em> or spirit. This active life force is not specifically mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 2:7</a>, but it is referred to elsewhere.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 6:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 7:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Eccl. 12:7</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The life force or principle of life in earthly creatures that is sustained by breathing is one of the meanings of spirit. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 27:3</a>, the word is used with this meaning. “While my breath is yet whole within me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils.” The Hebrew word <em>n<sup>e</sup>shamah</em>ʹ is used for the literal breath in this scripture, whereas <em>ruʹahh</em> is used for spirit, or life force.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Sometimes the word spirit indicates a person’s mental disposition. This is something that cannot be seen, but it manifests itself in a visible way by a person’s expressions or actions. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 34:18</a>, mental disposition is clearly indicated by the word spirit: “Jehovah is near to those that are broken at heart; and those who are crushed in spirit he saves.” As a rock is crushed with a hammer so does a repentant person feel crushed when God’s Word brings home to him the gravity of his sins. He humbly seeks forgiveness as did the people who were “stabbed to the heart” with guilt feelings from what Peter said to them at Pentecost. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 2:37</a>) So “crushed in spirit” indicates the mental disposition of a person who has become <span id="page503" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="503" data-before-text="503"></span>conscious of his sins and of his spiritual need.</p>

However, they can be absolutely sure that if they look to Jehovah, he will help them to endure.

<strong>“Taste and See that Jehovah Is Good”</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">There was the occasion when Israelite King Saul, because of jealousy, tried to kill David. So David was forced to flee into the enemy territory of the Philistines. There he disguised his sanity by acting crazily, and he was able to escape with his life. It was on this occasion, when his life was in great danger, that David composed <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978608/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 34</a>. Note how an understanding of these circumstances gives added meaning to his words:</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“I inquired of Jehovah, and he answered me, and out of all my frights he delivered me. The angel of Jehovah is camping all around those fearing him, and he rescues them. <em>Taste and see that Jehovah is good,</em> O you people; happy is the able-bodied man that takes refuge in him. Many are the calamities of the righteous one, but out of them all Jehovah delivers him.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978608/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 34:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978608/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 7, 8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978608/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 19</a>, and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978608/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps 34:superscription</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Serving Jehovah often exposes one to reproach and persecution​—<em>calamities</em>—​as David’s experiences illustrate. Since this is true, some persons may hesitate to offer themselves unreservedly in God’s service. But speaking from experience, David urges us to “taste and see that Jehovah is good.” Yes, David knew that, despite the difficulties that may be encountered, God’s servants would realize Jehovah’s mighty protective hand and the “peace of God that excels all thought.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978608/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Phil. 4:7</a>.</p>

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page101" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="101" data-before-text="101"></span><strong>Fulfilled Prophecy Testifies that God Lives</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Many persons feel that a living God would have interfered long ago in human affairs to cut short this era of wickedness and woe. And now that some clergymen have put forth the idea that “God is dead,” many wonder where they can find the truth about the matter. The truth can be found in the Holy Bible, and especially pertinent to this controversy of whether God lives is the testimony of fulfilled prophecy.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When prophecies of the Bible are seen being fulfilled, it is evidence that God lives. Humans cannot accurately foretell events and give precise details concerning them even a few years in advance, but God has done so centuries in advance. For example, centuries before the arrival of Jesus Christ on earth, God foretold in detail many things in connection with him.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>WHAT PROPHECIES CONCERNING JESUS TESTIFY</strong></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Consider Jesus’ birth. About seven hundred years in advance God inspired his prophet to foretell that it would take place in Bethlehem. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967121/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mic. 5:2</a>) And how remarkably this was fulfilled! It was, in fact, as a result of a royal decree of the Roman Caesar himself! The Jewish virgin Mary and her husband Joseph were living in Galilee, in Nazareth, some sixty or more miles north of Bethlehem, a long journey over rugged terrain in those days. However, Augustus Caesar’s registration decree required them to travel to Bethlehem to register​—at just the right time for Jesus to be born there!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967121/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 2:1-7</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Consider, also, the prophecies that were fulfilled at Jesus’ death. In the inspired Psalms it was foretold that not one of his bones would be broken, and that those present would cast lots for his clothing. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967121/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 34:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967121/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 22:18</a>) Did this occur? Since the day following the execution was a holy one to the Jews and bodies were not to be left on the torture stake overnight, the Roman soldiers proceeded to break the legs of the men to hasten their death. But since Jesus had just died, his were left unbroken. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967121/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 19:31-36</a>) As for Jesus’ inner garment, it was woven with no seam, so the soldiers decided to determine by lot whose it would be, rather than to tear it up and divide it. How miraculously these prophecies were fulfilled!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967121/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 19:23, 24</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Prophecies regarding Jesus’ time in the tomb and his resurrection likewise were astonishingly fulfilled. In the Psalms it was foretold that God would not leave his holy one in hell, or the grave. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967121/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 16:10</a>, <em>AV</em>) And Jesus himself explained that he would “be killed, and on the third day be raised up.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967121/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 16:21</a>) Was he? Yes, he was! Testified the apostle Peter: “This Jesus God resurrected, of which fact we are all <span id="page102" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="102" data-before-text="102"></span>witnesses.” The prophecies were fulfilled!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967121/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 2:30-32</a>.</p>

<strong>Worship That Leads to the Kingdom of God</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><span id="page245" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="245" data-before-text="245"></span><strong>THE BOOK OF TRUE WORSHIP</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">However, regardless of what form of religion you now practice, you will want to know about the Kingdom hope that the Creator of mankind holds out to those that worship him in the way he approves. Yes, this Great Spirit <em>does</em> communicate with man today; no, not by means of a witch doctor or a religious clergyman, but through the pages of the oldest book in existence, a book that even records information about the first man and his creation by God. This is an Oriental book originating in and being written entirely by men from Eastern lands. This famous book, which contains the inspired writings of some forty Orientals, is generally called today the Holy Bible, or simply the Scriptures.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">In addition to its great antiquity the Bible from earliest times has realized the greatest distribution of any writings in existence. During the past five hundred years billions of copies have been printed—far more than of any other book. Equally remarkable is the fact that the Bible has been translated into 1,202 different languages, so that it is available to more than 90 percent of earth’s population in their own tongue. Is not such a large distribution and wide circulation what you would expect of the Book that is inspired by Almighty God?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">But what particularly stamps this Book as being of Divine authorship are its prophecies that have consistently proved reliable. Humans are not always able to accurately foretell the weather twenty-four hours in advance, yet the Holy Bible foretold ever so many events centuries and even millenniums before they actually occurred. No other book claiming to be of Divine authorship has been able to do this, which is evidence that the Bible is the book that God is using to communicate with men today.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Why, consider for a moment how the Holy Bible recorded in advance the rise and fall of World Powers that have dominated earth’s affairs. Under inspiration of God, the Hebrew prophet Isaiah foretold in the eighth century B.C.E. that Cyrus the Persian would serve as a liberator of the captive Israelites from Babylon. God even gave details of the conquest. Nearly two hundred years later Cyrus marched into Babylon, exactly as foretold. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 44:26-45:3</a>) The prophet Daniel, writing under inspiration of God, also recorded in advance the rise of the Medo-Persian World Power. More than that, in unmistakable terms, he told about the coming to prominence of the next World Power, Greece, its conquest of Medo-Persia, and, in time, its dissolution into four smaller empires with the death of its conquering king, Alexander the Great.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Dan. 8:1-8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 20-22</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Perhaps even more amazing are the fulfillments of scores of prophecies relating to the promised Messiah, the one appointed by God as deliverer to all mankind. He was to be born of the Israelite tribe of Judah in Bethlehem.

<strong>Light on Life’s Roadway from the Psalms</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">To begin with, the Psalms eloquently and repeatedly call attention to the fact that Jehovah God created all things: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man?” (8:3, 4) “Before the mountains themselves were born, or you proceeded to bring forth as with labor pains the earth and the productive land, even from time indefinite to time indefinite you are God.” (90:2) “Know that Jehovah is God. It is he that has made us, and not we ourselves.” (100:3) <span id="page550" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="550" data-before-text="550"></span>“I shall laud you because in a fear-inspiring way I am wonderfully made.”—139:14.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Among the earliest instances of God’s dealings with his creatures that the book of Psalms records is that of Jehovah concluding a covenant with Abraham and his making sworn statements to Isaac and Jacob. In fulfillment of these promises Jehovah God “brought out his people with exultation” to the land promised.—105:9, 10, 42-44.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Bringing his people Israel into their Promised Land involved many mighty acts, and these the book of Psalms also features. It tells that Jehovah sent ten plagues upon Egypt, that he split the Red Sea so that they could pass over and that he miraculously sustained them in the wilderness, providing bread, meat and water. Noted also are the striking victories God gained for his people in the days of Barak and Gideon.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalms 78,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 83,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 105,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 106,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/4" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> 135</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Then too, the Psalms record that it was necessary for Jehovah God repeatedly to chastise his people, even to the point of bringing them into Babylonian captivity: “By the rivers of Babylon—there we sat down. We also wept when we remembered Zion.” (137:1-9) And they record also Israel’s return from captivity: “When Jehovah gathered back the captive ones of Zion, we became like those who were dreaming. . . . At that time they proceeded to say among the nations: ‘Jehovah has done a great thing in what he has done with them.’” (126:1, 2) Yes, by recording how Jehovah God dealt with his people in times past and why, the book of Psalms throws much light on life’s roadway, for thereby it acquaints us with God’s attributes and principles.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>THE LIGHT OF PROPHECY</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The book of Psalms also serves as a light on life’s roadway by reason of the prophecies it contains, many of which have already been fulfilled, giving confidence that the rest will also have fulfillment. Among the many prophecies of the Psalms regarding Jesus Christ that the Christian Greek Scriptures show had fulfillment were that he would come in dedication to do God’s will (40:8; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 10:7-9</a>); that zeal for God’s house would eat him up, as it were (69:9; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 2:17</a>); that he would be betrayed by an intimate (41:9; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 13:18</a>); that lots would be cast for his garments (22:18; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 19:24</a>); that not a bone of him would be broken (34:20; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 19:36</a>) and that God would not leave his soul in Sheol or Hades.—16:10; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 2:29-31</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Further, the book of Psalms foretold Jesus’ exaltation to the right hand of his Father, there to await God’s due time for him to go into action against God’s enemies and for God to subject all things under Christ’s feet.—110:1, 2; 8:6; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Heb. 1:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 2:8</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The fulfillment of such prophecies instills faith that the prophecies in the Psalms regarding the blessings of the Messianic reign of the King’s Son, Jesus Christ, will also have fulfillment: “Let him judge the afflicted ones of the people, let him save the sons of the poor one, and let him crush the defrauder. He will descend like the rain upon the mown grass, like copious showers that wet the earth. In his days the righteous one will sprout, and the abundance of peace until the moon is no more. There will come to be plenty of grain on the earth; on the top of the mountains there will be an overflow.”—72:4, 6, 7, 16.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>BIBLE TEACHINGS</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The book of Psalms also throws light on life’s roadway by the various Bible teachings it touches on. Fittingly it stresses the role of Jehovah God as the Universal <span id="page551" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="551" data-before-text="551"></span>Sovereign. Though ‘the rulers of earth mass together as one against Jehovah and his anointed one, Jehovah himself will laugh at them in derision, speak to them in his anger and disturb them in hot displeasure.’ (2:1, 2, 4, 5) He will put them in their place, answering the psalmists’ prayers: “Do arise, O Jehovah! Let not mortal man prove superior in strength. Let the nations be judged before your face. Do put fear into them, O Jehovah, that the nations may know that they are but mortal men.” “Fill their faces with dishonor, that people may search for your name, O Jehovah. That people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.”—9:19, 20; 83:16, 18.</p>

<strong>The Festival of Freedom</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The Hebrews measured their day from sundown to sundown instead of from midnight to midnight as we do. After the sun had dipped below the horizon on the evening of the thirteenth day of Abib the anticipated fourteenth day began. They killed their animals between the time when the sun went down and when the afterglow gave way to darkness. The killing, therefore, was done “between the two evenings,” <span id="page486" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="486" data-before-text="486"></span>as God had commanded, and on the fourteenth day of Abib. The lamb was prepared and eaten before midnight.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The blood of the animals was splashed upon the two doorposts and on the upper part of the doorway of each Israelite home where a group had gathered to eat the passover. This splashing was done with a bunch of hyssop. The animals were roasted whole with no bones being broken. If any meat was left over from the meal, it was burned. None was to be kept until the next day. Unfermented cakes and bitter greens were eaten with the meat. The Hebrews were prepared to leave Egypt on a moment’s notice. “In this way you should eat it, with your hips girded, sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand, and you must eat it in haste. It is Jehovah’s passover.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959601/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex. 12:11</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The Passover lamb foreshadowed Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, who would deliver God’s people from the bondage of sin and death. The sprinkling of the animal’s blood on the outside of the doors pictured that we have faith in Christ’s blood and publicly confess its ransoming power. As the lamb’s blood did not mean deliverance and life to those unbelievers outside the Israelite homes, so Christ’s blood does not mean deliverance to unbelievers outside God’s organization. For the Egyptians the blood on the doorposts betokened God’s vengeance. So, too, does Christ’s blood for this unbelieving world. The bitter herbs typify how the followers of Christ would suffer the bitterness of persecution and reproach from this wicked world because they are a people for Jehovah’s name and follow Christ’s example in declaring his name.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">According to God’s command, not a bone of the lamb was broken. This foretold how Christ, the Lamb of God, would not have a bone broken. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959601/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 34:20</a> also foretold it: “He is guarding all the bones of that one; not one of them at all has been broken.”</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">By eating the passover while being fully equipped to leave Egypt at once the Israelites pictured those today who are Jehovah’s worshipers and who are not part of this corrupt world. Shortly they are due to enter God’s new world of freedom.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">When God’s angel of destruction went through Egypt that night and killed the first-born of man and beast he passed over every home that had blood from the Passover victim splashed upon the doorposts. Inside the houses the Hebrews waited for their freedom. None suffered the loss of a first-born. The destruction of Egypt’s firstborn was a picture of how the chief ones in Satan’s visible organization would become dead in God’s sight and as respects his witnesses in these last days.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The preservation of the Israelites during the angelic killing of Egypt’s first-born and then their deliverance from slavery was a marvelous demonstration of God’s power in their behalf. It was an event that was not to be forgotten, especially since it was a vindicating of Jehovah’s great name. God commanded them to remember it: “This day must serve as a memorial for you, and you must celebrate it as a festival to Jehovah throughout your generations.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959601/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex. 12:14</a>) More than forty years later when the Hebrews were about to enter the Promised Land Moses reminded them: “Let there be an observing of the month of Abib, and you must celebrate the passover to Jehovah your God, because in the month of Abib Jehovah your God brought you out of Egypt by night.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959601/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Deut. 16:1</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">From what <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959601/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Exodus 13:5</a> says it appears that the observing of this festival of freedom was to take place when the Israelites had reached the land God had promised them. The only record of its being observed while they were in the wilderness is at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959601/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Numbers 9:1-5</a>. This was in their second <span id="page487" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="487" data-before-text="487"></span>year out of Egypt while they were still in the wilderness of Sinai. There is no record that it was observed again until Joshua and the sons of those who had left Egypt had crossed the Jordan and were in Gilgal. After being circumcised they then began observing the Passover.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959601/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Josh. 5:2-10</a>.</p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The foremost representative of Jehovah God is Christ Jesus, and in his case also this principle is confirmed. Jehovah God is rightly referred to as the Creator of all things, yet we know from the Bible record that after he directly created his “only-begotten Son” the remainder of the creation work was performed by and through that Son, in his capacity as the Logos or Word. But since he was Jehovah’s representative and workman in this creative activity, and empowered by God to do it, Jehovah himself is spoken of as the Creator of heavens and earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Isa. 40:26,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/13/2" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> John 1:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/13/3" data-bid="14-4" class="b"> Col. 1:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/13/4" data-bid="14-5" class="b"> Rev. 3:14</a>) For similar reasons, and because Jesus’ course and speech on earth were so perfectly representative of Jehovah God, Jesus said: “He that has seen me has seen the Father also.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">John 14:9</a>, <em>NW</em>) So this text proves no trinity teaching, no more so than do <span id="page479" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="479" data-before-text="479"></span>references that seeing angels was seeing God prove the representative angels were embraced in any trinity godhead.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>● Was Jesus’ side pierced with the spear before or after his death on the torture stake? The accounts of Matthew and John seem to conflict on this point.—D. L., Washington.</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The weight of evidence is that it was after death that his side was pierced. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 27:49, 50</a> (<em>NW</em>) says: “But the rest of them said: ‘Let him be! Let us see whether Elijah comes to save him.’ Another man took a spear and pierced his side, and blood and water came out. Again Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and ceased to breathe.” The <em>New World Translation</em> has a footnote that states that the sentence about the man piercing his side and blood and water coming out is in some important manuscripts but is not in others. The belief by many is that this statement was later interpolated from John’s Gospel, but was misplaced by the interpolater. Some translations leave it out entirely, others set it off in brackets or parentheses, and some put it in along with an explanatory footnote, as did the <em>New World Translation</em>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">However, there is nothing questionable about John’s account of the matter. It reads: “The soldiers came, therefore, and broke the legs of the first man and those of the other man that had been impaled with him. But on coming to Jesus, as they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. Yet one of the soldiers jabbed his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">John 19:32-34</a>, <em>NW</em>) The legs of the other impaled ones were broken to hasten death, and if Jesus had not already died his legs would have been broken. His early death worked for fulfillment of the prophecy that none of his bones would be broken. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 34:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> John 19:36</a>) That his death did come more quickly than usual in such cases is shown by Pilate’s surprise upon hearing that he was already dead. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Mark 15:44, 45</a>) Possibly the soldier speared Jesus’ side to remove all doubt of his death, and eliminate any later revival that might be falsely heralded as a resurrection, as could have happened if Jesus had only fainted.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">But what caused his death to come so soon? Many take the view that he died of a broken heart, and in this way explain not only his quick death but also the flow of “blood and water” from the spear wound. By a literal rupture of the heart or one of the great blood vessels where it attaches to the heart blood would be discharged into the pericardium, the membrane that loosely encases the heart and in which is also contained the watery pericardial fluid. In writing on the physical cause of Jesus’ death one doctor said that such a rupture did take place and blood gushed into the pericardium, there to separate into watery serum and red, soft clotted matter. He pointed out that such separation of the blood’s constituent parts seldom occurs in a dead body except under such cases of extravasation, that is, where the blood is forced or let out of its proper vessels. Then if a soldier standing below Jesus’ body on the stake would thrust a spear upward into the side, it could easily travel upward, under the ribs, pierce the pericardium bulging with serum and clotted matter, and cause the flow of what would appear as “blood and water”. Or, it is possible for the ruptured heart or aorta to force blood into the chest cavity, and in this unnatural place the blood would soon begin separating into serum and red clotted matter. Out of the big gash made by the upthrust spearhead this watery serum and clotted matter would gush.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">There are Scriptural grounds for the belief that Jesus died of a broken heart. His mental anguish at the moment was intense, as indicated by his words: “My God, my God, to what end have you forsaken me?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matt. 27:46</a>, <em>NW</em>) This expression of his feeling abandoned was foretold at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Psalm 22:1</a>, along with several other verses in that psalm that were prophetic of Christ Jesus at the time of his death. A broken heart could certainly be seen in the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ps 22 verse 14</a>: “I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.” Ordinarily blood would not flow from a corpse, but the piercing of the pericardium in the above-described state would be like puncturing a bag of water. And if he were pierced before death, as Matthew’s account indicates, blood would gush out but it would be whole blood, and not separated into its constituent parts to give the appearance of “blood and water”.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Hence the evidence is that John’s account is the accurate one, and certainly he was an eyewitness very near at hand, so near that the impaled Jesus spoke to him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951568/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">John 19:25-27</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"></p>

There, he could find protection. The unintentional manslayer had to remain in the city of refuge until the high priest’s death.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017642/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Num. 35:15,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017642/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 28</a>.</p>

Jehovah himself commanded Joshua: “Tell the Israelites, ‘Select for yourselves the cities of refuge.’” The cities were given “a sacred status.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017642/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Josh. 20:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017642/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 7, 8</a>) Since Jehovah was directly involved in setting these cities apart for special use, we might ask: How does this arrangement help us to have a clearer view of Jehovah’s mercy?

<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"><strong>6, 7.</strong><strong> (a) Describe the role of the elders in judging an unintentional manslayer. (See opening picture.)

He was to be received hospitably. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017642/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Josh. 20:4</a>) Some time later, he was sent back to the elders of the city where the killing had occurred, and those elders judged the case. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017642/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>Numbers 35:24, 25</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Only after they had declared the killing accidental would the fugitive be returned to the city of refuge.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Why were the elders involved? They were to keep the congregation of Israel clean and to help the unintentional manslayer to benefit from Jehovah’s mercy. One Bible scholar wrote that if the fugitive neglected to approach the elders, “it was at his peril.” He added: “His blood was on his own head, because he did not make use of the security God had provided for him.” Help was available to the unintentional manslayer, but he had to seek out and accept that help. If he did not seek refuge in one of the cities Jehovah had set aside, the closest relative of the person he had killed was free to put him to death.</p>

Why is this so important? First, the arrangement for elders to handle cases of serious sin comes from Jehovah, as outlined in his Word. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017642/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jas. 5:14-16</a>) Second, this arrangement fortifies repentant wrongdoers to remain in God’s care and to avoid a pattern of sin.

Jehovah calls these older men “a refuge from the rainstorm.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017642/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isa. 32:1, 2</a>, ftn.)

A brother named Daniel, for example, committed a serious sin, but for several months he hesitated to approach the elders. “After so much time had gone by,” he admits, “I thought that there wasn’t anything the elders could do for me anymore. Still, I was always looking over my shoulder, waiting for the consequences of my actions. And when I prayed to Jehovah, I felt that I had to preface everything with an apology for what I had done.” Finally, Daniel sought the help of the elders. Looking back, he says: “Sure, I was scared to approach them. But afterward, it seemed as if someone had lifted a huge weight off my shoulders. Now, I feel that I can approach Jehovah without anything being in the way.” Today, Daniel has a clean conscience, and he was recently appointed as a ministerial servant.</p><h2 id="p19" data-pid="19"><strong>“HE MUST FLEE TO ONE OF THESE CITIES”</strong></h2>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"><strong>10.</strong><strong> To receive mercy, what decisive action did an unintentional manslayer have to take?</strong></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> An unintentional manslayer had to take action to receive mercy.

This meant sacrifice on his part. He had to leave behind his previous employment, the comforts of home, and the freedom to travel​—until the death of the high priest.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2017642/0">a</a> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017642/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Num. 35:25</a>) But such inconveniences were worth the effort.

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"><strong>11.</strong><strong> What actions of a repentant Christian show that he has not taken God’s mercy for granted?</strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> To benefit from God’s mercy, repentant wrongdoers today must likewise take action. We must completely abandon the sinful course, fleeing not only from serious sin but also from the lesser sins that often lead to gross wrongdoing. Under inspiration, the apostle Paul described the actions of repentant Christians in Corinth. He wrote: “What a great earnestness your being saddened in a godly way produced in you, yes, clearing of yourselves, yes, indignation, yes, fear, yes, earnest desire, yes, zeal, yes, righting of the wrong!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017642/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Cor. 7:10, 11</a>) Earnest actions to abandon a sinful course show Jehovah that we are not complacent, that we have not presumed on his mercy.</p>

If you struggle to be moderate in your use of alcoholic beverages, are you willing to steer clear of situations that might tempt you to overdrink? If you battle sexually immoral desires, are you avoiding any movies, websites, or activities that may trigger unclean thoughts? Remember, any sacrifice we make to keep our integrity to Jehovah is worth it. Nothing stings more than feeling abandoned by him. At the same time, nothing is more satisfying than feeling his “everlasting loyal love.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017642/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isa. 54:7, 8</a>.</p><h2 id="p23" data-pid="23"><strong>“THEY WILL SERVE AS A REFUGE FOR YOU”</strong></h2>

The fugitive thus never had to fear reprisal. While in the city, he was safe and secure under Jehovah’s protection. This was not a <em>prison</em> of refuge. The city offered him an opportunity to work, to help others, and to serve Jehovah in peace.

Daniel, quoted earlier, found this to be true. After the elders had corrected him and helped him to regain a clear conscience, he said: “I felt that I could breathe again. After the matter was handled properly, I didn’t have to feel guilty anymore. Once the sin is gone, it’s gone. As Jehovah said, he takes your burdens away and puts them far away from you. You will never have to see them again.” Once inside the city of refuge, a fugitive no longer needed to look over his shoulder for the avenger of blood. Similarly, once Jehovah has forgiven our sin, we do not need to fear that he is looking for a reason to bring up that sin again or to judge us for it.​—<strong>Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017642/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 103:8-12</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

As our Ransomer, Jesus cleanses our consciences and gives us inner peace.

They were outcasts, the very dregs of society. Just to get a cake from the one (likely King Saul) who would be pleased with their words, these base men would make fun of David. They would grind their teeth at him, that is, express anger, derision and scorn.</p>

<strong>International Praise to the One God</strong><br/><p id="p48" data-pid="48" data-rel-pid="[100]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="40"><sup>40</sup></span> For our highest happiness now and in the world to come the Psalms serve as a faithful guide to us regarding what is his will for us now. As we approach the day of days when Jehovah will make wars to cease to the extremity of the earth, breaking the enemy armaments to pieces and setting astonishing events in the earth, we need to keep united as his people and to meet together as often as can be arranged. “Look! how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Ps. 133:1</a>) To promote that goodness and pleasantness of unitedly dwelling together we should take hold of the opportunity and build one another up as fellow believers <span id="page637" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="637" data-before-text="637"></span>and fellow servants. We meet, not only to praise the universal Sovereign and his kingdom, but to help one another to praise him before people on the outside who need salvation. Our determination should be: “As for me, in my integrity I shall walk. O redeem me and show me favor. My own foot will certainly stand on a level place; among the congregated throngs I shall bless Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/65/0" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Ps. 26:11, 12</a>) “I will laud you in the big congregation; among a numerous people I shall praise you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/66/0" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Ps. 35:18</a>.</p><p id="p101" data-pid="101" class="qu">41.

We dwell scattered around the earth in the midst of worldly peoples, whose ungodly practices and beliefs and nationalistic pride and ambitions we must resist. Yet Jehovah has separated his people from this world by his truth, which has made them free, and by his organization of them that they may all act together in doing his one will for them. In this day of Jehovah he has brought forth his nation of spiritual Israel, a nation not captive to any of the nations of this world. He has given them a spiritual position before him, a theocratic position occupied by no others on earth, so that he has, as it were, caused a ‘land to be born’ in this great day of Jehovah for their residence. There he has brought the spiritual children of his woman Zion, and there he has gathered to them hundreds of thousands of temporary residents of good will.</p><p id="p103" data-pid="103" class="qu">43.

There is the suitable place to talk about the God who has made us his organized people. There before and with our brothers in the faith we should express our joy in Jehovah, who has become our King since 1914. The blessing from this to us will be a deepening of our love for him and his Christ and for our brothers, and a strengthening of our tie to one another to stick together against all the world that is united against Jehovah and us as his witnesses.</p><p id="p104" data-pid="104" class="qu">44. What is it that we are commanded to go forth from our meetings and do, and, according to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/96/0" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Psalm 68:11, 12</a>, who also take part in this?</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" data-rel-pid="[104]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="44"><sup>44</sup></span> From our meetings we are commanded to go forth and bear witness and sound warning to all the nations for the last time, because their complete end is clocked for Armageddon. By faith, in the light of prophecy, we see his victory and we can rejoice because of what that victory will mean for his own universal sovereignty and for the blessing of all who love and serve him. As we go out to our territory to bear witness publicly and from house to house, he gives us his triumphant message today. Women and not just the men who ordinarily do the fighting are to join in this triumphal proclamation. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/69/0" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Psalm 68:11, 12</a> has come true in this respect: “Jehovah himself gives the saying; the women telling the good news are a large army. <span id="page638" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="638" data-before-text="638"></span>Even the kings of armies flee, they flee. As for her who abides at home, she shares in the spoil.” At our homes, too, we should tell of our theocratic victories in preaching the good news of Jehovah’s triumphant kingdom.</p>

Was he preaching thereby something that would be for the hurt of all mankind? No, but something for their everlasting good. Personal pride and selfishness were the things that induced the world to hate Jesus for proclaiming the Kingdom message that was really good news, Gospel, the Evangel. That the world’s hatred of him was actually for no valid reason, Jesus plainly told his faithful apostles, saying:</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> “If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have no sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.

How did David view his integrity, and as a type of whom?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>DAVID, the upright king of ancient Israel, was a man with real confidence in his Creator, the God whom David called Jehovah. He appreciated that over the years of his life he had made many mistakes as a sinful, imperfect human, but he also knew that uppermost in his mind and heart was the doing of the will of his heavenly Life-giver. As the leading member of a nation dedicated to Jehovah God, David was concerned with the matter of integrity. “As for me,” said he, “in my integrity I shall walk.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 26:11</a>) This he faithfully endeavored to do, as an example to all the subjects over whom he reigned and also as a prophetic type for the true followers of the Greater David, Jesus Christ, the glorified king of God’s new world.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 2. Why was David confident he had walked in his integrity, and how does he plead to be judged?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> The 26th Psalm shows David presenting his integrity and offering himself to Jehovah’s searching. He had confidence that he had walked in the right way, living according to the commandments of God. Always anxious to do the right thing, David said to Jehovah: “Make me walk in your truth and teach me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 25:5</a>) Feeling certain that he had walked in truth, he confidently stated: “Judge me, O Jehovah, for I myself have walked in my own integrity.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 26:1</a>) Reading the whole psalm, one sees David in his joyful worship of Jehovah contrasting himself with the wicked life of sinful men with whom he did not want to be classed. David did not want to be judged by men’s standards of living. He knew what sort of man he was, a lover of truth and of right things. He was honest and blameless. His one desire was to give Jehovah exclusive devotion. He knew what God’s standards were and he wanted to be judged by them. So he pleads: “Judge me according to your righteousness, O Jehovah my God, and may [opponents] not rejoice over me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 35:24</a>) Such righteous judgment brought him happiness. He was content, satisfied. He had assurance that he was walking in integrity. Today is our confidence in our integrity as sure as David’s was?</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 3. In what ways did David show his desire was to please Jehovah?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> When David was a young man he was chosen by Jehovah to be king. From the time of his anointing by the prophet Samuel he had special responsibilities. He took care of them, always seeking Jehovah. After many trials and hardships he was placed on the throne of Jehovah over the nation of Israel. One of his great joys was the bringing of the sacred ark of the covenant to the holy city of Jerusalem and establishing the place of worship of Jehovah there. On Mount Zion Jehovah’s altar was built and all Israel praised Jehovah <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>there. Of this place he said: “O Jehovah, who will be a guest in your tent? Who will reside in your holy mountain? He who is walking faultlessly and practicing righteousness and speaking the truth in his heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 15:1, 2</a>) David wanted to measure up to those requirements and to be strong, not weak or unsteady. So he had to trust in God. “In Jehovah I have trusted, that I may not wobble.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 26:1</a>) David’s reliance and faith in Jehovah were unshakable, undisturbed, calm, and there was no wavering on his part, for he was walking as one should who ‘loved the dwelling of Jehovah’s house.’</p>

Our own salvation is not yet complete. There are numberless other sheep far off from Jehovah’s Right Shepherd who need help toward salvation. Our prayers need to rise to God, widening out beyond our own individual salvation <span id="page728" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="728" data-before-text="728"></span>and taking in that of these other sheep. The prayer that the psalmist offered in conclusion is appropriately ours now: “Save us, O Jehovah our God, and gather us from among the nations, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise. Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting. And let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952885/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ps. 106:47, 48</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> Many are the other sheep whom the Right Shepherd must yet gather. Among all nations they are held prisoner to Babylon through ignorance and fear, but deep down in their hearts they long to share in the prosperity of Jehovah’s chosen ones and to rejoice in the gladness of his nation. Until we have worked for their deliverance according to God’s will the prayer is not fully answered for God to save US and gather US (not simply me) from among the nations, to thank his holy name and to triumph through praising him.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">25.

Step forward, then. Let them see and hear us as his witnesses and observe our spiritual prosperity and feel an overwhelming desire to share it. Our attitude toward them must be that of the psalmist who said: “Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favor my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Jehovah be magnified, who hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952885/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps. 35:27</a>, <em>AS</em>) The prosperity with which he has blessed us is abundant enough for the great crowd of other sheep to share in it, no matter how many their number. We can afford to be liberal, openhanded. By sharing our welfare unselfishly with others we shall see the prosperity of God’s visible organization boom yet more and more, despite the worsening situation in the world. We shall increase our own gladness in Jehovah with all his people, all the way into the new world. So to ourselves, to others, we join the psalmist in saying: “Praise ye Jehovah.”</p>
