As joyfully proclaimed in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004180/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 96:10</a>: “Jehovah himself has become king.” The new developments in Jehovah’s extension of his kingship, as well as what these signify for heaven and earth, appear to be the subject of this “new song.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004180/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps 96:11-13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004180/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 98:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004180/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Isa 42:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004180/7/3" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> 13</a>.</p>

Since 1935 a growing great crowd of other sheep has heard their triumphant song and been moved to join with them in publicizing God’s Kingdom.

But they too sound a melodious chorus of praise to Jehovah that is an anthem lauding Jehovah for the new things he is accomplishing. They thus fulfill the psalmist’s exhortation: “Sing to Jehovah a new song. Sing to Jehovah, all you people of the earth. Sing to Jehovah, bless his name. From day to day tell the good news of salvation by him. Declare among the nations his glory, among all the peoples his wonderful works. Ascribe to Jehovah, O you families of the peoples, ascribe to Jehovah glory and strength.

<strong>The Land of the Pepper Bird Hears the “New Song”</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In recent years, however, a new song has been heard in this land. This is a song sung, not by the pepper bird or by returned slaves, but by a growing chorus of people who are responding to the urging of the Biblical psalmist: “Sing to Jehovah a new song. Sing to Jehovah, all you people of the earth. Say among the nations: ‘Jehovah himself has become king.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989366/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 96:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989366/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 10</a>) Yes, this is the song of God’s established Kingdom, with Jesus Christ as King. It is being sung by prospective heirs of Jehovah’s heavenly government. They and their companions are joyously proclaiming the “good news” about that Kingdom in all the nations​—including Liberia—​during “the conclusion of the system of things,” in which we now live. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989366/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989366/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 14</a>) When and how did this song first come to be heard in the land of the pepper bird? And what effect has its heart-searching melody had on appreciative hearers? Let’s listen.</p>

<strong>“Fear God and Give Him Glory”</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> For the present, enough of those beasts! In refreshing contrast, <strong>the ninth vision</strong> focuses on the Lamb. He stands on Mount Zion, with the 144,000 that he buys as firstfruits from among mankind. Though some of these still serve on earth, in a spiritual sense all 144,000 have “approached a Mount Zion and . . . heavenly Jerusalem.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988925/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:22</a>) Appropriately, the 24 elders are also seen here before God’s throne, for they picture the same anointed group from a different standpoint​—as already raised and installed as kings and priests. The 144,000 are singing “a new song.” It stems from their unique experience in being bought from the earth to become Kingdom heirs. The great crowd also “sing to Jehovah a new song,” but this differs in that they sing in prospect of attaining to everlasting life in the earthly realm of the Kingdom.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988925/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988925/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 14:1-5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988925/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Psalm 96:1-10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988925/6/3" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> Matthew 25:31-34</a>.</p>

<strong>Expressing Appreciation in Song</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Most fittingly, time and again God’s Word tells us to voice appreciation by singing praises to God. Apparently there is a tendency to be lax in this regard, for so often the urgings are stated repetitively, as at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975006/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 47:6, 7</a>: “Make melody to God, make melody. Make melody to our King, make melody. For God is King of all the earth; make melody.” Five times the psalmist calls upon us to make melody.​—See also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975006/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 96:1, 2</a>.</p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In answering this question, some persons may point to the fact that the terms “heavens” and “earth” are not always applied to the literal heavens and earth. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 96:1</a>, for example, the “earth” is encouraged to sing a “new song.” Obviously in this case the people of the earth are meant. The Bible also speaks of “wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Eph. 6:12</a>) This would suggest that such wicked spirit forces constitute a ‘heaven’ over the wicked human society. In fact, the Devil is referred to as the “god of this system of things.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:4</a>) On this basis, some might conclude that the heavens and the earth mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 102:25, 26</a> (quoted at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971567/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:10, 11</a>) refer to the wicked heavens composed of Satan and his demons and which control the earth made up of mankind alienated from God. But does the passage itself allow for this application?</p>

<strong>The Most Widely Published Song</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">How would the Christian “prophets” and “holy ones” who had died be rewarded and stand with him on the heavenly Mount Zion? By being resurrected just as he was, not in a fleshly body, for in flesh they could not stand with him in heaven in the presence of Jehovah God. The apostle Paul explains this fact to us in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:35-50</a>, where he tells us that “flesh and blood cannot inherit God’s kingdom,” but that these dead ones, having gone down in death in a corruptible, physical body of weakness, would be raised up with a spiritual body, incorrupt, bearing the image of the heavenly One. Their resurrection, therefore, would be in a spiritual body and be invisible to human eyes. While the great majority of the 144,000 have lived and died, yet at present there remains a “remnant,” who, while completing their faithful course on earth, are <span id="page184" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="184" data-before-text="184"></span>highly privileged to join in the song and to see that it is published to a great earthwide audience.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>TO WHOM DO THE SINGERS BEAR WITNESS</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><em>“Having his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.”</em> Having the name of the Lamb Jesus Christ and the name of his Father written on the forehead, where it can be plainly seen by all, symbolizes the fact that they are slaves of Jehovah God and Jesus Christ. They do not have the name of Babylon on their foreheads as if they were slaves of Babylon and belonged to her. What the apostle John saw in the foreheads of the 144,000 was no doubt the sacred Hebrew tetragrammaton (יהוה), for the name of the Father (YHWH), or in Anglicized pronunciation, Jehovah. The 144,000 therefore must be Jehovah’s witnesses during their earthly course and now continue to be his witnesses in heaven.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><em>“And I heard a sound out of heaven as the sound of many waters and as the sound of loud thunder; and the sound that I heard was as of singers who accompany themselves on the harp playing on their harps.”</em> What a chorus! A hundred and forty-four thousand singers, not with earthly voices, but with heavenly voices, singing in perfect harmony, accompanied by the pure music of the harp. The extent to which the song would be heard is indicated by the fact that to John it had the mighty sound of many waters and the sound of loud thunders. Never in the history of the universe has there been such a song nor such an audience, millions of angels in heaven listening and the entire earth to hear its joyful, encouraging strains. We shall see how the singers accomplish this, by Jehovah’s direction and power.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>THE GRAND THEME OF THE SONG</strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><em>“And they are singing as if a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the older persons.”</em> So the song was not known and sung before 1914. It is <em>new.</em> The 144,000 integrity-keeping joint heirs with Christ are the first ones to vocalize it. Because of its singers and its content it is the greatest and most far-reaching anthem of the universe, for it is about the kingdom of God as the government that has been established since 1914. It has the loftiest theme, the greatest truth taught in the Bible: it is about Jesus Christ reigning in Kingdom power. Jesus Christ the King in Jehovah’s kingdom is the great Truth in fulfillment of all the prophetic utterances of the Bible, and he is the one who himself gave a fine testimony before Pontius Pilate that he came to earth to bear witness to this great truth. It concerns first the most important One of the Kingdom organization, for the song itself contains words addressed to the Lamb of God: “You are worthy to take the scroll and open its seals, because you were slaughtered and with your blood you bought persons for God out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and you made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God, and they will rule as kings over the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Rev. 5:9, 10</a>) The 144,000 singers will have the abounding joy of reigning with Christ and sharing in his rule over the earth, bringing the blessings of the Abrahamic covenant, which provided that all families of the earth were to bless themselves by means of the Seed, Jesus Christ. To these singers the commands of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalms 96:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 98:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/14/3" data-bid="15-4" class="b"> 5</a>; and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps 149:1, 2</a> would apply:</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="si">“Sing to Jehovah a new song.

He will plead the cause of the peoples in uprightness.’” “Sing to Jehovah a new song, for wonderful are the things that he has done. His right hand, even his holy arm, has gained salvation for him. Make melody to Jehovah with the harp, with the harp and the voice of melody.” “Praise Jah, you people! Sing to Jehovah a new song, his praise in the congregation of loyal ones.

<strong>“The Good News of Salvation by Him”</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> The setting up of God’s heavenly kingdom over this rebellious earth is deserving of a coronation song, a song to glorify the crowning of his beloved Son Jesus Christ as his appointed King over all mankind. When Jesus rode in royal style into the city of Jerusalem in the year 33, the Jewish religious rulers at the temple missed the opportunity of offering him a crown. They did not recognize him as the promised Son of famous King David, who had long ago sat on the ‘throne of Jehovah’ at Jerusalem. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956922/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:23</a>, <em>AS</em>) They were not in the spirit of the joyous crowd who accompanied Jesus into the royal city, <span id="page748" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="748" data-before-text="748"></span>shouting “Save, we pray, the Son of David!”</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">12. How did King David come to compose a coronation song for us, and why must we sing it now?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Ancient King David showed the fitness of a coronation song at such an event as that of Jehovah’s assuming power over all the earth. David had the visible sign of God’s presence, the golden Ark of the Covenant, brought into the royal city of Jerusalem and put in a tent near his royal palace. So David composed and sang a coronation song, which reached its grand climax in the theme: “Let the heavens be glad, let the earth be joyful, and let them say among the nations, ‘Jehovah himself has become king!’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956922/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Chron. 16:23-33</a>, <em>NW</em>) Under the guidance of Jehovah’s holy spirit King David adapted that same theme and composed a new psalm. This psalm showed that a coronation song must be sung on a grand scale now in our day following the setting up of God’s kingdom and his placing his faithful, resurrected Son on the heavenly throne in 1914. In the Book of Psalms this is <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956922/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 96</a>, and it is known as one of the Coronation Psalms. The great enthronement and the glorious coronation have taken place in the resplendent courts of heaven, of which fact we have all the needed evidence since 1914. So all the things commanded in this Coronation Psalm must be carried out. The witnesses of Jehovah of today, with the eye of faith, are carrying out those things. What things?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>A NEW SONG</strong></p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">13.

Billions of years ago, as the scientists themselves have pointed out, Jehovah God caused thermonuclear explosions of hydrogen to take place within the sun to supply light and heat to our earth that mankind might keep alive on this planet. Bombs, long-range ballistic missiles, atomic submarines, and other military inventions and commercial products of twentieth-century science are not the “wonderful works” that Jehovah has guided and enlightened the scientists to perform, and about which to sing in praise of him. The scientists scoff at Jehovah and prefer to misuse the brains with which he created man by serving the vicious enemy of God and man, Satan the Devil.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">14. What thing does supply us the subject for a “new song,” and why?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> No, these modern scientific inventions and developments do not furnish us the theme for a new song of gladness. Since 1914 the one big, overwhelming thing that supplies the people of Jehovah with the subject for a “new song” to his praise is the birth of his royal government, which he lays upon the shoulder of his long-waiting Son Jesus Christ. Though it was promised about six thousand years ago in man’s first earthly home, in the paradise of Eden, there has till A.D. 1914 been nothing in heaven or on earth like this kingdom of God by his promised Seed, Jesus Christ. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956922/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Gen. 3:15</a>) Never before 1914 has there been a capital organization over the entire living universe, with Christ as its Head and with the Most High God Jehovah dwelling in it and operating through it to have his will done throughout the universe. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956922/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Phil. 2:5-11</a>) This is indeed something new, something gloriously new, and it means blessing to all men of good will as well as to holy angels. A realization of this <span id="page749" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="749" data-before-text="749"></span>moves one to burst out in singing. It calls for a new song, with a theme entirely new, entirely different! Jehovah by introducing his kingdom has made this possible. To him and in his honor the new song should be sung.</p>

<strong>All True Christians Are Evangelizers</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> The zeal of Jehovah’s Witnesses today parallels that of the Christians of the first century. Of them, the Roman Catholic newspaper <em>L’Osservatore Romano</em> correctly said: “The first Christians, as soon as they were baptized, felt it their duty to spread the Gospel. From mouth to mouth, slaves transmitted the Gospel.” Why are Jehovah’s Witnesses, like those early Christians, so zealous? First, because the good news they publish is from Jehovah God himself. Could there be a better reason for zeal? Their preaching is a response to the words of the psalmist: “Sing to Jehovah, bless his name. From day to day tell the good news of salvation by him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002002/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 96:2</a>.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 3. (a) What is a second reason for the zeal of Jehovah’s Witnesses? (b) What is involved in “salvation by [God]”?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> The psalmist’s words remind us of a second reason for the zeal of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Their message is one of salvation. Some individuals work in medical, social, economic, or other fields to improve the lot of fellow humans, and such efforts are commendable. But anything one human can do for another is very limited in comparison with “salvation by [God].” Through Jesus Christ, Jehovah will save meek ones from sin, sickness, and death. Those who benefit will live forever! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002002/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 3:16,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002002/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002002/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Revelation 21:3, 4</a>) Today, salvation is among the “wonderful works” that Christians recount when they respond to the words: “Declare among the nations [God’s] glory, among all the peoples his wonderful works. For Jehovah is great and very much to be praised. He is fear-inspiring above all other gods.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002002/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 96:3, 4</a>.</p>

<strong>Expressing Appreciation in Song</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Most fittingly, time and again God’s Word tells us to voice appreciation by singing praises to God. Apparently there is a tendency to be lax in this regard, for so often the urgings are stated repetitively, as at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975006/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 47:6, 7</a>: “Make melody to God, make melody. Make melody to our King, make melody. For God is King of all the earth; make melody.” Five times the psalmist calls upon us to make melody.​—See also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975006/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 96:1, 2</a>.</p>

<strong>Why Continue to Preach?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">That the preaching activity is a means of salvation to those who will hear is clear both from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965685/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Joel 2:28-32 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965685/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Romans 10:13-15</a>, where it is foretold that those who call on the name of Jehovah will be saved, and in order for men to do this someone must preach to them. So the burning desire to aid other men to get saved should be an incentive that encourages Jehovah’s witnesses to continue preaching. And when sincere persons respond and seek to learn God’s will, this is all the encouragement the Witnesses need to continue. But what if one does not get these positive results, is unable to have good discussions with people? First, the Witness should analyze his own teaching methods and endeavor to improve such. He will ask if he is well prepared to give good sermons. Is he friendly, enthusiastic at the door? Does he give the other person a chance to speak and does he respond to what the other person has <span id="page572" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="572" data-before-text="572"></span>said? Are his words always upbuilding? That much depends upon the one preaching as to whether he will get good results is shown in the advice to Timothy to employ the “art of teaching.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965685/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Tim. 4:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965685/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 2:24, 25</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The Christian witness will remember too that people who are not interested or even opposed to hearing his message today may react otherwise the next time he calls. The repeated visits by Jehovah’s witnesses with their faith-inspiring words and works can gradually build up a picture of God’s purposes in the mind of the hearer and so arouse interest. Also, world conditions change and the lives of individuals are constantly going through changes that give rise to new attitudes, all of which can result in a favorable reaction to the preaching of the good news. But if Jehovah’s witnesses were to stop preaching from house to house merely because a majority are opposed, there would be no opportunity for these persons to benefit from their change of mind. So we must continue to “search out who . . . is deserving.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965685/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 10:11</a>) The number of persons newly associating with Jehovah’s witnesses each year at their assemblies, public talks and other special meetings shows that there are thousands upon thousands yet to be gathered. To stop preaching because many now reject the message would in a sense be a passing of judgment upon all these deserving ones as undeserving. May we never do that.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>PROOF OF LOVE AND INTEGRITY</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Another purpose of witnessing is to give the Christian an opportunity to demonstrate his love for Jehovah and his fellowman, a chance to prove his integrity under testing. To gain God’s approval, one must be thankful for life and its blessings. Thankfulness produces love for God, and this motivates the Christian to have freeness of speech in telling of God’s goodness. “This is how love has been made perfect with us, that we may have freeness of speech in the day of judgment.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965685/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 John 4:17</a>) Surely it is the quality of love that motivates persons to carry out the command: “Sing to Jehovah, bless his name. From day to day tell the good news of salvation by him. . . . Ascribe to Jehovah the glory belonging to his name.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965685/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 96:2-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965685/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 115:1</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">But what about those who may worry because they feel they are lacking in thankfulness and love? These should form the habit of reflecting on the marvelous blessings they have received from God—conscious existence, thinking ability, sight, hearing, and many others. Such meditation causes one to grow in love for God. Also, continued preaching, combined with self-examination and aid by God’s spirit, helps one to purify his motives and cultivate love. Though continued preaching can become a trial, we should remember that trials can result in endurance, which can ‘make us complete in all respects, not lacking in anything.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965685/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jas. 1:3, 4</a>) “Let us exult while in tribulations, since we know that tribulation produces endurance; endurance, in turn, an approved condition; the approved condition, in turn, hope, and the hope does not lead to disappointment; because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the holy spirit, which was given us.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965685/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Rom. 5:3-5</a>) “Pursue love” say the Scriptures. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965685/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Cor. 14:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965685/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 6:11, 12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965685/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 2 Tim. 2:22</a>) Love is a quality we can cultivate by our “contributing in response all earnest effort.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965685/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Pet. 1:5-7</a>) It is demonstrated by our obedience to the truth.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965685/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 John 5:3</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>A MESSAGE OF WARNING</strong></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">A third reason for continuing to preach even though opposed is to warn those who <span id="page573" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="573" data-before-text="573"></span>will not change of the coming judgment. Even if they have taken their stand, they must be continually warned. A judgment message should be preached. The majority of persons may not want to hear. They may want to shut out the judgment message and thereby retain their “peace”; yet they must be made aware of their responsibility. They may view this as ‘disturbing their privacy,’ as did the Israelites who tired of Isaiah’s preaching and of whom it is written: “It is a rebellious people, . . . sons who have been unwilling to hear the law of Jehovah; who have said to the ones seeing, ‘You must not see,’ and to the ones having visions, ‘You must not envision for us any straightforward things. Speak to us smooth things; envision deceptive things. Turn aside from the way; deviate from the path. Cause the Holy One of Israel to cease just on account of us.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965685/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa. 30:9-11</a>) But the preaching of God’s coming judgment must continue so that their disregard of his purposes and laws comes to full growth.</p>

In fact, ever since 1914 this earth has been a place of ever-increasing bad news because of wickedness.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">But there is good news to be had, and that from the only possible source of good news, Jehovah God. All his dedicated servants have been commissioned to bring good news to the people. Good news regarding what? Good news regarding the establishment of God’s kingdom. The fulfillment of Bible prophecy shows that we are living in the days of Christ’s second presence, in the days when the God of heaven has set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, at the time when Christ’s period of waiting has ended and he has begun to rule in the midst of his enemies.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957886/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Dan. 2:44</a>, <em>AV;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957886/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Now, therefore, applies the psalmist’s prophetic command: “From day to day tell the good news of salvation by him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957886/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 96:2</a>)<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1957886/0">a</a> This good news we must tell in all cleanness, “in holy adornment”; and we must tell God’s enemies to “be in severe pains because of him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957886/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps 96 Verse 9</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Note that we are to tell this good news from day to day, continually. Why? Because the days to tell it are limited before Armageddon strikes, in fact, are getting fewer with each passing day. And does not each passing day bring with it opportunities to tell the good news?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">And how many different ways there are to tell this good news! To one another as members of a family or of a Christian congregation; to those not yet familiar with the good news by means of the printed page by offering it to them from door to door and on the streets. Also tell the good news from the public platform, to those coming to our homes, to those with whom we work or have business relations; nor would we overlook traveling companions. And where God’s truth is banned, tell the good news underground.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">And not only must we ourselves tell the good news from day to day, but we must get others to tell it. That means patient training work, first of all by making return visits and then regularly studying the Bible with them. As they progress, show them their privilege to share in telling the good news. Were all ministers to do this to the best of their ability and opportunity, what increases could be expected in the coming months!</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The inspired psalmist tells the sea, the open field and the trees of the forest to join in exulting before Jehovah because of his coming to judge the earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957886/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 96:11, 12</a>) If all nature is to exult because of what it will mean to them, how much more so should we living, intelligent, speech-endowed and Bible-reading creatures sing praise to Jehovah and say that he has become king and tell the good news of his salvation from day to day!</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Yes, if the heavenly sons of God and the morning stars had occasion to sing at the time of earth’s creation; if the Israelites had occasion to sing praise to Jehovah at the time of their deliverance at the Red Sea; if the heavenly hosts had occasion to sing for joy at the birth of the babe Jesus; truly, if anyone ever had occasion to exult and sing for joy, we now do because Jehovah has become King! And what a beautiful song we have to sing, one that will become the song hit of the universe! Jehovah is its Composer, who inspired it by his holy spirit; and the one teaching us to sing it is his Son, Jesus Christ. So let each one sing for joy and sing unitedly and unceasingly, telling the good news of salvation by Jehovah from day to day.</p>

<strong>“The Good News of Salvation by Him”</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> The setting up of God’s heavenly kingdom over this rebellious earth is deserving of a coronation song, a song to glorify the crowning of his beloved Son Jesus Christ as his appointed King over all mankind. When Jesus rode in royal style into the city of Jerusalem in the year 33, the Jewish religious rulers at the temple missed the opportunity of offering him a crown. They did not recognize him as the promised Son of famous King David, who had long ago sat on the ‘throne of Jehovah’ at Jerusalem. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956922/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:23</a>, <em>AS</em>) They were not in the spirit of the joyous crowd who accompanied Jesus into the royal city, <span id="page748" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="748" data-before-text="748"></span>shouting “Save, we pray, the Son of David!”</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">12. How did King David come to compose a coronation song for us, and why must we sing it now?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Ancient King David showed the fitness of a coronation song at such an event as that of Jehovah’s assuming power over all the earth. David had the visible sign of God’s presence, the golden Ark of the Covenant, brought into the royal city of Jerusalem and put in a tent near his royal palace. So David composed and sang a coronation song, which reached its grand climax in the theme: “Let the heavens be glad, let the earth be joyful, and let them say among the nations, ‘Jehovah himself has become king!’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956922/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Chron. 16:23-33</a>, <em>NW</em>) Under the guidance of Jehovah’s holy spirit King David adapted that same theme and composed a new psalm. This psalm showed that a coronation song must be sung on a grand scale now in our day following the setting up of God’s kingdom and his placing his faithful, resurrected Son on the heavenly throne in 1914. In the Book of Psalms this is <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956922/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 96</a>, and it is known as one of the Coronation Psalms. The great enthronement and the glorious coronation have taken place in the resplendent courts of heaven, of which fact we have all the needed evidence since 1914. So all the things commanded in this Coronation Psalm must be carried out. The witnesses of Jehovah of today, with the eye of faith, are carrying out those things. What things?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>A NEW SONG</strong></p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">13.

Billions of years ago, as the scientists themselves have pointed out, Jehovah God caused thermonuclear explosions of hydrogen to take place within the sun to supply light and heat to our earth that mankind might keep alive on this planet. Bombs, long-range ballistic missiles, atomic submarines, and other military inventions and commercial products of twentieth-century science are not the “wonderful works” that Jehovah has guided and enlightened the scientists to perform, and about which to sing in praise of him. The scientists scoff at Jehovah and prefer to misuse the brains with which he created man by serving the vicious enemy of God and man, Satan the Devil.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">14.

Since 1914 the one big, overwhelming thing that supplies the people of Jehovah with the subject for a “new song” to his praise is the birth of his royal government, which he lays upon the shoulder of his long-waiting Son Jesus Christ. Though it was promised about six thousand years ago in man’s first earthly home, in the paradise of Eden, there has till A.D. 1914 been nothing in heaven or on earth like this kingdom of God by his promised Seed, Jesus Christ. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956922/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Gen. 3:15</a>) Never before 1914 has there been a capital organization over the entire living universe, with Christ as its Head and with the Most High God Jehovah dwelling in it and operating through it to have his will done throughout the universe. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956922/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Phil. 2:5-11</a>) This is indeed something new, something gloriously new, and it means blessing to all men of good will as well as to holy angels. A realization of this <span id="page749" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="749" data-before-text="749"></span>moves one to burst out in singing. It calls for a new song, with a theme entirely new, entirely different! Jehovah by introducing his kingdom has made this possible. To him and in his honor the new song should be sung.</p>

But this fear is not mixed with the fear of Jehovah. Besides fearing the things they discern as about to come upon the earth, they fear their visible gods, the mighty ones that they idolize in politics, in business, in militarism and in popular religion. These deified ones instill fear of themselves into the hearts of the populace to keep themselves prominent and in the power to control. To these the people ascribe the power and works and adoration that belong only to the one living and true God, Jehovah. The fear that the people have toward these earthly gods is merely a fear of awesome men, mere human creatures who will die. But Jehovah is to be “feared more than all other gods.” As he once executed judgment on all the false gods of Egypt, so he is now judging these earthly gods, to the point of exposing their utter inability and falsity. “God standeth in the congregation of God; he judgeth among the gods.” To the mighty, adored ones in Christendom who profess to be sons of the God of heaven he directs this message: “I said, Ye are gods, and all of you sons of the Most High.

Before him all the false gods must shortly bow in defeat at Armageddon. “For Jehovah is a great God, and a great King above all gods.” He is to be feared, rather than the totalitarian aggressors bent on world conquest for enthroning their political gods and form of religion everywhere. “For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods.” Those who make him their refuge and who trust in his strength credit him with godship and say: “For thou, Jehovah, art most high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951204/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Pss. 95:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951204/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 96:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951204/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 97:9</a>, <em>AS</em>) Because he supplies secret strength to his witnesses, they have been able to endure the most determined and fiendish persecution from human agents of the false gods.

For instance, in spite of the 1950 Holy Year, the world’s difficulties worsened to an alarming degree. So the pope of Vatican City in his encyclical of December 6 called on the Catholic world to engage in a novena of prayer for peace. Addressing the college of cardinals five days later, the pope called for a “general accord of intentions of all human hearts which, with the aid of God, may cause all the dangers which are threatening peace to disappear throughout the world”. (N. Y. <em>Times,</em> Dec. 12, 1950) But prayers to God are vain the intentions of which are contrary to his will. As <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951204/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">James 4:2, 3</a> (<em>Dy</em>) says: “You contend and war, and you have not, because you ask not. You ask, and receive not; because you ask amiss: that you may consume it on your concupiscences.” It is not God’s will at this time to establish world peace in order for the nations to return to normal. If he restored peace, the nations would only consume its benefits upon their concupiscences and selfish desires, showing they are “lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God”.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[27]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> The timetables of God’s Word set this period down as a time marked for international troubles, when there would be “on the earth anguish of nations, not knowing <span id="page178" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="178" data-before-text="178"></span>the way out because of the roaring of the sea and its agitation, while men become faint out of fear and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth”.

<strong>Gods and Goddesses</strong><br/><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="sb"><strong>Gods of Nations Contrasted With Jehovah.</strong> Today many of the gods mentioned in the Bible are little more than a name. Although their worshipers at times even sacrificed their own children to them, the false gods were unable to rescue those who looked to them for aid in time of need. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001732/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">2Ki 17:31</a>) Hence, in the face of his military successes, the king of Assyria, through his spokesman Rabshakeh, boasted: “Have the gods of the nations at all delivered each one his own land out of the hand of the king of Assyria? Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? Who are there among all the gods of the lands that have delivered their land out of my hand, so that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001732/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">2Ki 18:28,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001732/43/1" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> 31-35</a>) But Jehovah did not fail his people as had those false gods.

<strong>Power, Powerful Works</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><strong><em>“Nature gods” contrasted with the true God.</em></strong> Ancient documents from Babylon and from points of mankind’s migration show that the worship of “nature gods” (such as the Babylonian sun-god Shamash and the Canaanite fertility god Baal) became very prominent in those early times. The “nature gods” were associated in men’s minds with periodic or cyclic manifestations of power, such as the daily beaming forth of the sun’s rays, the seasonal results of solstices and equinoxes (producing summer and winter, spring and fall), the winds and storms, the falling of rain and its effect on earth’s fertility in seedtime and harvest, and similar evidences of power. These forces are impersonal. So men had to fill in the blank, providing personality for their gods by their own imagination. The personalities they conjured up for their gods were generally capricious; they lacked any definite purpose, were morally debased, and were unworthy of worship and service.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Yet the visible heavens and earth give clear proof of a superior Source of power that produced all these forces in an interrelated, coordinated arrangement, one giving undeniable evidence of intelligent purpose. To that Source the acclamation goes: “You are worthy, Jehovah, even our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, because you created all things, and because of your will they existed and were created.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003540/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Re 4:11</a>) Jehovah is not a God governed by or limited to celestial or earthly cycles. Nor are his expressions of power capricious, erratic, or inconsistent. In each case they reveal something about his personality, his standards, his purpose. The <em>Theological Dictionary of the New Testament,</em> edited by G. Kittel, in treating the view of God contained in the Hebrew Scriptures, thus observes that “the important and predominant feature is not force or power but the will which this power must execute and therefore serve. This is everywhere the decisive feature.”​—Translated and edited by G. Bromiley, 1971, Vol. II, p. 291.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The worship of such “nature gods” by the Israelites was apostasy, a suppression of truth in favor of a lie, an unreasoning course of worshiping the creation rather than the One who created it; this is what the apostle states at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003540/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Romans 1:18-25</a>. Though invisible, Jehovah God had made his qualities manifest among men, for as Paul says, these are “clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are perceived by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship, so that they are inexcusable.”</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><strong><em>God’s control of natural forces distinctive.</em></strong> To prove himself the true God, Jehovah might reasonably be expected to demonstrate his control over the created forces, doing so in a way that would be distinctly connected with his name. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003540/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Ps 135:5, 6</a>) Since the sun, moon, planets, and stars follow their regular courses, since the earthly atmospheric conditions (producing wind, rain, and other effects) obey the laws governing them, since locusts swarm and birds migrate, then these and many other normal functions would not suffice to sanctify God’s name in the face of opposition and false worship.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Nevertheless, Jehovah God could cause the natural creation and elements to testify to his Godship by using them to fulfill specific purposes beyond their ordinary function, often at a specifically designated time. Even when the events, such as a drought, a rainstorm, or a similar weather condition, were not unique in themselves, their coming in fulfillment of Jehovah’s prophecy made them distinctive. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003540/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">1Ki 17:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003540/40/1" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> 18:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003540/40/2" data-bid="41-3" class="b"> 41-45</a>.) In most cases, though, the events were extraordinary in themselves, either because of their magnitude or intensity (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003540/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Ex 9:24</a>) or because they occurred in an unusual, even unheard of, way or at an abnormal time.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003540/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Ex 34:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003540/42/1" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 1Sa 12:16-18</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Similarly, the birth of a child was ordinary. But the birth of a child to a woman who had been sterile all her life and who had passed the age of childbirth (as in the case of Sarah) was extraordinary. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003540/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Ge 18:10, 11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003540/43/1" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> 21:1, 2</a>) It gave evidence of God’s intervention. Death, too, was a common occurrence. But when the death came at a predicted time or in a preannounced way with the causative factor otherwise unknown, this was extraordinary, pointing to divine action. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003540/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">1Sa 2:34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003540/44/1" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> 2Ki 7:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003540/44/2" data-bid="45-3" class="b"> 20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003540/44/3" data-bid="45-4" class="b"> Jer 28:16, 17</a>) All these things proved Jehovah to be the true God, and the “nature gods” to be “valueless gods.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003540/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Ps 96:5</a>.</p>

<strong>When Worship Centered Around an Earthly Temple</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THERE are thousands of temples and cathedrals throughout the world. Many of them are glorious in architecture and very ornate, often being decorated with gold and precious jewels.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Have these temples brought the people of earth closer together in true, unified worship, with love toward one another? No; rather, they have put up almost insurmountable barriers. We may find a god in such temples or an image before which devotees kneel, but can we find the true God, that all may worship him “with spirit and truth,” in unity and love for one another? The psalmist said: “All the gods of the peoples are valueless gods,” and the apostle Paul stated: “The things which the nations sacrifice they sacrifice to demons, and not to God.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974204/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 4:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974204/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ps. 96:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974204/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 1 Cor. 10:20</a>.</p>

<strong>Witchcraft Becomes Popular—Is It Dangerous?</strong><br/><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">For instance, in Africa the children of Jehovah’s witnesses are not seen with black and white threads on their necks or wrists to protect them from the god “Sambio.” They do not join the villagers in breaking off branches of trees, throwing stones or cursing, to prevent certain night birds called “witch birds” from resting in the trees, in order to keep death from striking the village. Christians know that these birds are God’s creations, coming forth in the nighttime to search for insects or rodents. Neither do they refrain from catching so-called “sacred” fish to eat. They have ignored the local custom and have recognized the local gods as really no gods at all, and such worship as worship of demons. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973600/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gal. 4:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973600/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 10:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973600/12/2" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> Jer. 16:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973600/12/3" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> Ps. 96:5</a>) The village people have waited expectantly for the Witnesses to die.

<strong>The Name in Which All Nations Are Choosing to Walk</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> The inspired writer of ancient times correctly sized up the course of modern nations in saying: “All the peoples, for their part, will walk each one in the name of its god.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972921/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mic. 4:5</a>) Each of these gods is very popular in its own locality. That is why, if an individual who really knows what it is all about refuses to go along with the crowd, there is great offense taken toward that individual. Indignation is felt almost to the point of taking violent action toward the offender. But the question is, Of what value are those idolatrous “gods”? To what are they leading the peoples of the nations? To these questions the present world situation ought to give the most convincing answer, especially in view of the unchanging current of world affairs and conditions. We are obliged to agree that the ancient writer made a proper estimate of popular deities when he said: <span id="page742" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="742" data-before-text="742"></span>“All the gods of the peoples are valueless gods.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972921/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 96:5</a>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 4.

The “gods” that have got them into the present muddle are unable to get them out of it and cannot be depended on to get them out of it. If “the peoples” do not wake up, then, at least, <em>individuals</em> should do so, before the whirlpool of rapidly happening world events drags, sucks them down into destruction. Our being pulled out of this disastrous vortex to safety can result only from choosing the right God and walking in the name of that God. Either we continue to go in the name of some popular god, or we choose to go in another direction, walking in the name of a God better than all the popular gods of the peoples of the nations. The choice of this latter course, the right course, is yet possible for lovers of life and happiness.

Yes, indeed! Taking such a courageous course must certainly call for sincerity. Their sincerity in taking this course is not questioned for a moment, but does the mere sincerity as evidenced in their taking of this course make it the right course? No! Hence, the courageous course is being adopted not in sincerity alone, but on the basis of reliable information, correct knowledge. And this under trustworthy guidance, better than the guidance of “valueless gods.” The correctness of the course is proved by the fact that it was foretold in a prophecy that has turned out to be no lie but the truth. All the features of this prophecy are true, because it comes from a God whom no one can accuse of having told a lie, for he does not lie. After more than four thousand years of his dealing with mankind it could still be written of Him: “It is impossible for God to lie.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972921/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 6:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972921/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Titus 1:2</a>) This is the God in whose name more and more persons are choosing to walk today.</p>

<strong>Why the Name “Jehovah’s Witnesses”?</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Leaders of Christendom assert that the true God, the Creator, the God of the Bible, does not need a distinctive name. In this they err. Thereby they shut their eyes to the fact that there are many false gods that men have set up as rivals of the <span id="page120" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="120" data-before-text="120"></span>one true God and that he therefore needs a specific designation to distinguish him from all the rest; even as the Scriptures clearly show: “On all the gods of Egypt I shall execute judgments. I am Jehovah.” “All the gods of the peoples are valueless gods; but as for Jehovah, he has made the very heavens.” “I am Jehovah. That is my name; and to no one else shall I give my own glory, neither my praise to graven images.” “For even though there are those who are called ‘gods,’ whether in heaven or on earth, just as there are many ‘gods’ and many ‘lords,’ there is actually to us one God the Father, out of whom all things are, and we for him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962125/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ex. 12:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962125/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Ps. 96:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962125/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Isa. 42:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962125/6/3" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> 1 Cor. 8:5, 6</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">But why should it be necessary for anyone to witness to the one true God? someone might ask. For at least four distinct reasons. In the first place, because Jehovah God is invisible; no one can see him and live. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962125/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ex. 33:20</a>) Visible creation does witness to Jehovah’s existence and power and wisdom, but it cannot tell humankind what the Creator’s name is and what his other attributes and purposes are. For making known these things Jehovah requires human, intelligent witnesses.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Secondly, because of the challenge of Satan the Devil to the sovereignty of Jehovah and the conditions Satan has brought about on the earth that reflect unfavorably upon Jehovah, it is necessary that He have witnesses to let all men know the truth about himself.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962125/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Gen. 3:1-6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962125/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Rev. 12:12</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Thirdly, in that Satan boasted that he could turn all men away from Jehovah God; to prove Satan a liar, God needs, perforce, to have faithful witnesses on the earth.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962125/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 1:6-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962125/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Prov. 27:11</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">And fourthly, the time is rapidly approaching when Jehovah will once and for all time vindicate himself as the Universal Sovereign by destroying all his foes and delivering his people. Because of these facts witnesses are needed to sound an urgent warning; so that lovers of righteousness can flee to safety and so that the wicked will know why they are being destroyed when Armageddon comes upon them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962125/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Rev. 16:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962125/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 16</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">From their early beginnings the modern witnesses of Jehovah have witnessed to Jehovah’s name. However, it was not until 1931 that they were specially moved by the fact that the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962125/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isaiah 43:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962125/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 12</a>, specifically apply to them, and so in that year, at a convention, they officially went on record as accepting this as their designation.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">In taking that name, Jehovah’s witnesses were not acting presumptuously. Had they not been witnessing to that name and were they not determined to continue to do so? Most assuredly! Others questioned whether the name would stick or not. Has it stuck? It has, for, thirty years later, the third edition of Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary states: “Jehovah’s witnesses: Members of a group that witness by distributing literature and by personal evangelism to beliefs in the theocratic rule of God, the sinfulness of organized religions and governments, and an imminent millennium.”</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Jehovah’s witnesses are proud to bear their name and are concerned with measuring up to it at all times, not only by witnessing verbally, but also by conducting themselves so as to bring no reproach to Jehovah’s name. It is indeed a name that sets them apart from all others professing to be Christians.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb"></p>

He is partaking of the table of demons; he is making himself a sharer with the demons; he is having communion or participation with them. How so? Examine again the above-quoted verses (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956046/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:18-21</a>, <em>NW</em>) and you will see that the apostle Paul uses fleshly Israel as an illustration and asks: “Are not those who eat the sacrifices sharers with the altar?” The eaters of the sacrifices were not merely the priests but also the Israelites who furnished the sacrifices. Concerning the priests Paul asks in the preceding chapter: “Do you not know that the men performing sacred duties eat the things of the temple, and those constantly attending at the altar [Jehovah’s table] have a portion for themselves with the altar?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956046/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Cor. 9:13</a>, <em>NW</em>) However, when the Israelites <span id="page47" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="47" data-before-text="47"></span>presented peace-offering sacrifices or communion sacrifices, then the Israelites also ate some of the sacrifice. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956046/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Lev. 7:11-37</a>) The blood of the communion sacrifice was sprinkled upon Jehovah’s altar, and the fat was burned upon the altar, as Jehovah’s direct part of the sacrifice. The fat of it was his “bread” or “food.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956046/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Lev. 3:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956046/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 7:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956046/15/2" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 22-26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956046/15/3" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> 9:18-20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956046/15/4" data-bid="16-5" class="b"> 17:5-7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956046/15/5" data-bid="16-6" class="b"> 21:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956046/15/6" data-bid="16-7" class="b"> 22:25</a>) The breast and right leg of the communion sacrifice became the priest’s who officiated at the sacrifice.

That altar belonged to Jehovah God; it was Jehovah’s table upon which his food was offered to him by his priests. Hence by eating of the same communion sacrifice of which the fat was offered as food to Jehovah God, the Israelites were having communion or a meal in common with him. They were already his people by his choosing them and by the covenant that he had made with them through the mediator Moses. But now by partaking of the communion sacrifice along with his priest and his altar they were having special communion with Jehovah God. They were partaking of the typical “table of Jehovah.” Thus the fitness of the name “communion sacrifice,” although the Greek Septuagint Version of the Hebrew Scriptures calls it a peace sacrifice and a sacrifice of salvation.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956046/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Sam. 10:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956046/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 11:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956046/18/2" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> 13:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956046/18/3" data-bid="19-4" class="b"> 1 Ki. 3:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956046/18/4" data-bid="19-5" class="b"> 8:63, 64;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956046/18/5" data-bid="19-6" class="b"> 9:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956046/18/6" data-bid="19-7" class="b"> Lev. 3:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956046/18/7" data-bid="19-8" class="b"> 22:21</a>, <em>LXX.</em></p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">11.

And the priest must sprinkle the blood upon Jehovah’s altar at the entrance of the tent of meeting and he must make the fat smoke as a smell of appeasement to Jehovah. So they should no longer sacrifice their sacrifices to the goat-shaped demons.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956046/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Lev. 17:5-7</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">12. Is it because the idol and the animal sacrificed to it amount to anything, or just why is it that Paul advises against eating from such sacrifice, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956046/68/0" data-bid="69-1" class="b">1 Corinthians, chapter 10</a>?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> For a like reason the worshiper of the living and true God should avoid idol sacrifices, argues Paul. Not that the idol in itself is anything more than the gold, silver, stone, wood or other material of which it is made. Nor that the thing sacrificed to the idol takes on any new quality or value that changes it from being still a creation of Jehovah God. But that lifeless, material idol represents a demon. “All the gods of the peoples are idols; but Jehovah made the heavens.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956046/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 96:5</a>, <em>AS</em>) “All the gods of the nations are demons [devils]. But as for the Lord, He made the heavens.” (<em>Septuagint,</em> Thomson; Bagster) So when a worshiper at a sacrificial feast ate part of the animal sacrificed to the idol, he was partaking of the “table of demons,” for <span id="page48" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="48" data-before-text="48"></span>the idol altar belonged to the demons. When he drank of the wine cup at such a sacrificial feast he was drinking from the “cup of demons.” He was becoming a ‘sharer with the demons,’ having communion with them. That is why Paul said to the Christians at Corinth: “The things which the nations sacrifice they sacrifice to demons, and not to God, and I do not want you to become sharers with the demons. You cannot be drinking the cup of Jehovah and the cup of demons; you cannot be partaking of ‘the table of Jehovah’ and the table of demons.” Jehovah is jealous; he demands exclusive devotion.</p>

But this fear is not mixed with the fear of Jehovah. Besides fearing the things they discern as about to come upon the earth, they fear their visible gods, the mighty ones that they idolize in politics, in business, in militarism and in popular religion. These deified ones instill fear of themselves into the hearts of the populace to keep themselves prominent and in the power to control. To these the people ascribe the power and works and adoration that belong only to the one living and true God, Jehovah. The fear that the people have toward these earthly gods is merely a fear of awesome men, mere human creatures who will die. But Jehovah is to be “feared more than all other gods.” As he once executed judgment on all the false gods of Egypt, so he is now judging these earthly gods, to the point of exposing their utter inability and falsity. “God standeth in the congregation of God; he judgeth among the gods.” To the mighty, adored ones in Christendom who profess to be sons of the God of heaven he directs this message: “I said, Ye are gods, and all of you sons of the Most High.

Oh worship Jehovah in holy array: tremble before him, all the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952840/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 96:4-9</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">But is there a single political party or faction anywhere on earth today that seeks such ends? No, the totalitarian spirit has infested the governments and societies of this world so that dictator-led peoples are crushed under military machines into outright worship of the state and their <em>fuehrers, duces, caudillos,</em> etc. In professedly democratic lands, though the method is more subtle—through political machines—the resulting exaltation of men, their programs, parties, “deals,” etc., is very similar. So flagrantly hypocritical do their boasts and promises become that the people generally and even the politicians smile cynically at their own antics.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">A recent instance occurred early this past July when the president of the United States, Harry S. Truman, journeyed into Arkansas to view and dedicate two government power projects. Seizing the opportunity to exalt his political party, this prominent leader in world affairs told one crowd: “There is not a man or a woman in this audience who is not better off for twenty years of Democratic rule. Now if you want to throw that out the window and go off after false gods, that is your business and I can’t stop you. But just do a little thinking and you will find that your interests are with the party that represents the people as a whole and not special interests.”—New York <em>Times,</em> July 3, 1952.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In a similar vein, one that kept reminding his listeners how much they owed to the government administration, President Truman declared during a high point of his main speech of the trip: “My friends, I say to you that the progressive policies of the last twenty years have been the salvation of this country.”</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Whether he said it in so many words or not, whether he meant to infer it or not, the obvious implication of Mr. Truman’s remarks is that the powers of the Democratic party represent the “true gods” of the American people. If he called his political enemies <em>gods,</em> “false gods,” it would not be beyond him to consider himself and his political associates and allies likewise gods, supposedly the “true gods”. If he meant the <span id="page676" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="676" data-before-text="676"></span>programs rather than the individuals in the two main American political parties, the effect is the same. As the president said, the people are free to do what they like in selecting human leaders and parties and programs to follow. But they do well to remember that following the mighty men or their promises in any human political party is to follow a sin-spoiled and dying creature. No more than one blind man can lead another can they of themselves bring a world born in sin back into divine favor. “Do you not know that if you keep presenting yourselves to anyone as slaves to obey him, you are slaves of him because you obey him, either of sin with death in view or of obedience with righteousness in view?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952840/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 15:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952840/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Rom. 6:16</a>, <em>NW.</em></p>

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page291" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="291" data-before-text="291"></span><strong>Appreciating Beauty</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE great Creator is a lover of beauty. His appreciation of it is apparent from the things he has made. Look where we will and we see nature, when unspoiled by humans, a thing of beauty; not to say anything about beauty in human form and features. It is right also that we appreciate beauty, that we have eyes for beauty and that we enjoy it. All such beauty, together with our faculty for enjoying it, may be said to be but another proof that “God is love.”</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">No question about it, “everything he has made pretty in its time.” That is also true of everything associated with the worship of God. In ancient times God ordained that the special structures used for his worship as well as their furnishings be exceedingly beautiful. No wonder the psalmist exulted: “Out of Zion, the perfection of prettiness, God himself has beamed forth.” “Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963360/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963360/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ps. 50:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963360/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 96:6</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Still another kind of beauty that the Creator gave his earthly creatures is that found in his Word. It is indeed a Book that is filled with beautiful sentiments, beautifully expressed. That is why one of Israel’s poets could say: “Melodies your regulations have become to me.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963360/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 119:54</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Great as may be the pleasure and enjoyment that we find in beauty, still God did not intend for us to make beauty our chief goal in life. He did not intend for us to forget ourselves in beauty, to take it so seriously that we would neglect our worship of God or that we would even break God’s laws so as to enjoy beauty.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">For one thing, let us never forget that under present imperfect conditions much beauty is transient, temporary. Of this God repeatedly reminds us in his Word: “All flesh is green grass, and all their loving-kindness is like the blossom of the field. The green grass has dried up, the blossom has withered; but as for the word of our God, it will last to time indefinite.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963360/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa. 40:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963360/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 8</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Not only is beauty transient, but it can very easily become a snare, and that in two ways: a snare to those possessing it and a snare to those hungering for it. Thus we read regarding the one that became Satan the Devil: “Your heart became haughty because of your beauty. You brought your wisdom to ruin on account of your beaming splendor.” The beauty of Absalom, a son of King David, without doubt had a part in turning his head, so that he tried to wrest the kingdom from his father: “Now compared with Absalom there proved to be no man so beautiful in all <span id="page292" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="292" data-before-text="292"></span>Israel as to be praised so much.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963360/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezek. 28:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963360/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2 Sam. 14:25</a>.</p>

Little do the people realize that they are worshiping demons who take to themselves the worship that the people blindly offer. The apostle Paul, who identified the unknown God for the pagan philosophers, said concerning their idols: “What, then, am I to say? That what is sacrificed to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything? No; but I say that the things which the nations sacrifice they sacrifice to demons, and not to God, and I do not want you to become sharers with the demons.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956923/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:19, 20</a>, <em>NW</em>) These gods are “worthless gods.” Idol images cannot save, neither can the demons that they represent do so. With Satan their ruler these demons have great anger against the true God and his people on earth. Determined to let Jehovah God save nothing on earth, they are leading all the kings of this inhabited earth against God at Armageddon, to their destruction. It spells death, annihilation, therefore, to listen to demon-inspired propaganda. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956923/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rev. 16:13-16</a>) Their man-made idols cannot rescue their worshipers from that annihilation. Instead of being of real religious benefit to strengthen man’s belief in what is true, the idols do harm. They blind the nations and peoples to Jehovah God and his kingdom, the exclusive source of eternal salvation. “Worthless gods,” indeed!</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 7.

He made them by his power and in his wisdom. His unsearchable mind arranged for all the glory of the visible heavens and their order and harmony. Only one mind could organize all this—His mind. Immeasurably far up above those heavens the Most High God exercises his universal sovereignty. If those visible heavens beneath are so impressive and splendid and beautiful to us, what dignity and splendor there must be all about Jehovah himself in the spiritual heavens! What strength and beauty there must be in that most holy place where he personally dwells! This we can only weakly imagine on the basis of the things visible, although we cannot actually know how glorious he himself is, for “no man has seen God at any time,” no man has seen his figure, and he himself decrees: “No man may see me and yet live.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956923/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 1:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956923/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 5:37 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956923/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Ex. 33:20</a>, <em>NW</em>) The artificial glory and stateliness of earthly gods fade away in comparison. How foolish, then, for one to demand to see Jehovah actually before one would believe in him! Believe the testimony of his creative works. Believe the true witness of his written Word, the sacred Bible.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 8.

For our guidance the inspired psalmist sings out: “Ascribe to Jehovah, O you families of the peoples, ascribe to Jehovah glory and strength. Ascribe to Jehovah the glory belonging to his name. Carry a gift and come into his courtyards. Bow down to Jehovah in holy adornment, be in severe pains because of him, all [you people of] the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956923/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 96:7-9</a>, <em>NW.</em></p>

<strong>Let All Declare the Glory of Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> Without speech, without words, without voice, Jehovah’s awesome created heavens declare his glory, day after day, night after night. Creation never ceases to declare God’s glory, and it is humbling to contemplate this silent testimony going into “all the earth” for all its inhabitants to see. However, the silent witness of creation is not enough. Faithful humans are urged to join in with audible voice. An unnamed psalmist addressed faithful worshipers with these inspired words: “Ascribe to Jehovah glory and strength. Ascribe to Jehovah the glory belonging to his name.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004002/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 96:7, 8</a>) Those who have a close relationship with Jehovah are thrilled to respond to that exhortation. What, though, is involved in ascribing glory to God?</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 3. Why do humans ascribe glory to God?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> More is required than mere words. The Israelites of Isaiah’s day glorified God with their lips, but most lacked sincerity. Through Isaiah, Jehovah said: “This people have come near with their mouth, and they have glorified me merely with their lips, and they have removed their heart itself far away from me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004002/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 29:13</a>) Any praise uttered by such individuals was meaningless. To be meaningful, praise must spring from a heart filled <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>with love for Jehovah and a sincere recognition of his unique glory. Jehovah alone is the Creator. He is the Almighty, the Just One, the epitome of love. He is the author of our salvation and the rightful Sovereign to whom everyone living in heaven and on earth owes subjection. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004002/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 4:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004002/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 19:1</a>) If we truly believe these things, let us glorify him with all our heart.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 4.

He said: “My Father is glorified in this, that you keep bearing much fruit and prove yourselves my disciples.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004002/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 15:8</a>) How do we bear much fruit? First, by sharing whole-souled in preaching the “good news of the kingdom” and thus joining with all created things in “telling” about God’s “invisible qualities.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004002/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004002/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Romans 1:20</a>) Moreover, in this way we all have a share​—directly or indirectly—​in the making of new disciples who swell the chorus of praise to Jehovah God. Second, we cultivate the fruitage produced in us by holy spirit and strive to imitate Jehovah God’s superlative qualities. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004002/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Galatians 5:22, 23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004002/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Ephesians 5:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004002/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Colossians 3:10</a>) As a result, our daily conduct glorifies God.</p>

<strong>Giving Our Best to Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[26]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> So David recognized that we humans cannot enrich the Almighty in any way. Indeed, whatever we may give is merely a returning of a small part of what we have received from the Source of “every good gift and every perfect present.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979328/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jas. 1:17</a>) But does this mean that the bringing of gifts to our Creator has no value? Does he spurn the offerings of his devoted servants? The answer of God’s Word is, No. Jehovah God invites humble worshipers to <span id="page17" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>bring their gifts. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979328/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 96:8</a> we read: “Ascribe to Jehovah the glory belonging to his name; carry a gift and come into his courtyards.”</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="qu"> 4. What kind of gifts are pleasing to Jehovah?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[27]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Of course, Jehovah wanted fine offerings that were prompted by appreciative hearts. These would be gifts that involved self-denial as well as prayerful and thoughtful preparation. For example, while the Mosaic law was in force, an Israelite could not bring just <em>any</em> animal to the gate of the tabernacle courtyard and expect to receive favorable recognition from God. The Law stated: “In case a man should present a communion sacrifice to Jehovah in order to pay <span id="page18" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>a vow or as a voluntary offering, it should prove to be a sound one among the herd or the flock, in order to gain approval. No defect at all should prove to be in it. No case of blindness or fracture or having a cut or wart or scabbiness or ringworm, none of these must you present to Jehovah.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979328/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Lev. 22:21, 22</a>.</p>

<strong>Rendering Our Best to Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Yes, David had the right view of all his own and his people’s contributions toward the place of worship at Jerusalem, for he goes on to admit: “Everything is from you, and out of your own hand we have given to you.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971327/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:11-14</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Yet should that discourage God’s people from offering gifts in support of pure worship, rendering their best to Jehovah? No, for, under inspiration of God, the psalmist penned this enthusiastic invitation to all who would please the Creator: “Ascribe to Jehovah the glory belonging to his name; carry a gift and come into his courtyards.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971327/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 96:8</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Those words may give us a mental vision of the Israelites of old as they brought their gift offerings​—fine flour, wine, oil, unblemished animals—​to the courtyards of Jehovah’s temple, particularly on the three special occasions of the year.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971327/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Deut. 16:16</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Priests of the family line of Aaron, acting as Jehovah’s representatives, accepted the generous offerings of the people. They had their instructions from Jehovah as to the proper disposition of all those gifts for the maintenance and advancement of true worship. Sincere worshipers were satisfied to lay down their gifts in that holy place, and then start the journey back to their homes, happy in the knowledge that they had given of their best to their God.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>MODERN WORSHIPERS AND THEIR GIFTS</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Today there is, of course, no such literal temple with its courtyards. But since all those things were to serve as ‘typical representations of heavenly things’ or spiritual things, we look for the modern-day “courtyards” with their throngs of worshipers. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971327/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Heb. 9:23</a>) Association of those ancient worshipers with the anointed Aaronic priesthood proves a clue. Today there is on earth a small remnant or remaining number of Jesus’ spirit-anointed brothers, persons who have before them the prospect of one day serving as heavenly priests under their High Priest, Jesus Christ. A great crowd of persons from all nations count it a privilege to come into association with that remnant, for thereby they can enjoy the blessings of an arrangement that <span id="page284" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="284" data-before-text="284"></span>God has made for a visible organization of his worshipers today. That <em>association</em> to them is like approaching the very “courtyards” of Jehovah’s house.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971327/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:16</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The throng of modern worshipers also concern themselves about the gifts they bring into Jehovah’s “courtyards.” Perhaps the first thought that comes to mind is to make a monetary contribution of some kind. But how much? For an answer, we can go back to the typical scene and note these words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971327/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 16:17</a>: “The gift of each one’s hand should be in proportion to the blessing of Jehovah your God that he has given you.” Who knows better than the individual worshiper the extent of God’s blessing upon him? The unappreciative person may not see that Jehovah has blessed him at all, but those who are grateful for life and breath and opportunities to serve their Creator have a different view. They give cheerfully.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971327/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Cor. 9:7</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Just as God loves a cheerful giver, so he loves those who give with the right motives and heart attitudes. We do well to meditate upon some of God’s own expressions on this matter: “I am Jehovah, the one exercising loving-kindness, justice and righteousness in the earth; for in these things I do take delight.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971327/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jer. 9:24</a>) “To this one, then, I shall look, to the one afflicted and contrite in spirit and trembling at my word.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971327/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isa. 66:2</a>) And according to the apostle Peter, what is it that “is of great value in the eyes of God”? Why, “the secret person of the heart [draped] in the incorruptible apparel of the quiet and mild spirit.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971327/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:4</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">So it is evident that the first thing Jehovah is concerned about in those who would bring gift offerings to his “courtyards” is their heart attitude. Are they, too, lovers of loving-kindness, justice, righteousness? Are they humble, contrite, repentant in their approach to God? Are they striving to put on that apparel of the “quiet and mild spirit”?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Thus it is not only what is offered that counts. The spirit and motive behind the gift are open before the searching gaze of the Supreme One.</p>

<strong>The Most Widely Published Song</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">How would the Christian “prophets” and “holy ones” who had died be rewarded and stand with him on the heavenly Mount Zion? By being resurrected just as he was, not in a fleshly body, for in flesh they could not stand with him in heaven in the presence of Jehovah God. The apostle Paul explains this fact to us in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:35-50</a>, where he tells us that “flesh and blood cannot inherit God’s kingdom,” but that these dead ones, having gone down in death in a corruptible, physical body of weakness, would be raised up with a spiritual body, incorrupt, bearing the image of the heavenly One. Their resurrection, therefore, would be in a spiritual body and be invisible to human eyes. While the great majority of the 144,000 have lived and died, yet at present there remains a “remnant,” who, while completing their faithful course on earth, are <span id="page184" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="184" data-before-text="184"></span>highly privileged to join in the song and to see that it is published to a great earthwide audience.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>TO WHOM DO THE SINGERS BEAR WITNESS</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><em>“Having his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.”</em> Having the name of the Lamb Jesus Christ and the name of his Father written on the forehead, where it can be plainly seen by all, symbolizes the fact that they are slaves of Jehovah God and Jesus Christ. They do not have the name of Babylon on their foreheads as if they were slaves of Babylon and belonged to her. What the apostle John saw in the foreheads of the 144,000 was no doubt the sacred Hebrew tetragrammaton (יהוה), for the name of the Father (YHWH), or in Anglicized pronunciation, Jehovah. The 144,000 therefore must be Jehovah’s witnesses during their earthly course and now continue to be his witnesses in heaven.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><em>“And I heard a sound out of heaven as the sound of many waters and as the sound of loud thunder; and the sound that I heard was as of singers who accompany themselves on the harp playing on their harps.”</em> What a chorus! A hundred and forty-four thousand singers, not with earthly voices, but with heavenly voices, singing in perfect harmony, accompanied by the pure music of the harp. The extent to which the song would be heard is indicated by the fact that to John it had the mighty sound of many waters and the sound of loud thunders. Never in the history of the universe has there been such a song nor such an audience, millions of angels in heaven listening and the entire earth to hear its joyful, encouraging strains. We shall see how the singers accomplish this, by Jehovah’s direction and power.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>THE GRAND THEME OF THE SONG</strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><em>“And they are singing as if a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the older persons.”</em> So the song was not known and sung before 1914. It is <em>new.</em> The 144,000 integrity-keeping joint heirs with Christ are the first ones to vocalize it. Because of its singers and its content it is the greatest and most far-reaching anthem of the universe, for it is about the kingdom of God as the government that has been established since 1914. It has the loftiest theme, the greatest truth taught in the Bible: it is about Jesus Christ reigning in Kingdom power. Jesus Christ the King in Jehovah’s kingdom is the great Truth in fulfillment of all the prophetic utterances of the Bible, and he is the one who himself gave a fine testimony before Pontius Pilate that he came to earth to bear witness to this great truth. It concerns first the most important One of the Kingdom organization, for the song itself contains words addressed to the Lamb of God: “You are worthy to take the scroll and open its seals, because you were slaughtered and with your blood you bought persons for God out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and you made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God, and they will rule as kings over the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Rev. 5:9, 10</a>) The 144,000 singers will have the abounding joy of reigning with Christ and sharing in his rule over the earth, bringing the blessings of the Abrahamic covenant, which provided that all families of the earth were to bless themselves by means of the Seed, Jesus Christ. To these singers the commands of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalms 96:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 98:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/14/3" data-bid="15-4" class="b"> 5</a>; and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps 149:1, 2</a> would apply:</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="si">“Sing to Jehovah a new song.

The productive land also becomes firmly established so that it cannot <span id="page185" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="185" data-before-text="185"></span>be made to totter. He will plead the cause of the peoples in uprightness.’” “Sing to Jehovah a new song, for wonderful are the things that he has done. His right hand, even his holy arm, has gained salvation for him. Make melody to Jehovah with the harp, with the harp and the voice of melody.” “Praise Jah, you people! Sing to Jehovah a new song, his praise in the congregation of loyal ones. Let Israel rejoice in its grand Maker, the sons of Zion—let them be joyful in their King.”</p>

<strong>“What Prevents Me from Getting Baptized?”</strong><br/><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"><sup>25</sup></span> Everyone who has answered “Yes” to these two questions is eligible for baptism and should be baptized at that same circuit or district assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses. The baptized ones should remember the day; it is the day of their symbolizing their dedication because of which dedication they receive an ordination to preach the good news of the kingdom of heaven. They should make a notation of it, the date and the year, lest they ever forget it. And they should remember also that that day of great and deep joy is <span id="page309" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="309" data-before-text="309"></span>no time to show hilarity or fanaticism; it is a serious occasion, and the ones undergoing baptism should have a prayerful attitude, just as we read about Jesus, that he prayed when he went up out of the water.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960364/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Luke 3:21</a>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">26.

There that typical visible kingdom on earth ended and Jehovah ceased to reign among men by an imperfect king of David’s line. But Jesus Christ taught us to pray for God’s kingdom to come to earth again and for the heavenly Father’s will to be done on earth the same as up in heaven. Jesus preached the good news of that coming kingdom and died for it. By resurrecting Jesus God restored him to life and seated him at his own right hand in heaven and commanded him to wait till the “appointed times of the nations” ended in 1914, at which time Jehovah would bring forth his kingdom and lay the executive power of it upon the shoulder of Jesus Christ.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">13.

It is the kingdom of salvation for both heaven and earth. The salvation already begun by it is the good news that the witnesses are commanded to tell from day to day. We are instructed not to miss a day in telling it. Why? Because the days to tell it are limited before Armageddon, in fact, are getting fewer with each passing day. Not a single day dare we leave it out of mind, for the kingdom of salvation is the thing that Jesus said we should keep seeking first, together with righteousness from God. Of all times, why not seek it now when it is actually here? Every day brings opportunities to tell of the salvation that it has brought and will bring, that others may be impelled to seek the Kingdom too. It being the only rightful government of heaven and earth, the only one that will vindicate Jehovah’s universal sovereignty and save mankind, salvation by it is worth telling out to others who also need salvation. Owing to the oncoming destruction of this wicked system of things salvation by Jehovah’s means is something most timely to be told daily. It is the only “good news” today. If we rejoice daily in the Kingdom, <span id="page757" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="757" data-before-text="757"></span>if we feel like shouting Hallelujah! at the realization that it is ruling now in the midst of its enemies, we shall bubble over into talking of the salvation it brings. The telling of salvation by Jehovah is, in fact, a part of our worship of him, and we know we must render him worship every day. Tell it, then, from day to day. If we do not sing to Jehovah by telling it, we do not have the “joy of Jehovah.” Sharing in his joy is a stronghold to us.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956923/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Neh. 8:10</a>, <em>NW.</em></p>

<strong>Heaven</strong><br/><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">It can be seen from the foregoing that the context must always be considered in determining the sense of these figurative expressions. Thus, when Moses called on “the heavens and the earth” to serve as witnesses to the things that he declared to Israel, it is obvious that he did not mean the inanimate creation but, rather, the intelligent residents inhabiting the heavens and the earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/140/0" data-bid="141-1" class="b">De 4:25, 26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/140/1" data-bid="141-2" class="b"> 30:19</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/141/0" data-bid="142-1" class="b">Eph 1:9, 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/141/1" data-bid="142-2" class="b"> Php 2:9, 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/141/2" data-bid="142-3" class="b"> Re 13:6</a>.) This is also true of the rejoicing by the heavens and earth over Babylon’s fall, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/142/0" data-bid="143-1" class="b">Jeremiah 51:48</a>. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/143/0" data-bid="144-1" class="b">Re 18:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/143/1" data-bid="144-2" class="b"> 19:1-3</a>.) Likewise it must be the spiritual heavens that “trickle with righteousness,” as described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/144/0" data-bid="145-1" class="b">Isaiah 45:8</a>. In other cases the literal heavens are meant but are figuratively described as rejoicing or shouting out loud. At Jehovah’s coming to judge the earth, as described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/145/0" data-bid="146-1" class="b">Psalm 96:11-13</a>, the heavens, along with the earth, sea, and the field, take on a gladsome appearance. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/146/0" data-bid="147-1" class="b">Isa 44:23</a>.) The physical heavens also praise their Creator, in the same way that a beautifully designed product brings praise to the craftsman producing it. In effect, they speak of Jehovah’s power, wisdom, and majesty.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/147/0" data-bid="148-1" class="b">Ps 19:1-4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/147/1" data-bid="148-2" class="b"> 69:34</a>.</p>

Not a single day dare we leave it out of mind, for the kingdom of salvation is the thing that Jesus said we should keep seeking first, together with righteousness from God. Of all times, why not seek it now when it is actually here? Every day brings opportunities to tell of the salvation that it has brought and will bring, that others may be impelled to seek the Kingdom too. It being the only rightful government of heaven and earth, the only one that will vindicate Jehovah’s universal sovereignty and save mankind, salvation by it is worth telling out to others who also need salvation. Owing to the oncoming destruction of this wicked system of things salvation by Jehovah’s means is something most timely to be told daily. It is the only “good news” today. If we rejoice daily in the Kingdom, <span id="page757" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="757" data-before-text="757"></span>if we feel like shouting Hallelujah! at the realization that it is ruling now in the midst of its enemies, we shall bubble over into talking of the salvation it brings. The telling of salvation by Jehovah is, in fact, a part of our worship of him, and we know we must render him worship every day. Tell it, then, from day to day. If we do not sing to Jehovah by telling it, we do not have the “joy of Jehovah.” Sharing in his joy is a stronghold to us.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956923/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Neh. 8:10</a>, <em>NW.</em></p>

The tree is of the acacia species and is known as the whistling thorn. Why? Because when the wind rushes through the delicate branches, the tree seemingly lifts its voice.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A lovely, lilting sound is produced when the tree’s unusually long and slender thorns vibrate in the wind. Adding to the melody of the thorns, the tree’s hollow galls produce a sound much like that of an empty bottle when air is blown across its mouth. These “instruments” are formed by ants, who are said to hollow out the galls, the ants’ spherical homes, and carve tiny entrance and exit holes in them. Because the galls and holes are of differing sizes, they produce sounds of differing pitch. These sounds add to the uniqueness and beauty of the whistling thorn.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">This tree reminds us of the words of the psalmist who declared figuratively: “Let all the trees of the forest break out joyfully [in song] before Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101999168/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 96:12, 13</a>) Indeed, when the wind flows over the thorns and the flutelike galls, it produces sounds that are a lovely, emotive song of Africa.</p>

<strong>Why God’s Field Will Be Productive</strong><br/><p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"><sup>27</sup></span> The earth was not destroyed; it is still “standing compactly out of water.” However, it is not standing “in the midst of water.” How is that? Because the water in the midst of which it then stood was deluged down upon it from the heavens, but not from clouds. Up until Noah’s six hundredth year of life the “heavens in ancient <span id="page55" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="55" data-before-text="55"></span>times” were different or had a feature different from what the heavens or outer space have now. They had a water ring high in suspension above the earth and containing billions of tons of water. According to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964043/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Genesis 1:6-8</a>, God’s word of command put that water ring up there in the heavens. It covered the earth like a canopy, so that the earth was standing “in the midst of water by the word of God.” In November of the six hundredth year of Noah God’s word brought that encircling water ring down upon the earth from which it had originally come. So that feature of the heavens disappeared, but the heavens themselves, with their sun, moon and stars, remained. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964043/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Gen. 1:14-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964043/52/1" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> 6:5—8:7</a>) Well, then, what was destroyed?</p><p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="qu">28.

Of course, there were Nephilim in the earth in those days. They were the hybrid offspring from the marriage of disobedient angels, the sons of God, with the beautiful daughters of men. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964043/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Gen. 6:1-4</a>) Although they may have had superhuman vitality, the Nephilim were flesh and, of course, were destroyed in the Flood.

<strong>Jehovah Has Become King</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">But perhaps you will ask, Has not God always been King—from the very time he had at least one subject, his only-begotten Son? Yes, that is true regarding his heavenly dominions but not of his earthly one. While Adam and Eve remained obedient God’s rule did directly extend to this earth, but not since their rebellion. Since then there has been no direct rule of God upon this earth save in the tiny area held by <span id="page310" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="310" data-before-text="310"></span>the nation of Israel and while its kings did “sit upon Jehovah’s throne.” These served as deputy kings for Jehovah as it were. With the overthrow of the last of these kings, Zedekiah, began “the appointed times of the nations.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Luke 21:24</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">True, whenever his purposes have been involved Jehovah has exercised rule “in the kingdom of men,” maneuvering men and nations according to his sovereign will. But such men and nations have not been his deputies nor his kingdoms. Rather, they have been the deputies and kingdoms of Satan the Devil. For this reason that one is termed “the ruler of this world,” and “the god of this system of things,” in whose power “the whole world is lying.” Had it been otherwise Jesus would not have taught us to pray for God’s kingdom to come.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Dan. 4:17</a>, <em>AS;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 16:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 4:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 1 John 5:19</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Why has God tolerated rebellion upon this earth, and that for so long? He has permitted it only—and that temporarily—because of Satan’s boast that he could turn all men away from God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job, chaps. 1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 2</a>) At his appointed time Jehovah God takes action, for he cannot forever permit these conditions without, in effect, denying his sovereignty, which it is impossible for him to do. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Tim. 2:13</a>) When he displays his sovereignty by establishing direct rule toward this earth, the prophetic words apply: “Jehovah himself has become king!” “Yahweh hath become king.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 97:1</a>; <em>Ro.</em></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Failure on the part of most translators of the Bible to appreciate these truths accounts for the fact that most versions render the psalmist’s words, “Jehovah [or, The Lord] reigns!” (<em>AS, AV, RS, AT</em>) And so we also find that Biblical commentators generally apply these words either to God’s eternal rulership or to certain annual celebrations of the Jews. However, such renderings and explanations are neither in line with the original Hebrew word used nor with the circumstances that called forth <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 96</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The original Hebrew word here rendered by so many “reigns” does not mean a continuous or eternal reigning but refers to the beginning of a reign. That is why Bible writers used it in regard to the beginning of the reigns of Adonijah, Jehoshaphat and Hezekiah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Ki. 1:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 22:41;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 2 Chron. 29:1</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">That the beginning of a reign is indicated can also be seen by noting the circumstances that caused King David, for one, to exclaim, “Jehovah himself has become king!” The sacred ark of the covenant had been taken by priests into battle to assure Israel victory, as though it were a magic charm that would work miracles even though the Israelites were under God’s displeasure. To the dismay of the Israelites, the Philistines captured it, but the latter were only too glad to get rid of it because of the havoc it wrought among them. For years it then lodged at the homes of two Levites, Abinadab and Obed-edom, until King David directed bringing it to Mount Zion. Because this ark was a symbol of Jehovah’s presence, David could now shout that Jehovah himself had begun ruling on the royal mountain.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Chron. 16:7-36</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>SINCE 1914</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Jehovah God reigns by and through his Son Jesus Christ. So, when Jesus ascended into heaven, forty days after his resurrection, God said to him: “Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.” When that time came the prophetic words were fulfilled: “I, even I, have installed my king upon Zion, my holy mountain. . . . You are my son; I, today, I have become your father. Ask of me, that I may give nations as your inheritance <span id="page311" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="311" data-before-text="311"></span>and the ends of the earth as your own possession.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 2:6-8</a>.</p>

So in 1914 the time had come for Jehovah to begin making Christ’s enemies the stool for his feet. The time had come for Jehovah to send the rod of Christ’s strength out of heavenly Zion with the command: “Go subduing in the midst of your enemies.” At the exact time in 1914 Jehovah God faithfully did those things. His kingdom by Christ is now in action. Because of its action Satan the Devil and all his demons now find themselves hurled down and confined to the neighborhood of this earth to await the not-far-off time when Jehovah himself, at his anointed King’s right hand, will break the enemy kings of the earth to pieces on the day for vindicating his universal sovereignty.</p><p id="p92" data-pid="92" class="qu">32.

Let the earth be joyful. Let the many islands rejoice. For you, O Jehovah, are the Most High over all the earth; you have made your ascent very high over all other gods.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Ps. 97:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/51/1" data-bid="52-2" class="b"> 9</a>) Wise, indeed, we are if we rejoice in faith over the establishment of God’s kingdom rather than sorrow over the coming overthrow of the kingdoms of this wicked world.</p><p id="p93" data-pid="93" class="qu">33.

<strong>Born to Believe in God</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Not only does science give one reason to believe in God, but it causes one to see the need for a revelation from God about himself. The Bible fills that need. Chemist Roger J. Voskuyl says: “As a scientist, it is more reasonable for me to believe in a Creator than in an eternally existing cosmos. . . . One cannot rightly know God from the natural world alone. The scientist may work for an eternity, but he will <span id="page392" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="392" data-before-text="392"></span>never come to know God and all His attributes. . . . Man is but a creature of a Creator; therefore, man cannot learn about God by investigation of His creation alone, but he needs a special revelation. That special revelation is God’s Word, which has been given in the Scriptures.”</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Distinguished scientist Warren Weaver said: “I believe that the Bible is the purest revelation we have of the nature and goodness of God.” Physicist and chemist Oscar Leo Brauer writes: “There is Special Divine Revelation. Another name for that is the Bible. Science can establish that a creative act at some time must have taken place, implying the existence of a Divine Intelligence and a Divine Power. Science can also establish that none but a Divine Intelligence could have been the Author of the tremendous, involved and intricate system of laws in the universe. But only the Bible can identify that Divine Intelligence and Power as the God most of us have learned to know about from early childhood—the God who has revealed himself uniquely and supremely in His Son, Jesus Christ.”</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">The Bible does what nature cannot do. Nature only submits circumstantial evidence that God exists, but the Bible calls the Creator by name. “This is what The true God, Jehovah, has said, the Creator of the heavens and the grand One stretching them out; the One laying out the earth and its produce, the One giving breath to the people on it, and spirit to those walking in it. ‘I am Jehovah. That is my name; and to anyone else I shall not give my own glory, neither my praise to graven images.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961481/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa. 42:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961481/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 8</a>) The psalmist wrote: “That people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961481/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 83:18</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">The inspired apostle Paul tells us that Jehovah’s “invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are understood by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship.” The psalmist exclaims: “The heavens are declaring the glory of God, and of the work of his hands the expanse is telling. One day after another day causes speech to bubble forth, and one night after another night shows forth knowledge.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961481/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rom. 1:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961481/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Ps. 19:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The scales of perfection evident in the creation of the universe imply the existence of an absolute standard and a perfect Being. Regarding Jehovah, the Bible says: “Perfect is his activity.” “God is a God, not of disorder, but of peace.” Order and design in the universe are proof of that fact. The presence of life bespeaks a lifegiver. Jehovah is “the source of life.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961481/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Deut. 32:3, 4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961481/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 14:33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961481/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Ps. 36:9</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Another fact that stands out in nature is that our God is a Master Creator who loves beauty. The majesty of the sunrise and sunset, the moon and stars, flowers and trees, the gorgeous colors on the scales of a fish and the feathers of a peacock tell us that Jehovah loves beauty. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961481/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 104:24</a>) We know too that Jehovah is a loving God, for among men we find the love of a mother for her child, the love of men and women for each other. We also see that falsehood betrays itself and injustice reaps a grim reward. Can we imagine these qualities stemming from an Author who knows nothing of love, righteousness and judgment? No, we cannot. The Bible tells us that “God is love,” that “righteousness and judgment are the established place of his throne.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961481/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 John 4:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961481/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Ps. 97:2</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Nothing can be more true than that God is, as both the Bible and nature so eloquently testify. Therefore, in God’s own Word unbelievers are appropriately called fools and are justly judged inexcusable.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961481/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 14:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961481/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Rom. 1:20</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Mount, Mountain</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><strong>Figurative and Prophetic Use.</strong> Sometimes the term “mountain” applies to the soil, vegetation, and trees on the mountain’s surface. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003125/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ps 83:14</a>.) Of Jehovah, the psalmist says: “He touches the mountains, and they smoke.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003125/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Ps 104:32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003125/32/1" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> 144:5, 6</a>) This may point to the fact that lightning can set mountain forests on fire, thereby causing a mountain to smoke. The effects of a severe storm appear to be described when the Bible speaks of mountains ‘melting’ or ‘flowing away.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003125/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Jg 5:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003125/33/1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> Ps 97:5</a>) Heavy rains produce streams and raging torrents that wash the soil away, as if melting it. Similarly, the expression of Jehovah’s anger against the nations was foretold to result in such slaughter that the blood of the slain would melt the mountains, that is, wash the soil away. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003125/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Isa 34:1-3</a>) For mountains to “drip with sweet wine” means that the vineyards occupying their slopes would produce abundantly.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003125/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Joe 3:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003125/35/1" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> Am 9:13</a>.</p>

<strong>Obeisance</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><strong><em>Obeisance to the glorified Jesus Christ.</em></strong> On the other hand, Christ Jesus has been exalted by his Father to a position second only to God, so that “in the name of Jesus every knee should bend of those in heaven and those on earth and those under the ground, and every tongue should openly acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Php 2:9-11</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Da 7:13, 14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/35/1" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> 27</a>.) <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:6</a> also shows that even the angels render obeisance to the resurrected Jesus Christ. Many translations of this text here render <em>pro·sky·neʹo</em> as “worship,” while some render it by such expressions as “bow before” (<em>AT; Yg</em>) and ‘pay homage’ (<em>NE</em>). No matter what English term is used, the original Greek remains the same and the understanding of what it is that the angels render to Christ must accord with the rest of the Scriptures. Jesus himself emphatically stated to Satan that “it is Jehovah your God you must worship [form of <em>pro·sky·neʹo</em>], and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Mt 4:8-10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/37/1" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> Lu 4:7, 8</a>) Similarly, the angel(s) told John to “worship God” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Re 19:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/38/1" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> 22:9</a>), and this injunction came after Jesus’ resurrection and exaltation, showing that matters had not changed in this regard. True, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Psalm 97</a>, which the apostle evidently quotes at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:6</a>, refers to Jehovah God as the object of the ‘bowing down,’ and still this text was applied to Christ Jesus.

On the other hand, the renderings “bow before” and ‘pay homage’ (instead of “worship”) are in no way out of harmony with the original language, either the Hebrew of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Psalm 97:7</a> or the Greek of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003293/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:6</a>, for such translations convey the basic sense of both <em>hish·ta·chawahʹ</em> and <em>pro·sky·neʹo.</em></p>

<strong>Obeisance</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The Greek <em>pro·sky·neʹo</em> corresponds closely with the Hebrew <em>sha·hhahʹ</em> as to conveying the thought of both obeisance to creatures and worship to God or a deity. While the <em>manner</em> of expressing the obeisance is perhaps not so prominent in <em>pro·sky·neʹo</em> as in <em>sha·hhahʹ,</em> where the Hebrew term graphically conveys the thought of prostration or bowing down, some lexicographers suggest that originally the Greek term did emphatically portray this idea. Some scholars would derive the term from the Greek <em>ky·neʹo,</em> “to <span id="page1242" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1242" data-before-text="1242"></span>kiss,” while others would derive it from the Greek word for “dog” <em>kyʹon,</em> and give it the basic meaning of “to crouch, crawl, fawn,” as a dog would at his master’s feet. The derivation thus remains in dispute; however, the usage of the word in the Christian Greek Scriptures (as also in the Greek <em>Septuagint Version</em> of the Hebrew Scriptures) shows that persons to whose actions the term is applied, did, in fact, prostrate themselves or bow down. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Matt. 2:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 18:26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/20/2" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> 28:9</a>) So the latter derivation may fit better than that relating to kissing.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">As with the Hebrew term, the context must be considered to determine whether <em>pro·sky·neʹo</em> refers to obeisance solely in the form of deep respect or obeisance in the form of religious worship. Where reference is directly to God (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">John 4:20-24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 14:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/21/2" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> Rev. 4:10</a>) or to false gods and their idols (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Acts 7:43;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Rev. 9:20</a>), it is evident that the obeisance goes beyond that acceptably or customarily rendered to men and enters the field of worship. So, too, where the object of the obeisance is left unstated, its being directed to God being understood. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">John 12:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Acts 8:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/23/2" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> 24:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/23/3" data-bid="24-4" class="b"> Heb. 11:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/23/4" data-bid="24-5" class="b"> Rev. 11:1</a>) On the other hand, the action of those of the “synagogue of Satan” who are made to “come and do obeisance” before the feet of Christians is clearly not worship.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Rev. 3:9</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Obeisance to a human king is found in Jesus’ illustration at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Matthew 18:26</a>. It is also evident that this was the kind of obeisance the astrologers rendered to the child Jesus, “born king of the Jews,” and also that Herod professed interest in expressing, and that the soldiers mockingly rendered to Jesus before his impalement. They clearly did not view Jesus as God or as a deity. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Matt. 2:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013222/26/2" data-bid="27-3" class="b"> Mark 15:19</a>) While some translators use the word “worship” in the majority of cases where <em>pro·sky·neʹo</em> describes persons’ actions toward Jesus, the evidence does not warrant one’s reading too much into this rendering. Rather, the circumstances that evoked the obeisance correspond very closely with those producing obeisance to the earlier prophets and kings.

As the apostle Paul had written: “Do you not know that we shall judge angels?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970847/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">1 Cor. 6:3</a>) The angel(s) evidently recognized this change of relationship when rejecting John’s obeisance.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">On the other hand, Christ Jesus has been exalted by his Father to a position second only to God, so that “in the name of Jesus every knee should bend of those in heaven and those on earth and those under the ground, and every tongue should openly acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970847/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Phil. 2:9-11</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970847/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Daniel 7:13, 14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970847/31/1" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 27</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">In view of all this, how are we to understand <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970847/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:6</a>, which shows that even the angels render “worship” to the resurrected Jesus Christ? While many translations of this text render <em>pro</em>·<em>sky</em>·<em>néo</em> as “worship,” some render it by such expressions as “bow before” (<em>The Bible​—An American Translation</em>) and “pay homage” (<em>The New English Bible</em>)<em>.</em> No matter what English term is used, the original Greek remains the same and the understanding of what it is that the angels render to Christ must accord with the rest of the Scriptures.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">If the rendering “worship” is preferred, then it must be understood that such “worship” is only of a relative kind. For Jesus himself emphatically stated to Satan that “it is Jehovah your God you must worship [form of <em>pro</em>·<em>sky</em>·<em>ne΄o</em>]<em>,</em> and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970847/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Matt. 4:8-10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970847/33/1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> Luke 4:7, 8</a>) True, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970847/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Psalm 97</a>, which the apostle evidently quotes at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970847/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:6</a>, refers to Jehovah God as the object of the ‘bowing down,’ and still this text was applied to Christ Jesus.

Our worship is to go to Jehovah.” Does this not contradict the statement of</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954369/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Hebrews 1:6</strong></a><strong>?—T. P., United States.</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In reply to the several questions on this point in a few letters received, we ask: Are you an angel of God in heaven? If you are, then <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954369/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:6</a> applies to you.

For example, to which one of the angels did he ever say: ‘You are my Son; today I have become your Father’? And again: ‘I shall be a Father to him, and he will be a Son to me’? [6] But when he again brings his Firstborn into the inhabited earth, he says: ‘And let all God’s angels worship him.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954369/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Heb. 1:4-6</a>, <em>NW</em>) Here the apostle Paul quotes from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954369/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 97:7</a>, which, in the words of <em>An American Translation,</em> reads: “All who serve wrought images are put to shame, they who prided themselves on their nonentities. <em>Worship him, all you gods!”</em> In the Greek <em>Septuagint Version</em> (<em>LXX</em>) these italicized words read: “Worship [<em>pros·ky·neʹo</em>] him, all ye his angels.” (Bagster’s edition; also <em>Thomson</em>) The apostle may also have been quoting from the <em>Septuagint Version</em> of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954369/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:43</a>, the opening part of which reads: “Rejoice, ye heavens, with him, <em>and let all the angels of God worship him;</em> rejoice ye Gentiles, with his people, and let all the sons of God strengthen themselves in him; . . .” (<em>Bagster;</em> similarly <em>Thomson</em>) By examining the context of both <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954369/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 97:7 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954369/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Deuteronomy 32:43</a> we note that the reference is to Jehovah God as the one to be worshiped. Does this mean that Jesus is the same as Jehovah because of how the writer of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954369/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:6</a> applies the quotation?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In translating <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954369/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:6</a> <em>An American Translation</em> does not follow its rendering of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954369/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 97:7</a> and use “worship” but says: “And let all God’s angels bow before him.” The <em>New World Translation</em> says: “And let all God’s angels worship him.” Is the <em>New World Translation</em> inferior here, or has it violated its general rule of endeavoring as far as possible to render each Greek word of the Christian Greek Scriptures by one English equivalent? The answer to these questions is No! What, then, is the reason for its saying “worship” instead of “bow down” or “do obeisance”?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">As already stated in the above-mentioned <em>Watchtower</em> article the Greek word here rendered “worship” is the word <em>pros·ky·neʹo.</em> Strange as it may seem, this word is drawn from the Greek word for “dog,” <em>kýōn,</em> and hence means, properly, “to crouch, crawl, fawn,” as a dog would at his master’s feet. Practically applied, therefore, the word basically means “to prostrate oneself, to bow down, to do obeisance.” And in the lands of the Bible this was the proper attitude both of civil veneration and homage and also of religious worship. This appears from the Bible, both in the Hebrew original text and in the Greek.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In the King James or Authorized Version of the Bible <em>pros·ky·neʹo</em> is, without exception, in its 60 occurences, rendered “worship.” However, in the <em>New World Translation pros·ky·neʹo</em> is rendered “do obeisance” and “worship.” For example, the magi from the east and King Herod said they wanted to “do obeisance to” (<em>pros·ky·neʹo</em>) the babe that had been born king of the Jews. “Do obeisance” is preferable here because neither the magi nor King Herod meant to worship the babe as God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954369/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 2:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954369/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954369/12/2" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> 11</a>) <em>Pros·ky·neʹo</em> is properly rendered “do obeisance” at times, because often in the Greek Septuagint Version of the Bible the action of this verb is directed to men; for example, where the patriarch Abraham bowed down (<em>pros·ky·neʹo</em>) to the pagan natives of Canaanland, the Hittites, the sons of Heth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954369/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Gen. 23:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954369/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 12</a>, <em>LXX</em>) Or, as when the patriarch Jacob and his wives and his children all bowed down repeatedly (<em>pros·ky·neʹo</em>) to his twin-brother Esau, whom Jehovah God said He hated. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954369/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Gen. 33:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954369/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 6, 7</a>, <em>LXX</em>) Or, as when Emperor Nebuchadnezzar bowed down (<em>pros·ky·neʹo</em>) to the prophet Daniel.

How could that affect us today in this age of hydrogen bombs and nuclear warfare? We humans should not think that all that is too far in the past to be of any concern or value to us today. Nineteen centuries ago seems like long, long ago to us, but to the beginningless, endless Jehovah God, to whom a thousand of our years are as but one day, nineteen hundred years ago is as less than two days ago. More than ever the actions of all the nations since the year 1914 call for the settling of the supreme issue, the vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty over earth as well as heaven.

That kingdom was born in the heavens in 1914 in fulfillment of Jehovah’s oath to David’s Lord. By that year Jesus had sat through the appointed period of time at his heavenly Father’s right hand. So in 1914 the time had come for Jehovah to begin making Christ’s enemies the stool for his feet. The time had come for Jehovah to send the rod of Christ’s strength out of heavenly Zion with the command: “Go subduing in the midst of your enemies.” At the exact time in 1914 Jehovah God faithfully did those things. His kingdom by Christ is now in action. Because of its action Satan the Devil and all his demons now find themselves hurled down and confined to the neighborhood of this earth to await the not-far-off time when Jehovah himself, at his anointed King’s right hand, will break the enemy kings of the earth to pieces on the day for vindicating his universal sovereignty.</p><p id="p92" data-pid="92" class="qu">32.

Say among the nations: ‘Jehovah himself has become king.’” And the very next psalm tells the peoples in lands great and small to be glad because Jehovah has brought his royal government to birth, saying: “Jehovah himself has become king! Let the earth be joyful. Let the many islands rejoice. For you, O Jehovah, are the Most High over all the earth; you have made your ascent very high over all other gods.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Ps. 97:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/51/1" data-bid="52-2" class="b"> 9</a>) Wise, indeed, we are if we rejoice in faith over the establishment of God’s kingdom rather than sorrow over the coming overthrow of the kingdoms of this wicked world.</p><p id="p93" data-pid="93" class="qu">33.

Your kingship is a kingship of all times indefinite, <span id="page635" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="635" data-before-text="635"></span>and your dominion is throughout all successive generations.” This talking about the glory of Jehovah’s kingship by all the many means of preaching has not been in vain. Already hundreds of thousands of the sons of men to whom the glory of the splendor of Jehovah’s kingship has been made known in more than a hundred languages have believed and accepted the Kingdom message and are rejoicing in it. More than that, they are acting upon it in fulfillment of the psalmist’s prayer: “The praise of Jehovah my mouth will speak, and let all flesh bless his holy name to time indefinite, even forever.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Ps. 145:21</a>) They too have become Kingdom witnesses of Jehovah.</p>

His all-seeing eyes range through the whole earth to locate those who are devoted to him that he might show his strength in their behalf. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951204/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Chron. 16:9</a>) What a God he is! Before him all the false gods must shortly bow in defeat at Armageddon. “For Jehovah is a great God, and a great King above all gods.” He is to be feared, rather than the totalitarian aggressors bent on world conquest for enthroning their political gods and form of religion everywhere. “For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods.” Those who make him their refuge and who trust in his strength credit him with godship and say: “For thou, Jehovah, art most high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951204/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Pss. 95:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951204/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 96:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951204/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 97:9</a>, <em>AS</em>) Because he supplies secret strength to his witnesses, they have been able to endure the most determined and fiendish persecution from human agents of the false gods. Greedy dictators craving world empire have punished those who would not join in idolizing them. But when these dictators went down, Jehovah’s witnesses have lived on and have found fresh strength to renew their witnessing to the “God of gods”. Today they gratefully exclaim: “Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; for his lovingkindness endureth for ever. Oh give thanks unto the God of gods; for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951204/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 136:1, 2</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>“A VERY PRESENT HELP”</strong></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="qu"> 5, 6.

Why will God not answer such prayers?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[27]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> It appears to be human nature for people, when helpless in trouble, to appeal to their gods for aid and deliverance. For instance, in spite of the 1950 Holy Year, the world’s difficulties worsened to an alarming degree. So the pope of Vatican City in his encyclical of December 6 called on the Catholic world to engage in a novena of prayer for peace. Addressing the college of cardinals five days later, the pope called for a “general accord of intentions of all human hearts which, with the aid of God, may cause all the dangers which are threatening peace to disappear throughout the world”. (N. Y. <em>Times,</em> Dec. 12, 1950) But prayers to God are vain the intentions of which are contrary to his will. As <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951204/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">James 4:2, 3</a> (<em>Dy</em>) says: “You contend and war, and you have not, because you ask not. You ask, and receive not; because you ask amiss: that you may consume it on your concupiscences.” It is not God’s will at this time to establish world peace in order for the nations to return to normal. If he restored peace, the nations would only consume its benefits upon their concupiscences and selfish desires, showing they are “lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God”.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[27]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> The timetables of God’s Word set this period down as a time marked for international troubles, when there would be “on the earth anguish of nations, not knowing <span id="page178" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="178" data-before-text="178"></span>the way out because of the roaring of the sea and its agitation, while men become faint out of fear and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth”. For Christendom it was to be a time when “we looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health [by means of holy years, etc.], and behold trouble!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951204/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 21:25, 26</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951204/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Jer. 8:15</a>) This is not the time for God to make peace for the nations of this world. So the efforts of the pope and his hierarchy to try their hand and pose as a mediator between the communist bloc and the democratic bloc will prove unavailing. Neither Catholics nor Protestants need expect help from God through them.</p>

The psalmist tells us: “He is guarding the lives of his loyal ones; he rescues them from the hand of the wicked.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002053/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Psalm 97:10</a>) Consider his dealings with the nation of Israel. After their miraculous deliverance through the Red Sea, the Israelites proclaimed in song to Jehovah: “In your loyal love you have led the people whom you have redeemed.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002053/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Exodus 15:13</a>) The deliverance at the Red Sea certainly was an act of loyal love on Jehovah’s part. Moses therefore told the Israelites: “It was not because you were the most numerous of all the peoples that Jehovah showed affection for you and chose you, for you were the smallest of all the peoples. Rather, it was because of Jehovah’s love for you and because he kept the oath that he had sworn to your forefathers that Jehovah brought you out with a mighty hand, to redeem you from the house of slavery, from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002053/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 7:7, 8</a>.</p>

<strong>How Can We Show Our Love for Jehovah?</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3">Have you felt closer to God since you began studying the Bible? Would you like to continue to strengthen your friendship with him? If so, remember that the more Jehovah sees your love for him grow, the more he will love and care for you. How can you show him that you love him?</p><h3 class="du-color--turquoise-700 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>1.

Instead, he gives each of us the opportunity to choose whether we will obey him or not. Why? Jehovah wants us to be <strong>“obedient from the heart.”</strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021234/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Romans 6:17</a>) In other words, he wants you to obey him, not because you have to, but because you love him. <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1102021234/0">Sections 3</a> and <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1102021234/1">4</a> of this book are designed to help you show your love for Jehovah by doing what pleases him and avoiding what displeases him.</p><h3 class="du-color--turquoise-700 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Why can it be challenging to show our love for Jehovah?</strong></h3><p id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>“Many are the hardships of the righteous one.”</strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021234/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 34:19</a>) We all struggle with our own imperfections. And we may also face economic problems, injustice, and other difficulties. When we experience hardships, we may not find it easy to do what Jehovah asks of us. That is because the wrong path may be easier to follow. But when you faithfully do what Jehovah tells you to, you show that you love him more than anything else. And you prove that you are loyal to him. In turn, he will be loyal to you.

By thinking about the consequences! “Do not be misled: God is not one to be mocked. For whatever a man is sowing, this he will also reap; because he who is sowing with a view to his flesh will reap corruption from his flesh.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993284/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Galatians 6:7, 8</a>) When tempted to give in to passion, think of what is of greater consequence​—how this would hurt Jehovah God. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993284/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Psalm 78:41</a>.) Think, too, about the possibility of an unwanted pregnancy or of contracting a disease, such as AIDS. Consider the emotional devastation and loss of self-respect you would suffer. There may also be long-term consequences. One Christian woman admits: “My husband and I had sex relations before we met each other. Although we are both Christians today, our past sex life is a source of contention and jealousy in our marriage.” Not to be overlooked, either, is the loss of your theocratic privileges or the possibility of being expelled from the Christian congregation!

<strong>In What Ways Can We “Become Imitators of God”?</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Still another way in which we can “become imitators of God,” and thus prove ourselves perfect as He is perfect, is by hating what God hates. What does he hate? He tells us: “I, Jehovah, am . . . hating robbery along with unrighteousness.” “There are six things that Jehovah does hate; yes, seven are things detestable to his soul: lofty eyes, a false tongue, and hands that are shedding innocent blood, a heart fabricating hurtful schemes, feet that are in a hurry to run to badness, a false witness that launches forth lies, and anyone sending forth contentions among brothers.” Also, the Bible encourages: “You lovers of Jehovah, hate what is bad.” “Abhor what is wicked.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974166/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isa. 61:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974166/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Prov. 6:16-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974166/17/2" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> Ps. 97:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974166/17/3" data-bid="18-4" class="b"> Rom. 12:9</a>.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">15.

Therefore, it is absolutely necessary that we regard what is bad with detestation. How can we do this?</p>

A Christian’s hatred of such things is demonstrated by his zeal to tell others what God’s Word says about the time when God’s kingdom will be the only government ruling this earth. Godly hatred is further characterized by a feeling of contempt toward such things as lying, stealing, immorality.

<strong>True Repentance—How Can We Identify It?</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">But repentance (Gr. <em>me·taʹnoi·a</em>) also involves a ‘change of mind’ or ‘change of will.’ To be genuine, it must include a positive rejection of the bad course as repugnant, something hated. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972524/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ps. 97:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972524/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Rom. 12:9</a>) This is paralleled by a love of righteousness that causes the repentant Christian to determine firmly to hold to a righteous course thenceforth. Without both this hatred of bad and love of righteousness there would be no real force to our repentance, no following through with what the apostle Paul called “works that befit repentance.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972524/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Acts 26:20</a>) King Rehoboam’s case illustrates this.

<strong>When Hate Is Folly</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Fittingly, God’s Word counsels us to hate what God hates: “O you lovers of Jehovah, hate what is bad.” The Scriptures quote with approval what King David of ancient Israel said: “Do I not hate those who are intensely hating you, O Jehovah? . . . With a complete hatred I do hate them.” Does this mean that we should react violently toward those who practice bad things? No; the Bible counsels us not to get heated up at injustices and not to render evil for evil.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101972680/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 97:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101972680/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 139:21, 22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101972680/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Rom. 12:17-21</a>.</p>

<strong>Why Christians Seek to Avoid Loose Conduct</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Loose conduct is also stupid in that it can cause friction between mates. Flirting, for example, has been termed ‘the game that can disrupt marriage.’ The very fact that it can arouse jealousy and so disrupt a marriage proves that it is not an innocent game. For married persons to flirt with others is as foolish as it is wrong and might be said to be diluting the fine wine of marriage with water. The more loyal a married couple are to each other the sweeter their own joys will be. Not only that, but the stronger will be the marriage bond and the more moral support each will be able to give to the other when most needed, as when a serious mistake <span id="page477" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="477" data-before-text="477"></span>is made, or as when adversity strikes in the form of sudden illness, accident, unemployment, and so forth. Such couples are putting money in a bank, as it were, for a rainy day, but flirting or philandering mates are squandering their capital and may find themselves without needed emotional support in times of stress.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">And then, loose conduct is also stupid because of the harm it does to ourselves directly. For one thing indulging in loose conduct causes a loss of self-respect and tends to make one careless in regard to other matters and so causes a loss of spirituality. And loose conduct is not without deleterious effects upon the mind and body, although there is some dispute among those engaged in the healing arts as to the extent to which this is so. Among the ills that various ones have attributed to loose conduct are mental illness, tumors and prostatic disorders. Truly as the Bible says, one carrying on loose conduct is stupid. He disrupts his relationship with his Creator, weakens ties with his marriage mate and does harm to his own mind and body.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>STRENGTHENING OURSELVES AGAINST LOOSE CONDUCT</strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">How can we strengthen ourselves against loose conduct? First of all, by getting God’s mind on the subject. We must keep telling ourselves that, regardless of how pleasurable or exciting or thrilling loose conduct is to the senses, it is wrong, it is bad, it is wicked. And what does God’s Word tell us should be our attitude toward what is bad? “O you lovers of Jehovah, hate what is bad.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968567/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 97:10</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">We must not only love what is right, pure and good, but we must actually <em>hate</em> what is bad if we would protect ourselves from it. How do we show that we hate what is bad? First of all, by dismissing it from our minds; by not dwelling upon it as something desirable. That means we must guard our minds and hearts, even as we are told: “More than all else that is to be guarded, safeguard your heart, for out of it are the sources of life.” Yes, as Jesus so forcefully showed, loose conduct begins in the heart: “That which issues forth out of a man is what defiles a man; for . . . out of the heart of men, injurious reasonings issue forth: fornications, . . . adulteries, . . . loose conduct.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968567/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Prov. 4:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968567/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Mark 7:20-23</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">A practical aid in our fight against loose conduct is substitution. Replace dwelling on sensuous things with thinking on ‘whatever things are true, of serious concern, righteous, chaste, lovable, well spoken of, virtuous and praiseworthy.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968567/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Phil. 4:8</a>) Yes, “quit being fashioned after this system of things,” with its emphasis on sensual pleasure, “but be transformed by making your mind over.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968567/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Rom. 12:2</a>) That means to “strip off the old personality with its practices,” such as “fornication, uncleanness, sexual appetite,” and “clothe yourselves with the new personality, which through accurate knowledge is being made new according to the image of the One who created it.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968567/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Col. 3:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968567/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 9, 10</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Replace bad associations that spoil useful habits with Christian associations that strengthen good habits.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968567/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Eph. 5:3, 4</a>) Replace watching sexy motion pictures and TV programs with watching those that are wholesome and educational. If such kind are not available, then why not do without? Better none at all than the kind that tears you down, tends to demoralize you. Christians for almost two thousand years have enjoyed life without such modern forms of entertainment. They are not indispensable to contentment, happiness or peace of mind. Far better to visit with <span id="page478" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="478" data-before-text="478"></span>some Christian friends in their homes than to associate with fornicators, adulterers, murderers and perverts by means of motion pictures or the TV set!</p>

<strong>Do Bible Principles Govern Your Choice of Entertainment?</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Why would a person that had escaped from the immoral cesspool of the world and transformed his life by the application of Scriptural principles choose as entertainment that which dramatized the worst aspects of the world—the very things he had rejected on becoming a Christian? Filling one’s mind with such corrupting thoughts would indicate that one did not <span id="page692" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="692" data-before-text="692"></span>fully appreciate the importance of being made new in the force actuating the mind in order to put on the new personality that conforms to God’s righteous will. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965843/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eph. 4:22-24</a>) It would not be consistent for a Christian to amuse himself by watching plays that portrayed before his eyes conduct in which Bible principles did not permit him to engage.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965843/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965843/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 4:3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">In the Bible at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965843/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 97:10</a> the command is given: “You lovers of Jehovah, hate what is bad.” If a Christian hated what is bad, he would not want to watch it as entertainment, would he? If he wholeheartedly turned his back on the moral badness of the world when he became a Christian, he would not crave entertainment that paraded that badness, unveiling it in revolting detail, would he? At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965843/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:3</a> we are told: “Let fornication and uncleanness of every kind or greediness not even be mentioned among you, just as it befits holy people.” If such things were not even to be mentioned as a topic of conversation, how could they be taken in through the ear and the eye as entertainment?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>CHRISTIANS TODAY</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The principles that guided Christians in the first century of the Common Era are the same principles that should guide Christians today. Although entertainment today does not include the amphitheater where real life-and-death battles are fought, it does include “sports” in which men brutally beat each other and dramas that depict bloodshed in a very realistic way. There are also dramas that highlight the depravity in twentieth-century life. So a Christian today, because of Bible principles, has to be just as selective about his entertainment as were the early Christians.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Programs presented on TV, for example, have frequently been condemned for their excessive brutality and violence. In the United States the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency stated: “The extent to which violence and crime are currently portrayed on the nation’s television screens is clearly excessive.” On TV and in motion-picture houses viewers get a far closer view of violence than the Romans ever had from their amphitheater seats.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The sordid movies that the motion-picture industry turns out in many countries often center on sexual depravity, which can hardly be regarded as wholesome entertainment as far as a Christian is concerned. In view of Bible principles, what enjoyment can he get from seeing adultery, rape, homosexuality and other immoral themes paraded before his eyes? What pleasure can he find in seeing the brutality of the criminal underworld and the vivid details of how crimes are executed?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">When a Christian turns from movies and TV to the field of literature, how can his good principles permit him to find entertainment in stories that drag a reader’s mind into the moral cesspool of the world and make heroes of persons who are immoral, cruel, sadistic and violent? Will he, as if he had no moral standards at all, allow the author for hours at a time to pour corruption into his mind? Not if Bible principles guide him.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Some movies, TV programs, books and magazines are informative and refreshing, but you need to be selective. It is true that, on occasion, you may not be the one who chooses the entertainment; someone else may invite you to go along. But before you accept the invitation, you can always inquire what is planned. You do not have to ignore Bible principles simply because others do.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The types of entertainment available are many. There is much that is wholesome. There are outdoor and indoor games in <span id="page693" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="693" data-before-text="693"></span>which the entire family can share. What about playing Bible games with your family, or sharing a song fest together? Or you might enjoy making a trip into the woods or hills together to enjoy the marvels of creation. These are activities that refresh while at the same time drawing you closer to the ones you love.</p>

Jehovah does: “I, Jehovah, am loving justice, hating . . . unrighteousness.” And of Jesus it was written: “You have loved righteousness and you hate wickedness.” So we are commanded: <span id="page110" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="110" data-before-text="110"></span>“O you lovers of Jehovah, hate what is bad.” “Abhor what is wicked, cling to what is good.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Isa. 61:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Ps. 45:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/23/2" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> 97:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/23/3" data-bid="24-4" class="b"> Rom. 12:9</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[68]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"><sup>27</sup></span> We all must be careful that we keep on walking with God by exercising justice, not only loving what is right, but also hating what is bad, what is wicked. At times what is bad may be very temptingly presented to us, even as was the forbidden fruit to Eve; and so unless we have cultivated a loathing for what is bad, an abhorrence and hatred for it, in a moment of weakness we may succumb to temptation, to our lasting shame and regret. No one may take for granted that because of his many years as a dedicated Christian he has a firm position. Not even the apostle Paul had such confidence in himself!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Cor. 9:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 10:12</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[68]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="28"><sup>28</sup></span> We know what our individual weaknesses are. We may not pamper ourselves but must manifest a righteous zeal in opposing them at all times. If love of money is our chief weakness, we dare not indulge in sharp practices, for sooner or later we will go too far and come in for punishment. If we are fond of alcoholic beverages to the extent of not being able to control that fondness, we must exercise a tight rein when in the presence of those indulging in them, preferably staying away from such places, or we may bring dishonor to the Christian congregation and deserve to be chastised. If our weakness is along the lines of sex, whether married or single, then we must wage a strong fight against that weakness, avoiding unclean thoughts, pornographic literature and sensual moving pictures. Remember, “there is nothing . . . secret that will not become known.” We must keep “bringing every thought into captivity to make it obedient to the Christ.” We must ‘keep ourselves clean as carriers of Jehovah’s utensils’ if we would keep on walking with God, ‘exercising justice.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Matt. 10:26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 10:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/25/2" data-bid="26-3" class="b"> Isa. 52:11</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="ss"><strong>“LOVE KINDNESS”</strong></p><p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="qu">29.

The Hebrew word here rendered “kindness” is the same that is elsewhere translated “loving-kindness.” Time and again we read of Jehovah’s loving-kindness. “How precious your loving-kindness is, O God!” “I am Jehovah, the One exercising loving-kindness.” “It is the acts of loving-kindness of Jehovah that we have not come to our finish, because his mercies will certainly not come to an end. They are new each morning. Your faithfulness is abundant.” “Jehovah is very tender in affection and merciful.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ps. 36:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> Jer. 9:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/27/2" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> Lam. 3:22, 23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/27/3" data-bid="28-4" class="b"> Jas. 5:11</a>.</p><p id="p70" data-pid="70" class="qu">30.

Loving-kindness will make us understanding, considerate, gentle and helpful. To be kind we must have empathy. Empathy goes farther than sympathy, for in empathy we put ourselves in the other’s place, we actually feel what he feels. Jehovah God, great as he is, is not beyond exercising empathy regarding his creatures. He not only has pity, compassion, sympathy for us, remembering that we are but dust, but he puts himself in our place so that what hurts us hurts him. Thus we read regarding his nation of Israel: “During all their distress it was distressing to him.” Yes, when they suffered, he suffered.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Isa. 63:9</a>.</p><p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="qu">31.

And once becoming a follower of Jesus Christ himself, Paul also imitated his Master in this matter of empathy. He put himself in the others’ place, that he might win them to Christ: To the Jew he became as a Jew, to those under the law, as under the law, to those without the law, as without law. “To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to people of all sorts . . . for the sake of the good news.” And once these had become his brothers Paul continued to manifest empathy: “Who is weak, and I am not weak?

And even on the menservants and on the maidservants in those days I shall pour out my spirit.” Jesus’ disciples saw the holy spirit, in the form of tongues as if of fire, resting on the heads of all of them​—about 120 men and women—​assembled in Jerusalem.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 1:12-15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 2:1-4</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Also on the day of Pentecost, the disciples first understood that the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 16:10</a> applied to the resurrected Jesus Christ. The psalmist had said: “You [Jehovah God] will not leave my soul in Sheol. You will not allow your loyal one to see the pit.” The disciples realized that those words could not have applied to King David, for his tomb was with them until that day. No wonder about 3,000 of those who heard this new light explained were so convinced that they got baptized that very day!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 2:14-41</a>.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 7.

It is noteworthy that this was the only time that the holy spirit was given before baptism. But it had to be that way. Otherwise, Peter would not have known that these uncircumcised Gentiles were qualified for baptism. Fully appreciating the significance of this phenomenon, Peter asked: “Can anyone forbid water so that these [Gentiles] might not be baptized who have received the holy spirit even as we have?” Of course, nobody present could rightly object, and the baptism of <span id="page12" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>these Gentiles therefore took place.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Acts 10:44-48</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 8:14-17</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>No More Circumcision</strong></p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 8.

The practice of circumcision had its beginning in 1919 B.C.E. with Jehovah’s covenant with Abraham. God then commanded Abraham that he and all other males of his household were to get circumcised. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Genesis 17:9-14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 23-27</a>) So circumcision became an identifying mark of the descendants of Abraham. And how proud they were of this practice! As a result, “uncircumcised” came to be a term of contempt. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Isaiah 52:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 1 Samuel 17:26, 27</a>) It is easy to see why certain early Jewish Christians wanted to retain this symbol. Some of them had quite a discussion with Paul and Barnabas about this matter. To settle it, Paul and others went to Jerusalem to consult the Christian governing body.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Acts 15:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 9.

Rather, they received that increased light by searching the Scriptures, looking to the holy spirit for guidance, and hearing the experiences of Peter and Paul regarding the conversion of uncircumcised Gentiles. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Acts 15:6-21</a>) The decision was issued in a letter that read in part: “The holy spirit and we ourselves have favored adding no further burden to you, except these necessary things, to keep abstaining from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Acts 15:28, 29</a>) The early Christians were thus set free from the command to practice circumcision and from the other requirements of the Mosaic Law.

Comparatively few of the first-century Christians had personally heard Jesus expound his teachings. In particular, Matthew’s Gospel emphasized that the theme of Jesus’ preaching was the Kingdom. And how strongly Jesus had stressed the importance of having the right motive! What flashes of light there were in his Sermon on the Mount, in his parables (such as those recorded in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Mt chapter 13</a>), and in his great prophecy in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Mt chapters 24 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 25</a>!

While much of it is similar to Matthew’s account, 59 percent is additional. Luke recorded six of Jesus’ miracles and more than twice that many of His illustrations not mentioned by the other Gospel writers. Apparently just a few years later, Mark wrote his Gospel, placing emphasis on Jesus Christ as a man of action, a miracle worker. While Mark mostly related events previously covered by Matthew and Luke, he did record one parable <span id="page13" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>that they did not. In that illustration, Jesus likened the Kingdom of God to seed that sprouts, grows tall, and bears fruit gradually.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1995363/0">a</a>​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Mark 4:26-29</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">12.

Only John provides the account of Lazarus’ resurrection, and he alone gives us many of Jesus’ fine remarks to his faithful apostles as well as his heartwarming prayer on the night of his betrayal, as recorded in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Joh chapters 13 to 17</a>.

For instance, there is Paul’s letter to the Romans, written about 56 C.E.​—approximately the same time that Luke wrote his Gospel. In this letter Paul highlights the fact that righteousness is imputed as a result of God’s undeserved kindness and through faith in Jesus Christ. Paul’s emphasis on this aspect of the good news has caused some to view his letter to the Romans as if it were a fifth Gospel.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">14-16.

His letter to the Corinthians includes much inspired counsel that has benefited Christians down to our day. To begin with, he had to enlighten the Corinthians as to the mistake they were making in forming personality cults around certain individuals. The apostle set them straight, boldly telling them: “I exhort you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you should all speak in agreement, and that there should not be divisions among you, but that you may be fitly united in the same mind and in the same line of thought.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 1:10-15</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> Gross immorality was being tolerated in the Christian congregation at Corinth. A man there had taken his father’s wife, thus practicing ‘such fornication as was not found even among the nations.’ Plainly, Paul wrote: “Remove the wicked man from among yourselves.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 5:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 11-13</a>) That was something new for the Christian congregation​—disfellowshipping. Another matter on which the Corinthian congregation needed enlightenment had to do with the fact that some of its members were taking their spiritual brothers to worldly courts in order to settle grievances. Paul strongly rebuked them for doing this.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:5-8</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span id="page14" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Still another matter that plagued the congregation in Corinth had to do with sex relations. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">1 Corinthians chapter 7</a>, Paul showed that because of the prevalence of sexual immorality, it would be good for every man to have his own wife and every woman her own husband. Paul also showed that while single persons are able to serve Jehovah with less distraction, not all had the gift of singleness. And if a woman’s husband should die, she would be free to get married again but “only in the Lord.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:39</a>.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">17.

With what sort of body will anointed Christians be raised? “It is sown a physical body, it is raised up a spiritual body,” wrote Paul. No fleshly bodies will be taken to heaven, for “flesh and blood cannot inherit God’s kingdom.” Paul added that not all anointed ones will sleep in death but that during Jesus’ presence some will be raised to immortal life instantly at death.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:43-53</a>.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">18.

Jehovah’s day would come as a thief in the night. Paul also explained: “Whenever it is that they are saying: ‘Peace and security!’ then sudden destruction is to be instantly upon them just as the pang of distress upon a pregnant woman; and they will by no means escape.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 5:2, 3</a>.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">19, 20.

How powerfully he showed the superiority of the Christian system of worship over the Mosaic system of worship! Instead of following the Law transmitted by angels, Christians have faith in a salvation first spoken of by God’s Son, who is far superior to such angelic messengers. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Hebrews 2:2-4</a>) Moses was a mere attendant in the house of God. However, Jesus Christ presides over the entire house. Christ is a high priest after the order of Melchizedek, having a position far superior to the Aaronic priesthood. Paul also pointed out that the Israelites were unable to enter into God’s rest because of a lack of faith and obedience, but Christians enter into it because of their faithfulness and obedience.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Hebrews 3:1–4:11</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> Then, too, the new covenant is far superior to the Law covenant. As prophesied 600 years earlier at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, those in the new covenant have God’s law written in their hearts and enjoy true forgiveness of sins. Instead of having a high priest who had to offer sacrifices yearly for his own sins and those of the people, Christians have as their High Priest Jesus Christ, who is without sin and who once and for all offered a sacrifice for sins. Instead of entering a holy place made by hands to present his offering, he entered <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>heaven itself, there to appear before the person of Jehovah. Moreover, animal sacrifices under the Mosaic Law covenant could not completely take away sins, or they would not have been offered annually. But Christ’s sacrifice, offered once for all time, does take away sins. All of this sheds light on the great spiritual temple, in the courtyards of which the anointed remnant and the “other sheep” serve today.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">John 10:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995363/35/1" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> Hebrews 9:24-28</a>.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">21.

They took this scripture to mean that if a Christian was drafted in wartime, he would be obligated to put on a uniform, shoulder a gun, and go to the front, to the trenches. It was felt that since a Christian could not kill a fellow human, he would be compelled to <span id="page22" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>fire his gun into the air if worst came to worst.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1995365/0">a</a></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> <em>The Watchtower</em> of November 15 and of December 1, 1962, shed clear light on the subject in discussing Jesus’ words at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995365/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 22:21</a>: “Pay back . . .

To get away from the hierarchical structure prevalent in Christendom, it was concluded that these should be elected democratically by the vote of the members of each congregation.

In 1971 another flash of light showed that each congregation was not to be directed by just one congregation servant. Rather, each should have a body of elders, or overseers, assigned by the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses. So by the increasing light over some 40 years, it became evident that elders as well as deacons, now known as ministerial servants, should be appointed by “the faithful and discreet slave,” through its Governing Body. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995365/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45-47</a>) This was in line with what took place in apostolic times.

For many years the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses was synonymous with the board of directors of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, and matters were largely in the hands of its president. As shown in the <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1995365/0/0"><em>1977 Yearbook of Jehovah’s</em> <span id="page23" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span><em>Witnesses</em> (pages 258-9)</a>, in 1976 the Governing Body began to function with six committees, each assigned to care for certain aspects of the worldwide work. The Personnel Committee deals with personnel matters, including the interests of all who serve in the worldwide Bethel family. The Publishing Committee handles all secular and legal matters, such as property and printing. The Service Committee concerns itself with the witness work and supervises traveling overseers, pioneers, and the activities of congregation publishers. The Teaching Committee is responsible for congregation meetings, special assembly days, circuit assemblies, and district and international conventions as well as the various schools for the spiritual education of God’s people. The Writing Committee supervises the preparation and translation of publications in all forms, making sure that everything is in line with the Scriptures. The Chairman’s Committee cares for emergencies and other urgent matters.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1995365/1">b</a> Also in the 1970’s, branch offices of the Watch Tower Society began to be directed by a committee instead of an overseer.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>Light Relating to Christian Conduct</strong></p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 9.

For instance, consider the matter of neutrality. A particularly bright flash of light beamed forth on this subject in the article “Neutrality” appearing in <em>The Watchtower</em> of November 1, 1939. How timely it was, coming just after the beginning of World War II! The article defined neutrality and showed that Christians must not get involved in political affairs or confrontations between nations. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995365/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Micah 4:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995365/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995365/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> John 17:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995365/10/3" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 16</a>) This is a factor in their being hated by all the nations.

Some Bible Students thought that the prohibition against the eating of blood, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995365/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Acts 15:28, 29</a>, was limited to Jewish Christians. However, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995365/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 21:25</a> shows that in apostolic times this command was also applied to those of the nations who became believers. So the sanctity of blood applies to all Christians, as shown in <em>The Watchtower</em> of July 1, 1945. That means not just refusing to eat animal blood, as in blood sausage, but also abstaining from human blood, as in the case of blood transfusions.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">11.

An example of this was in connection with the use of tobacco. In <em>Zion’s Watch Tower</em> of August 1, 1895, Brother Russell directed attention to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995365/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:31</a> and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995365/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 7:1</a> and wrote: “I cannot see how it would be to God’s glory, or to his own profit, for any Christian to use tobacco in any form.” Since 1973 it has been clearly understood that no tobacco user can be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. In 1976 it was clarified that no Witness could be employed in a gambling establishment and remain in the congregation.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><span id="page24" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span><strong>Other Refinements</strong></p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">12.

The Bible Students held that Peter received two keys that opened up the way for people to become Kingdom heirs​—one for the Jews, used at Pentecost 33 C.E., and the other for the Gentiles, used first in 36 C.E. when Peter preached to Cornelius.

For example, among the Bible Students, one of the most beloved publications was volume one of <em>Studies in the Scriptures,</em> entitled <em>The Divine Plan of the Ages.</em> However, in time, it was realized <span id="page25" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>that God’s Word speaks only of humans as making plans. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995365/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Proverbs 19:21</a>) The Scriptures never speak of Jehovah as planning. He does not need to plan. Whatever he purposes is sure to succeed because of his infinite wisdom and power, even as we read at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995365/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ephesians 1:9, 10</a>: “It is according to his good pleasure which he purposed in himself for an administration at the full limit of the appointed times.” So it was gradually seen that the term “purpose” is the more appropriate one when referring to Jehovah.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">16. What was gradually seen to be the correct understanding of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995365/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Luke 2:14</a>?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Then there was the matter of getting a clearer understanding of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995365/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Luke 2:14</a>. According to the <em>King James Version,</em> it reads: “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.” It was seen that this did not express the correct thought, for God’s goodwill is not expressed toward the wicked. The Witnesses therefore viewed this as a matter of peace to men who were of goodwill toward God. So they kept referring to those interested in the Bible as persons of goodwill. But then it was understood that what was involved was goodwill, not on the part of men, but on the part of God. Thus, the <em>New World Translation</em> footnote on <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995365/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Luke 2:14</a> speaks of “men whom he [God] approves.” All Christians who are living up to their vow of dedication have God’s goodwill.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">17, 18.

But had Satan called Jehovah’s name into question? For that matter, had any of Satan’s agents done so, as if Jehovah did not have a right to that name? No, not at all. It was not the name of Jehovah that was challenged and that needed to be vindicated. That is why the Watch Tower Society’s recent publications do not speak of Jehovah’s <em>name</em> as being <em>vindicated.</em> They speak of Jehovah’s <em>sovereignty</em> as being <em>vindicated</em> and of his <em>name</em> as being <em>sanctified.</em> This is in keeping with what Jesus told us to pray: “Let your <em>name</em> be <em>sanctified.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995365/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9</a>) Time and again, Jehovah said that he was going to sanctify his name, which the Israelites had not challenged but had profaned.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995365/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ezekiel 20:9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995365/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995365/28/2" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> 22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995365/28/3" data-bid="29-4" class="b"> 36:23</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Interestingly, in 1971, the book <em>“The Nations Shall Know That I Am Jehovah”​—How?</em> made this distinction: “Jesus Christ fights . . . for the vindication of Jehovah’s universal Sovereignty and for the glorification of Jehovah’s name.” (Pages 364-5) In 1973, <em>God’s Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached</em> said: “The coming ‘great tribulation’ is the time for Almighty God Jehovah to vindicate his universal sovereignty and to sanctify his worthy name.” (Page 409) Then, in 1975, <em>Man’s Salvation Out Of World Distress at Hand!</em> stated: “The greatest event of universal history will then have been accomplished, the vindication of Jehovah’s universal sovereignty and the sanctification of his sacred name.”​—Page 281.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">19, 20.

After a while he is able to tell that it is a wooden, not a brick, house. Then, later, he can make out the color of the house, and so forth.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="qu"> 3.

In such situations we may well have been influenced by previously held views. But as the light gets brighter and we draw much closer to events, then our understanding of the outworking of God’s purposes becomes clearer. Prophecies open up to us as Jehovah’s holy spirit sheds light upon them, and as they are fulfilled in world events or in the experiences of God’s people.

Indeed it has been!</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>EXAMPLE OF ABRAHAM</strong></p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu">4, 5. How did God gradually reveal his purpose to Abraham?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Consider Abraham, the man of faith whom God called his friend. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981887/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 41:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981887/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Jas. 2:23</a>) Despite his close relationship with Jehovah God, he did not at first have a complete understanding of God’s purposes. We can see this from a number of developments in Abraham’s life​—his understanding gradually improved. God called him to leave his home country, telling him that He would make a great nation of him and that through him all the families of the earth would bless themselves. But Abraham did not know all the details; we read that he obeyed “although not knowing where he was going.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981887/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 11:8</a>) Further, though God promised him that his seed would be given the land, Abraham did not know how this would come about. He even expressed concern that his servant Eliezer might inherit his house. Then Jehovah made matters plain, telling Abraham: “One who will come out of your own inward parts will succeed you as heir.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981887/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Gen. 12:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981887/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981887/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 15:2-4</a>) Since Abraham’s wife, Sarah, was barren, she asked him to have relations with her maid, Hagar, by whom he had Ishmael. Later God explained to Abraham that the heir of promise would be through Sarah.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981887/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gen. 17:15-17</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> So we can see that, whereas everything Jehovah revealed directly to Abraham was true, yet Abraham did not accurately understand how God would work out this purpose. Still, he continued to exercise faith and to wait on Jehovah, receiving further enlightenment as time went on. Likewise, when Jehovah commanded him to offer up his son Isaac as a sacrifice on Mount Moriah, Abraham did not know exactly how this matter would be worked out. But he had faith that God would raise up a seed through Isaac even if God had to raise Isaac from the dead.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981887/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Heb. 11:17-19</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>DANIEL AND OTHER PROPHETS</strong></p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu">6, 7.

This can be seen from the fact that while John was in prison he sent his disciples to Jesus with the inquiry: “Are you the Coming One, or are we to expect a different one?” John’s query was not an expression of a lack of faith but a desire for more specific confirmation. Jesus’ reply, pointing to his works, without a doubt comforted John.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981887/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 11:2-6</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>JESUS AND HIS APOSTLES</strong></p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 9.

He told them much about the Kingdom: that he would go away and that he would return after a long time and take them home to him in the heavens. In spite of all of this, however, his apostles held to the idea that the Messianic kingdom would be the restored kingdom of David in Jerusalem. That is why they asked the resurrected Jesus: “Lord, are you restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time?” Jesus told them that there were some things they could not understand as yet, saying: “It does not belong to you to get knowledge of the times or seasons which the Father has placed in his own jurisdiction.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981887/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Acts 1:6, 7</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> That there is a due time to gain understanding of certain features of God’s purposes is clear from Jesus’ words to his apostles: “I have many things yet to say to you, but you are not able to bear them at present.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981887/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">John 16:12</a>) This indicates that God gives his servants understanding of his will in accordance with their ability to grasp and make use of such understanding.

This knowledge infused them with zeal to tell the “good news” to others. Even though Jesus had said they should make disciples of people of all nations, at first they limited their preaching to the Jews, non-Jewish proselytes and then, in time, to the Samaritans. <span id="page19" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>They did not understand that they should go to the uncircumcised Gentiles.

Peter truly needed help to adjust his thinking before entering the home of an uncircumcised Gentile considered unclean by the Law. He had to be instructed while in a trance: “You stop calling defiled the things God has cleansed.” So Peter and the other apostles had to change their viewpoint on this matter. Peter did so and was used by God to declare to the Gentiles that the way to God’s heavenly kingdom was open.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981887/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Acts 10:9-43</a>.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu">14.

It was necessary for Paul and other disciples to go to Jerusalem in order to take this matter up with the apostles and other elders, who at that time made up the governing body for Christian congregations. This body heard what Peter had to say about the conversion of Cornelius, and Paul’s evidence about the mighty works God had performed in connection with Paul’s ministry to the Gentiles. Then they considered what God’s inspired Word had to say about the matter. With the help of holy spirit they came to the right conclusion, namely, that while certain standards of conduct were required, it was not necessary for Gentiles to be circumcised and keep the Mosaic law in order to become Christians.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981887/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Acts 15:1–16:5</a>.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">15, 16.

For at present we see in hazy outline by means of a metal mirror, but then it will be face to face. At present I know partially, but then I shall know accurately even as I am accurately known.” So even at this point spirit-begotten Christians, including the apostle Paul himself, had not been led by holy spirit to a complete knowledge of all truth. Their knowledge was still only partial, to the extent that God had given them understanding up to that time. But it was sufficient for the needs they then had.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981887/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:9, 10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981887/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 12</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Some nine years after Paul had written the foregoing, or about the year 64 C.E., what did Peter write his fellow Christians? After discussing the transfiguration experience that confirmed Jesus to be the Son of God, he went on to say: “Consequently we have the prophetic word made more sure; and you are doing well in paying attention to it as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until day dawns and a daystar rises, in your hearts.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981887/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">2 Pet. 1:16-21</a>) So Christians still needed to search the Scriptures, giving much attention to the prophetic word, which would be like a lamp shining in a dark place.

In these <span id="page20" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>visions a number of truths concerning God’s purposes were revealed to spirit-begotten Christians for the first time. For instance, they thus learned that 144,000 men and women would be redeemed from all nations to be joint heirs with Jesus Christ in heaven and would rule as kings, priests and judges in the Messianic kingdom of 1,000 years’ duration.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981887/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Rev. 1:10</a>) Thus <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981887/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Revelation 5:1-14</a> pictorially describes a scroll, with seals that had to be loosed so that the scroll could be opened.

And the wicked ones will certainly act wickedly, and no wicked ones at all will understand; but the ones having insight will understand.” Would this enlightenment come all at once? To be identified as ‘those having insight’ would it require that God’s servants have complete, detailed knowledge and understanding, so that they would not need, in time, to make any readjustments or changes in their views of certain teachings or other matters?

Jude says that God “has reserved [them] with eternal bonds under dense darkness for the judgment of the great day.” The apostle Peter also describes their immediate punishment, saying: “God did not hold back from punishing the angels that sinned, but, by throwing them into Tarʹta·rus, delivered them to pits of dense darkness to be reserved for judgment; and he did not hold back from punishing an ancient world, but kept Noah, a preacher of righteousness, safe with seven others when he brought a deluge upon a world of ungodly people, and by reducing the cities Sodʹom and Go·morʹrah to ashes he condemned them, setting a pattern for ungodly persons of things to come, and he delivered righteous Lot, who was greatly distressed by the indulgence of the law-defying people in loose conduct.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955726/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Pet. 2:4-7</a>, <em>NW</em>) Particularly from the Flood and to the judgment of the great day of Jehovah when he establishes his <span id="page594" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="594" data-before-text="594"></span>kingdom by Jesus Christ, the “angels that sinned” have been penalized with having to dwell in Tartarus, unable to return to their lofty “original position.” Tartarus (generally mistranslated “hell”) is not the same as Gehenna and Haʹdes (likewise mistranslated “hell”).

(a) How are Tartarus of the Bible and the mythological Tartarus comparable? (b) How is abasing (or abyssing) of unholy spirit creatures Biblically defined?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> The Biblical Tartarus is not the Tartarus of the heathen mythologies, namely, the lowest of the lower regions, as far below Haʹdes as the earth is below heaven. There the lesser gods, Cronus and the other spirit Titans, were imprisoned by the victorious god Zeus or Jupiter. It was a place of darkness and it enveloped all the lower regions the same as the heavens enveloped all that was higher than the earth. Comparable with the mythological meaning, Tartarus pictures a condition of deepest abasement and dense darkness, not for human souls, but for wicked spirits, rebels against God. In harmony with this, the Syriac version of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955726/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Peter 2:4</a> uses the expression “the lowest places” instead of Tartarus. These rebel spirits, including Satan the Devil, have been abased as if cast down to a literal Tartarus, by being cast out of God’s service and sentenced to destruction, to being crushed at the head like so many serpents by the Seed of God’s woman, the glorified Jesus Christ.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> That did not mean they were at once excluded from heaven, kept away from contact with the faithful, holy angels. The book about Job, who lived over seven hundred years after the Flood, pictures how Satan had access into heaven, to enter the meeting of the “sons of God” and to challenge Jehovah to let him put Job’s integrity to the test. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955726/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 1:6 to 2:10</a>) And <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955726/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Revelation 12:1-7</a> reveals that when Jehovah’s kingdom by Jesus Christ was born in the heavens in 1914 (A.D.), Satan and his angels had been tolerated up in heaven till then. Moreover, Satan and his demons constitute the symbolic heavens of this world, the heavens that have dominated earthly human society and that are to be destroyed as by fire at the battle of Armageddon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955726/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:10-12</a>) Hence, in the Bible, Tartarus means an abased condition, deprived of privileges of service within God’s universal organization rather than a position or place.</p><p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu"> 7. What enlarged understanding of the present position and activity of the rebel angels should we now recognize and make known (or sow)?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[64]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> In this abased state or condition Satan and the other angels that sinned are held under dense darkness or are in pits of dense darkness, held there by eternal bonds. The dense darkness is a spiritual one, rather than a literal one, with no light of truth and revelation and favor from God. “Light is sown for the righteous,” not for demonized spirits. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955726/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 97:11</a>) That is why the messages of the spirits through mediums give no explanation of the Bible and throw no light on Bible prophecies. So, being in pits of dense darkness does not mean that their operations in connection with humankind are restricted to seances in the dark with spirit mediums. They can perform through human agents also in the daylight.</p><p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu"> 8. How may we now accurately understand manifestations and communications that spiritualism falsely defines as an activity of human souls that have died?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Their being “reserved with eternal bonds” evidently means also that they are no more permitted to materialize in the flesh as before the Flood. This power of materialization was exercised by God’s faithful angels, including Jesus Christ, for thousands of years after the Flood, down <span id="page595" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="595" data-before-text="595"></span>into the day of Christ’s faithful apostles, according to God’s will and to serve his holy purposes. But the sinner angels were not allowed to use this power longer, for they would misuse it. The materializations that are reported by spiritualists as taking place at mediumistic séances are not materializations such as the “sons of God” performed before the Flood. Their materializations were instantaneous and out in the open daylight without a medium and in independent bodies. The spiritualist materializations today are merely the taking of the protoplasm or material of the medium’s body and extruding it from such body as “ectoplasm” and then shaping it into human appearances. At the end of the apparition the ectoplasm, rather than being dissolved, uncreated and dematerialized, returns to the medium’s body and the medium becomes normal and conscious again. Since the disobedient spirits can no longer materialize, they are obliged to operate through mediums. They also try to obsess human victims or take possession of them, fully controlling them. Such were the demon-possessed whom Jesus and his apostles encountered in their day, and many a demon Jesus and his apostles expelled to free their victims. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955726/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 4:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955726/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 10:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955726/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955726/11/3" data-bid="12-4" class="b"> 12:28</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955726/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 9:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955726/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 10:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955726/12/2" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> Acts 16:16-18</a>) This they did by the spirit of God to uphold the truth and universal sovereignty of Jehovah God, and not by the power of the Devil the way the spirit mediums and religious exorcists do in order to bolster up the doctrines, beliefs and practices of false religious cults and systems. Operating through mediums at séances or table tippings or spirit knockings or other spiritualistic manifestations, these demons pretend to be “departed souls” of the human dead and thus keep up the lie that the dead are not dead but more alive and know more than ever before.</p>

All these survivors on earth are the ones against whom Satan the great dragon stirred up the “kings of the earth and their armies” for the purpose of destroying all such upholders of Jehovah God and his Messianic kingdom.

<strong>The Most Widely Published Song</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">How would the Christian “prophets” and “holy ones” who had died be rewarded and stand with him on the heavenly Mount Zion? By being resurrected just as he was, not in a fleshly body, for in flesh they could not stand with him in heaven in the presence of Jehovah God. The apostle Paul explains this fact to us in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:35-50</a>, where he tells us that “flesh and blood cannot inherit God’s kingdom,” but that these dead ones, having gone down in death in a corruptible, physical body of weakness, would be raised up with a spiritual body, incorrupt, bearing the image of the heavenly One. Their resurrection, therefore, would be in a spiritual body and be invisible to human eyes. While the great majority of the 144,000 have lived and died, yet at present there remains a “remnant,” who, while completing their faithful course on earth, are <span id="page184" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="184" data-before-text="184"></span>highly privileged to join in the song and to see that it is published to a great earthwide audience.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>TO WHOM DO THE SINGERS BEAR WITNESS</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><em>“Having his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.”</em> Having the name of the Lamb Jesus Christ and the name of his Father written on the forehead, where it can be plainly seen by all, symbolizes the fact that they are slaves of Jehovah God and Jesus Christ. They do not have the name of Babylon on their foreheads as if they were slaves of Babylon and belonged to her. What the apostle John saw in the foreheads of the 144,000 was no doubt the sacred Hebrew tetragrammaton (יהוה), for the name of the Father (YHWH), or in Anglicized pronunciation, Jehovah. The 144,000 therefore must be Jehovah’s witnesses during their earthly course and now continue to be his witnesses in heaven.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><em>“And I heard a sound out of heaven as the sound of many waters and as the sound of loud thunder; and the sound that I heard was as of singers who accompany themselves on the harp playing on their harps.”</em> What a chorus! A hundred and forty-four thousand singers, not with earthly voices, but with heavenly voices, singing in perfect harmony, accompanied by the pure music of the harp. The extent to which the song would be heard is indicated by the fact that to John it had the mighty sound of many waters and the sound of loud thunders. Never in the history of the universe has there been such a song nor such an audience, millions of angels in heaven listening and the entire earth to hear its joyful, encouraging strains. We shall see how the singers accomplish this, by Jehovah’s direction and power.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>THE GRAND THEME OF THE SONG</strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><em>“And they are singing as if a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the older persons.”</em> So the song was not known and sung before 1914. It is <em>new.</em> The 144,000 integrity-keeping joint heirs with Christ are the first ones to vocalize it. Because of its singers and its content it is the greatest and most far-reaching anthem of the universe, for it is about the kingdom of God as the government that has been established since 1914. It has the loftiest theme, the greatest truth taught in the Bible: it is about Jesus Christ reigning in Kingdom power. Jesus Christ the King in Jehovah’s kingdom is the great Truth in fulfillment of all the prophetic utterances of the Bible, and he is the one who himself gave a fine testimony before Pontius Pilate that he came to earth to bear witness to this great truth. It concerns first the most important One of the Kingdom organization, for the song itself contains words addressed to the Lamb of God: “You are worthy to take the scroll and open its seals, because you were slaughtered and with your blood you bought persons for God out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and you made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God, and they will rule as kings over the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Rev. 5:9, 10</a>) The 144,000 singers will have the abounding joy of reigning with Christ and sharing in his rule over the earth, bringing the blessings of the Abrahamic covenant, which provided that all families of the earth were to bless themselves by means of the Seed, Jesus Christ. To these singers the commands of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalms 96:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 98:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/14/3" data-bid="15-4" class="b"> 5</a>; and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966204/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps 149:1, 2</a> would apply:</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="si">“Sing to Jehovah a new song.

The productive land also becomes firmly established so that it cannot <span id="page185" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="185" data-before-text="185"></span>be made to totter. He will plead the cause of the peoples in uprightness.’” “Sing to Jehovah a new song, for wonderful are the things that he has done. His right hand, even his holy arm, has gained salvation for him. Make melody to Jehovah with the harp, with the harp and the voice of melody.” “Praise Jah, you people! Sing to Jehovah a new song, his praise in the congregation of loyal ones. Let Israel rejoice in its grand Maker, the sons of Zion—let them be joyful in their King.”</p>

Away back, long before the creation of the human family, what do we read, as Jehovah demanded of Job: “Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? . . . when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 38:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 7</a>, <em>AS</em>) Linked with this, and going even farther back, we have that intensely illuminating account of God’s only-begotten Son, in his prehuman existence, personified as wisdom, where it says: “Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, before the earth was. . . . When he marked out the foundations of the earth; then I was by him, as a master workman; and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him, rejoicing in his habitable earth; and my delight was with the sons of men.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Prov. 8:22, 23,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 29-31</a>, <em>AS</em>) Surely his delightful companionship with Jehovah, <span id="page178" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="178" data-before-text="178"></span>and his rejoicing before him, would often find expression in the most glorious heavenly singing.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 4. What question is thus raised, and what are we led to expect concerning the answer?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> These records of heavenly singing raise the question in our minds, Is there any mention in Scripture of Jehovah himself singing? The answer is very interesting, for, to our amazement, there appears to be but one reference, contained in a prophecy now finding fulfillment, a prophecy, too, that is linked with fighting. This marks the occasion as unique and outstanding, and it will be given due consideration in the course of our study.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 5. (a) How deep-rooted in the human family is the gift of music? (b) Where may we find something still better than music, and why?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> The record is silent as to whether there was any singing in the garden of Eden when all was perfect. It is difficult to imagine, though, that there was no singing, especially when the man was given his lovely companion and counterpart who could respond and join in, to the accompaniment of the songbirds, in that ideal setting. But it is beyond question that the gift and talent for music is deep-rooted in the human family, for, among the earliest descendants of Adam, Jubal is described as “the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe”. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 4:21</a>, <em>AS</em>) Yes, as deep-rooted as those other marvelous God-given gifts of speech and of writing. And right down to our day, though so imperfect and estranged from their Creator and unhappily blinded by “the god of this system of things” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:4</a>, <em>NW</em>), yet the members of the human family everywhere on earth still evidence that deep-seated desire to express themselves in music and in song. Often perverted and misused, it is true, but the gift is still there. There are some lovely things indeed in the music of this world, but there are far more lovely things, far grander and more appealing, in God’s Word, where God’s name is written in lovelier lines.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>FIGHTING AND SINGING IN THE DAY OF JEHOVAH</strong></p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 6. Following what theme is this subject going to be discussed?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Let us come, then, to the main theme of our discussion, and see what the Scriptures have to say and what we can learn for our encouragement and guidance on this dual subject of singing and fighting. First, we propose to state briefly what is the theme, and then show how this is amply supported by God’s Word. To begin with, since A. D. 1914 we have been living in the most momentous of all times, in “that day”, “the great day of Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isa. 26:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Zeph. 1:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 3:8</a>, <em>AS</em>) There is much fighting that takes place within this day, for which Jehovah is responsible. The fighting is actually done by Christ Jesus, who in prophecy may correspond to the “arm” of Jehovah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 98:1</a>, <em>AS</em>) Under Christ Jesus, there are heavenly forces placed at his disposal. God’s people on earth also have their part to play. By a series of victories, leading to a complete and final conquest over all God’s enemies at the battle of Armageddon, a great and eternal salvation is accomplished, seen in the secure establishment of a “new heavens and a new earth”, and on behalf of all those who will gain everlasting life in that new world. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isa. 65:17</a>, <em>AS</em>) This glorious salvation, which has already begun to be accomplished, is the main burden of our singing, which, mark you, gives all the credit and all the praise to whom it rightly belongs, to Jehovah, through his strong, “holy arm.”</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 7. In what prophetic drama were singing and fighting involved, revealing what particular purpose on Jehovah’s part?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Most of our readers are familiar with the wealth of Scriptural evidence, frequently <span id="page179" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="179" data-before-text="179"></span>discussed in detail in these columns, showing that A. D. 1914 marked the beginning of Jehovah’s day. Therefore, instead of taking time now to submit proof concerning this, we purpose to discuss, first, one of those prophetic dramas worked out in real life in God’s leadings and dealings with his chosen people, Israel, showing forcefully the present-day issue involving both singing and fighting. We refer to the occasion when God visited Egypt to effect a mighty deliverance and salvation for the children of Israel, as expressed in that question put by David: “And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem unto himself for a people, and to make him a name?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Sam. 7:23</a>, <em>AS</em>) In line with that, we remember that God caused Moses to notify and warn Pharaoh of the issue involved in that battle of the gods, as recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Exodus 9:16</a>, quoted by Paul as follows: “For this very purpose I have let you remain, that in connection with you I may demonstrate my power and that my name may be published throughout all the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rom. 9:17</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p>

<strong>Mount, Mountain</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><strong><em>The mountains rejoice and praise Jehovah.</em></strong> When Jehovah turns his favorable attention to his people, this has a good effect upon the land. Cultivated and cared for, mountain slopes cease to have an unkept appearance, as if mourning in a state of desolation or plague. Therefore, figuratively, the mountains “cry out joyfully” and their beauty and productivity praise Jehovah.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003125/73/0" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Ps 98:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003125/73/1" data-bid="74-2" class="b"> 148:7-9</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003125/74/0" data-bid="75-1" class="b">Isa 44:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003125/74/1" data-bid="75-2" class="b"> 49:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003125/74/2" data-bid="75-3" class="b"> 55:12, 13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003125/74/3" data-bid="75-4" class="b"> Eze 36:1-12</a>.</p>

<strong>Hebrew Poetry</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Some expressions in the Bible are obviously to be taken, not literally, but as figures of speech. It is evident that the earth does not rest on literal “socket pedestals” nor do its rivers actually “clap their hands.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101973090/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 38:4-6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101973090/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ps. 98:8</a>) Nevertheless, very clear truths are being stated when such expressions are used: the earth <em>is</em> immovably set by changeless laws, and rivers <em>do</em> produce handlike waves that noisily slap at their banks. While this variation in style from ordinary prose is usually obvious and therefore understood, other points about Hebrew poetry may not be.</p>

Babylon, by her military conquests, brought other lands to ruin and is, therefore, called a “ruinous mountain.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Jer. 51:24, 25</a>) A psalm relating Jehovah’s activities against warring men depicts him as being “enveloped with light, more majestic than the mountains of prey.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Ps. 76:4</a>) The “mountains of prey” may represent aggressive kingdoms.

Regarding Jehovah, David said: “You have made my mountain to stand in strength,” probably meaning that Jehovah had exalted David’s kingdom and firmly established it.

With reference to this choosing, David wrote: “The mountainous region of Bashan is a mountain of God [that is, created by God]; the mountainous region of Bashan is a mountain of peaks. Why do you, O you mountains of peaks, keep watching enviously the mountain that God has desired for himself to dwell in? Even Jehovah himself will reside there forever. . . . Jehovah himself has come from Sinai [where he first revealed his presence to the entire nation of Israel] into the holy place.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Ps. 68:15-17</a>) The mountainous region of Bashan may be said to reach its crest in Mount Hermon and, therefore, this mountain may be meant by the words the “mountain of God” and the “mountain of peaks.” Although Mount Hermon towers far above Mount Zion, Jehovah chose the less conspicuous location for his place of dwelling.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">After the temple was built on Mount Moriah, the term “Zion” came to include the temple site and therefore Zion remained God’s holy mountain.

There is no evidence that such a thing ever took place in connection with the literal temple at Jerusalem. But there is evidence of a fulfillment upon the Christian congregation of spiritual Israel, which is associated with the spiritual temple of Jehovah God. The invitation to become part of spiritual Israel began to be extended to non-Jews in the year 36 C.E.

It is a hasty assumption. For example, the atheist may point to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 1:4</a> which says “the earth abideth for ever”, and then flip the pages to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:10</a> and read: “The earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.” He gloats that here is a contradiction that proves the Bible unreliable. However, in the first instance it is the literal earth that does abide forever; while in the second reference the term “earth” stands for the peoples generally and their organized governments under Satan. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:4</a>) The context shows this correct, for it had just mentioned that the earth in Noah’s day was destroyed by water. We know the flood did not destroy the literal earth; it is still here. It did wash out of existence the wicked peoples and governing arrangements upon the surface of the earth. This symbolical reference to peoples as “earth” is not infrequent. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Ki. 10:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Ps. 66:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 98:9</a>) Or, the atheist may say Christ contradicted himself, one time telling his disciples not to provide themselves with purses and on another occasion instructing them to do so. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 10:9, 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Luke 10:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 22:35, 36</a>) In the first instance they were being sent forth on missionary work, to trust in God’s provision for them as workers worthy of their pay. They would be taking spiritual food to the people, and interested persons would gladly respond with some material help for the preachers. But in the second instance Jesus was about to be nailed to the torture stake, his followers scattered, persecution set in, with enemies on all sides, and even those favoring the message fearful of showing friendliness for Christ’s followers. Then Christians would have to make provision for their material needs.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 4. Why is the atheist so readily deceived?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> By ignoring the context and possible symbolic meanings of scriptures the atheist thinks he finds contradictions, and because he is looking for contradictions he ends his search with his superficial reading, happy, feeling rewarded, thinking he has found what he was seeking. He does not wish to continue his study to get an understanding that would bring harmony to the passages that his prejudiced mind views as contradictory. He has his reward.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 6:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 16</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 5. How do modernist clergy view the Bible, and why?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> The modernist clergy join in with the attacks on the Bible because they are caught in this trap: “The fear of man leads one into a snare.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Prov. 29:25</a>, <em>AT</em>) The popular concept of the day is that the Bible is only myth and legend, and its only value is literary. Fearing the scorn of the worldly wise and trying to keep pace with the intellectual classes and stay in their favor, the modernist clergy abandon the Bible truths to embrace the theories and philosophies of the smart men of this world. The Bible sounds a warning against such spineless deserters: “Look out: perhaps there may be some man that will carry you off as his prey through the philosophy and empty deception according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary things of the world and not according to Christ.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Col. 2:8</a>, <em>NW</em>) Typical of those who abandon the Bible in fact but cling to it for a selfish living is the attitude expressed by the head of a theological seminary in Denver, Colorado. He said: “The biggest challenge of religious education is to fit a camel-train philosophy into a diesel civilization.” This is just another way of saying that the Bible is not practical, that it is too old-fashioned for our day, that it is about as out-of-date as a camel train would be in our fast-moving, machine-age civilization.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 6. How do fundamentalist clergy make it seem ridiculous and void?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Creed-bound fundamentalist clergymen <span id="page327" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="327" data-before-text="327"></span>that always take the Bible so literally make it ridiculous. After emoting at length on how God is love, they turn right around and say that he torments people forever in a lake of fire and brimstone. However, if the punishment of the wicked were to be torment, why did Jehovah tell Adam that to disobediently eat the forbidden fruit would mean death? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Gen. 2:17</a>) If the wages of sin is eternal torment, why does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Romans 6:23</a> say: “The wages sin pays is death”? (<em>NW</em>) To withstand eternal burning in a lake of fire, one would have to be immortal. And so these fundamentalists teach concerning man’s soul. But if the human soul is immortal, why does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951401/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ezekiel 18:4</a> state: “The soul that sinneth, it shall die”? And if man is immortal, what need is there for a resurrection through Christ Jesus? In many ways such clergymen make God’s Word appear ridiculous and void by their religious traditions and creeds.</p>

Jehovah is great in Zion, and he is high over all the peoples.” In 1914 the time came for him to stop the trampling upon the Kingdom in the royal line of David, as represented in the once royal city of Jerusalem. Hence, he enthroned his Son, Jesus Christ, as King at His own right hand in “the Jerusalem above,” the celestial Jerusalem, in this way making it a royal city. Jehovah’s own kingship is reinforced or enlarged upon by the enthronement of Jesus Christ as King.</p>

Upon that ark there were two golden cherubs with wings stretched out toward one another, and, centered above, there appeared the so-called Shekinah light that represented the presence of Jehovah God at his temple. In a miraculous vision of the interior of the temple the prophet Isaiah saw Jehovah on his throne and attended by spirit creatures called seraphs.

<strong>Putting Kingdom Interests First</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The overseer at Beaumont, California, writes this: “When I received my invitation to come to the Kingdom Ministry School at South Lansing I was having trouble with my vocal cords, which the doctor described as ‘preacher’s sore throat.’ The remedy, he said, was to quit doing so much talking. My only income was derived from selling and that had been practically nil for the past few months, with the usual accumulation of bills. But Jehovah’s spirit entered in, and my wife suggested that maybe she could get a job. <span id="page447" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="447" data-before-text="447"></span>This she was able to do, and while her salary would not meet all expenses and pay for the trip, it did give us something. So she took up her pad and pencil as a secretary, and I took up her apron and saved my voice. With a contribution from the congregation to fill the gap, I am, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, able to attend the Kingdom Ministry School.”</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">A congregation servant from Brooklyn, New York, says that on three separate occasions he approached his employer to ask for time off to attend the Kingdom Ministry School. All three times he was turned down, and the third time the response was an angry one. Three days later it was time to leave for school, so the brother approached his employer again, this time requesting his pay in full, since he was going to have to say Good-by. On this occasion, after a long conversation in which the purpose of the school was again explained, leave of absence was granted.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Some who have attended the school have lost their secular work when doing so, but even these do not feel as if the Lord had let them down. Not at all! He blessed them far beyond their expectations with good things at the Kingdom Ministry School. Nor will He fail to hear their prayer in the days to come, when they ask: “Give us our bread for the day according to the day’s requirement.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961527/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 11:3</a>) As Jesus himself assured, those who earnestly seek first the kingdom of God will find that all the other things necessary to life are added to them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961527/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 6:33</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The example of these overseers in putting the Kingdom interests first is a fine one.

After these six thousand years of satanic domination of earth what the wicked one promised in Eden through Adam and Eve’s rebellion against Jehovah’s universal sovereignty has not materialized. The type of human government that he started with Nimrod at Babylon, the birthplace of all worldly kings, has failed to give the people satisfactory administration of their affairs.

So let all who long for life, peace and righteous government forsake this doomed world and declare themselves Jehovah’s subjects. It is only reasonable that all normal persons should want to seek the favor of the new King, especially if all must eventually submit to his rule or perish. Common sense dictates this as the wise course, because it is for one’s benefit and glorifies God. It upholds Jehovah’s universal sovereignty against the false charges and assaults of the Devil. As Jehovah’s witnesses keep on preaching the Kingdom gospel, more and more people hear the sound of the great crowd saying: “Praise Jah, you people, because Jehovah our God, the Almighty, has begun to rule as king.” It is high time for every hearer today to act upon this call to praise him as King, their personal King whom they have chosen to worship and serve forever.

In the cities allotted to them the priests were available to assist the judges and they also served with the judges in extraordinarily difficult cases beyond the ability of local courts to decide.

Also, when not on assigned duty, they would have wide opportunity for such teaching, whether in the area of the sanctuary or in other parts of the land. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013474/76/0" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Deut. 33:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013474/76/1" data-bid="77-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 15:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013474/76/2" data-bid="77-3" class="b"> 17:7-9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013474/76/3" data-bid="77-4" class="b"> Mal. 2:7</a>) Upon returning to Jerusalem from Babylon, Ezra the priest, assisted by other priests along with the Levites, gathered the people and spent hours reading and explaining the Law to them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013474/77/0" data-bid="78-1" class="b">Neh. 8:1-15</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">The priestly administration served as a safeguard to the nation in religious cleanness as also in physical health. The priest was to judge between the clean and the unclean in cases of leprosy of a man, a garment or a house. He saw that the legal quarantine regulations were carried out. He also officiated in the cleansing of those who had been defiled by a dead body or were unclean from morbid discharges, and so forth.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013474/78/0" data-bid="79-1" class="b">Lev. chaps. 13-15</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="ss"><strong><em>Organization</em></strong></p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">Of the twenty-four divisions or courses of the priests established by King David, sixteen were made up from the house of Eleazar and eight from the house of Ithamar. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013474/79/0" data-bid="80-1" class="b">1 Chron. 24:1-19</a>) However, at least initially, priests from only four of the divisions returned from the Babylonian exile. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013474/80/0" data-bid="81-1" class="b">Ezra 2:36-39</a>) Some suggest that, in order to continue the former organizational arrangement, the four families returning were divided so that there were again twenty-four courses. Dr. Edersheim, in <em>The Temple,</em> suggests that this was accomplished by each family drawing five lots for those who had not returned, thereby forming from their groups twenty more courses to which they gave the original names. John the Baptist’s father Zechariah was a priest of the eighth division, that of Abijah. However, if the above view represents the true case, he may not have been a descendant of Abijah, only belonging to the division which carried his name. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013474/81/0" data-bid="82-1" class="b">1 Chron. 24:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013474/81/1" data-bid="82-2" class="b"> Luke 1:5</a>) Absence of full information does not allow for firm conclusions on these points.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">In the temple service the priests were organized under various officers. Lots were drawn in assigning certain services. Each of the twenty-four divisions served one week at a time, being on assigned duty twice a year. Evidently the entire priesthood served at festival seasons when thousands of sacrifices were offered by the people, as they did at the temple dedication. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013474/82/0" data-bid="83-1" class="b">1 Chron. 24:1-18,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013474/82/1" data-bid="83-2" class="b"> 31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013474/82/2" data-bid="83-3" class="b"> 2 Chron. 5:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013474/82/3" data-bid="83-4" class="b"> compare 29:31-35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013474/82/4" data-bid="83-5" class="b"> 30:23-25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013474/82/5" data-bid="83-6" class="b"> 35:10-19</a>.) A priest might serve at other times as long as he did not interfere with the allotted services of the priests on assigned duty. According to rabbinical traditions, in the time of Jesus’ earthly life, the priests were numerous, so that the service of the week was subdivided among the various families making up the division, each family serving one or more days according to their number.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">Probably considered the most honorable of the daily services was the burning of incense on the golden altar. This was done after the sacrifice was offered. During the burning of incense the people would be gathered outside the sanctuary in prayer. Rabbinical tradition is that lots were drawn for this service, but that one who had previously officiated was not allowed to participate unless all present had performed the service before. If this is so, a priest would usually have the honor only once in a lifetime. It was this service that Zechariah was performing when the angel Gabriel appeared to him to announce that Zechariah and his wife Elizabeth would have a son. When Zechariah came out of the sanctuary, the crowd gathered there could discern by his appearance and his inability to speak that Zechariah had seen a supernatural sight in the sanctuary; thus the event became public knowledge.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013474/83/0" data-bid="84-1" class="b">Luke 1:8-23</a>.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">Each sabbath day, it appears, the priests had the privilege of changing the showbread. It was also on the sabbath that the priestly division for that week completed its service and the new course began duty for the following week. These and other necessary duties were performed by the priests without constituting a breaking of the sabbath.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013474/84/0" data-bid="85-1" class="b">Matt. 12:2-5</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013474/85/0" data-bid="86-1" class="b">1 Samuel 21:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013474/85/1" data-bid="86-2" class="b"> 2 Kings 11:5-7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013474/85/2" data-bid="86-3" class="b"> 2 Chronicles 23:8</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="ss"><strong><em>Loyalty</em></strong></p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">When the ten tribes broke away from the kingdom under Rehoboam and established the northern kingdom under Jeroboam, the tribe of Levi remained loyal and stuck with the two-tribe kingdom of Judah and Benjamin. Jeroboam made priests of men not of the tribe of Levi to serve in the worship of golden calves and drove out the priests of Jehovah, the sons of Aaron.
