<strong>Cave</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Caves provided refuge in times of danger. The first mention of such a place concerns Lot and his two daughters living in a cave after leaving Zoar because of fear. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000907/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ge 19:30</a>) At Makkedah five confederate Amorite kings hid from Joshua in a cave that afterward became their common tomb. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000907/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jos 10:16-27</a>) When fleeing from the Philistines in the days of King Saul, some Israelites hid in caves. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000907/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1Sa 13:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000907/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 14:11</a>) To escape the wrath of Saul, David took refuge in a cave near Adullam and was there joined by “about four hundred men.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000907/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1Sa 22:1, 2</a>) Again pursued by Saul, David concealed himself in a cave in the wilderness of En-gedi, and it was here that David cut off the skirt of Saul’s coat when he “came in to ease nature.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000907/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1Sa 24:1-15</a>) It may have been David’s experiences on these two occasions that prompted him to compose <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000907/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalms 57</a> and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000907/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">142</a>, as their superscriptions show. After David was made king, the cave of Adullam apparently served as military headquarters during a campaign against the Philistines. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000907/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2Sa 23:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000907/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 1Ch 11:15</a>) When wicked Jezebel attempted to kill off all of Jehovah’s prophets, Obadiah fed 100 of them who were hiding in caves. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000907/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1Ki 18:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000907/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 13</a>) Elijah also fled from the anger of Jezebel to a cave at Horeb, and it was there that he received divine instructions to return and anoint Hazael as well as Jehu. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000907/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1Ki 19:1-17</a>) So from these examples Paul had ample support for writing that men of faith “wandered about in . . . caves and dens of the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000907/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Heb 11:38</a>) Many years later the catacombs of Rome served as underground refuges and meeting places for persecuted Christians.</p>

This is especially noticeable when examining the psalms, many of which are illuminated by what is contained in the books of Samuel.

<strong>How Valuable Are the Superscriptions in the Book of Psalms?</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">A case in point is <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972046/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 57 sup</a>. According to its superscription, this Psalm pertains to the time ‘when David ran away because of Saul, into the cave.’ In the book of First Samuel we find that David on one occasion hid from King Saul in the cave of Adullam (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972046/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Sam. 22:1</a>) and another time in a cave in the wilderness of Engedi. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972046/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Sam. 24:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972046/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 3</a>) The psalm itself points to the cave in the wilderness of Engedi as the probable setting. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972046/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps 57 Verse six</a> of this psalm reads:</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sp"><span id="page62" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="62" data-before-text="62"></span>“A net they have prepared for my steps;</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sz">My soul has become bowed down.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sp">They excavated before me a pitfall;</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sz">They have fallen into the midst of it.”</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Yes, Saul and his men were hunting down David. They had, as it were, excavated a pitfall for him. But what happened? <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972046/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">First Samuel 24:3, 4</a> reports that “Saul came in to ease nature” in the very cave where David and his men had concealed themselves. This made it possible for David to kill Saul, if that had been what he wanted to do. Thus, by entering the cave and coming to be at the mercy of David, Saul fell into the very pitfall that he had dug for David.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Like David, Jehovah’s faithful servants today are often plotted against. But, as Saul failed in his attempts to bring David to ruin, they, too, can rest assured that those seeking their injury will fail, getting ensnared by their own schemes.</p>

<strong>How Valuable Are the Superscriptions in the Book of Psalms?</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">A case in point is <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972046/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 57 sup</a>. According to its superscription, this Psalm pertains to the time ‘when David ran away because of Saul, into the cave.’ In the book of First Samuel we find that David on one occasion hid from King Saul in the cave of Adullam (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972046/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Sam. 22:1</a>) and another time in a cave in the wilderness of Engedi. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972046/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Sam. 24:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972046/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 3</a>) The psalm itself points to the cave in the wilderness of Engedi as the probable setting. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972046/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps 57 Verse six</a> of this psalm reads:</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sp"><span id="page62" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="62" data-before-text="62"></span>“A net they have prepared for my steps;</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sz">My soul has become bowed down.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sp">They excavated before me a pitfall;</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sz">They have fallen into the midst of it.”</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Yes, Saul and his men were hunting down David. They had, as it were, excavated a pitfall for him. But what happened? <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972046/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">First Samuel 24:3, 4</a> reports that “Saul came in to ease nature” in the very cave where David and his men had concealed themselves. This made it possible for David to kill Saul, if that had been what he wanted to do. Thus, by entering the cave and coming to be at the mercy of David, Saul fell into the very pitfall that he had dug for David.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Like David, Jehovah’s faithful servants today are often plotted against. But, as Saul failed in his attempts to bring David to ruin, they, too, can rest assured that those seeking their injury will fail, getting ensnared by their own schemes.</p>

<strong>Charm, II</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>Snake Charming.</strong> So-called snake charming can be a form of spiritism and is a survival of the ancient cult of serpent worshipers. The charmer is supposed to cast a spell over the serpent, often a hooded cobra, so it appears enchanted with the playing of music, usually on a flute or pipe instrument. Snakes are not deaf or hard of hearing, as some may think, but as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000926/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 58:4, 5</a> implies, they are able to hear the voice of charmers as well as the music. One might think that it is a mere trick of training the snake as one would train an animal or bird, by placing it in a basket with a lid, playing soft music, quickly dropping the lid if any attempt is made to escape, until the snake finally learns to raise itself upright in obedience to the music without trying to escape. While this may be true in some instances, spiritistic forces are often apparently involved in snake charming.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Attesting to the antiquity of this spiritistic practice is its mention in the Bible.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000926/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps 58:4, 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000926/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Ec 10:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000926/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Isa 3:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000926/7/3" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> Jer 8:17</a>.</p>

<strong>Cobra</strong><br/>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn"><strong><em>How can a cobra “listen to the voice of charmers”?</em></strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The Bible refers to the cobra’s ear and alludes to the cobra’s ability to “listen to the voice of charmers.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001000/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps 58:4, 5</a>) Since snakes lack surface ear openings and appeared to naturalists to be indifferent to sound, many have assumed that these reptiles are deaf. Commenting on this error, <em>The New Encyclopædia Britannica</em> (1987, Vol. 27, p. 159) states: “This supposition is incorrect; snakes are sensitive to some airborne sound waves and are able to receive them through a mechanism that serves as a substitute for the tympanic <span id="page486" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="486" data-before-text="486"></span>membrane. . . . Moreover, while the sensitivity of most snakes to the middle of the low-tone range is below that of most other types of ears, it is not seriously so. In a few snakes, however, the sensitivity is about as keen as in the majority of lizards with conventional types of ear openings and middle-ear mechanisms.”</p>

(Cobra venom is an accepted medication, in blood disorders, for instance.) Dr. Macht reported that in working with cobras and cobra venom he became acquainted with a number of Hindu physicians, well educated, and from different parts of India. All agreed that cobras respond to some musical tones, from musical pipes or fifes. Some forms of music excite the animals more than other forms, the physicians reported. Indian children, playing in the dark in the countryside, are even warned not to sing lest their sounds attract cobras, he said. Dr. Macht commented that Shakespeare, who repeatedly referred to serpents as deaf . . . merely repeated a common misunderstanding. On the other hand Dr. Macht said, the psalmist was right who implied conversely, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101993532/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 58, Verse 5</a>, that serpents can hear.”</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Similarly, in an article published in the German zoological magazine <em>Grzimeks Tier, Sielmanns Tierwelt</em> (Grzimek’s Animal, Sielmann’s Animal World), July 1981, pages 34 and 35, the author tells of a cobra that lived on his estate in Sri Lanka in a termite hill. He asked a snake charmer to catch the wild snake and get it to dance. The author reports: “After I had assured my guest that there really was a cobra living there, he sat down in front of the termite hill and began to play his pipe. After a long time​—I no longer believed anything would happen—​the cobra raised its head several centimeters out of a hole. Before the snake could open its mouth the charmer hurried over and grabbed its head between his thumb and two fingers.” The Indian thereupon actually got the snake to dance.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Therefore, there is evidence that the cobra does “listen to the voice of charmers.”​—<em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures—​With References,</em> Appendix 7A, page 1583.</p>

<strong>Cobra</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The Bible refers to the cobra’s ear and alludes to the cobra’s ability to “listen to the voice of <span id="page362" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="362" data-before-text="362"></span>charmers.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010986/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 58:4, 5</a>) Though some naturalists claim snakes cannot hear, the Bible is in harmony with the latest findings that demonstrate that snakes have an internal sound mechanism and that they can hear fairly well. Thus the New York <em>Times</em> of January 10, 1954 (Sec. 4, p. 9), reported under the heading “Are Snakes ‘Charmed’ by Music?”:</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“Dr. David I. Macht, research pharmacologist of the Mount Sinai Hospital in Baltimore, is one of the world’s leading authorities on cobra snake venom. . . . Dr. Macht reported that in working with cobras and cobra venom he became acquainted with a number of Hindu physicians, well educated, and from different parts of India. All agreed that cobras respond to some musical tones, from musical pipes or fifes. Some forms of music excite the animals more than other forms, the physicians reported. Indian children, playing in the dark in the countryside, are even warned not to sing lest their sounds attract cobras, he said. Dr. Macht commented that Shakespeare, who repeatedly referred to serpents as deaf . . . merely repeated a common misunderstanding. On the other hand, Dr. Macht said, the psalmist was right who implied conversely, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010986/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 58</a>, Verse 5, that serpents can hear: . . . Contrary to the claims of some naturalists, Dr. Macht said, snakes are ‘charmed’ by sounds, not by movements of the charmer. Revise the textbooks, the physicians recommended.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The snake can best hear a vibration on the ground or notes of high pitch. Some of its most common preys make high-pitched sounds; these high-pitched notes produce great uneasiness and alarm in the snake. Thus notes produced by flutes only signify food or danger to the snake and do not meet with an appreciation of the music played. When a snake charmer starts playing on his flute, this immediately gets a reaction from the snake and it lifts itself erect, alert to danger. Recognizing the sound as coming from the flute, it will naturally fix its attention on that object and the one playing it. If the charmer moves or sways back and forth, the snake will do the same. If he moves around the snake in a circle, the snake will, of course, turn to keep its eyes on the source of the sound.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Pharaoh Tutankhamen, whose tomb was discovered in 1922, used the Egyptian cobra (<em>Naja haje</em>) as his imperial symbol.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Some cobras, such as the black-necked or spitting cobra of Africa, can spit or spray venom a distance of six to twelve feet (1.8 to 3.7 meters). The spitting cobras aim at the eyes of the victim and seldom miss their target. Spitting cobras appear to be able to eject their venom in rapid-fire salvos. One observer reports that in Tanganyika a black-necked cobra sprayed venom between a dozen and twenty times—in rapid succession.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"></p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Some animals have characteristics that seem especially suited to killing, such as lions and poisonous snakes. How can this be, if they were all vegetarians at one time?—L. K., Netherlands.</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It is understandable that this question might arise, for as things stand now many animals do kill one another for food. But please note that this is <em>as things stand now.</em> Is there anyone on the earth who can say from personal observation how these animals acted six thousand years ago?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Throughout the earth humans kill animals and eat their flesh. But does man’s ability to chew and digest meat prove that all men eat meat or that men have always eaten meat? No, for God’s Word, the oldest and most reliable history of mankind, shows that originally Jehovah gave man “all vegetation bearing seed” and “every tree on which there is the a fruit of a tree bearing seed” as food. It was not until over sixteen hundred years later that God permitted a change of diet for man, allowing him to hunt animals for food.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969648/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 1:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969648/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 9:2, 3</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">True, those who believe that man and animals evolved over a period of millions of years might not accept this, but it is what the Word of God says, and Jesus Christ said, “Your word is truth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969648/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 17:17</a>) If the present diet and mode of life of humans does not represent what it originally was, is it not possible that the same is true of animals?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">We must keep in mind that scientists are limited in their knowledge. Even if a man is an authority in some field of animal life, he does not know all there is to know about an animal as it now lives, to say nothing about how it lived thousands of years in the past. Those who are humble and sincere admit this. The very fact that scientists have different opinions proves the point.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">For instance, the question came up as to whether cobras can hear sounds. On November 27, 1968, an Associate Curator of Reptiles at one of the large zoological gardens in the United States wrote: “All snakes are unable to hear sounds; this also includes the Cobra.” That seems quite final. However, on the very same day the Curator and Chairman of the Department of Herpetology at the American Museum of Natural History explained: “It has been generally assumed . . . that snakes are deaf to air-borne sounds. Recent evidence has it, though, that some snakes can hear low-pitched sounds. How this relates to the cobra problem is uncertain. The weight of evidence is still in favor of the theory that it is movement rather than sound that influences the cobras, but <em>the matter certainly is not closed.”</em></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The Bible long ago indicated that the cobra hears the “voice of charmers,” but could refuse to listen just as a human can refuse to hear. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969648/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 58:4, 5</a>) Would it be wise to reject what the Bible says just because some scientists think the facts to be otherwise? The above quotations show that the answer is, No. Similarly, that certain current evidence does not seem to support what the Bible says about animal life in the past should not cause one to reject God’s inspired Word.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Another thing, is one justified in concluding that the way an animal uses its body today is the only possible way? As an example, a tiger uses its fangs and claws to catch, kill and tear apart other animals. Yet, could not these same fangs and claws be used in tearing apart heavy vegetation and ripping off husks and shells?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">‘But what about poisonous snakes?’ someone may ask. Animal poisons might appear to be just for killing or protection, but are they? In “Animal Poisoners” H. Munro Fox wrote: “In some cases we know that poisons play a role in the functioning of the body of the animal which manufactures them. In many instances this may be the real <em>raison d’être</em> [reason for existence] of the venoms, quite apart from any protective value. The poisonous spittle of snakes, for example, has work to do in the digestion of the snake’s food.” Another illustration is a certain green marine worm that is partly covered with a poisonous slime. Is this poison to protect it from being eaten? It might seem so. Yet if the young of this worm settle on this slime, the poison changes them into microscopic males instead of the large females they would have developed into if they settled on the sea floor.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">It is true that hundreds or even thousands of problem cases might be brought up, ones that <em>apparently</em> indicate that animals always killed one another, that this is necessary for the “balance of nature.” But should our lack of <span id="page544" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="544" data-before-text="544"></span>complete knowledge of God’s creation cause us to lose faith in him and his Word? Should we let questions about preying animals prey on us?</p>

<strong>Charm, II</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>Snake Charming.</strong> So-called snake charming can be a form of spiritism and is a survival of the ancient cult of serpent worshipers. The charmer is supposed to cast a spell over the serpent, often a hooded cobra, so it appears enchanted with the playing of music, usually on a flute or pipe instrument. Snakes are not deaf or hard of hearing, as some may think, but as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000926/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 58:4, 5</a> implies, they are able to hear the voice of charmers as well as the music. One might think that it is a mere trick of training the snake as one would train an animal or bird, by placing it in a basket with a lid, playing soft music, quickly dropping the lid if any attempt is made to escape, until the snake finally learns to raise itself upright in obedience to the music without trying to escape. While this may be true in some instances, spiritistic forces are often apparently involved in snake charming.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Attesting to the antiquity of this spiritistic practice is its mention in the Bible.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000926/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps 58:4, 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000926/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Ec 10:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000926/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Isa 3:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000926/7/3" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> Jer 8:17</a>.</p>

<strong>Cobra</strong><br/>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn"><strong><em>How can a cobra “listen to the voice of charmers”?</em></strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The Bible refers to the cobra’s ear and alludes to the cobra’s ability to “listen to the voice of charmers.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001000/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps 58:4, 5</a>) Since snakes lack surface ear openings and appeared to naturalists to be indifferent to sound, many have assumed that these reptiles are deaf. Commenting on this error, <em>The New Encyclopædia Britannica</em> (1987, Vol. 27, p. 159) states: “This supposition is incorrect; snakes are sensitive to some airborne sound waves and are able to receive them through a mechanism that serves as a substitute for the tympanic <span id="page486" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="486" data-before-text="486"></span>membrane. . . . Moreover, while the sensitivity of most snakes to the middle of the low-tone range is below that of most other types of ears, it is not seriously so. In a few snakes, however, the sensitivity is about as keen as in the majority of lizards with conventional types of ear openings and middle-ear mechanisms.”</p>

He asked a snake charmer to catch the wild snake and get it to dance. The author reports: “After I had assured my guest that there really was a cobra living there, he sat down in front of the termite hill and began to play his pipe. After a long time​—I no longer believed anything would happen—​the cobra raised its head several centimeters out of a hole. Before the snake could open its mouth the charmer hurried over and grabbed its head between his thumb and two fingers.” The Indian thereupon actually got the snake to dance.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Therefore, there is evidence that the cobra does “listen to the voice of charmers.”​—<em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures—​With References,</em> Appendix 7A, page 1583.</p>

The author reports: “After I had assured my guest that there really was a cobra living there, he sat down in front of the termite hill and began to play his pipe. After a long time​—I no longer believed anything would happen—​the cobra raised its head several centimeters out of a hole. Before the snake could open its mouth the charmer hurried over and grabbed its head between his thumb and two fingers.” The Indian thereupon actually got the snake to dance. In this instance at least, the cobra really did ‘listen to the voice of the charmer.’</p>

Thus the New York <em>Times</em> of January 10, 1954 (Sec. 4, p. 9), reported under the heading “Are Snakes ‘Charmed’ by Music?”:</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“Dr. David I. Macht, research pharmacologist of the Mount Sinai Hospital in Baltimore, is one of the world’s leading authorities on cobra snake venom. . . .

Contrary to the claims of some naturalists, Dr. Macht said, snakes are ‘charmed’ by sounds, not by movements of the charmer. Revise the textbooks, the physicians recommended.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The snake can best hear a vibration on the ground or notes of high pitch. Some of its most common preys make high-pitched sounds; these high-pitched notes produce great uneasiness and alarm in the snake. Thus notes produced by flutes only signify food or danger to the snake and do not meet with an appreciation of the music played. When a snake charmer starts playing on his flute, this immediately gets a reaction from the snake and it lifts itself erect, alert to danger. Recognizing the sound as coming from the flute, it will naturally fix its attention on that object and the one playing it. If the charmer moves or sways back and forth, the snake will do the same. If he moves around the snake in a circle, the snake will, of course, turn to keep its eyes on the source of the sound.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Pharaoh Tutankhamen, whose tomb was discovered in 1922, used the Egyptian cobra (<em>Naja haje</em>) as his imperial symbol.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Some cobras, such as the black-necked or spitting cobra of Africa, can spit or spray venom a distance of six to twelve feet (1.8 to 3.7 meters). The spitting cobras aim at the eyes of the victim and seldom miss their target. Spitting cobras appear to be able to eject their venom in rapid-fire salvos. One observer reports that in Tanganyika a black-necked cobra sprayed venom between a dozen and twenty times—in rapid succession.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"></p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Some animals have characteristics that seem especially suited to killing, such as lions and poisonous snakes. How can this be, if they were all vegetarians at one time?—L. K., Netherlands.</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It is understandable that this question might arise, for as things stand now many animals do kill one another for food. But please note that this is <em>as things stand now.</em> Is there anyone on the earth who can say from personal observation how these animals acted six thousand years ago?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Throughout the earth humans kill animals and eat their flesh. But does man’s ability to chew and digest meat prove that all men eat meat or that men have always eaten meat? No, for God’s Word, the oldest and most reliable history of mankind, shows that originally Jehovah gave man “all vegetation bearing seed” and “every tree on which there is the a fruit of a tree bearing seed” as food. It was not until over sixteen hundred years later that God permitted a change of diet for man, allowing him to hunt animals for food.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969648/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 1:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969648/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 9:2, 3</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">True, those who believe that man and animals evolved over a period of millions of years might not accept this, but it is what the Word of God says, and Jesus Christ said, “Your word is truth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969648/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 17:17</a>) If the present diet and mode of life of humans does not represent what it originally was, is it not possible that the same is true of animals?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">We must keep in mind that scientists are limited in their knowledge. Even if a man is an authority in some field of animal life, he does not know all there is to know about an animal as it now lives, to say nothing about how it lived thousands of years in the past. Those who are humble and sincere admit this. The very fact that scientists have different opinions proves the point.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">For instance, the question came up as to whether cobras can hear sounds. On November 27, 1968, an Associate Curator of Reptiles at one of the large zoological gardens in the United States wrote: “All snakes are unable to hear sounds; this also includes the Cobra.” That seems quite final. However, on the very same day the Curator and Chairman of the Department of Herpetology at the American Museum of Natural History explained: “It has been generally assumed . . . that snakes are deaf to air-borne sounds. Recent evidence has it, though, that some snakes can hear low-pitched sounds. How this relates to the cobra problem is uncertain. The weight of evidence is still in favor of the theory that it is movement rather than sound that influences the cobras, but <em>the matter certainly is not closed.”</em></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The Bible long ago indicated that the cobra hears the “voice of charmers,” but could refuse to listen just as a human can refuse to hear. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969648/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 58:4, 5</a>) Would it be wise to reject what the Bible says just because some scientists think the facts to be otherwise? The above quotations show that the answer is, No. Similarly, that certain current evidence does not seem to support what the Bible says about animal life in the past should not cause one to reject God’s inspired Word.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Another thing, is one justified in concluding that the way an animal uses its body today is the only possible way? As an example, a tiger uses its fangs and claws to catch, kill and tear apart other animals. Yet, could not these same fangs and claws be used in tearing apart heavy vegetation and ripping off husks and shells?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">‘But what about poisonous snakes?’ someone may ask. Animal poisons might appear to be just for killing or protection, but are they? In “Animal Poisoners” H. Munro Fox wrote: “In some cases we know that poisons play a role in the functioning of the body of the animal which manufactures them. In many instances this may be the real <em>raison d’être</em> [reason for existence] of the venoms, quite apart from any protective value. The poisonous spittle of snakes, for example, has work to do in the digestion of the snake’s food.” Another illustration is a certain green marine worm that is partly covered with a poisonous slime. Is this poison to protect it from being eaten? It might seem so. Yet if the young of this worm settle on this slime, the poison changes them into microscopic males instead of the large females they would have developed into if they settled on the sea floor.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">It is true that hundreds or even thousands of problem cases might be brought up, ones that <em>apparently</em> indicate that animals always killed one another, that this is necessary for the “balance of nature.” But should our lack of <span id="page544" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="544" data-before-text="544"></span>complete knowledge of God’s creation cause us to lose faith in him and his Word? Should we let questions about preying animals prey on us?</p>

The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ps. 92:10-12</a>, <em>AS</em>) The honor with which the horn is exalted comes from God, not from men. But men are forced to recognize the divine source of that honor. Ultimately the honor of lasting victory will be ours, but even now we enjoy the <span id="page762" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="762" data-before-text="762"></span>honor of being in Jehovah’s service as his witnesses. The great crowd of persons of good will who are already thronging Jehovah’s house to serve and worship him there are also a glory and honor to the Jehovah-fearing spiritual class who have labored to father this earthly seed or generation. As the apostle Paul said of the brothers at Thessalonica whom he had fathered by means of the good news that he had preached to them: “For what is our hope or joy or crown of exultation—why, is it not in fact you?—before our Lord Jesus at his presence? You certainly are our glory and joy.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 Thess. 2:19, 20</a>, <em>NW</em>) By our continuing to give the Kingdom good news freely and generously to the poor and needy, that honor of increased membership in the New World society at God’s temple is bound to be added to until Jehovah exalts our horn as victors at Armageddon.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">17. Why does the wicked, at seeing this, grieve?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> The wicked haters of Jehovah have gloated over seeing us under oppressions, injustices, bans and proscriptions, but their gleeful gloating is turning to chagrin and dismay at seeing the increasing honor that Jehovah confers upon his people who fear and serve him and magnify his name. Ah well, this was all foretold in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 112:10</a> (<em>AS</em>): “The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.” The wicked is destined to see this crowning victory and honor of Jehovah’s witnesses before he is destroyed. He is ill-willed and has no love of righteousness and hence does not rejoice at the exalted horn of Jehovah’s righteous fearers. This is why he seeks to destroy the spiritual prosperity of the restored spiritual Israelites and their companions of good will. He takes offense at Jehovah’s goodness to his people. He wants the worldly favor and success and the divine favor and spiritual prosperity also, but he cannot have both at the same time. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Jas. 4:4</a>) He does not scatter abroad and give the Kingdom message to the poor. So he is discontented. His consciousness of being rich in worldly goods and favor does not fully satisfy him, for he has only the form of godliness but proves false to its power to transform the heart and make one truly happy. Eaten up with envy at the spiritual prosperity of the witnesses, he grieves.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">18. Why does the wicked gnash his teeth, and when and how will he melt away?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> The wicked cannot overthrow the spiritual prosperity of those who fear Jehovah. He gnashes or grinds his teeth at the sight he is obliged to behold, but that is all he can do in his rage. He cannot truly harm the righteous or destroy the New World society. He suffers torment now, not only from the preaching of the good news of God’s established kingdom but also at the prosperity of Jehovah’s witnesses. In 1955 he will keep on grinding his teeth in his rage and prepare to join the great Gog of Magog in his world-wide pre-Armageddon assault on the New World society. When Jehovah stops that furious, malicious assault by the “war of the great day of God the Almighty,” the wicked crowd will still not see the desire of their eyes but will have one last look at a sight grievous to their eyes, the enduring prosperity of Jehovah’s witnesses and the triumph of the New World society on earth. Then the wicked will ‘melt away,’ yes, melt like a snail that leaves a slimy trail. They will melt like a snail, which, as it moves, “dissolves into slime.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ps. 58:8</a>, <em>RS; Mo</em>) Just as a snail is halted by the salt sprinkled about its haunts, what can the slimy wicked do against the fearers of Jehovah who are like the “salt of the earth”? Nothing, only melt away in an inglorious end at the <span id="page763" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="763" data-before-text="763"></span>grand display of Jehovah’s battle power at Armageddon.</p>

<strong>Traitor</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Another outstanding example of a traitor listed in the Bible was Ahithophel. Though having been King David’s trusted counselor, he joined Absalom’s insurrection.

God thwarted the traitorous adviser’s counsel, leading to Ahithophel’s death by suicide. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004464/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2Sa 17:23</a>) Evidently David had other experiences with persons who turned against him. A number of modern Bible translations render the plural Hebrew participial form of <em>ba·ghadhʹ</em> (meaning “deal treacherously”) as “traitors” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004464/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 59:5</a>: “Do not show favor to any hurtful traitors.” (<em>JB, NE, NW, Mo</em>) The superscription of the psalm suggests that it relates to the time when Saul sent men to watch David’s house in order to kill him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004464/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1Sa 19:11-18</a>) So the “traitors” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004464/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 59:5</a> may have been associates of David who had deserted him or who were willing to betray him in that hour of trial. Or, since the preceding words call on God to turn his attention to “all the nations,” the term “traitors” may have referred to all opposers of God’s will, whether inside or outside Israel.</p>

Concerning these fortunate people it is written: “Happy are the men whose strength is in [Jehovah] . . . They will walk on from vital energy to vital energy.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961523/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 84:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961523/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 7</a>) Upon seeing all the marvelous wonders of Jehovah’s creative activity these energetic happy people exclaim: “For you have made me rejoice, O Jehovah, because of your activity; because of the works of your hands I cry out joyfully.

No unreasoning man himself can know them, and no one stupid can understand this.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961523/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 92:4-6</a>.</p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">24.

But let them continue to do so. Let the godless scientists and technologists of this old world’s system of things continue their ceaseless search for new sources of material fuel and power. Let the proud and arrogant researchers and explorers continue their probing of outer space. Let all these stupid ones, whether they are of the Eastern, Western or Neutral bloc of nations, continue to harden their stony hearts against the only true Source of all dynamic energy and vigorous power. Yet Jehovah says to them: “How dare you people say: ‘We are mighty men and men of vital energy for the war’?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961523/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Jer. 48:14</a>) What war is He speaking about? Why, the fast-approaching war of Armageddon, “the war of the great day of God the Almighty,” which is now so very near. It is then that Jehovah will answer the supplication of the righteous who pray: “By your vital energy make them wander about, and bring them down, O our shield Jehovah, for the sin of their mouth, the word of their lips; and may they be caught in their pride, even for the cursing and the lying that they rehearse. Bring them to an end in rage, bring them to an end, that they may not be, and may they know that God is ruling in Jacob to the ends of the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961523/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Rev. 16:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961523/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961523/16/2" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> Ps. 59:11-13</a>.</p>

How noble that he took up the cause of the poor and uplifted and comforted them!</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sd">Those who are determined to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many senseless and hurtful desires which plunge men into destruction and ruin. For the love of money is a root of all sorts of injurious things, and by reaching out for this love some have been led astray from the faith and have stabbed themselves all over with many pains.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951125/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:9, 10</a>, <em>NW.</em></p>
