<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Whether a married couple will have unfailing love as long as they live depends on them. To illustrate, a campfire has the potential to burn indefinitely​—but only if it is fed. If left unattended, the fire will eventually go out. Likewise, the love between a husband and wife can remain strong indefinitely​—but only if they nurture their relationship. At times, a couple could feel that their love is cooling off, especially when they are weighed down by financial hardship, health concerns, or the pressures of raising children. So if you are married, how can you keep “the flame of Jah” alive in your marriage? In this article, we will discuss three ways to keep your relationship strong and enjoy a happy marriage.<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2023405/2">c</a></p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Consider a Bible example. When Jehovah had to choose a couple to be the parents of the future Messiah, He chose Joseph and Mary out of the many descendants of David. Why? They both had a personal relationship with Jehovah, and Jehovah knew that they would build their marriage around their love for him. Married couples, what can you learn from Joseph and from Mary?</p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>5.</strong><strong> What can husbands learn from Joseph?</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Joseph readily applied Jehovah’s direction, and that made him a better husband. On at least three occasions, he received instructions from God regarding his family. Each time, he obeyed promptly, even when it meant making big changes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023405/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 1:20,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023405/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023405/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 2:13-15,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023405/4/3" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 19-21</a>) By following God’s direction, Joseph protected Mary, supported her, and provided for her. Imagine how Joseph’s actions must have deepened Mary’s love and respect for him! Husbands, you can imitate Joseph by seeking Bible-based advice on caring for your family.<a id="footnotesource4" data-fnid="4" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2023405/3">d</a> When you apply this advice, even if it means making changes, you show love for your wife and you strengthen your marriage. A sister in Vanuatu who has been married for over 20 years says: “When my husband seeks and applies Jehovah’s direction, I respect him more. I feel secure, and I have confidence in his decisions.”</p><br/>&nbsp;

She knew the Scriptures well. (See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/2023405/1/0">study note on Luke 1:46</a>.) She also made time for meditation.

Today, many wives strive to do as Mary did. For example, a sister named Emiko says: “When I was single, I had my personal spiritual routine. But after getting married, I realized that because my husband prayed for us and took the lead in worship, my faith had become dependent on what he did. I came to see that I needed to carry my own load regarding my relationship with Jehovah.

What an excellent example for married couples today! If you have children, as did Joseph and Mary, it may be challenging to attend meetings or to schedule time for family worship. It may be even harder to coordinate time to study or pray together as a couple. Yet, remember that when you worship Jehovah together, you draw closer to him and to each other. So make worship a priority.</p><br/>&nbsp;

Think about the many things that you and your spouse need to do. Could you handle some of these tasks as a couple instead of individually? For example, Aquila and Priscilla preached together.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023405/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Eccl. 4:9</a>) When you help each other perform a task, you feel more like a team and you have the opportunity to talk.

A wife in Brazil says: “Nowadays, with so many distractions, I’ve found that we could fall into the trap of thinking that we are spending time together just because we live under the same roof. I have learned that being together is only half of the equation. The other half involves giving my spouse the attention he needs.” Note how Bruno and his wife, Tays, make sure to give each other attention.

It is like the oxygen that allows a campfire to burn brightly. Without oxygen, a fire quickly goes out. Similarly, without respect, a couple will find that their love can quickly grow cold. On the other hand, a husband and wife who strive to show respect for each other are working to keep their love alive. Yet, bear in mind that it is, not a matter of whether <strong><em>you</em></strong> think that you show respect, but a matter of whether your <strong><em>spouse</em></strong> feels respected. Penny and Aret have been married for over 25 years. She says: “Our mutual respect creates a warm atmosphere in our home. We feel free to express ourselves because we know that we value each other’s opinions.” So, what can you do to help your spouse feel that you really respect him or her?

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> Today, Satan wants to extinguish the love that exists in Christian marriages. He knows that if a couple lose their love for each other, they may begin to draw away from Jehovah. However, <strong><em>true</em></strong> love cannot be extinguished! So may the love in your marriage be like the love described in the Song of Solomon. Be resolved to build your life together around Jehovah, make time for each other, and respect each other’s feelings and needs. As you do, your marriage will bring honor to the Source of true love, Jehovah, and just like a well-tended fire, your love will blaze indefinitely.</p><br/>&nbsp;
