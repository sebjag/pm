<div class="padding"><strong>[a]</strong> Footnote: 	<a href="#footnotesource1" class="fn-symbol">a</a> Gideon was appointed by Jehovah to shepherd and to protect His people during a very difficult period in the history of the nation of Israel. Gideon faithfully carried out that assignment for some 40 years. However, he faced a number of challenges. We will discuss how his example can help elders today when they face tests.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> In caring for their responsibilities, elders face many challenges. For one thing, caring for a congregation involves a great deal of work. Tony, an elder in the United States, had to learn to be more modest when it came to the amount of work he accepted. He explains: “At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, I took on more and more work to organize meetings and the ministry. But no matter how much I did, there was always more to do. Eventually, my Bible reading, personal study, and prayer started to slip.” Ilir, an elder in Kosovo, faced a different challenge. When he was in a war zone, he found it difficult to obey theocratic direction. He says: “My courage was tested when the branch office offered me an assignment to help the brothers and sisters in a dangerous area. I was afraid, and the direction did not seem practical.” Tim, a missionary in Asia, found it hard just to keep up with the pace day after day. He says: “At times, I felt mentally and emotionally exhausted.” What can help elders who are facing similar challenges?</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>4.</strong><strong> How did Gideon show modesty and humility?</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Gideon was a modest and humble man.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2023440/1">b</a> When Jehovah’s angel told Gideon that he had been chosen to deliver Israel from the powerful Midianites, that humble man replied: “My clan is the least in Manasseh, and I am the most insignificant in my father’s house.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023440/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Judg. 6:15</a>) He felt unqualified for the assignment, but Jehovah knew better.

I also reviewed on jw.org the video <a href="https://www.jw.org/finder?lank=pub-jwbcov_201505_9_VIDEO&amp;wtlocale=E" data-video="webpubvid://?pub=jwbcov&amp;issue=201505&amp;track=9"><em>Train, Trust, and Empower Others, as Jesus Does</em></a><em>.”</em> Tony began to invite others to help with his workload.

Elders might at times reflect on whether they are drawing undue attention to themselves. Consider the experience of an elder named Timothy. When newly appointed, Timothy loved giving public talks. He says: “I would come up with elaborate introductions and illustrations. These often drew praise from others. Unfortunately, the attention tended to be on me instead of on the Bible or Jehovah.” In time, Timothy saw the need to adjust his teaching style in order to avoid drawing undue attention to himself. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023440/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Prov. 27:21</a>) With what result? He explains: “Different ones tell me how my talk has helped them to cope with a problem, to endure a trial, or to draw closer to Jehovah. I get more joy from those comments than I ever did from the praise that was directed to me years ago.”</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Be willing to adjust.</em></strong> Recall that at Jehovah’s request, Gideon reduced his army by more than 99 percent. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023440/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Judg. 7:8</a>) He may have thought: ‘Is this change really necessary? Will this work?’ Nevertheless, Gideon obeyed. Elders today imitate Gideon by implementing recommended changes in theocratic direction. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023440/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><strong>Hebrews 13:17</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> As an example, in 2014 the Governing Body changed the way Kingdom Hall and Assembly Hall construction projects are financed. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023440/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">2 Cor. 8:12-14</a>) Congregations would no longer repay a loan. Instead, congregations worldwide would pool their resources so that theocratic facilities could be constructed wherever they were needed, regardless of the local congregation’s ability to pay. When José learned of the change, he doubted that it would work, thinking: ‘Not even one Kingdom Hall will ever be built. This is not how things are done in this part of the world.’ What helped José to support the direction? He says: “The words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023440/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:5, 6</a> reminded me to trust in Jehovah. And the results have been wonderful! Not only are we building more Kingdom Halls but we have learned to contribute in different ways so that an equalizing takes place.”</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> Consider the experience of Matthew, a member of a Hospital Liaison Committee. What helps him to endure? Matthew says: “I have experienced the reality of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023440/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Philippians 4:13</a>. Many times when tired and completely spent, I have prayed intensely, begging God for the physical and mental energy that I need to support my brothers. In those moments, I have felt Jehovah’s spirit energize me, helping me to endure.” Like Gideon, our devoted elders may face obstacles while unselfishly shepherding the flock. Granted, they need to recognize their physical and emotional limits and work within those limits. They can, though, trust that Jehovah will hear their requests for help and will strengthen them to endure.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023440/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Ps. 116:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023440/32/1" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> Phil. 2:13</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> There are timely and practical lessons that elders can learn from Gideon. Elders ought to display modesty and humility in both the amount of work they take on and the way they respond to criticism or praise. They must display obedience and courage, especially as the end of this system of things draws near. And they need to trust that no matter what obstacles they may face, God can strengthen them. Certainly, we appreciate such hardworking shepherds and “keep holding men of that sort dear.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023440/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Phil. 2:29</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;
