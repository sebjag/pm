<br/>We will consider three of Jesus’ parables and discuss how they relate to the time of judgment that will occur at the end of this system of things.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/> <strong>2.</strong><strong> On what will we focus our attention, and why will this help us?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Jesus provided helpful warnings by means of three parables. These are the parables of the sheep and the goats, the discreet and the foolish virgins, and the talents. Each parable helps us to understand how a person’s behavior will affect the way he will be judged. As we review these parables, let us identify the lessons and how we can apply them. The first parable we will discuss is that of the sheep and the goats.

<br/> <strong>3.</strong><strong> When will Jesus judge people?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> In the parable of the sheep and the goats, Jesus described the judgment of people who have the opportunity to respond to the good news and to support his anointed brothers. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024566/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 25:31-46</a>) During the “great tribulation,” he will render this judgment right before Armageddon.

<br/> <strong>5.</strong><strong> What is the lesson of the parable of the sheep and the goats, and who should be interested in it?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Prove yourself faithful and loyal.</em></strong> Jesus’ parable of the sheep and the goats focuses primarily on those who have the earthly hope. They express their faith not only by assisting Christ’s brothers in the preaching work but also by loyally accepting the lead of the small group of anointed brothers whom Jesus has selected. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024566/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45</a>) But those with a heavenly hope also need to heed the warning message of the parable. Why? Because Jesus takes note of their conduct, attitude, and speech. They too must prove faithful. In fact, Jesus related two other parables that contain specific warnings for the anointed. We also find these parables in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024566/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matthew chapter 25</a>. Let us next discuss the parable of the discreet and the foolish virgins.

Jesus described five of them as “discreet” and the other five as “foolish.” The discreet virgins were prepared and vigilant. They were ready to wait for the bridegroom as long as needed, even if he arrived late at night. Thus, they brought oil lamps to provide light in the dark. They even brought extra oil in case the bridegroom should delay.

<br/><strong>18-19.</strong><strong> What lessons and warnings have we considered?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> What have we considered? For those who hope to live forever on earth, the parable of the sheep and the goats highlights the need to remain <strong><em>faithful and loyal</em></strong> to Jehovah​—now and during the upcoming great tribulation. At that future time, Jesus will judge faithful ones as being worthy of departing “into everlasting life.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024566/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Matt. 25:46</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> We also reviewed two parables that provide warnings for the anointed. In <span id="page25" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>Jesus’ parable of the discreet and the foolish virgins, five of them proved to be wise. They were <strong><em>prepared and vigilant,</em></strong> ready to wait for the bridegroom as long as needed. But the foolish virgins were unprepared. So the bridegroom refused to allow them into his marriage feast. We too must be prepared to wait for however long it takes until Jesus brings an end to this system of things. Also, in Jesus’ parable of the talents, we considered the two faithful slaves who were <strong><em>industrious and diligent.</em></strong> They worked hard in behalf of their master and earned his approval. However, the sluggish slave was rejected. The lesson? We must keep busy in Jehovah’s service right up to the end. Finally, we considered how anointed ones must remain <strong><em>watchful</em></strong> in order to be “taken along” by Jesus to their heavenly reward. With great anticipation, such ones look forward to “being gathered together” to Jesus in heaven. After the war of Armageddon, they will share as Jesus’ bride in the marriage of the Lamb.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024566/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">2 Thess. 2:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024566/32/1" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> Rev. 19:9</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><strong>20.</strong><strong> What will Jehovah do for those who heed his warnings?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><strong><sup>20</sup></strong></span> Though judgment is fast approaching, there is no reason for us to be afraid. If we remain faithful, our loving heavenly Father will give us “the power beyond what is normal” so that we “may succeed . . . in standing before the Son of man.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024566/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024566/33/1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> Luke 21:36</a>) Whether our hope is heavenly or earthly, we will please our Father if we heed the warnings found in Jesus’ parables. Through Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, our names will be “found written down in the book” of life.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024566/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Dan. 12:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024566/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> Rev. 3:5</a>.
