<div class="padding"><strong>[b]</strong> Footnote: 	<a href="#footnotesource2" class="fn-symbol">b</a> EXPRESSION EXPLAINED: In this article and in the next, “courtship” refers to the time during which a man and a woman become better acquainted in order to determine whether they would be compatible as marriage mates. In some countries, it is also referred to as dating, getting to know someone, or a romantic relationship. Courtship begins when a man and a woman make clear that they are romantically interested in each other, and it continues until either they make a commitment to get married or they end the courtship.

A sister from Macao named Sin Yi says: “Compared with the time you could spend with your spouse in Paradise, the time being single is relatively short. Treasure that time, and make good use of it.” But what if you have found a potential mate and have begun courting? In the next article, we will discuss how you can have a successful courtship.</p><br/>&nbsp;
