How, though, would you explain to others why you believe in that promise? And how can you make the resurrection hope even more real to you?

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>1.</strong><strong> How did one boy express his hope in the resurrection?</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>A BOY named Matthew has a serious medical condition that has required many surgeries. When he was seven years old, he and his family were watching a monthly program on JW Broadcasting<sup>®</sup>. Toward the end of the program, they saw a music video about welcoming loved ones back in the resurrection.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2023361/1">b</a> After the program, Matthew approached his parents, held their hands, and said: “You see, Mom and Dad? Even if I die, I will wake up in the resurrection. You can wait for me; it will be OK.” Can you imagine how those parents must have felt when they learned how real the resurrection hope is to their son?</p><br/>&nbsp;

<h2 id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>WHY WE CAN BELIEVE IN THE RESURRECTION PROMISE</strong></h2><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>4.</strong><strong> To believe in a promise, of what must we be convinced? Illustrate.</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> To believe in a promise, we must be convinced that the one making the promise has the <strong><em>desire</em></strong> as well as the <strong><em>power,</em></strong> or ability, to fulfill it. To illustrate: Imagine that your house has been badly damaged by a storm. A friend comes to you and promises, ‘I am going to help you rebuild your house.’ He is sincere, and you are convinced that he has the desire to help you. If he is a skilled builder and has the needed tools, you know that he also has the ability. So you believe in his promise. What, then, about God’s promise of a resurrection? Does he really have the desire and the power to fulfill it?</p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>5-6.</strong><strong> Why can we be sure that Jehovah has the <strong><em>desire</em></strong> to resurrect the dead?</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Does Jehovah have the <strong><em>desire</em></strong> to resurrect the dead? Without question, he does. He inspired a number of Bible writers to record his promise of a future resurrection.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023361/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Josh. 23:14</a>) Jehovah is, in fact, eager to restore the dead to life. Why can we say that?</p><br/>&nbsp;

What about the billions who have died without having a chance to learn the truth about Jehovah? Our loving God wants to resurrect them too. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023361/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 24:15</a>) He wants them to have the opportunity to become his friends and live forever on earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023361/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>) Clearly, Jehovah has the desire to resurrect the dead.</p><br/>&nbsp;

They send a message to Jesus, who is across the Jordan, about a two-day walk from Bethany. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023361/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">John 10:40</a>) Sadly, Lazarus dies about the time the messenger reaches Jesus. Even though Jesus knows that his friend has just died, he remains where he is for two more days and then he makes the trip to Bethany. So by the time Jesus arrives, Lazarus has been dead for four days. Jesus intends to do something that will benefit his friends and glorify God.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023361/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">John 11:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023361/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023361/19/2" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023361/19/3" data-bid="20-4" class="b"> 17</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

Consider: When Mary and Martha sent the message to Jesus, they did not ask him to come to Bethany. They simply said that his dear friend was sick. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023361/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">John 11:3</a>) When Lazarus died, Jesus could have resurrected him from a distance. Yet, Jesus chose to go to Bethany to be with his friends Mary and Martha. Do you have a friend who will come to your aid without being asked? Then you know that you can count on him for help in “times of distress.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023361/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Prov. 17:17</a>) Like Jesus, may we be such a friend to others!

How so? Recall Jesus’ promise to Martha: “Your brother will rise.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023361/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">John 11:23</a>) Like his Father, Jesus has the desire and the power to fulfill that promise. His tears revealed that he has a heartfelt yearning to undo death and the sorrow that it causes. And the moment Lazarus walked out of the tomb, Jesus again proved that he has the power to raise the dead. Also, think about Jesus’ reminder to Martha: “Did I not tell you that if you would <strong><em>believe</em></strong> you would <strong><em>see</em></strong> the glory of God?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023361/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">John 11:40</a>) We have sound reasons for believing that God’s promise of a resurrection will come true. What, though, can we do to make this hope even more real to us?</p><br/>&nbsp;
