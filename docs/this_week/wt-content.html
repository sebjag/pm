Even so, when Abraham was 100 years of age and his wife was 90, that faithful couple still did not have a son. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023681/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 21:1-7</a>) Yet, the Bible says: “Based on hope, [Abraham] had faith that he would become the father of many nations according to what had been said.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023681/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rom. 4:18</a>) You know that Abraham’s hope was realized.
