It is simply thrilling to read about the miracles Jesus performed! Those accounts are recorded in the Bible, not to entertain us, but to teach us. As we review them, we learn faith-strengthening lessons about Jehovah and Jesus and identify godly qualities that we do well to cultivate.

<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>1.</strong><strong> Describe the setting in which Jesus performed his first miracle.</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>PICTURE the scene in late 29 C.E. at the start of Jesus’ ministry. Jesus and his mother, Mary, and some of his disciples are invited to a wedding feast in Cana, a village north of Jesus’ hometown of Nazareth. Mary is a friend of the family and is apparently helping to care for the guests. But during the wedding feast, a problem arises that could greatly embarrass the family and the young couple​—the wine runs out.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2023360/1">b</a> Perhaps the number of guests is greater than expected. Mary quickly turns to her son and says: “They have no wine.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023360/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 2:1-3</a>) What does Jesus do? Something extraordinary​—he miraculously turns water into “fine wine.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023360/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 2:9, 10</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<div class="padding"><strong>[b]</strong> Footnote: 	<a href="#footnotesource2" class="fn-symbol">b</a> A Bible scholar explains: “Hospitality in the East was a sacred duty and it was not deemed sufficient to set before people that which was just enough. Real hospitality, especially at a wedding feast, demanded superabundance.”

For example, just two of his miracles​—feeding 5,000 men and later 4,000 men—​may have involved a total of over 27,000 people if we include the women and children who were also present.

On one occasion, two blind men cried out to him for help. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023360/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 20:30-34</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Notice that Jesus was “moved with pity” and then he healed them. As used here, the Greek verb translated “moved with pity” refers to an intense compassion felt deep inside the body. Such deep compassion, which is an expression of love, also moved Jesus to feed the hungry and to cure a leper.

<h2 id="p15" data-pid="15"><strong>A LESSON IN HUMILITY</strong></h2><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>9.</strong><strong> What did Jesus do at the wedding feast? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023360/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">John 2:6-10</a>)</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;

No. There was no prophecy foretelling that the Messiah would miraculously produce wine. But just imagine how you would feel if the beverages ran out at your own wedding. Jesus likely felt compassion for the family, especially the bride and groom, and wanted to spare them embarrassment. <span id="page5" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>So, as mentioned at the outset, he performed a miracle. He turned water​—some 390 liters (103 gal)—​into the finest wine. Perhaps he provided such a generous amount so that some would be left over for future use or could even be sold to help the young couple financially. How relieved the newly married couple must have been!</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> Consider another way we can imitate Jesus’ humility. Imagine this scenario: An elder spends much time helping a young ministerial servant prepare for his first public talk. As a result, the young brother gives an encouraging talk, to the delight of the congregation. After the meeting, someone comes up to the elder and says: ‘Brother So-and-so gave an excellent talk, didn’t he?’ Does the elder need to say: ‘Yes, but I spent a lot of time helping him’? Or might he humbly say: ‘Yes, he did. I’m so proud of him’? When we are humble, we do not have to take credit for the good things we do for others. We are content with knowing that Jehovah sees and values what we do. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023360/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matthew 6:2-4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023360/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Heb. 13:16</a>) Surely, we please Jehovah when we imitate Jesus in showing humility.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023360/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:6</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

The song mentioned the resurrection hope, and that mother had recently lost her young daughter in death. Knowing that, the sister immediately went over, put her arm around the mother, and sang the rest of the song with her. The mother later recalled: “I felt so full of love for the brothers and sisters.” She was very grateful that she had gone to the meeting. “That’s where our help is,” she said, “there at the Kingdom Hall.” We can be sure that Jehovah notices and values even the simple things we do to show compassion to bereaved ones, who are “crushed in spirit.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023360/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ps. 34:18</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

They teach us that Jehovah and Jesus deeply love us, that Jesus has the power to solve all mankind’s problems, and that we can have full confidence in the promised Kingdom blessings so near at hand. As we analyze those accounts, we can meditate on ways we might imitate Jesus’ qualities. Why not schedule a personal study project or a Family Worship session that focuses on other miracles of Jesus? See what lessons you can glean, and then share what you learn with others.
