Daniel was a very courageous young man. Consider two occasions on which he showed courage. The first likely happened about two years after the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem. King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had a disturbing dream about an immense image. He threatened to kill all his wise men, including Daniel, if they could not tell him what he had dreamed and also give the interpretation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023520/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Dan. 2:3-5</a>) Daniel had to act quickly; otherwise, lives would be lost. He “went in and asked the king to grant him time to tell the interpretation to the king.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023520/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Dan. 2:16</a>) That took courage and faith. There is no record that Daniel had ever interpreted dreams before. He asked his companions​—whose Babylonian names were Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego—​“to pray for mercy from the God of heaven concerning this secret.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023520/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Dan. 2:18</a>) Jehovah answered those prayers. With God’s help, Daniel interpreted Nebuchadnezzar’s dream. Daniel’s life and the lives of his companions were spared.</p><br/>&nbsp;

Nebuchadnezzar had another troubling dream. This dream involved a gigantic tree. Daniel courageously explained to the king the meaning of the dream, including the pronouncement that the king would go mad and lose his throne for a period of time.

<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong><strong> What else helped Daniel to have courage? (See also picture.)</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Daniel studied the writings of God’s prophets, including the prophecies of Jeremiah. From that study, Daniel later discerned that the long captivity of the Jews in Babylon was soon to end. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023520/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Dan. 9:2</a>) Seeing Bible prophecy come true no doubt strengthened Daniel’s trust in Jehovah, and those who have strong trust in God can be remarkably courageous. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023520/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Romans 8:31, 32,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023520/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 37-39</a>.) Most important, Daniel prayed to his heavenly Father often. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023520/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Dan. 6:10</a>) He confessed his sins to Jehovah and shared his feelings with Him. And Daniel asked for help.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> To develop courage, what do we need to do? Our parents may urge us to be courageous, but they cannot pass this quality on to us as if it were a family heirloom. Gaining courage is like learning a new skill. One way you can master the skill is by closely watching the instructor’s actions and then copying his example. In a similar way, we learn to be courageous by closely looking at how others show this quality and then copying their example. So, what have we learned from Daniel? Like him, we need to know God’s Word well. We must form a close bond with Jehovah by talking to him freely and often. And we need to trust in Jehovah, being convinced that we have his backing. Then when our faith is tested, we will be courageous.</p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> <strong>9.</strong><strong> How do we benefit from being courageous?</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> We benefit in a number of ways from being courageous. Consider the experience of Ben. He attended a school in Germany where everyone believed in evolution and felt that the creation account in the Bible is a myth. One day, Ben was given the opportunity to stand in front of the class and explain why he believed that life was created. He courageously presented his beliefs. With what result? “My teacher listened carefully,” says Ben, “and he made copies of the material that I used to support my argument and gave one to every student in the class.” How did Ben’s classmates react? “Many of them were open-minded,” <span id="page5" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>says Ben, “and they said that they admired me.” As Ben’s experience shows, courageous people often gain the respect of others. They may also attract honesthearted people to Jehovah. Certainly, we have good reasons to develop courage.</p><br/>&nbsp;

But one of the greatest tests came when he was in his 90’s. By this time, Babylon had been captured by the Medes and the Persians and was ruled by King Darius. Members of the royal court disliked Daniel and had little respect for the God he worshipped. So they devised a plot to have Daniel killed. They had a decree issued that would test whether Daniel would be loyal to his God or to the king. All Daniel had to do to prove his loyalty to the king and to blend in with everyone else was stop praying to Jehovah for 30 days. Daniel refused to compromise. As a result, he was thrown into the lions’ pit. But Jehovah rewarded Daniel’s loyalty by rescuing him from the mouth of the lions.

Such people may dislike anyone who claims to love God. Some even try to bully our young ones into breaking their loyalty to Jehovah. Note, for example, what happened to a young man named Graeme, who lives in Australia. He faced a challenging situation when he attended high school. The teacher asked the class how they would react if a friend confided in them about being a homosexual. The teacher said that all in the class who would support a friend in pursuing such a lifestyle must stand on one side of the room; those who would not, on the other side. Graeme says, “The entire class stood on the side that supported that lifestyle except for me and another Witness.” What happened next was a real test of Graeme’s loyalty to Jehovah. “For the rest of the hour-long class,” he says, “the other students and even the teacher taunted and insulted us. I did my best to defend my faith in a calm and reasonable way, but they didn’t listen to a word I said.” What effect did this test of loyalty have on Graeme? He says, “I did not like being the target of such verbal attacks, but I felt incredibly happy that I was able to defend my beliefs without compromise.”<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2023520/2">c</a></p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> We can develop unbreakable loyalty to Jehovah if, like Daniel, we form a deep love for Him. We develop that love by learning about Jehovah’s qualities. For example, we can study the things he has made. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023520/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Rom. 1:20</a>) If you would like to deepen your love and respect for Jehovah, you could read the brief articles in the series “<a href="https://www.jw.org/finder?docID=1011554&amp;prefer=content&amp;wtlocale=E" class="fb">Was It Designed?</a>” or watch the videos. You could also go over the material in the brochures <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/2023520/2/0"><em>Was Life Created?</em></a> and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/2023520/3/0"><em>The Origin of Life​—Five Questions Worth Asking</em></a><em>.</em> Note what a young Danish sister named Esther says about those publications: “The reasoning is fantastic. The brochures don’t tell you what to believe; they simply present the facts and let you make a decision.” Ben, quoted earlier, says: “This material was very faith-strengthening. It proved to me that God created life.” After studying this material, you will likely agree with the Bible when it says: “You are worthy, Jehovah our God, to receive the glory and the honor and the power, because you created all things.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023520/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Rev. 4:11</a>.<a id="footnotesource4" data-fnid="4" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2023520/3">d</a></p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> Another way to develop a deep love for Jehovah is by closely examining the life of his Son, Jesus. A young sister named Samira, who lives in Germany, <span id="page7" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>did this. She says: “I came to know Jehovah better through Jesus.” When she was a child, Samira struggled to understand how Jehovah could have feelings. But she could relate to Jesus. “I liked Jesus because he was friendly and loved children,” she adds. The more she learned about Jesus, the more she formed a bond with Jehovah. Why? She says: “I slowly understood that Jesus perfectly imitates his Father. They are a lot alike. I realized that this was one of the reasons why Jehovah sent Jesus to the earth, to make it possible for mankind to get to know Jehovah better.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023520/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">John 14:9</a>) If you want to strengthen your bond with Jehovah, why not spend time learning all you can about Jesus?
