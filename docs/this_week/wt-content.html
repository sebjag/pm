<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>1.</strong><strong> What was the prophet Isaiah’s message to his fellow Israelites?</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>THE prophet Isaiah described Jehovah as “the God of truth.” The word translated “truth” literally means “amen.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023640/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 65:16</a>, ftn.) “Amen” means “so be it,” or “surely.” When the word “amen” is used in the Bible with regard to Jehovah or Jesus, it is a guarantee that something is true. Thus, Isaiah’s message to his fellow Israelites was clear: What Jehovah foretells is always trustworthy. Jehovah has proved that fact by fulfilling every one of his promises.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>2.</strong><strong> Why can we trust in Jehovah’s promises regarding our future, and what questions will we consider?</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Can we put the same trust in Jehovah’s promises regarding our future? Nearly 800 years after Isaiah’s time, the apostle Paul explained why God’s promises are always trustworthy. Paul stated: “It is impossible for God to lie.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023640/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb. 6:18</a>) Just as a spring cannot produce both fresh water and salt water, so Jehovah, the Source of truth, cannot speak lies. Thus, we can have complete trust in everything that Jehovah says, including all his promises for our future. In this article, we will consider these questions: What has Jehovah promised to give us in the future? And what guarantee has Jehovah provided that his promise will come true?</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"> <strong>9.</strong><strong> (a) The phrase “making all things new” refers to what two activities of Jehovah? (b) What will happen to the existing “heaven” and “earth”?</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Let us examine the next phrase found at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023640/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Revelation 21:5</a>: “Making all things new.” In this Bible chapter, that phrase refers to two activities of Jehovah​—replacing and restoring. First, what would Jehovah replace? At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023640/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Revelation 21:1</a>, we read: “The former heaven and the former earth had passed away.” “The former heaven” refers to political governments influenced by Satan and his demons. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023640/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 4:8, 9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023640/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 1 John 5:19</a>) As used in the Bible, “earth” can refer to the earth’s inhabitants. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023640/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Gen. 11:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023640/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Ps. 96:1</a>) Thus, “the former earth” refers to today’s wicked human society. Jehovah will not merely remodel, or fix up, the existing “heaven” and “earth”; rather, he will make a clean sweep by replacing them. He will replace the present heaven and the present earth with “a new heaven and a new earth”​—that is, a new government and a new human society.</p><br/>&nbsp;

It appeared as if Satan had made it impossible for Jehovah ever to say “Omega.” Satan might have thought that Jehovah had very few options left. One option was to put Adam and Eve to death and create another perfect couple to fulfill His purpose for mankind. But if God had done that, the Devil would have accused Him of being a liar. Why? Because, as recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023640/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Genesis 1:28</a>, Jehovah had told Adam and Eve that <strong><em>their</em></strong> offspring would fill the earth.</p><br/>&nbsp;

By the end of the Millennium, perfect, obedient descendants of Adam and Eve will inhabit a paradise earth​—just as Jehovah originally purposed. At that time, Jehovah will say, as it were, “Omega.”</p><br/>&nbsp;

First, Jehovah himself makes the promise. The book of Revelation states: “The One seated on the throne said: ‘Look! I am making all things new.’” He has the wisdom, the power, and the desire to make his promise come true. Second, the fulfillment of his promise is so certain that from Jehovah’s viewpoint, it has already happened. He rightly says: “These words are faithful and true. . . . They have come to pass!” Third, when Jehovah starts something, he brings it to its successful conclusion, as confirmed by the expression: “I am the Alpha and the Omega.” Jehovah will prove that Satan is a liar and a failure.</p>
