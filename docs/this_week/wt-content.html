No, that was not his point. Rather, he meant that we need to get rid of every <strong><em>unnecessary</em></strong> weight. This type of weight could hinder us and cause us to tire out. To endure, we must quickly identify and discard any unnecessary weight that could slow us down. At the same time, however, we do not want to cast aside loads that we should carry. Otherwise, we could disqualify ourselves from the race. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023528/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Tim. 2:5</a>) What loads must we carry?</p><br/>&nbsp;
