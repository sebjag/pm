No doubt he had learned about Jehovah from the sacred writings of <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>the Hebrew Scriptures. Still, he was eager to learn more. In fact, when Philip met that official on the road, what did Philip find the man doing? Poring over a scroll of the prophet Isaiah’s writings. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023321/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 8:28</a>) That was solid spiritual food. The court official was not content simply to learn a few basics; he wanted to keep learning.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>5.</strong><strong> What did the Ethiopian do about what he learned?</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;

Yet, he took time to worship Jehovah. He was not content with <strong><em>learning</em></strong> the truth; he <strong><em>acted</em></strong> on what he learned. He therefore traveled all the way from Ethiopia in order to worship Jehovah at the temple in Jerusalem. That journey must have involved a great deal of time and expense, but the man spared no effort where Jehovah’s worship was concerned.</p><br/>&nbsp;

How would he respond? He could have remained as he was, a respected Jewish proselyte. Instead, his love for Jehovah and His Son grew. He was moved to make the life-changing decision to get baptized as a follower of Jesus Christ. Seeing that the man was ready, Philip baptized him.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Understandably, learning about Jehovah starts with the basics. In his letter to the Hebrews, the apostle Paul referred to basic teachings as “the elementary things.” He was not belittling “the primary doctrine”; he was comparing it to the milk that nourishes a baby.

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><strong><sup>20</sup></strong></span> In time, your love for Jehovah will move you to say a special prayer. You will dedicate yourself to God. Remember, once you are dedicated to Jehovah, you have this marvelous prospect: You can belong to him for all eternity. A vow of dedication to Jehovah endures beyond life’s ups and downs. It never needs to be renewed. True, when we make a dedication, we are taking a serious step. Consider this, though: You will make many decisions in your life, some of them very good, but you will never make a better one than that of dedicating your life to Jehovah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023321/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Ps. 50:14</a>) Satan will try to weaken your love for your Father, hoping that you will give up your integrity. Never let Satan win! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023321/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Job 27:5</a>) Your strong love for Jehovah will help you live up to your dedication and grow ever closer to your heavenly Father.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><strong><sup>21</sup></strong></span> After you make your dedication to Jehovah, talk to the elders in your congregation about taking that next vital step. Always remember, though, that baptism is not the end but the beginning. It begins an endless life course of serving Jehovah. So strengthen your love for your Father now. Set goals so that your love can grow stronger day by day. Such a course will lead you to baptism. That will be a wonderful day. But this is just the beginning. May your love for Jehovah and for his Son keep on growing forever!</p><br/>&nbsp;
