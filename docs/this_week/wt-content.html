<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[36]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>YEARS ago, Jehovah’s people wondered, ‘When will the last of the anointed Christians be taken to heaven?’ We once thought that possibly some of the anointed might remain in the earthly Paradise for some time after the war of Armageddon. But in the July 15, 2013, issue of <em>The Watchtower,</em> we learned that all anointed ones who are still on earth will be raised to heaven <strong><em>before</em></strong> the outbreak of Armageddon.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024280/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 24:31</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

Perhaps some Scriptural accounts bring such fears to mind. Let us consider two examples. The first involves High Priest Jehoiada. He was an outstanding man of God. He and his wife, Jehoshabeath, protected a young boy named Jehoash and helped him to become a good and faithful <span id="page3" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="3" data-before-text="3"></span>king. As long as elderly Jehoiada was alive, Jehoash did well. But after Jehoiada died, Jehoash soon turned bad. He listened to wicked princes and left Jehovah.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024280/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Chron. 24:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024280/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 15-19</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

The apostle John, the last surviving apostle, was a good influence on many Christians, helping them to endure in their service to Jehovah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024280/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">3 John 4</a>) Along with Jesus’ other faithful apostles, John had for some time been fighting hard against the apostasy that was spreading.

</div>


<div class="padding"><strong>[study notes on 2 Thess. 2:7]</strong> <br/><strong>the mystery of this lawlessness:</strong> For “mystery,” Paul uses the Greek word <em>my·steʹri·on,</em> which describes something secret and beyond normal understanding. It is used in a similar sense at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070789/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Re 17:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070789/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 7</a>. (For a discussion of other occurrences of this Greek word, see <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1001070789/13/0">study note on Mt 13:11</a>.) In the case of “the man of lawlessness,” there was an element of mystery because the leadership among apostates had not yet established itself as an identifiable group. But that mystery was <strong>already at work</strong> because apostates were infiltrating the congregation, acting as a subversive influence toward lawlessness.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070789/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ac 15:24</a>; see <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1001070789/14/0">study note on 2Th 2:3</a>.<br/><strong>the one who is right now acting as a restraint:</strong> Paul here repeats the Greek word for “acting as a restraint” from the preceding verse, adding the time element “right now.” He likely refers to the restraining influence of the apostles. (See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1001070789/15/0">study note on 2Th 2:6</a>.) Decades later, about 98 C.E., the apostle John suggested that it was then “the last hour” of the apostolic age and that apostasy was spreading. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070789/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1Jo 2:18</a>) That last restraint against apostasy was “out of the way” after John died about 100 C.E.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[42]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Do those two Scriptural accounts indicate that something similar will happen to Christ’s other sheep when the anointed are taken to heaven? At that time, will faithful Christians on earth stray from their training, as did Jehoash, or drift into apostasy, as did many Christians during the second century C.E.? The answer is <strong><em>absolutely not!</em></strong> We can be sure that when the anointed leave the earthly scene, the other sheep will be well cared for and will thrive spiritually.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[44]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Why can we be confident that pure worship will not be corrupted, even during the difficult times that are ahead? Because of what we have learned from the Bible about the time period in which we live. This time period differs greatly from the time of ancient Israel and the time of the second-century Christians. So let us look more closely at these three time periods: (1) The time of ancient Israel, (2) the time period after the apostles died, and (3) our times, “the times of restoration of all things.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024280/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 3:21</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[46]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>The time of ancient Israel.</em></strong> Shortly before his death, Moses told the Israelites: “I well know that after my death you will surely act wickedly and turn aside from the way about which I have commanded you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024280/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Deut. 31:29</a>) Moses also warned that if Israel rebelled, the nation would be sent into exile.

Over the centuries, many kings chose a wicked course and led God’s people astray. This caused Jehovah to cast off his wicked people and to end the line of earthly kings.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[56]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> Before Israel entered the Promised Land, Moses died. What happened to God’s people? Without that faithful man, were they left in the lurch? No. As long as they were faithful, Jehovah provided for them. Before Moses died, Jehovah told him to commission Joshua to lead the people. Moses had been training Joshua for decades. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024280/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ex. 33:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024280/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Deut. 34:9</a>) In addition, there were many other capable men taking the lead​—chiefs of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and even tens. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024280/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Deut. 1:15</a>) God’s people were well cared for. We find a similar example in Elijah. He had been taking the lead in pure worship among the Israelites for decades. But the time came when Jehovah transferred him to a different assignment, down south in Judah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024280/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">2 Ki. 2:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024280/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 21:12</a>) Were faithful people in the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel abandoned? No. Elijah had been training Elisha for years. There were also “the sons of the prophets,” who were evidently organized into schools of some kind. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024280/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2 Ki. 2:7</a>) Thus, many faithful men were available to help lead God’s people.

For decades the brothers of the Governing Body have been training men from among the other sheep to take the lead. For example, they have organized many schools to train elders, traveling overseers, Branch Committee members, overseers at Bethel, and others. The Governing Body has personally been training helpers to the various committees of the Governing Body. These helpers are right now faithfully carrying a heavy load of responsibility. They are well-prepared to continue the work of caring for Christ’s sheep.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[60]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> Here is the key point of our discussion: When the last of the anointed are taken to heaven near the end of the great tribulation, pure worship will keep right on going here on earth. Thanks to the leadership of Jesus Christ, God’s worshippers will not miss a beat. True, at that time, we will be under attack by Gog of Magog, a hostile coalition of nations. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024280/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ezek. 38:18-20</a>) But that brief attack will fail; it will not stop God’s people from worshipping Jehovah. He will surely rescue them! In a vision, the apostle John saw the “great crowd” of Christ’s other sheep. John was told that this “great crowd” comes “out of the great tribulation.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024280/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Rev. 7:9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024280/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 14</a>) Yes, they will be kept safe!</p><br/>&nbsp;

It reveals that the political elements of this world will “battle with the Lamb.” They will lose, of course. We read: “The Lamb will conquer them.” And who will help him? The verse answers. Those who are “called,” “chosen,” and “faithful.” <strong>(<span style="background-color:#b7ff95">Read</span>&nbsp;</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024280/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b"><strong>Revelation 17:14</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Who are these? The resurrected anointed ones! So when the last of the anointed on earth are taken to heaven near the end of the great tribulation, one of their first assignments will be to fight. What a remarkable assignment! Some anointed Christians were fighters before they became Jehovah’s Witnesses. Some even served in the armed forces of this world. But later they became true Christians and learned the way of peace. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024280/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Gal. 5:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024280/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 2 Thess. 3:16</a>) They put aside all physical warfare.
