<br/>How ministerial servants, elders, and circuit overseers help us and how we can show our appreciation for what these faithful men do.<br/>&nbsp;
<br/> <strong>1.</strong><strong> What are some of the gifts that we have received from Jesus?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>NO HUMAN has ever been as generous as Jesus. When on earth, he freely used his miraculous power to help others. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024607/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 9:12-17</a>) He gave the greatest gift of all by laying down his life for us. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024607/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 15:13</a>) Since his resurrection, Jesus has continued to be generous. Just as he promised, he has asked Jehovah to pour out holy spirit to teach and comfort us.

<br/> <strong>3.</strong><strong> Illustrate how all of us can support the work of the “gifts in men.”</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> Jesus assigned these “gifts in men” to build up the congregation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024607/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Eph. 4:12</a>) But the rest of us can help them to carry out this important responsibility. To illustrate: Some of us are directly involved in the construction <span id="page19" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>of a Kingdom Hall. Others <strong><em>support</em></strong> the work by providing meals, transportation, and other services. Similarly, all of us can support the efforts of ministerial servants, congregation elders, and circuit overseers by what we say and do. Let us consider how we benefit from their hard work and how we can show them and Jesus, who gave us these “gifts in men,” that we appreciate them.

<h2 class="du-color--coolGray-700 du-textAlign--center" id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>MINISTERIAL SERVANTS PROVIDING “HELPFUL SERVICES”</strong></h2><br/>&nbsp;
<br/> <strong>4.</strong><strong> What were some of the “helpful services” that ministerial servants performed in the first century?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> In the first century, some brothers were appointed as ministerial servants. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024607/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Tim. 3:8</a>) It seems that they were the ones who performed the “helpful services” that Paul wrote about. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024607/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Cor. 12:28</a>) Ministerial servants evidently cared for necessary matters so that the elders could focus on teaching and shepherding. For example, ministerial servants may have helped to make copies of the Scriptures or may have purchased materials needed for copying.<br/>&nbsp;

All these services are necessary for the congregation to function properly.

A ministerial servant may also be appointed to assist a group overseer. At times, qualified ministerial servants join elders on shepherding calls.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> How does the work of ministerial servants benefit the congregation? “Thanks to our ministerial servants, I fully enjoy the meetings,” says Beberly,<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2024607/1">b</a> a sister in Bolivia. “Because of their work, I can sing, give my comments, listen to talks, and learn from videos and artwork. They care for security and for those connected via videoconference. After the meeting, they take the lead in cleaning, help with the accounts, and make sure that we have the literature we need. I’m grateful for them!” Leslie, who lives in Colombia and whose husband serves as an elder, says: “My husband depends on the ministerial servants to care for various assignments. Without them, he would be even busier, so I’m thankful for their enthusiasm and willing help.” No doubt that expresses how you feel.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024607/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Tim. 3:13</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><strong>10.</strong><strong> What are some reasons why we appreciate our hardworking elders?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Jehovah foretold that shepherds would care well for us and that we would “no longer be afraid or be terrified.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024607/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Jer. 23:4</a>) Johanna, a sister in Finland, experienced the truth of those words when her mother faced a serious illness. She relates: “Although I find it difficult to share my feelings with others, an elder whom I didn’t know very well was patient with me, prayed with me, and assured me of Jehovah’s love. I don’t remember exactly what he said, but I remember that I felt safe. I believe that Jehovah sent him to help me at exactly the right moment.” How have the elders in your congregation helped you?<br/>&nbsp;

Sometimes I just say <span id="page21" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>to them: ‘Do you know what? You are a really good elder.

<br/><strong>13.</strong><strong> What are some responsibilities of circuit overseers?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> Circuit overseers are constantly on the move. Some travel hundreds of kilometers between congregations. Each week, a circuit overseer delivers several talks, goes on shepherding calls, and conducts a pioneer meeting, an elders’ meeting, and meetings for field service. He prepares talks and organizes circuit assemblies and conventions. He teaches pioneer schools, arranges for a special meeting with the pioneers in the <span id="page22" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>circuit, and handles other​—sometimes urgent—​matters assigned to him by the branch office.<br/>&nbsp;
<br/><strong>14.</strong><strong> What are some reasons why we appreciate our hardworking circuit overseers?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> How do congregations benefit from the gift of circuit overseers? Commenting on the visits of traveling overseers, a brother in Türkiye says: “Every one of their visits motivates me to spend more time helping my brothers and sisters. I have met many circuit overseers; yet, not one of them ever seemed unapproachable or gave me the feeling that he was too busy.” Johanna, quoted earlier, worked with a circuit overseer in the ministry, but they found no one at home. “Still,” she says, “I will always remember that day. Both of my sisters had just moved away, and I missed them a lot. The circuit overseer warmly encouraged me and helped me to see that in Jehovah’s service the distances are only temporary but in the new world, we will have endless opportunities to spend time together.” Many circuit overseers have similarly endeared themselves to those whom they serve.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024607/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Acts 20:37–21:1</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><strong>Box title:</strong> Remember Their Wives</h2><br/>&nbsp;
<br/>The wives of ministerial servants, elders, and circuit overseers often make sacrifices so that these men can help the congregation. “It is as if they lend their husbands to Jehovah,” says one sister. “I am sure that he looks on them as his precious daughters.” What can we do to show our gratitude for these unselfish sisters?<ul>
