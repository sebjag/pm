<br/>How Jehovah has been taking the initiative to help us battle against sin and how he has made it possible for us to enjoy eternal life, free from sin.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>WOULD you like to know how much Jehovah God loves you? Here is a good way for you to learn the answer: Study what he has done in order to save you from sin and death. Sin<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2024530/0">a</a> is a terrible enemy, one that you cannot defeat on your own. We all sin daily, and we die because of sin. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024530/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12</a>) There is good news, though. With Jehovah’s help, we can defeat sin. In fact, our victory is absolutely certain!<br/>&nbsp;

<div class="padding"><strong>[a]</strong> Footnote: 	<a href="#footnotesource1" class="fn-symbol">a</a> EXPRESSION EXPLAINED: In the Bible, the word “sin” may refer to wrong deeds, a failure to live or act in harmony with Jehovah’s moral standards. But the word “sin” may also refer to the imperfect, or sinful, condition that we have inherited from Adam. Inherited sin is the reason why we all die.

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Jehovah God has been helping humans fight against sin for some 6,000 years. Why? Because he loves us. He has loved humans from the very beginning, so he has gone to great lengths to help them in this fight. God knows that sin leads to death, and he does not want us to die. He wants us to live forever. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024530/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rom. 6:23</a>) That is what he wants for you. In this article, we will discuss three questions: (1) How did Jehovah offer hope to sinful humans? (2) How did sinful humans in Bible times gain Jehovah’s favor? (3) How did Jesus come to the rescue of sinful humankind?

<br/> <strong>3.</strong><strong> How did our first parents come to be sinners?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> When Jehovah created the first man and woman, he wanted them to be happy. He gave them a beautiful home, the gift of marriage, and a fascinating assignment. They were to fill the earth with their descendants, making the whole planet a paradise like the garden of Eden. He gave them only one simple restriction. And he warned them that if they broke that command by deliberately rebelling against him, their sin would lead to death. We know what happened. An invisible spirit, one who had no love for God or for them, entered the picture and tempted them to commit that sin. Adam and Eve gave in to that bad influence. Failing to trust their loving Father, they sinned. As we know, Jehovah’s words proved true. From that day onward, they had to face the consequences: they began to grow old, and finally they died.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024530/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 1:28, 29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024530/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2:8, 9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024530/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 16-18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024530/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 3:1-6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024530/3/4" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> 17-19,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024530/3/5" data-bid="4-6" class="b"> 24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024530/3/6" data-bid="4-7" class="b"> 5:5</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Jehovah had that sad account recorded for our benefit. It helps us to understand why he hates sin so much.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024530/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 59:2</a>) That is why Satan, the rebel spirit who instigated all this trouble, loves sin and seeks to promote it. He might have thought that he won a great victory in Eden. But he did not understand how loving Jehovah is. God never changed his purpose for the descendants of Adam and Eve. He loves the human family, so he immediately offered hope to all. <strong>(<span style="background-color:#b7ff95">Read</span> </strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024530/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 8:20, 21</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Jehovah knew that some of those descendants would choose to love him and would seek his help in fighting against sin.

Abel <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>was a shepherd, so he took some of his young lambs and slaughtered them, offering them up to Jehovah.

<br/><strong>10.</strong><strong> How did Jesus show that he “came to call” sinners?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Jesus focused special attention on people who felt weighed down by sin and invited them to become his followers. He knew that sin was the root cause of mankind’s ills. So he reached out to men and women who were known to be sinners. Using an illustration, he explained: “Healthy people do not need a physician, but those who are ill do.” He added: “I came to call, not righteous people, but sinners.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024530/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 9:12, 13</a>) Jesus lived up to those words. He gently forgave the sins of the woman who washed his feet with her tears. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024530/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Luke 7:37-50</a>) He taught vital truths <span id="page5" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>to the Samaritan woman at the well, though he knew of her immoral lifestyle.

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> Jesus was betrayed, arrested, verbally abused, slandered, convicted, and even tortured. Soldiers led him to the site of execution and nailed him to a stake. As he faithfully endured all that agony, there was Someone who felt even more pain. That was Jehovah God. He held back his infinite power and refrained from intervening. Why? What could move a loving Father to act in that way? In a word, love. Jesus said: “God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, so that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024530/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><strong>14.</strong><strong> What does Jesus’ sacrifice teach you?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> Jesus’ sacrifice is the ultimate proof of how much Jehovah loves the descendants of Adam and Eve. It proves how much Jehovah loves <strong><em>you.</em></strong> He went to great lengths, subjecting himself to the worst pain imaginable in order to rescue you from sin and death.

<br/><strong>15.</strong><strong> What must we do in order to benefit from God’s gift of the ransom sacrifice of Jesus?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> God’s gift, the ransom sacrifice of his only-begotten Son, makes it possible for us to have our sins forgiven. But to receive God’s forgiveness, we must do something. What is that? John the Baptist and then Jesus Christ himself provided the answer: “Repent, for the Kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024530/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matt. 3:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024530/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 4:17</a>) So repentance is key if we truly want to fight against sin and draw close to our loving Father. But what is involved in being repentant, and how does it help us combat our sinful condition? The next study article will provide the answer.
