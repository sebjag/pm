Often, fashion trends are designed and promoted by people who have no regard for Jehovah or who lead immoral lives. Their immoral thinking is reflected in clothing styles that are tight-fitting or tend to make men look like women. When choosing what to wear, a young man who is growing to Christian maturity will be guided by Bible principles and by good examples in the congregation. He can ask himself: ‘Do my choices show that I am sound in mind and considerate of others? Does the way I dress make it easy for others to believe that I am devoted to serving God?’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023686/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:31-33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023686/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Titus 2:6</a>) A young man with thinking ability will gain the respect of not only his brothers and sisters but also his heavenly Father.</p><br/>&nbsp;

Pioneering helps a young man to learn how to work effectively with a variety of people. It also helps him to make a reasonable budget and live by it. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023686/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Phil. 4:11-13</a>) A good stepping stone to full-time service is auxiliary pioneering. Many serve as an auxiliary pioneer for some time, which helps them to be ready to take up regular pioneering. Pioneering may open the door to other forms of full-time service, including serving as a construction servant or a Bethelite.</p><br/>&nbsp;

Ministerial servants assist the elders in many practical ways. Both elders and ministerial servants humbly serve their brothers and sisters and share zealously in the ministry. Young brothers can qualify to serve as ministerial servants even when they are still in their late teens. And a well-qualified ministerial servant in his early 20’s may be appointed as an elder.</p><br/>&nbsp;

What can you learn from Jehovah about being a good father? There are many lessons. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023686/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Eph. 6:4</a>) Jehovah openly told his Son, Jesus, that he loved him and approved of him.

Generously commend them for the good things that they do. Fathers who imitate Jehovah’s example help their children to develop into mature Christian men and women. You can prepare now for this role by lovingly caring for others in your family and in the congregation and by learning to express your love and appreciation for them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023686/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">John 15:9</a>) This will help you to fulfill your possible future roles as a husband and a father.
