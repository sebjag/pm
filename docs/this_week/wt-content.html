<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[49]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> We all want to serve Jehovah as fully as possible. However, some feel that they can <strong><em>never do enough</em></strong> to gain his approval. A sister named Amanda says: “I tend to equate giving Jehovah my best with the constant need to do more. I often expect more of myself than I can give. When I ‘fail,’ I assume that Jehovah is as disappointed with me as I am with myself.”</p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[49]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> How can we overcome the feeling that we can never do enough to please Jehovah? Remember that Jehovah is not rigid, or inflexible. He never demands more of us than we can reasonably do. He appreciates whatever we do for him as long as we are doing our best. Also, reflect on Bible examples of those who served Jehovah whole-souled. Think of Paul. He exerted himself zealously for years, traveling thousands of miles and establishing many congregations. Yet, when circumstances limited his share in the preaching work, did he lose God’s approval? No. He continued to do what he could, and Jehovah blessed him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024326/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Acts 28:30, 31</a>) Similarly, what we can give to Jehovah may vary at times. But what matters to him is why we do it. Let us now consider some ways that Jehovah expresses his approval of us.</p><br/>&nbsp;

For example, he may move others to speak encouraging words at the right time. A sister in Asia experienced this during a time of great stress. She had lost her job and had become seriously ill. Then her husband committed a serious sin and was removed as an elder. “I could not figure out why this was happening,” she said. “I thought that perhaps I had done something wrong and had lost Jehovah’s approval.” Our sister begged Jehovah to reassure her of his approval. How did he do so? She notes, “The congregation elders talked with me and reassured me of Jehovah’s love.” Later she again asked Jehovah for help. “That same day I received a letter from a group of brothers and sisters in the congregation,” she says. “As I read their comforting words, I felt that Jehovah had heard me.” Yes, Jehovah often expresses his approval through the kind words of others.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024326/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ps. 10:17</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017527/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gal. 5:22, 23</a>) He described these desirable qualities as forming a whole​—“the fruitage of the spirit.”<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2017527/0">a</a> This fruitage characterizes “the new personality.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017527/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Col. 3:10</a>) Just as a tree will bear fruit when it is properly tended, so a person will manifest the fruitage of the spirit when holy spirit flows freely in his life.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017527/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The first aspect of the spirit’s fruitage that Paul listed is the precious quality of love. How precious is it? Paul said that without love, he was “nothing.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017527/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:2</a>) But just what is love, and how can we develop it and show it every day?</p><h2 id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>HOW LOVE IS EXPRESSED</strong></h2><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Although words cannot easily define the quality of love, the Bible describes the way it is expressed. For example, we read that love is “patient and kind.” Also, it “rejoices with the truth,” and it “bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.” Love also involves a feeling of deep affection for others and a sincere concern for them, as well as a warm attachment to them. On the other hand, a lack of love is revealed by jealousy, pride, indecent behavior, selfishness, and a resentful, unforgiving attitude. Unlike such heartless and vain qualities, the love we desire to develop “does not look for its own interests.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017527/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:4-8</a>.</p><h2 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>EXEMPLARY LOVE SHOWN BY JEHOVAH AND JESUS</strong></h2><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“God is love.” Indeed, Jehovah is the very essence of love. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017527/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 John 4:8</a>) All his works and actions bear witness to his love. His greatest act of love toward mankind was that of sending Jesus to suffer and die for us. The apostle John stated: “By this the love of God was revealed in our case, that God sent his only-begotten Son into the world so that we might gain life through him. The love is in this respect, not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017527/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 John 4:9, 10</a>) Because of God’s love, we can obtain forgiveness, hope, and life.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Jesus proved his love for mankind by willingly carrying out God’s will. Paul wrote: “[Jesus] says: ‘Look! I have come to do your will.’ . . . By this ‛will’ we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all time.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017527/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Heb. 10:9, 10</a>) No human could show greater love. Jesus said: “No one has love greater than this, that someone should surrender his life in behalf of his friends.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017527/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 15:13</a>) Can we imperfect humans imitate the love shown to us by <span id="page28" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>Jehovah and Jesus? Yes! Let us consider how we can do so.</p><h2 id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>“GO ON WALKING IN LOVE”</strong></h2><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Paul exhorts us: “Become imitators of God, as beloved children, and go on walking in love, just as the Christ also loved us and gave himself for us.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017527/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Eph. 5:1, 2</a>) We “go on walking in love” when we manifest this quality in every aspect of our life. We show such love by actions rather than by words alone. John wrote: “Little children, we should love, not in word or with the tongue, but in deed and truth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017527/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 John 3:18</a>) For example, when we walk in love for God and neighbor, we will be moved to share the “good news of the Kingdom” with them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017527/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017527/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Luke 10:27</a>) We also walk in love when we are patient, kind, and forgiving. Hence, the Bible counsels us: “Just as Jehovah freely forgave you, you must also do the same.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017527/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Col. 3:13</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Such genuine love, however, is not to be confused with sentimentality. For instance, to calm a crying child, a sentimental parent may cater to the child’s every whim. But the parent who truly loves his child will be firm when necessary. Likewise, God is love, but “those whom Jehovah loves he disciplines.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017527/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Heb. 12:6</a>) When we walk in love, we will also give proper discipline when needed. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017527/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Prov. 3:11, 12</a>) Of course, in doing so we must remember that we too are sinful and prone to unloving acts. Thus, we all have areas in which we need to improve in showing love. How can we do this? Let us consider three ways.</p><h2 id="p12" data-pid="12"><strong>CULTIVATE LOVE​—HOW?</strong></h2><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><strong>First,</strong> ask God for his spirit, which produces love. Jesus stated that Jehovah gives “holy spirit to those asking him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017527/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Luke 11:13</a>) If we pray for holy spirit and endeavor to “keep walking by spirit,” our actions will become more and more loving. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017527/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Gal. 5:16</a>) For instance, if you are an elder in the Christian congregation, you can ask for holy spirit to help you to give Scriptural counsel to others in a loving manner. Or if you are a parent, you can request that God’s spirit help you to discipline your children, not in anger, but in love.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><strong>Second,</strong> reflect on how Jesus showed love even when provoked. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017527/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:21,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017527/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 23</a>) The need to think about Christ’s example may especially arise when we have been offended or have experienced an injustice. At such times, a good question to ask ourselves is, ‘What would Jesus do?’ A sister named Leigh found that considering this question helped her to think before acting. She relates: “Once, a coworker sent an e-mail to my colleagues with negative comments about me and the work I was doing. It hurt me deeply. But then I asked myself, ‘How can I imitate Jesus in dealing with this person?’ After reflecting on what Jesus would have done, I decided to let the matter go and not make an issue of it. Later, I learned that my coworker had been coping with a serious health problem and was under a lot of stress. I concluded that she probably did not really mean what she wrote. Reflecting on Jesus’ example of showing love even when provoked helped me to show similar love to my coworker.” Yes, if we imitate Jesus, we will always act with love.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><strong>Third,</strong> cultivate the spirit of self-sacrificing love, which is the identifying mark of true Christianity. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017527/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">John 13:34, 35</a>) In this regard, the Scriptures urge us to develop the same “mental attitude” that Jesus had. By leaving heaven, “he emptied himself” in our behalf, even “to the point of death.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017527/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Phil. 2:5-8</a>) As we imitate his self-sacrificing love, our thoughts and feelings will become more Christlike, and we <span id="page29" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>will be moved to place the interests of others ahead of our own. What further benefits come from cultivating love?</p><h2 id="p16" data-pid="16"><strong>BENEFITS OF SHOWING LOVE</strong></h2><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">When we show love, the benefits are far-reaching.

But in these last days, everyone faces trials that are “hard to deal with.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1</a>) Injustice, poor health, unemployment, grief, or other causes of anxiety and sorrow may gradually cause some to lose their joy. Even servants of God may become discouraged and see their joy slip away. If this has happened to you, how can you regain your joy?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">To answer that question, we first need to understand what genuine joy is and how others have remained joyful despite trials. Then we will learn what we can do to maintain our joy and even add to it.</p><h2 id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>WHAT IS JOY?</strong></h2><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">We should not confuse being joyful with simply being jovial or cheerful. To illustrate: After too many drinks, a drunkard may be in a hilarious mood. However, when he sobers up, he laughs no more, and he may return to a life full of sorrow and troubles. His momentary exuberance was not true joy.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 14:13</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Joy, in contrast, is a deep-seated quality of the heart. It has been defined as “the emotion excited by the acquisition or expectation of good.” Joy is a state of happiness or gladness that remains whether the conditions around us are pleasant or not. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Thess. 1:6</a>) In fact, a person can be disturbed about something but still have joy in his heart. For example, the apostles were flogged for speaking about the Christ. Yet, they “went out from before the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy to be dishonored in behalf of his name.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 5:41</a>) Obviously, they were not rejoicing over the flogging they had received. But as servants of God, they found true joy in keeping their integrity to him.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">We are not born with such joy; nor does it develop automatically. Why not? Because true joy is part of the fruitage of God’s holy spirit. With the help of God’s spirit, we can fully develop “the new personality,” which includes joy. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Eph. 4:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Gal. 5:22</a>) And when we develop joy, we are better able to cope with the stresses of life.</p><h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>EXAMPLES WE WANT TO IMITATE</strong></h2><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Jehovah intended for good things to develop on the earth, not the bad things that we see so often today. Yet, the wicked deeds of others do not rob Jehovah of joy. God’s Word states: “Strength and joy are in his dwelling place.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Chron. 16:27</a>) Furthermore, the good things that are being accomplished by his servants make “[Jehovah’s] heart rejoice.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Prov. 27:11</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">We can imitate Jehovah by not becoming overly concerned when things do not work <span id="page29" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>out as we had expected. Rather than lose our joy, we can focus on the good things we have now and wait patiently for the better things ahead.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2018283/0">a</a></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">We can also find many Biblical examples of humans who maintained joy in the face of trying circumstances. Abraham is one who endured life-threatening situations and difficulties caused by others. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 12:10-20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 14:8-16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 16:4, 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/7/3" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> 20:1-18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/7/4" data-bid="8-5" class="b"> 21:8, 9</a>) Despite such pressures, Abraham maintained joy in his heart. How did he do so? He had clearly in mind his hope of living in the new world under the Messiah’s rule. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Gen. 22:15-18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Heb. 11:10</a>) Jesus said: “Abraham your father rejoiced greatly at the prospect of seeing my day.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 8:56</a>) We can imitate Abraham by pondering the joys ahead.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Rom. 8:21</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Like Abraham, the apostle Paul and his companion Silas were focused on God’s promises. They had strong faith, and they kept their joy alive despite negative experiences. For example, after they had endured a dreadful beating and were thrown into prison, in “the middle of the night, [they] were praying and praising God with song.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 16:23-25</a>) In addition to drawing strength from their hope, Paul and Silas were joyful because they were suffering for the sake of Christ’s name. We can imitate Paul and Silas by keeping in mind the good that comes from serving God faithfully.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Phil. 1:12-14</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Today, our brotherhood includes many fine examples of individuals who maintained joy in the face of trials. For instance, in November 2013, Super Typhoon Haiyan ripped through the central part of the Philippines, destroying the homes of over 1,000 Witness families. George, whose home in the city of Tacloban was obliterated, said: “In spite of what happened, the brothers are happy. It’s hard for me to express the joy we feel.” Whenever we experience great difficulties, we will remain joyful if we meditate appreciatively on what Jehovah has done for us. What else has Jehovah provided that gives us reason for joy?</p><h2 id="p14" data-pid="14"><strong>OUR REASONS FOR JOY</strong></h2><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">What greater reason for joy could we have than our relationship with God? Think of it: We know the Universal Sovereign. He is our Father, God, and Friend!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 71:17, 18</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">We also treasure the gift of life and our ability to enjoy it. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:12, 13</a>) As intelligent creatures who have been drawn by Jehovah, we understand God’s will for us. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Col. 1:9, 10</a>) Hence, we have real meaning and direction in our lives. On the other hand, the majority of mankind have no clear concept of life’s purpose. Highlighting this contrast, Paul wrote: “‘Eye has not seen and ear has not heard, nor have there been conceived in the heart of man the things that God has prepared for those who love him.’ For it is to us God has revealed them through his spirit.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Cor. 2:9, 10</a>) Do we not rejoice over our understanding of Jehovah’s will and purpose?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Consider what else Jehovah has done for his people. Are we not happy that our sins can be forgiven? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 John 2:12</a>) Because of God’s mercy, we have a living hope that a new world will soon be here. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Rom. 12:12</a>) Even now, Jehovah provides a wholesome group of fellow worshippers. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 133:1</a>) God’s Word also assures us that Jehovah protects his people from Satan and his demons. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 91:11</a>) If we meditate on all these blessings from God, we will see our joy deepen and grow.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Phil. 4:4</a>.</p><h2 id="p18" data-pid="18"><span id="page30" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="30" data-before-text="30"></span><strong>HOW TO INCREASE YOUR JOY</strong></h2><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Can an already joyful Christian increase his joy? Jesus said: “These things I have spoken to you, so that my joy may be in you and your joy may be made full.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">John 15:11</a>) Does this not indicate that we can grow in joy? You can compare your efforts at increasing joy to stoking a fire. You must feed the fire to intensify the heat. Likewise, you must feed your spirituality to increase your joy. Remember: Joy is fueled by God’s spirit. Hence, you will develop greater joy by regularly requesting the help of Jehovah’s spirit and prayerfully meditating on his spirit-inspired Word.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Luke 11:13</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">You also increase your joy by being active in works that please Jehovah.

Because we were created to “fear the true God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole obligation of man.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Eccl. 12:13</a>) In other words, we were designed to do God’s will.

For example, we will become more pleasing to our heavenly Father as we joyfully serve him no matter what problems we may face. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Deut. 16:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 1 Thess. 5:16-18</a>) Also, as a result of having true joy, we will reject a materialistic way of life and will instead seek to make greater personal sacrifices in behalf of God’s Kingdom. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Matt. 13:44</a>) When we see the good that this accomplishes, we will grow in joy, experience a greater sense of well-being, and add to the happiness of others.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Acts 20:35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> Phil. 1:3-5</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">“If you are happy and satisfied with your life now, you are more likely to be healthy in the future.” That is what a researcher at the University of Nebraska in the United States wrote after reviewing a number of studies on health. This is in agreement with the Bible, which says: “A joyful heart is good medicine.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Prov. 17:22</a>) Yes, as you increase your joy, you are likely to have better physical health.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">So despite living in stressful times, we can develop true and lasting joy as we acquire holy spirit by means of prayer, study, and meditation on Jehovah’s Word. We also increase our joy as we reflect on our current blessings, imitate the faith of others, and seek to do God’s will. In all such ways, we can share in the truth of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018283/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalm 64:10</a>, which says: “The righteous one will rejoice in Jehovah and take refuge in him.”</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018402/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 1:2, 3</a>) As we meditate on the Bible’s message, God’s spirit helps us to understand Jehovah’s thinking on many matters. For example, we see how he remains peaceable and why peace is so important to him. When we apply such lessons from God’s Word, we experience greater peace in our lives.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018402/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Prov. 3:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>Second,</strong> we must pray for God’s holy spirit.

<figcaption class="figcaption"><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> Applying Bible principles and praying for God’s spirit will help us to find peace</p></figcaption><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><strong>David’s</strong> bad attitude affected his speech. Before dedicating his life to God, he was often critical of others and used harsh language with his family. In time, David saw the need to change and become peaceable. How did he find peace? He says, “I began applying Bible principles in my life, and as a result, the respect between me and my family grew.”</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><strong>Rachel’s</strong> background influenced her attitude. She admits, “Even now, I struggle with feelings of anger because I was brought up in an angry household.” What has helped <span id="page11" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>her to become more peaceable? She answers, “Prayerful reliance on Jehovah.”</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">David and Rachel are just two examples of the peaceful fruitage that results when we apply inspired Scriptural principles and rely on God’s spirit to help us. Clearly, despite living in a hostile world, we can have inner peace that contributes to harmony within our families and with fellow Christians. Yet, Jehovah urges us to “be peaceable with <em>all</em> men.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018402/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rom. 12:18</a>) Is that really possible, and what benefits come from our efforts to make peace?</p><h2 id="p17" data-pid="17"><strong>PURSUE PEACE WITH OTHERS</strong></h2><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">By means of our field ministry, we invite people to benefit from our peaceful message about the Kingdom of God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018402/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isa. 9:6, 7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018402/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Matt. 24:14</a>) Happily, many have responded. As a result, they are no longer overwhelmed with feelings of despair or anger over what they see happening around them. Instead, they now have a real hope for the future and are moved to “seek peace and pursue it.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018402/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 34:14</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Not all, however, respond favorably to our message, at least not initially. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018402/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">John 3:19</a>) Even so, we are assisted by God’s spirit to present the good news to them in a peaceful and respectful manner. In this way, we follow Jesus’ instructions for the ministry recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018402/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 10:11-13</a>, where he advised: “When you enter the house, greet the household. If the house is deserving, let the peace you wish it come upon it; but if it is not deserving, let the peace from you return upon you.” When we follow Jesus’ advice, we can leave with our peace intact and with the possibility of helping the person in the future.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">We also contribute to peace when we approach government officials in a respectful way​—including those who may oppose our work. For example, the government of one African country allowed prejudice to prevent it from granting approval for the building of Kingdom Halls. In hopes of resolving the matter peacefully, a brother who had previously served as a missionary in that African land was assigned to visit the country’s High Commissioner in London, England. He was to tell the official about the peaceful work of Jehovah’s Witnesses in his country. How did that visit turn out?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">“When I arrived at the reception desk,” he relates, “I concluded by the receptionist’s manner of dress that she belonged to a tribe whose language I had learned. So I greeted her in her own tongue. Taken by surprise, she asked me, ‘What is the reason for your visit?’ I politely told her that I wished to see the High Commissioner. She telephoned the official, who came out to meet me and greeted me in the local language. After that, he carefully listened to me as I explained to him the peaceful activities of the Witnesses.”</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">The brother’s respectful explanation removed much of the commissioner’s misunderstanding and prejudice toward our work. Some time later, the government of that African country lifted its building restrictions. How the brothers rejoiced at that peaceful outcome! Indeed, treating others with respect yields many fine benefits​—including peace.</p><h2 id="p23" data-pid="23"><strong>ENJOY PEACE FOREVER</strong></h2><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Today, Jehovah’s people enjoy a spiritual paradise that is filled with peace. You will add to that peace as you work to develop this aspect of the spirit’s fruitage in your life. Most important, you will gain Jehovah’s approval and find abundant and everlasting peace in God’s new world.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018402/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:13, 14</a>.</p>	<!-- Root element of lightbox -->

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018527/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1-5</a>) We are surrounded by a world in which people are often lovers of themselves, not open to any agreement, and without self-control. Those who display such characteristics are frequently anything but patient. Hence, each Christian should ask himself: ‘Has the world’s impatience rubbed off on me? What does it mean to be truly patient? And how can I make this outstanding Christian quality a permanent part of my personality?’</p><h2 id="p3" data-pid="3"><strong>WHAT PATIENCE MEANS</strong></h2><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the Biblical sense of the word, patience is more than simply putting up with a trying situation. A person with godly patience endures with a purpose. He sees beyond his own needs and considers the welfare of the one causing a disagreeable situation. For this reason, when a patient person is wronged or provoked, he refuses to give up hope for improvement in the disturbed relationship. Little wonder, then, that the Bible lists being “patient” as the first of many fine qualities that stem from love.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2018527/0">a</a> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018527/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:4</a>) God’s Word also includes “patience” as an aspect of “the fruitage of the spirit.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018527/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gal. 5:22, 23</a>) What, though, does cultivating this godly quality require of us?</p><h2 id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>HOW TO DEVELOP PATIENCE</strong></h2><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">To cultivate the quality of patience, we must pray for the help of Jehovah’s spirit, which he gives to those who trust in him and rely on him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018527/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 11:13</a>) As powerful as God’s spirit is, however, we need to do our part and work in harmony with our prayers. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018527/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 86:10, 11</a>) This means that we must do our best to exercise patience each day in order for this quality to take root in our heart. Yet, even then, we may need to do more to make patience a permanent aspect of our personality. What else can help us?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">We can develop patience by examining and imitating Jesus’ perfect example. In harmony with that example, the apostle Paul under inspiration described “the new personality,” which includes “patience,” and then he urged us to “let the peace of the Christ rule in [our] hearts.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018527/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Col. 3:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018527/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018527/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 15</a>) We can let such peace “rule” in our hearts by imitating Jesus’ unbreakable faith that in His due time, God will correct matters that concern us. When we follow Jesus’ example, we will not be provoked into losing our patience, no matter what may be happening around us.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018527/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 14:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018527/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 16:33</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Although we are eager to see God’s promised new world, we learn to be more patient when we meditate on Jehovah’s patience <span id="page29" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>with us. The Scriptures assure us: “Jehovah is not slow concerning his promise, as some people consider slowness, but he is patient with you because he does not desire anyone to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018527/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:9</a>) As we contemplate Jehovah’s patience with us, are we not moved to be more patient with others? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018527/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rom. 2:4</a>) With that in mind, what are some circumstances that call for patience?</p><h2 id="p9" data-pid="9"><strong>SITUATIONS THAT CALL FOR PATIENCE</strong></h2><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Many everyday situations may test our patience. For example, if you feel that you have something important to say, you may need to exercise patience in order to avoid interrupting others. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018527/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Jas. 1:19</a>) You might also need to show patience when associating with fellow believers whose habits irritate you. Instead of overreacting to such things, you are wise to consider how Jehovah and Jesus react to <em>our</em> weaknesses. They do not focus a critical eye on our minor failings. Rather, they see our good qualities and patiently observe our efforts to improve.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018527/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Tim. 1:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018527/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 3:12</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Another situation that may test our patience is when someone suggests that we said or did something wrong. All too often, we may be quick to take offense and justify ourselves. However, God’s Word recommends a different response. It states: “Better to be patient than to be haughty in spirit. Do not be quick to take offense, for the taking of offense lodges in the bosom of fools.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018527/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Eccl. 7:8, 9</a>) Hence, even if an accusation is completely untrue, we should patiently weigh our response. Jesus followed that principle when others unjustly ridiculed him.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018527/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 11:19</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Parents especially need to show patience when they find it necessary to address any wrong attitudes, desires, or leanings that may develop in their children. Consider the case of Mattias, who serves as a member of the Scandinavia Bethel family. As a teenager, Mattias endured endless taunting at school because of his beliefs. At first, his parents were unaware of this. Nevertheless, they had to deal with the effect that this opposition had on their son, who began to question whether he had the truth. “The situation required a lot of patience,” recalls Mattias’ father, Gillis. Mattias would ask: “Who is God? What if the Bible is not God’s Word? How do we know that it is actually God who wants this or that from us?” He would also say to his father: “Why am I to be judged if I don’t feel and believe as you do?”</p><img src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/w18/2018/831" data-img-small-src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/w18/2018/830" alt="A father listens patiently to his teenage son" width="450" height="414" class="south_center" />
<br/><strong>Picture description:</strong> A father listens patiently to his teenage son
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">“Sometimes,” explains Gillis, “our son’s questions were expressed in anger, not against his mother or me, but against the truth, which he felt made life so difficult for him.” How did Gillis handle this situation? “My son and I would sit and talk for hours at a time. Mostly I listened and asked occasional questions to get the full picture of his feelings and views. Sometimes I gave him an explanation to think about for a day <span id="page30" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="30" data-before-text="30"></span>or so before we resumed our discussion. At other times, I would say that I needed a few days to think about a viewpoint he had expressed. By means of these regular conversations, Mattias slowly progressed in his understanding and acceptance of such teachings as the ransom, God’s sovereignty, and Jehovah’s love. It took time, and it was often difficult, but slowly, love for Jehovah grew in his heart. My wife and I are so happy that our patient efforts to help our son through his teenage years paid off and reached his heart.”</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Gillis and his wife trusted in Jehovah’s support as they patiently worked with their son. Looking back, Gillis says: “I often told Mattias that our deep love for him moved his mother and me to pray even more intensely that Jehovah would help him to understand.” How thankful those parents are that they exercised the vital quality of patience!</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">In addition to providing spiritual help, true Christians must cultivate loving patience when providing care for chronically ill family members or friends. Consider the example of Ellen,<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2018527/1">b</a> who also lives in Scandinavia.</p><img src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/w18/2018/833" data-img-small-src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/w18/2018/832" alt="A wife is patient with her ill husband" width="450" height="405" class="north_center" />
<br/><strong>Picture description:</strong> A wife is patient with her ill husband
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">About eight years ago, Ellen’s husband was afflicted with two strokes that damaged the functions of his brain. As a result, he is no longer able to feel compassion, happiness, or sorrow. The situation is very demanding for Ellen. She says: “It has taken a lot of patience and many prayers.” She adds: “My favorite scripture that brings me comfort is <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018527/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Philippians 4:13</a>, which says: ‘For all things I have the strength through the one who gives me power.’” Thanks to that power, Ellen endures patiently with full confidence in Jehovah’s support.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018527/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 62:5, 6</a>.</p><h2 id="p17" data-pid="17"><strong>IMITATE JEHOVAH’S PATIENCE</strong></h2><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Of course, when it comes to exercising patience, Jehovah is the most outstanding example for us to follow. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018527/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:15</a>) There are many accounts in God’s Word of times when Jehovah displayed great patience.

First of all, Jehovah did not interrupt as Abraham spoke. Instead, Jehovah listened patiently to each of Abraham’s questions and concerns. Then, Jehovah showed that he had listened as he repeated Abraham’s concerns and assured him that He would not destroy Sodom even if just ten righteous men were found in that city. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018527/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Gen. 18:22-33</a>) What a fine example of patient listening and of not overreacting!</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Godly patience truly is a vital part of the new personality with which all Christians must clothe themselves. If we work hard to develop this valuable and enduring quality, we honor our caring and patient heavenly Father, and we will be counted among “those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018527/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Heb. 6:10-12</a>.</p>	<!-- Root element of lightbox -->

When we realize that someone cares for us, we are grateful. Since each of us appreciates being treated with kindness, how can we develop this beautiful quality?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Kindness involves taking a genuine interest in the welfare of others​—an interest that is expressed through helpful words and deeds. An active quality, kindness is more than a veneer of politeness and courtesy. True kindness is motivated by deep love and empathy. More than that, such kindness is part of the fruitage of God’s holy spirit that Christians are told to cultivate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gal. 5:22, 23</a>) We must develop kindness, so let us examine how Jehovah and his Son have shown this quality and how we can follow their example.</p><h2 id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>JEHOVAH IS KIND TOWARD ALL</strong></h2><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jehovah is kind and considerate toward all, including “the unthankful and wicked.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 6:35</a>) For instance, Jehovah “makes his sun rise on both the wicked and the good and makes it rain on both the righteous and the unrighteous.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 5:45</a>) Hence, even those who do not acknowledge Jehovah as their Creator still benefit from his kind provisions for life and may enjoy a measure of happiness.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">We find an outstanding example of kindness in what Jehovah did for Adam and Eve. Shortly after they sinned, Adam and Eve “sewed fig leaves together and made loin coverings for themselves.” However, Jehovah knew that they would need suitable clothing in order to live outside of Eden, where the ground was now cursed with “thorns and thistles.” So Jehovah kindly responded to their need by making “long garments from skins” for them.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 3:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 17, 18,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 21</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Although Jehovah is kind to “both the wicked and the good,” he especially desires to show kindness toward his faithful servants. As an example, during the days of the prophet Zechariah, an angel was troubled at seeing the reconstruction of the temple in Jerusalem come to a standstill. Jehovah listened to the angel’s concerns and replied with “kind and comforting words.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Zech. 1:12, 13</a>) Jehovah dealt similarly with the prophet Elijah. At one point, the prophet felt so low that he asked Jehovah to put him to death. Jehovah was attentive to Elijah’s feelings and sent an angel to strengthen him. Moreover, God assured the prophet that he was not alone. After Elijah received such kind words and the help he needed, he was able to carry on in his assignment. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Ki. 19:1-18</a>) Among God’s servants, who has been foremost in reflecting Jehovah’s outstanding quality of kindness?</p><h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><span id="page29" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span><strong>JESUS​—A MAN OF GREAT KINDNESS</strong></h2><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">During his earthly ministry, Jesus was known for being kind and considerate. He was never harsh or overbearing. With empathy he said: “Come to me, all you who are toiling and loaded down, and I will refresh you. . . . For my yoke is kindly.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 11:28-30</a>) In response to his kindness, people followed Jesus wherever he went. “Moved with pity,” Jesus fed them, healed their sick and infirm, and taught them “many things” about his Father.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Mark 6:34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Matt. 14:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 15:32-38</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">As evidence of his great kindness, Jesus was understanding and discerning in his dealings with others. In fact, no matter how inconvenient the request, Jesus received “kindly” all those who sincerely sought him out. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 9:10, 11</a>) For instance, he did not reprimand a frightened woman who, although she was ceremonially unclean, touched his outer garment in hopes of being cured of a flow of blood. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Lev. 15:25-28</a>) With compassion for this woman who had suffered for 12 years, Jesus told her: “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed from your grievous sickness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Mark 5:25-34</a>) What a marvelous act of kindness!</p><h2 id="p11" data-pid="11"><strong>KINDNESS REQUIRES POSITIVE ACTION</strong></h2><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">In the examples noted above, we see that true kindness is expressed by action. Jesus illustrated the need for action in the parable about the neighborly Samaritan. Although animosity existed between Samaritans and Jews, the Samaritan man in the parable felt pity for a man who had been robbed, beaten, and left half-dead on the road. Kindness moved the Samaritan to action. He treated the man’s wounds and took him to an inn. The Samaritan then paid the innkeeper to care for the injured man and even offered to pay for any additional expenses.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 10:29-37</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">While kindness is often expressed by deeds, it can also be shown through thoughtful and motivating words. Hence, though “anxiety in a man’s heart weighs it down,” the Bible adds that “a good word cheers it up.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Prov. 12:25</a>) We can lift the spirits of others when we are motivated by kindness and goodness to share upbuilding things with them.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2018647/0">a</a> Our kind words will show that we care about them. Thus encouraged, they will cope better with the trials they face in life.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Prov. 16:24</a>.</p><h2 id="p14" data-pid="14"><strong>CULTIVATING KINDNESS</strong></h2><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Because of being created “in God’s image,” all humans are capable of developing the quality of kindness. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Gen. 1:27</a>) For instance, Julius, a Roman army officer in whose custody the apostle Paul traveled to Rome, treated the apostle “with kindness and permitted him to go to his friends and enjoy their care” at the city of Sidon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Acts 27:3</a>) Sometime later, the inhabitants of Malta showed “extraordinary kindness” to Paul and others who had just experienced shipwreck. The islanders even made a fire to warm the victims. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Acts 28:1, 2</a>) Yet, as commendable as their actions were, kindness involves more than just performing an occasional kind act.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">To please God fully, we must develop kindness as a permanent part of our personality and way of life. For this reason, Jehovah tells us to “clothe” ourselves with kindness. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Col. 3:12</a>) Admittedly, though, <span id="page30" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="30" data-before-text="30"></span>we do not always find it easy to make this godly quality a part of us. Why not? We may hold back from showing kindness because of shyness, insecurity, opposition, or lingering traces of selfishness. Nevertheless, we can overcome such difficulties by relying on holy spirit and by imitating Jehovah’s pattern of kindness.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Cor. 2:12</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Can we identify areas wherein we need to improve in showing kindness? We should ask ourselves: ‘Am I an empathetic listener? Am I alert to the needs of others? When was the last time I was kind to someone who is not a family member or a close friend?’ Then we can set goals, such as getting to know more about the people around us, especially in the Christian congregation. In this way we can become alert to their circumstances and their needs. Next, we should try to show kindness to others in ways that we would appreciate receiving it if we were in their place. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matt. 7:12</a>) Finally, Jehovah will bless our efforts to cultivate kindness if we ask him for help.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Luke 11:13</a>.</p><h2 id="p18" data-pid="18"><strong>KINDNESS ATTRACTS OTHERS</strong></h2><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">When the apostle Paul listed what distinguished him as God’s minister, he included “kindness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">2 Cor. 6:3-6</a>) People were drawn to Paul because of his personal interest in them, which he expressed through kind actions and words. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Acts 28:30, 31</a>) Similarly, we can attract people to the truth by our kind behavior. When we show kindness to all, including those who oppose us, we may warm their heart and melt away their hostility. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Rom. 12:20</a>) In time, they may even be attracted to the Bible’s message.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">In the earthly Paradise to come, countless resurrected ones will no doubt be thrilled to experience true kindness, perhaps for the first time. Out of gratitude, they in turn will be moved to show kindness to others. Anyone then living who refuses to show kindness and help others will have no permanent place under God’s Kingdom. On the other hand, those approved by God to live forever will treat one another in a loving and kind way. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ps. 37:9-11</a>) What a secure and peaceful world that will be! However, before that blessed time arrives, how can we benefit now from showing kindness?</p><h2 id="p21" data-pid="21"><strong>BENEFITS FROM SHOWING KINDNESS</strong></h2><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">“A kind man benefits himself,” the Bible says. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Prov. 11:17</a>) People are drawn to a kind person, and they tend to be kind to him as well. Jesus said: “With the measure that you are measuring out, they will measure out to you in return.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Luke 6:38</a>) Thus, a kind person easily finds and keeps good friends.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">The apostle Paul urged those in the congregation in Ephesus to “become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate, freely forgiving one another.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Eph. 4:32</a>) A congregation benefits greatly when it is made up of empathetic Christians who show kindness and seek to help one another. Such ones never resort to harsh words, sharp criticism, or hurtful sarcasm. Instead of spreading harmful gossip, they strive to use their tongue to help others. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Prov. 12:18</a>) As a result, the congregation thrives spiritually.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Yes, kindness is a quality expressed by word and action. When we are kind, we reflect the warm and generous personality of our God, Jehovah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018647/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Eph. 5:1</a>) In turn, we strengthen our congregations and draw others to pure worship. May we always be known as a people who display kindness!</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb"></p>

However, displaying goodness is a challenge in today’s world. Many people are “without love of goodness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019322/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:3</a>) They may follow a personal standard of right and wrong that, in effect, says that “good is bad and bad is good.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019322/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 5:20</a>) And we all contend with our own background and imperfections. Hence, we may feel like Anne,<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2019322/0">a</a> who despite serving Jehovah for decades admits, “I struggle to believe that I can be a good person.”</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Happily, all of us can cultivate goodness! It is a product of God’s holy spirit, and his spirit is more powerful than any external or internal obstacle we might face. Let us examine goodness more closely and learn how we can display this quality more fully.</p><h2 id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>WHAT IS GOODNESS?</strong></h2><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Simply put, goodness is the quality or state of being good. It involves moral excellence and virtue, without badness or rottenness. Goodness is evident by its beneficial effect on others. It is an active, positive quality manifested in helpful deeds.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">You have likely seen that some readily do good things for their family and friends, but is that where goodness should stop? Granted, we are limited in our ability to display this quality, for the Bible says that “there is no righteous man on earth who always does good and never sins.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019322/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Eccl. 7:20</a>) The apostle Paul candidly admitted: “I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, there dwells nothing good.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019322/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rom. 7:18</a>) How reasonable, therefore, to go to the Source of goodness if we want to develop that quality.</p><h2 id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>“JEHOVAH IS GOOD”</strong></h2><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Jehovah God sets the standard of what is good. Regarding him, we read: “You are good and your works are good. Teach me your regulations.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019322/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 119:68</a>) Let us examine the two aspects of Jehovah’s goodness mentioned in that verse.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><em>Jehovah is good.</em> Goodness is an inseparable part of Jehovah’s personality. Consider what happened when Jehovah told Moses: “I will make all my goodness pass before your face.” As Jehovah’s glory​—including his goodness—​passed by, Moses heard these words: “Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and compassionate, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love and truth, showing loyal love to thousands, pardoning error and transgression and sin, but he will by no means leave the guilty unpunished.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019322/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ex. 33:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019322/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 34:6, 7</a>) We have reason to understand, then, that goodness is reflected in every facet of Jehovah’s being. Though Jesus was the epitome of goodness in a human, he could say: “Nobody is good except one, God.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019322/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Luke 18:19</a>.</p><img src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/w19/2019/179" data-img-small-src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/w19/2019/178" alt="A father and son look at Jehovah’s creation" width="300" height="153" class="north_center" />

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019322/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 14:17</a>) His goodness is also shown when he forgives us.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019322/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Gen. 1:27</a>) Nevertheless, God’s Word urges his servants to “learn to do good.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019322/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isa. 1:17</a>) But how can we foster this appealing quality? Consider three ways we can do this.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">First, we can <strong>pray for holy spirit,</strong> which can help Christians to produce genuine goodness.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019322/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Rom. 12:9</a>) In fact, the Bible indicates that Jehovah can make us “firm in every good deed and word.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019322/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Thess. 2:16, 17</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Second, we should <strong>read God’s inspired Word.</strong> As we do, Jehovah can instruct us in “the entire course of what is good” and equip us “for every good work.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019322/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Prov. 2:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019322/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 2 Tim. 3:17</a>) By such reading, followed by meditation, we fill our heart with good things about God and his will.

You can benefit similarly.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><span id="page28" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>We can also give some thought to modern-day examples of those who do good. For instance, consider hardworking elders in the congregation who are ‘lovers of goodness.’ Not to be overlooked are faithful sisters who by word and example are “teachers of what is good.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019322/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Titus 1:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019322/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 2:3</a>) A sister named Roslyn relates: “My friend goes out of her way to help and encourage others in the congregation. She thinks about their situation and often gives them little gifts or helps them in other practical ways.

To illustrate: Do you think of an artist painting a portrait with only one or two brushstrokes? Rather, he may use many brushstrokes to create his painting. Similarly, our goodness can be seen in many helpful acts.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The Bible urges us to be <strong>“prepared”</strong> and <strong>“ready”</strong> to render good.

Now I have dignity and self-respect.”</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">The greatest reason for us to cultivate goodness is that doing so makes Jehovah happy.

For example, although Satan wants to kill us spiritually, faith enables us “to extinguish all the wicked one’s burning arrows.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019525/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eph. 6:16</a>) With faith, we can face mountainlike problems.

How does our heart condition affect our faith? How can we strengthen our faith? And in whom should we put faith?​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019525/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rom. 4:3</a>.</p><h2 id="p3" data-pid="3"><strong>WHAT IS FAITH?</strong></h2><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Faith goes beyond simply believing or acknowledging the truth, for even “the demons believe [that God exists] and shudder.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019525/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jas. 2:19</a>) What, then, is faith?</p><img src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/w19/2019/597" data-img-small-src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/w19/2019/596" alt="The earth as seen from outer space" width="300" height="169" class="north_center" />

For example, Jehovah told the Israelites: “If you could break my covenant regarding the day and my covenant regarding the night, to prevent day and night from coming at their proper time, only then could my covenant with my servant David be broken.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019525/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jer. 33:20, 21</a>) Are you ever afraid that the sun might stop rising and setting in the sky, thus causing day and night to cease? If you do not doubt the physical laws that keep the earth rotating on its axis and orbiting the sun, should you doubt that the Creator of these laws can fulfill his word? Of course not!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019525/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isa. 55:10, 11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019525/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Matt. 5:18</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong><em>Second,</em></strong> faith is “the evident demonstration of realities that are not seen.” Faith is said to be “the evident demonstration,” or “convincing evidence,” of things that are invisible to the eye and yet real. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019525/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Heb. 11:1b</a>; ftn.) In what way? Suppose a child asks you, ‘How do you know that air exists?’ Although you have never seen air, you would likely help the child to reason on the evidence that exists​—breathing, the effects of wind, and so on. Once the child is convinced of the evidence, he accepts the existence of what is invisible to him. Similarly, faith is based on solid evidence.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019525/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rom. 1:20</a>.</p><h2 id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>RIGHT HEART CONDITION NECESSARY</strong></h2><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Since faith is based on evidence, to have faith a person must first acquire “an accurate knowledge of truth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019525/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:4</a>) But that is not enough.

So I feel uncomfortable when I am with people who have a strong, aggressive personality. But I feel relaxed when I am with someone who is mild and humble. I can open up to that sort of person, share my feelings, and discuss my problems. My best friends are like this.”</em></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Sara’s comments reveal that mildness endears us to fellow humans. Mildness also pleases Jehovah. His Word exhorts us: “Clothe yourselves with . . . mildness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020402/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Col. 3:12</a>) What is mildness? How did Jesus show mildness? And how can this quality make our lives happier?</p><h2 id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>WHAT IS MILDNESS?</strong></h2><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Mildness is an inner, peaceful disposition. A mild person deals with others in a gentle, kind way and is able to face life’s irritations with calmness and self-control.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Mildness is a sign of inner strength. The Greek word for “mildness” was used to describe a wild horse that had been tamed. The strength of the horse remains, but patient training has bridled its raw power. Likewise, when we display mildness, we tame our unruly nature and deal peaceably with others.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">‘I am not a mild person by nature,’ we may think. We do live in a world where aggression and impatience are common, so we may find it a challenge to display a mild spirit. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020402/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rom. 7:19</a>) Clearly, it requires effort to cultivate mildness, but Jehovah’s holy spirit will help us to strengthen our resolve to reach our goal. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020402/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gal. 5:22, 23</a>) Why should we make the effort to cultivate mildness?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>Mildness is a quality that attracts people.</strong> As Sara, quoted above, observed, we feel relaxed in the company of a mild-tempered person. Jesus is an outstanding example of a mild and kind person. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020402/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Cor. 10:1</a>) Even children who hardly knew him wanted to be close to him.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020402/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Mark 10:13-16</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><strong>Mildness protects us as well as those around us.</strong> If we are mild, we do not quickly get frustrated or react angrily. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020402/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Prov. 16:32</a>) <span id="page18" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>We thus avoid feelings of guilt that arise after we hurt someone​—especially a person whom we love. And mildness protects those around us from suffering because of our unrestrained spirit.</p><h2 id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF MILDNESS</strong></h2><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Despite his heavy responsibilities and busy schedule, Jesus was mild-tempered toward all. Many in his day were struggling and loaded down, and they needed refreshment. How comforted they must have felt when Jesus said to them: “Come to me, . . . for I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart”!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020402/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 11:28, 29</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">How can we cultivate the mildness that Jesus displayed? We study God’s Word to learn how Jesus interacted with people and handled difficult situations. Then, when we face situations that test our mildness, we strive to act like Jesus. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020402/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:21</a>) Consider three factors that helped Jesus to be mild.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><strong>Jesus was humble at heart.</strong> Jesus said that he was both “mild-tempered and lowly in heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020402/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 11:29</a>) The Bible mentions these two qualities together because mildness is closely connected with humility. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020402/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Eph. 4:1-3</a>) Why is that so?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Humility helps us to avoid taking ourselves too seriously or becoming overly sensitive. How did Jesus respond to those who unjustly criticized him for being “a glutton” and “given to drinking wine”? He let his example stifle the criticism, and he mildly pointed out that “wisdom is proved righteous by its works.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020402/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 11:19</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">If someone makes a thoughtless comment about your race, sex, or background, why not make the effort to respond mildly? Peter, a Christian elder in South Africa, says: “When I find myself irritated by what someone says, I ask myself, ‘How would Jesus react?’” He adds: “I have learned not to take myself too seriously.”</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><strong>Jesus understood human weakness.</strong> Jesus’ disciples had good intentions, but sometimes their imperfect nature hindered them from carrying out their intentions. For example, the night before Jesus died, Peter, James, and John failed to give him the emotional support he requested. Jesus recognized that “the spirit, of course, is eager, but the flesh is weak.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020402/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 26:40, 41</a>) Thanks to this insight, Jesus did not get irritated with his apostles.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Mandy is a sister who used to be very demanding, but now she tries hard to imitate Jesus’ example of mildness. She says, “I try to accept human imperfection in all its facets and to see the positive in others, something that Jehovah certainly sees.” Could Jesus’ compassionate view of human weakness also help you to deal mildly with others?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><strong>Jesus left matters in God’s hands.</strong> Jesus accepted unjust treatment while he was on earth. He was misunderstood, despised, and tortured. Even so, he remained mild-tempered because he “entrusted himself to the One who judges righteously.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020402/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:23</a>) Jesus knew that his heavenly Father would care for him and deal with injustices at the right time.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">If we get angry and try to fight a personal injustice, we could easily overreact and make things worse. That is why the Scriptures remind us: “Man’s anger does not bring about God’s righteousness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020402/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Jas. 1:20</a>) Even if our anger is justified, imperfection may lead us to react in a wrong way.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">A sister in Germany named Cathy used to think, ‘If you don’t stand up for yourself, no one else will.’ But when she learned to trust in Jehovah, her attitude changed. “I no longer need to be on the defensive,” she says. “I feel free to act mildly, knowing that Jehovah has everything under perfect control.” If you have ever been a victim of injustice, following Jesus’ <span id="page19" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>example of trusting in God will also help you to maintain a mild spirit.</p><h2 id="p21" data-pid="21"><strong>“HAPPY ARE THE MILD-TEMPERED”</strong></h2><img src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/w20/2020/347" data-img-small-src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/w20/2020/346" alt="Collage: A brother displaying mildness in challenging situations. 1. He is driving a car while a couple in the car next to him insult him. 2. He is being pressured by his boss to work overtime. 3. While in the ministry, he is remaining composed while a householder yells and points her finger at him. 4. He is smiling and is at peace." width="450" height="253" class="north_center" />

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020402/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 5:5</a>) Note how mildness helps in the following situations.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"><strong>Mildness defuses tension in marriage.</strong> “I have said a lot of hurtful things to my wife that I didn’t mean,” admits Robert, a brother from Australia. “But rash words spoken in anger cannot be withdrawn. I felt so bad when I saw how much I had hurt her.”</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">“We all stumble many times” in our speech, and our thoughtless words can threaten marital peace. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020402/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Jas. 3:2</a>) On such occasions, mildness helps us to remain calm and control our tongue.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020402/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Prov. 17:27</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Robert worked hard to develop calmness and self-control. What has been the result? “Nowadays, whenever a disagreement arises, I make a conscious effort to listen carefully, to speak mildly, and not to allow myself to get upset,” he says. “My relationship with my wife is so much better.”</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"><strong>Mildness helps us to get along better with others.</strong> Those who are quick to take offense end up with few friends. Mildness, however, helps us “to maintain . . . the uniting bond of peace.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020402/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Eph. 4:2, 3</a>) Cathy, quoted earlier, says, “Mildness has given me the power to make every encounter with another person a bit more pleasant, even though some people are difficult to deal with.”</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb"><strong>Mildness brings inner peace.</strong> The Bible associates “the wisdom from above” with mildness and peace. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020402/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Jas. 3:13,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020402/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 17</a>) A mild person has “a calm heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020402/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Prov. 14:30</a>) Martin, who has worked hard to develop the quality of mildness, observes, “I am now more flexible and less aggressive, and I enjoy more inner peace and happiness.”</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">True, we may have to struggle to develop a mild spirit. “To be honest,” says one brother, “even to this day, I boil inside with anger on some occasions.” But Jehovah, who encourages us to pursue mildness, will help us in this struggle.

I would smash furniture, toys, whatever I found on hand.”​—Marco.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">We may not go to such extremes. Yet, all of us have difficulty controlling ourselves at times. This is primarily because we inherited sinful tendencies from the first man, Adam. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020445/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12</a>) Some, like Paul and Marco, have trouble controlling their temper.

Still others may have difficulty in resisting the urge to commit sexual immorality, to abuse alcohol, or to misuse drugs.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Those who allow their thinking, desires, and actions to go uncontrolled can ruin their lives. But we can avoid that outcome. How? By cultivating self-control. To help us do that, let us discuss three questions: (1) What is self-control? (2) Why is it essential? (3) How can we cultivate this quality that is one aspect of “the fruitage of the spirit”? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020445/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gal. 5:22, 23</a>) Then we will consider what we personally can do if we at times do not have self-control.</p><h2 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>WHAT IS SELF-CONTROL?</strong></h2><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">A person with self-control does not act on every impulse.

The Bible says: “When he was being insulted, he did not insult in return. When he was suffering, he did not threaten, but he entrusted himself to the One who judges righteously.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020445/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:23</a>) Jesus exercised such self-control when opposers ridiculed him as he hung on the torture stake.

Because self-control is an aspect of the fruitage of God’s spirit, and Jehovah gives his spirit to those asking him.

As evidence of that, Paul and Marco, mentioned earlier, each learned to control his violent temper. Consider also a brother who often lost his temper while driving, even getting into disputes with others. What did he do about it? “I prayed intensely every day. I studied articles on self-control and memorized helpful Bible verses. Although I have been working at this for years, it is still helpful for me to begin each day with the goal of remaining calm. And I leave early for appointments so as not to be in a hurry.”</p><h2 id="p19" data-pid="19"><strong>IF WE FAIL TO EXERCISE SELF-CONTROL</strong></h2><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">At times, we will fail to exercise self-control.
