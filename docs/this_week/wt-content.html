<div class="padding"><strong>[a]</strong> Footnote: 	<a href="#footnotesource1" class="fn-symbol">a</a> Since the days of Adam and Eve, Satan has promoted the idea that people should decide for themselves what is right and what is wrong. He wants us to adopt that same attitude toward Jehovah’s laws and toward any theocratic direction we receive. This article will help us to guard against the independent spirit of Satan’s world and to strengthen our resolve to stand firmly on Jehovah’s side.

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>IN THE late 1970’s, a 60-story skyscraper gradually rose above the skyline of Tokyo, Japan. Observers wondered how it would be able to withstand the frequent earthquakes in that city. The secret? Engineers designed the building to be rigid yet flexible enough to absorb seismic shocks. Christians are like that skyscraper. In what way?</p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> A Christian must maintain a balance between steadfastness and flexibility. He needs to be strong and immovable when it comes to upholding Jehovah’s laws and standards. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023485/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>1 Corinthians 15:58</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> He is “ready to obey” and does not compromise. On the other hand, he needs to be “reasonable,” or flexible, when the situation allows for it or even requires it. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023485/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jas. 3:17</a>) A Christian who has learned to have this balanced view will avoid the extremes of being either excessively rigid or overly permissive. In this article, we will consider how we can be immovable. We will also identify five ways that Satan tries to weaken our resolve and learn how we can resist his efforts.</p><br/>&nbsp;
