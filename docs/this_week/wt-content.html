Not necessarily. Jesus did not give a long explanation regarding the feeding habits of ravens or the cellular composition of lilies. Granted, your child may occasionally enjoy a deeper discussion about nature, but sometimes a simple observation or question is enough to make the point. Note what a brother named Christopher remembers from his childhood: “My mom would make simple comments to help us appreciate the creation around us. For example, when we were near mountains, she might say: ‘Look at how huge and beautiful those mountains are! Isn’t Jehovah amazing?’ Or when we were near the ocean, she might say: ‘Look at the power of those waves! Isn’t God powerful?’” Christopher says: “Those simple, thought-provoking comments had a big impact on us.”</p><br/>&nbsp;

Katya, a sister from Moldova, says: “My most vivid childhood memories are those spent with my parents in the countryside. I am grateful to them for teaching me from a young age to stop and observe what Jehovah has made and to see him through his creation.”</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> In God’s new world, parents and children will enjoy Jehovah’s creation as never before. Unlike today, we will have no reason to fear animals; nor will they fear us. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023325/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Isa. 11:6-9</a>) We will have endless time to enjoy what Jehovah has made. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023325/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 22:26</a>) But parents, do not wait until then to help your children to begin enjoying creation. As you use creation to teach your children about Jehovah, they will likely come to agree with what King David said: “O Jehovah, there are no works like yours.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023325/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 86:8</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;
