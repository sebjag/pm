<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> <strong>1.</strong><strong> When we consider the faith of Abraham, what question might we ask?</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>ALTHOUGH many people have heard of Abraham, most know little about him. However, you know a lot about Abraham. You know, for example, that Abraham has been called “the father of all those having faith.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023680/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rom. 4:11</a>) You may wonder, though, ‘Can I walk in the footsteps of Abraham and have the kind of faith he had?’ Yes, you can.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<div class="padding"><strong>[Rom. 4:11]</strong> <span id="v45-4-11-1" class="v"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/dx/r1/lp-e/1001070149/28125" class="vl vx vp study">11 </a>And he received a sign<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070149/122" data-bid="123-1" class="b">+</a>—namely, circumcision—as a seal of the righteousness by the faith he had while in his uncircumcised state, so that he might be the father of all those having faith<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070149/123" data-bid="124-1" class="b">+</a> while uncircumcised, in order for righteousness to be counted to them; </span>

<br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>2.</strong><strong> Why is it important to study Abraham’s example? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023680/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">James 2:22, 23</a>)</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> One way we can develop faith like that of Abraham is by studying his example. At God’s command, Abraham moved to a distant land, lived in tents for decades, and attempted to sacrifice his beloved son Isaac. Those actions reflected strong faith. Abraham’s faith and works resulted in his having God’s approval and friendship. <strong>(<span style="background-color:#b7ff95">Read</span></strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023680/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>James 2:22, 23</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Jehovah wants us​—wants <strong><em>you</em></strong>—​to enjoy those same blessings. For that reason, he inspired the Bible writers Paul and James to refer to Abraham’s example. Let us focus on his example, as it is discussed in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023680/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Romans chapter 4 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023680/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> James chapter 2</a>. Both chapters refer to a remarkable statement that was made concerning Abraham.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> For centuries, the relationship between faith and works has been hotly debated in Christendom. Some clergymen teach that all you have to do to be saved is believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. You may have heard them say, “Accept <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>Jesus and be saved.” Clergymen may even quote Paul’s words: “God counts righteousness apart from works.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023680/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rom. 4:6</a>) However, others contend that you can “save yourself” by going on religious pilgrimages and by performing other duties as outlined by the church. They perhaps quote <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023680/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">James 2:24</a>: “A man is to be declared righteous by works and not by faith alone.”</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> As a result of such positions, some religious writers have concluded that Paul and James disagreed on the subject of faith and works. Clergymen may claim that while Paul believed that a man is declared righteous by faith apart from works, James taught that works are essential in order to have God’s approval. A professor of divinity put it this way: “James did not understand Paul’s motive for insisting that [being declared righteous] is by faith alone and not by works.” But Jehovah inspired both Paul and James to write what they did. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023680/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:16</a>) So there must be a simple way to harmonize their statements.

Consequently, Paul <span id="page5" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>pointed to Abraham’s example to prove that a righteous standing with God does not result from “works of law.” It comes from faith. That is encouraging because knowing this gives us confidence that a good standing with God is within our reach. It means that we can develop faith in God and in Christ, which can actually lead to divine approval.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>12.</strong><strong> How did James explain the connection between faith and works? (See also picture.)</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> In the first example, James spoke of the need for Christians to be impartial in their dealings with others. He illustrated this point with the case of a man who showed favor to a wealthy person but looked down on a poor person. James pointed out that such a man might claim to have faith, but where are his corresponding works? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023680/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Jas. 2:1-5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023680/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 9</a>) As a second example, James mentioned someone who saw ‘a brother or a sister lacking clothing or food’ but did not provide practical help. Even if that one claimed to have faith, it was not backed up by actions; therefore, it was useless. As James wrote, “faith by itself, without works, is dead.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023680/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Jas. 2:14-17</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;
