We gain that confidence by studying Bible prophecy. This article will discuss specific reasons why we should study what the Bible foretells. We will also briefly examine two of the prophecies recorded by Daniel and see how we personally can benefit when we understand them.

Or are you a little intimidated by prophecy? You may even feel that studying prophecies can be boring. However, when you learn more about why Jehovah had them included in his Word, you may change your opinion.</p><br/>&nbsp;

Consider this illustration. Imagine that you are visiting an unfamiliar place but a friend who is traveling with you is well-acquainted with the area. He knows exactly where you are and where each road leads. No doubt you would be glad that your friend agreed to come with you! In a similar way, Jehovah knows where we are in the stream of time and what is on the road ahead of us. So to understand Bible prophecy, we must humbly ask for Jehovah’s help.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023521/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Dan. 2:28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023521/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2 Pet. 1:19, 20</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> <strong>5.</strong><strong> What can a young person learn from Max’s experience?</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> At school, our young ones are often surrounded by those who have little or no respect for the Bible. Their comments and conduct can raise doubts in the mind of a young Witness. Note the experience of a brother named Max. He says, “When I was in my teens, I started to doubt that my parents were teaching me the true religion and that the Bible was inspired by God.” What did his parents do? He says, “They reacted calmly, even though I know they were worried.” Max’s parents answered his questions from the Bible. Max did something too. “I studied Bible prophecy for myself,” he says, “and I discussed what I learned with other young ones.” With what result? Max says, “After that, I was convinced that the Bible is inspired by God!”</p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> <strong>6.</strong><strong> What do you need to do if you have doubts, and why?</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> If, like Max, you begin to doubt that the Bible contains the truth, you do not need to feel guilty. But you do need to do something about it. Doubt is like rust. If ignored, it can slowly destroy something valuable. To begin removing any “rust” from your faith, you need to ask yourself, ‘Do I believe what the Bible says about the future?’ If you are not sure, then you need to study Bible prophecies that have already come true. How can you go about doing that?</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> From Daniel’s description of the dream image and particularly its feet, we learn several important truths. First, the Anglo-American World Power has shown its strength in some ways. For example, it played a key role in winning World War I and World War II. However, this world power has been weakened and will continue to be weakened by internal conflicts among its own citizens. Second, this alliance will be the last world power to rule before God’s Kingdom puts an end to all human kingdoms. Even though other nations may at times challenge the Anglo-American World Power, they will not replace it. We know that because “the stone” representing God’s Kingdom will crush the feet, the part of the image that depicts the Anglo-American alliance.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023521/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Dan. 2:34, 35,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023521/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 44, 45</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

In recent decades, though, Jehovah’s servants living in the realm of that king have faced more subtle tests of their loyalty to God’s Kingdom. For instance, during election campaigns, a Christian might feel tempted to support one political party or candidate over another.

Without a doubt, we can trust that Jehovah will reveal to us what we need to know at exactly the right time, just as he did in the past.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023521/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Amos 3:7</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;
