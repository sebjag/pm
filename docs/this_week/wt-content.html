We learned, for example, that some individuals may have an opportunity to side with Jehovah’s people even <strong><em>after</em></strong> Babylon the Great is destroyed. We also learned that as of November 2023, Kingdom publishers would no longer be asked to report all their activity in the ministry. Do such changes make our ministry less important, less urgent than before? Absolutely not!</p><br/>&nbsp;

<div class="padding"><strong>[a]</strong> Footnote: 	<a href="#footnotesource1" class="fn-symbol">a</a> The annual meeting was held on October 7, 2023, at the Newburgh Assembly Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses in New York, U.S.A.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[44]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> As we reflect on our ministry, we do well to consider a soul-searching question: <strong><em>Why</em></strong> do we preach the good news? Put simply, <strong><em>love</em></strong> motivates us to preach. What we do in the preaching work reflects our love​—our love for the good news, our love for people and, above all, our love for Jehovah and his name.

Ernest recalls: “I wondered: ‘Has he gone to heaven? Or has he ceased to exist forever?’ I envied other children who still had a father.” Ernest would regularly go to the cemetery, kneel at his father’s grave, and pray: “Please, God, I want to know where my dad is.” About 17 years after his father died, Ernest was offered a Bible study, which he readily accepted. He was thrilled to learn that the dead are unconscious, as if in a deep sleep, and that the Bible promises a future resurrection. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024406/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Eccl. 9:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024406/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024406/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Acts 24:15</a>) Finally, he found the answers to the questions that had troubled him for so long! Ernest was very excited about the Bible truths he was learning. His wife, Rose, joined him in the study and shared his love for the Kingdom message. In 1978 they got baptized. They eagerly shared their treasured beliefs with family, friends, and any others who would listen. As a result, Ernest and Rose have helped more than 70 individuals to progress to baptism.</p><br/>&nbsp;
