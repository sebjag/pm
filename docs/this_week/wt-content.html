However, we are not perfect, so at times we may find it challenging to deal with a fellow believer in a loving way. Let us examine why love is so important and how we can imitate Jesus’ example when we deal with the imperfections of one another.

The Witnesses were polite and well-dressed, and their children were well-behaved.” He adds: “Above all, these people seemed to have a feeling of contentment and peace​—something I yearned for.

They were wrong to ask for positions of prominence in the Kingdom. But the other apostles were also wrong to allow the situation to disrupt their unity. Jesus, though, dealt with all 12 apostles in a kind and loving way. The lesson for us? What matters is not only what other people do but also how we <strong><em>react</em></strong> to their mistakes and shortcomings. What can help us? When we are upset with a fellow believer, we can ask ourselves: ‘Why does what he did bother me so much? Does it reveal a negative trait that I need to work on? Could it be that the person who upset me is dealing with a difficulty? Even if I feel that I am justified for being upset, can I show unselfish love by overlooking the offense?’ The more we deal with others in a loving way, the more we prove to be Jesus’ true followers.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> A traveling overseer serving in East Africa recalls a brother who he felt had an abrasive personality. How did the circuit overseer respond? He says: “Instead of avoiding the brother, I resolved to get to know him better.” In doing so, the circuit overseer learned some things <span id="page31" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="31" data-before-text="31"></span>about the brother’s background that had influenced his personality. The circuit overseer continues: “Once I understood how hard the brother had struggled to overcome his background and how far he had come, I admired him. We became good friends.” Indeed, when we try to understand our brothers and sisters, we often find it easier to show them love.</p><br/>&nbsp;
