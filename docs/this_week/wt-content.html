<br/>Ways we can maintain and even increase the joy we find in giving.<br/>&nbsp;
<br/><strong>1-2.</strong><strong> How do we benefit from being created with the ability to find more happiness in giving than in receiving?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>WHEN Jehovah created humans, he designed them with the ability to find more happiness in giving than in receiving. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024567/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>) Does this mean that we do not gain any happiness from receiving? No. We know from experience that we feel good when we receive a gift. Still, we feel even greater happiness when we are the giver. And really, it is to our benefit that Jehovah made us this way. Why?<br/>&nbsp;

<div class="padding"><strong>[Acts 20:35]</strong> <span id="v44-20-35-1" class="v"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/dx/r1/lp-e/1001070148/27753" class="vl vx vp study">35 </a>I have shown you in all things that by working hard in this way,<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070148/682" data-bid="683-1" class="b">+</a> you must assist those who are weak and must keep in mind the words of the Lord Jesus, when he himself said: ‘There is more happiness in giving<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070148/683" data-bid="684-1" class="b">+</a> than there is in receiving.’”</span>
</div>

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> By creating us the way he did, Jehovah allows <strong><em>us</em></strong> to influence our happiness.

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> The Scriptures assure us that giving brings happiness, so it is little wonder that the Bible describes Jehovah as “the happy God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024567/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Tim. 1:11</a>) He is the original and greatest Giver.

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> All of us would probably like to experience even more of the happiness that comes from giving. We can do so by imitating Jehovah’s generosity.

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> What are some ways that Jehovah shows generosity? Consider a few examples. <strong><em>Jehovah gives us material things.</em></strong> We may not always have luxuries, but thanks to Jehovah, most of us have what we need.

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Put simply, Jehovah provides for our physical needs because he loves us.

(<span style="background-color:#b7ff95">Read</span> .)</strong> Jesus uses examples from creation. Speaking of birds, Jesus says: “They do not sow seed or reap or gather into storehouses.” However, notice what he next says: “Your heavenly Father feeds them.” Then Jesus asks: “Are you not worth more than they are?” The point? Jehovah views his worshippers as far more valuable than animal creation. If Jehovah cares for the needs of animals, we can be sure that he will provide for us!

<br/> <strong>7.</strong><strong> What is one way we can imitate Jehovah’s generosity? (See also picture.)</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Like Jehovah, we too can give materially out of love. For example, are you acquainted with a fellow believer who is in need of food or clothing? Jehovah can use you to give him something to help fill that need. Jehovah’s people are especially known for showing generosity when disaster strikes. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, brothers and sisters shared food, clothing, and other supplies with ones who were in need. Many also made generous contributions to the worldwide work. That helped to fund relief efforts around <span id="page28" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>the globe. They took to heart the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024567/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:16</a>: “Do not forget to do good and to share what you have with others, for God is well-pleased with such sacrifices.”<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Though we are imperfect humans, we can imitate Jehovah’s generous use of power. We cannot literally impart strength, or energy, to others. But we can use our power in their behalf. For example, we might run errands or do household chores for an elderly or infirm Christian. If our circumstances permit, we could volunteer to help with the cleaning and the maintenance of the Kingdom Hall. Our use of power in such ways benefits others who worship Jehovah.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> Those who provide training do well to imitate the manner in which Jehovah shares his wisdom. Recall that Jehovah gives wisdom generously. Likewise, we freely share our knowledge and experience with those who are learning. We do not withhold some of our knowledge out of fear that the learner may eventually replace us. Nor do we take the view: ‘No one trained me! Let him learn on his own.’ Such an attitude has no place among Jehovah’s people. Rather, we gladly impart not only our knowledge “but also our very selves” to those we train.

However, what if we notice that we have been giving​—at least in part—​because we hope to receive something in return? We would do well to try what Jesus suggested. We can be hospitable to someone who we know does not have the means to show us hospitality. Then we will be happy because we are imitating Jehovah.

Some may feel deep gratitude but have difficulty expressing it. They might be embarrassed to receive help, especially if in the past they were the ones helping others.

About eight years later, the sister replied in a letter, saying: “I felt I just had to write and tell you of the help you have been to me over the years without your really being aware of it.” She went on: “[Your note] was very warm, but it was the scripture that reached my heart, and I never forgot it.”<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2024567/0">a</a> After explaining some of the challenges she had faced, the sister said: “At times I wanted out, out of the truth, out of the responsibilities​—just out.

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><strong><sup>21</sup></strong></span> As mentioned, Jehovah created us with a special ability. Although we enjoy receiving, we gain even greater happiness when we give to others. We feel good when we are able to help our fellow believers. And we are happy when they express their appreciation. Yet, whether the receiver expresses appreciation or not, we can be glad that we did the right thing. Never forget that whatever you give, “Jehovah has the means to give you much more.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024567/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">2 Chron. 25:9</a>) We simply cannot outgive Jehovah!
