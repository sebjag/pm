Several Bible accounts describe Jehovah’s judgments against unrighteous people, such as the unknown numbers who died in the Flood or the seven nations in the Promised Land that Jehovah ordered his people to devote to destruction or the 185,000 Assyrian soldiers slain by an angel of Jehovah in a single night.

King Solomon is an example. He was thoroughly instructed in God’s ways and greatly blessed by Jehovah; yet, he later turned to worshipping false gods. His sins made Jehovah furious and brought consequences that lasted for centuries. True, the Scriptures do say that Solomon “was laid to rest with his forefathers,” including such faithful men as King David.

Resurrection is a gift from a loving God. He bestows it on those whom he wants to give an opportunity to serve him forever.

The apostle Peter was inspired to echo what the prophet Ezekiel wrote, saying that “Jehovah . . . does <strong><em>not</em></strong> desire <strong><em>anyone</em></strong> to be destroyed.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024404/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:9</a>) In the light of that reassuring truth, we <strong><em>know</em></strong> that Jehovah is not quick to destroy people once and for all. He is profoundly merciful, and he shows mercy whenever possible.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<div class="padding"><strong>[study note]</strong> <br/><strong>the son of destruction:</strong> In this context, the expression refers to Judas Iscariot, whose deliberate betrayal of God’s Son made Judas subject to eternal destruction, one who was unworthy of a resurrection. The same expression is used at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070685/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2Th 2:3</a> with reference to “the man of lawlessness.” In the original Bible languages, the term “son(s) of” is sometimes used in a figurative sense about someone who pursues a certain course of conduct or who manifests a certain characteristic. Examples are such expressions as “sons of the Most High,” “sons of light and sons of day,” “sons of the Kingdom,” “sons of the wicked one,” “son of the Devil,” and “sons of disobedience.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070685/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Lu 6:35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070685/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 1Th 5:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070685/19/2" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> Mt 13:38;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070685/19/3" data-bid="20-4" class="b"> Ac 13:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070685/19/4" data-bid="20-5" class="b"> Eph 2:2</a>) In a similar way, the expression “son of” can be used to refer to the judgment or outcome that results from following a certain course or displaying a certain characteristic. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070685/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2Sa 12:5</a>, the expression rendered “deserves to die” is literally “is a son of death.” At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070685/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Mt 23:15</a>, the literal expression “a son of Gehenna” is used about someone who is deserving of eternal destruction, which was apparently what Jesus meant when he called Judas Iscariot “the son of destruction.”​—See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1001070685/9/0">study note on Mt 23:15</a> and Glossary, “<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1001070685/10/0">Gehenna</a>.”

<div class="padding"><strong>[study notes]</strong> <br/><strong>blasphemes against the holy spirit:</strong> Blasphemy refers to defamatory, injurious, or abusive speech against God or against sacred things.

King David got involved in a series of gross sins, including adultery and murder. Yet, David repented, so Jehovah mercifully forgave him.

The “Judgment Day” he referred to in both instances was surely the same. Like the Ninevites, the people of Sodom and Gomorrah did bad things. But the Ninevites had an opportunity to repent. Further, remember what Jesus said about the “resurrection of judgment.” It will include “those who practiced vile things.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024404/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">John 5:29</a>) So it seems that there may be some hope for the people of Sodom and Gomorrah. It is possible that at least some of those people will be resurrected, and we may have the opportunity to teach them about Jehovah and Jesus Christ.</p>

<br/><strong>Box title:</strong> What Did Jude Mean?</h2><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p78" data-pid="78">Decades after Jesus died, his half brother Jude wrote that Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them had undergone “the judicial punishment of everlasting fire.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024404/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Jude 7</a>) What did Jude mean? Was he contradicting Jesus’ message? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024404/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Luke 10:12</a>) No. Jesus did not say that everyone in Sodom and Gomorrah would be resurrected. Rather, he suggested that there was hope for at least some of them. It seems that the cities themselves, rather than all their inhabitants, were everlastingly destroyed as a dramatic warning against immoral conduct. What Jude wrote was in harmony with what the prophet Jeremiah had said when he explained that those wicked cities were just like ancient Edom and Babylon, which were destroyed forever, never to be rebuilt or inhabited again. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024404/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Jer. 49:17, 18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024404/49/1" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> 50:35,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024404/49/2" data-bid="50-3" class="b"> 39, 40</a>) Additionally, both Jude and the apostle Peter allowed for the possibility that some of those people whom God had destroyed will not be resurrected.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024404/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">2 Pet. 2:6</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;
