<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Zadok was a priest who worked closely with High Priest Abiathar. Zadok was also a seer who was able to discern the divine will and who was granted extraordinary insight. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024480/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Sam. 15:27</a>) People would turn to Zadok when they needed wise advice. He was also a man of courage. It is this aspect of his personality that we will focus on in this article.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> As Jehovah’s people, we wholeheartedly support God’s Kingdom, but we often need courage to do so. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024480/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 6:33</a>) For example, in this wicked world, we need courage to live by Jehovah’s standards and to preach the Kingdom good news. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024480/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Thess. 2:2</a>) And it often takes courage to remain politically neutral in this increasingly divided system of things. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024480/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 18:36</a>) Many among Jehovah’s people have suffered financial loss, have been physically abused, or have been imprisoned because of refusing to participate in political or military activity.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/> <strong>5.</strong><strong> Why did Zadok need courage to support David?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Zadok did not go to Hebron just to celebrate David’s kingship. He went there armed and ready for battle. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024480/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Chron. 12:38</a>) He was willing to follow David into battle and to defend Israel from its enemies. What Zadok possibly lacked in experience as a warrior, he made up for in courage.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/> <strong>6.</strong><strong> How did David set a good example of courage for Zadok to follow? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024480/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Psalm 138:3</a>)</strong><br/>&nbsp;

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Where did a priest like Zadok learn to be so courageous? He was surrounded by men who were strong and courageous. No doubt he benefited from their example. For instance, David’s example of courageously “leading Israel on its campaigns” moved all of Israel to support him wholeheartedly.

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> Consider Viktor and Vitalii, two spiritual brothers who worked to deliver food and water to their fellow believers in Ukraine. “We looked everywhere for food,” says Viktor. “Often there was shooting around us. One brother donated food from his store. This donation gave many publishers what they needed to survive for some time. As we were loading items into our truck, a rocket landed about 20 meters (66 ft) away from us. Throughout the day, I implored Jehovah to give me the courage I needed to continue to help the publishers.”<br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> “It called for a lot of courage,” says Vitalii. “My first trip took 12 hours. I prayed to Jehovah the whole way.” Vitalii was courageous, but he was also cautious. He adds: “I kept asking Jehovah for wisdom and modesty. I drove only on the roads approved by the authorities. I have benefited from seeing firsthand how the brothers and sisters worked together. They cleared obstacles from the road, collected and loaded humanitarian aid, and provided us with food and places to rest along the way.”<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><strong>18.</strong><strong> What do you learn from Marco and Sidse’s experience?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> Consider the example of Marco and his wife, Sidse, whose two adult daughters left the truth. Marco says: “From the day your children are born, you love them so much. You would do anything to protect them from harm. So when they choose to leave Jehovah, it is heartbreaking.” He continues: “But Jehovah has been by our side. He has made sure that when <strong><em>I</em></strong> am weak, my wife is strong, and when <strong><em>she</em></strong> is weak, I am strong.” Sidse adds: “We would not have been able to endure if Jehovah had not provided us with the strength we needed. I was struggling with the feeling that it was my fault, so I told Jehovah how I felt. After a short time, a sister whom I hadn’t seen for many years came up to me, laid her hands on my shoulders, looked me in the eyes, and said: ‘Remember, Sidse, it is not your fault!’ With Jehovah’s help, I have managed to maintain my joy in serving him.”<br/>&nbsp;
<br/><strong>19.</strong><strong> What are you determined to do?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> Jehovah wants all his worshippers to be courageous like Zadok.

So when you find yourself in a situation where you need courage, turn to Jehovah. You can be sure that he will make you as courageous as Zadok was!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024480/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:10</a>.
