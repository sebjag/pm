<br/><strong>FOCUS</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/>Jehovah cares deeply about those who suffer from emotional wounds. This article will show how he alleviates our grief and helps us to comfort others.<br/>&nbsp;
<br/> <strong>1.</strong><strong> How does Jehovah feel about his servants?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>WHAT does Jehovah see when he looks at his servants on earth? He is aware of our joys and our sorrows. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024601/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 37:18</a>) When he sees that we are serving him to the best of our ability despite coping with painful emotions, how pleased he is! More than that, he is eager to support and comfort us.<br/>&nbsp;

<div class="padding"><strong>[Ps. 37:18]</strong> <span id="v19-37-18-1" class="v"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/dx/r1/lp-e/1001070123/14501" class="vl vx vp">18 </a>Jehovah is aware of what the blameless go through,<a id="footnotesource230" data-fnid="230" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1001070123/229">*</a> (<i>Footnote: 	Lit., “the days of the blameless.”</i>) </span></p><p data-pid="786" class="sz"><span id="v19-37-18-2" class="v">And their inheritance will last forever.<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070123/713" data-bid="714-1" class="b">+</a></span>

<br/> <strong>2.</strong><strong> What does Jehovah do for the brokenhearted, and how can we benefit from his care?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024601/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 147:3</a> says that Jehovah ‘binds up the wounds’ of the brokenhearted. Jehovah is here pictured as tenderly caring for those who have been injured emotionally. What must we do to benefit from Jehovah’s care? Consider an illustration. A skilled doctor can do much to help an injured person to heal. To benefit, though, the injured person must carefully follow the doctor’s instructions. In this article, we will see what Jehovah says in his Word to those who are suffering emotionally and we will consider how to apply his loving advice.

<br/> <strong>3.</strong><strong> Why do some feel that they have little worth?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> We live in a world devoid of love, and sadly, many people have been made to feel that they have little worth. A sister named Helen<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2024601/0">a</a> says: “I grew up in a loveless family. My dad was violent and drummed into us <span id="page7" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>daily how useless we were.” Perhaps, like Helen, you have been mistreated, frequently criticized, or made to feel unlovable. If so, you may find it difficult to believe that anyone genuinely cares about you.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/> <strong>5.</strong><strong> What can we learn from the way Jesus treated those who were looked down on by others?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> We can learn about Jehovah’s feelings by considering Jesus’ example. During his earthly ministry, Jesus took notice of those who were looked down on by others, and he treated them with compassion. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024601/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 9:9-12</a>) When a woman hoping to be healed of a grievous sickness touched his garment, Jesus comforted her and commended her for her faith. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024601/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mark 5:25-34</a>) Jesus perfectly reflects his Father’s personality. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024601/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 14:9</a>) So you can be certain that Jehovah values you and takes note of your good qualities, including your faith and your love for him.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/> <strong>9.</strong><strong> Why should we do our best to focus on the present and the future rather than on the past?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> If you are troubled by regrets about the past, do your best to focus on the present and on the future rather than on the past. Consider the example of the apostle Paul. He regretted that he had once viciously persecuted Christians, but he knew that Jehovah had forgiven him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024601/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Tim. 1:12-15</a>) Did he then continue to mull over the sins of his past? He no doubt refused to do so, just as he did not dwell on his former accomplishments as an adherent of Judaism. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024601/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Phil. 3:4-8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024601/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 13-15</a>) Instead, Paul zealously cared for his ministry and looked ahead to the future. Like Paul, you cannot change the past. But you can honor Jehovah in your present circumstances and look ahead to the wonderful future that he has promised you.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> To receive support from others, we may need to ask for it. Our brothers and sisters love us and want to help.

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> Resist the urge to isolate yourself. Because of painful emotions, you may not feel like interacting with others. At times, your brothers and sisters may misunderstand you or fail to choose the right words. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024601/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Jas. 3:2</a>) Do not let such challenges prevent you from receiving the encouragement you need. An elder named Gavin, who suffers from depression, says: “Keeping in touch with friends is often the last thing I feel like doing.” Nevertheless, Gavin does not give in to his feelings, and he benefits from his association with others. A sister named Amy says: “Because of my past experiences, I have difficulty trusting people. But I am learning to love and trust my brothers and sisters as Jehovah does. I know that this makes Jehovah happy, and it makes me happy too.”
