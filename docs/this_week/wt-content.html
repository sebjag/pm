<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[43]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> The word “Nazirite” comes from the Hebrew term that means “One Singled Out,” “Separated One,” or “Dedicated One.” This term aptly describes the zealous Israelites who made certain personal sacrifices to serve Jehovah in a special way. The Mosaic Law allowed for a man or a woman to make a special vow to Jehovah by choosing to live as a Nazirite for a period of time.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2024282/0">a</a> <strong>(<span style="background-color:#b7ff95">Read</span>&nbsp;</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024282/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Numbers 6:1, 2</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> That vow, or solemn promise, involved following guidelines that the rest of the Israelites did not have to observe. Why, then, would an Israelite choose to take the Nazirite vow? Such an Israelite was likely motivated by deep love for Jehovah and sincere gratitude for His rich blessing.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024282/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Deut. 6:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024282/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 16:17</a>.</p>

Sadly, however, there were times in Israel’s history when Nazirites were not appreciated or supported.

Consider the example of Benjamin, a ten-year-old Witness in Norway. His school held an event in support of war-torn Ukraine. The children were asked to sing a song while dressed in Ukraine’s national colors. Benjamin planned to avoid this nationalistic event by remaining a discreet distance away from where it would take place. However, a teacher saw him and <span id="page17" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>loudly called out: “You must come and join us now. We are all waiting for you!” Benjamin courageously approached the teacher and said: “I am neutral, and I do not join in political demonstrations. In fact, many of Jehovah’s Witnesses are in prison because they refuse to go to war.” The teacher accepted this explanation and excused Benjamin from the event. However, his classmates began to ask why he did not join them. Benjamin was so nervous that he almost started to cry; yet, he bravely repeated to the whole class what he had said to the teacher. Afterward, Benjamin told his parents that he felt that Jehovah had helped him to stand up for his faith.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[71]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> We can certainly learn much from the fine example set by the volunteer Nazirites of old! However, this arrangement also reveals something about our heavenly Father, Jehovah. He is confident that we sincerely desire to please him and that we are willing to make sacrifices to live up to our dedication vow. He dignifies us by letting us express our love for him in a personal way.

May we, then, be determined to continue serving Jehovah, willingly offering him our very best.</p>
