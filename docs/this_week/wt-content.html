<div class="padding"><strong>[a]</strong> Footnote: 	<a href="#footnotesource1" class="fn-symbol">a</a> Now more than ever, it is important for us to show love for our brothers and sisters. Why is that so, and how can we demonstrate our love more fully?
</div>


<br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"><strong>1-2.</strong><strong> (a) Why could the apostle Paul say that love is “the greatest” quality? (b) What questions will we consider?</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>WHEN the apostle Paul was discussing faith, hope, and love, he concluded by saying that “the greatest of these [qualities] is love.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023641/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:13</a>) Why could Paul say this? In the future, we will no longer need to have faith in God’s promises about his new world or hope that those promises will be fulfilled because they will already be realized. But we will always need to have love for Jehovah and for people. In fact, our love for them will keep growing forever.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<div class="padding"><strong>[1 Cor. 13:13]</strong> <span id="v46-13-13-1" class="v"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/dx/r1/lp-e/1001070150/28770" class="vl vx vp study">13 </a>Now, however, these three remain: faith, hope, love; but the greatest of these is love.<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070150/375" data-bid="376-1" class="b">+</a></span>

<br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Since we will always need to have love, we will consider three questions. First, why should we love one another? Second, how do we show love for one another? Third, how can we keep our love for one another strong?</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> Why is it important for us to love one another? Among other reasons, love identifies us as true Christians. Jesus told his apostles: “By this all will know that you are my disciples​—if you have love among yourselves.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023641/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 13:35</a>) Further, having love for one another keeps us united. Paul called love “a perfect bond of union.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023641/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Col. 3:14</a>) There is, however, still another important reason why we should love one another. The <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>apostle John wrote to fellow believers: “Whoever loves God must also love his brother.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023641/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 John 4:21</a>) When we show love for one another, we show our love for God.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"><strong>4-5.</strong><strong> Illustrate how our love for God is connected to our love for one another.</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> In what way is our love for God closely connected to the love we show for our brothers and sisters? To illustrate, consider the connection that exists between our heart and other parts of our body. When a physician checks our pulse on our wrist to see if it is weak or strong, he may be able to get some information about the condition of our heart. How could we apply this principle to the topic of love?</p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Just as a doctor is able to get some information about the health of our heart when checking our pulse, we can get some information about the strength of our love for God by checking our love for others. If we notice that our love for fellow believers has weakened somewhat, this may indicate that our love for God is also growing weak. But when we regularly show love for fellow believers, this signals that our love for God is strong.</p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>6.</strong><strong> Why should we be concerned if our love for our brothers and sisters is weakening?

Why? Because it would mean that we are in spiritual danger. The apostle John makes that clear when he reminds us: “The one who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023641/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 John 4:20</a>) What is the lesson for us?

According to a Bible reference work, the word that Paul used for “comfort” means “standing beside a person to encourage him when he is undergoing severe testing.” Thus, by giving comfort, we help a fellow believer who is in distress to get up and to continue walking on the road to life. Each time we offer a brother or a sister a shoulder to cry on, we express our love for our fellow believer.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023641/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Cor. 7:6, 7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023641/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 13</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"><strong>10.</strong><strong> What is the connection between compassion and comfort?</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Feeling compassion and giving comfort are closely related. In what way? A compassionate person is moved to comfort others and to try to relieve their suffering. So first we feel compassion; then we give comfort. Note how Paul connects Jehovah’s compassion to the comfort He gives. Paul describes Jehovah as “the Father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023641/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Cor. 1:3</a>) As a <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/2023641/1/0">study note</a> on this verse explains, Paul uses the expression “tender mercies” to describe a feeling of compassion for others. Thus, “God is called the Father, or the Source, of tender mercies because compassion emanates from him.” And that compassion moves him to comfort “us in all our trials.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023641/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Cor. 1:4</a>) Just as pure water flowing from a spring brings refreshment to those who are thirsty, Jehovah brings refreshment and comfort to those who are distressed. How can we imitate Jehovah in feeling compassion and in providing comfort to others? One way we can do so is by cultivating qualities in our heart that are related to giving comfort. What are some of these qualities?</p><br/>&nbsp;

<div class="padding"><strong>[study note]</strong> <br/><strong>the Father of tender mercies:</strong> The Greek noun rendered “tender mercies” (<em>oi·ktir·mosʹ</em>) is here used to describe a feeling of compassion, or pity, for others. God is called <strong>the Father,</strong> or the Source, <strong>of tender mercies</strong> because compassion emanates from him and is part of his nature. Such tender feelings move him to act mercifully in behalf of his faithful servants who are suffering tribulation.<br/><strong>the God of all comfort:</strong> The Greek noun <em>pa·raʹkle·sis,</em> here rendered “comfort,” literally means “a calling to one’s side.” It conveys the idea of standing next to a person, helping or encouraging him when he is undergoing trials or feeling sad. (See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1001070750/6/0">study note on Ro 12:8</a>.) Some have suggested that Paul’s emphasis on comfort from God echoes <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070750/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isa 40:1</a>, where the prophet writes: “‘Comfort, comfort my people,’ says your God.” (See also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070750/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isa 51:12</a>.) Additionally, the related Greek term rendered “helper” (<em>pa·raʹkle·tos</em>) at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070750/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Joh 14:26</a> refers to Jehovah’s holy spirit. God uses his powerful active force to give comfort and help in situations that from a human viewpoint seem hopeless.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070750/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ac 9:31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070750/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Eph 3:16</a>.

Nonetheless, we should remain alert so that we are not influenced by the lack of love in the world around us. With that thought in mind, let us consider this important question: Is there a way to test whether our love for our brothers is strong?</p><br/>&nbsp;

The first part of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023641/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">verse 8</a> describes the type of love we need to have​—“intense love.” The word Peter used for “intense” literally means “stretched out.” The second part of the verse describes the effect that intense love can have. It covers the sins of our brothers. We could picture it this way: We grasp our love with both hands, as if it were an extendable piece of fabric, and stretch it out more and more until it covers, not one, not two, but “a multitude of sins.” To cover is a descriptive way of saying to forgive. Just as a piece <span id="page12" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>of fabric can cover a stain, love can cover the weaknesses and imperfections of others.</p><br/>&nbsp;
