However, we must recognize that there are some things that we just <strong><em>do not</em></strong> know about the near future. In this article, we will first discuss why we have reconsidered what we have said about some of those events.

We came to that conclusion because we understood that the account of the Flood was a prophetic type. For example, we reasoned that just as Jehovah shut the door of the ark prior to the start of the Flood, he would, at the beginning of the great tribulation, “shut the door” on Satan’s system of things, thus preventing any more people from being saved.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024405/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 24:37-39</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[44]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Should we view the account of the Flood as a prophetic type? The answer is no.

This does not mean, however, that we cannot learn from the account of Noah and the Flood.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>6-7.</strong><strong> Why can we conclude that we will not reach everyone on earth with the good news before the end comes? Explain.</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[48]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Consider what Jesus said about the scope of our preaching work. He foretold that the good news would be preached “in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024405/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>) That prophecy is being fulfilled today as never before. The Kingdom message is published in more than 1,000 languages, and by means of the jw.org website, it is available to the majority of the world’s population.</p><br/>&nbsp;
