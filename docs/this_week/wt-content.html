This translation renders those four letters, known as the Tetragrammaton, “Jehovah.” That name is by far the most frequently occurring name in the Bible. While the inspired writers refer to God by many titles and descriptive terms, such as “Almighty,” “Most High,” and “Lord,” the Tetragrammaton is the only personal name they use to identify God.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Jehovah God himself directed Bible writers to use his name. For example, he inspired the prophet Joel to write: “Everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001061204/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Joel 2:32</a>) And God caused one psalmist to write: “May people know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001061204/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 83:18</a>) In fact, the divine name appears some 700 times in the book of Psalms alone—a book of poetic writings that were to be sung and recited by God’s people.

The text is in the style of the Hebrew letters commonly used after the Babylonian exile, but the Tetragrammaton appears repeatedly in distinctive ancient Hebrew letters</p></figcaption><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>Why is the name missing from many Bible translations?</strong> The reasons vary. Some feel that Almighty God does not need a unique name to identify him. Others appear to have been influenced by the Jewish tradition of avoiding the use of the name, perhaps out of fear of desecrating it. Still others believe that since no one can be sure of the exact pronunciation of God’s name, it is better just to use a title, such as “Lord” or “God.” Such objections, however, lack merit for the following reasons:</p><ul><li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="su">  Those who argue that Almighty God does not need a unique name ignore evidence that early copies of his Word, including <span id="page1733" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1733" data-before-text="1733"></span>those preserved from before the time of Christ, contain God’s personal name. As noted above, God directed that his name be included in his Word some 7,000 times. Obviously, he wants us to know and use his name.</p></li><li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">  Translators who remove the name out of deference to Jewish tradition fail to recognize a key fact. While some Jewish scribes refused to pronounce the name, they did not remove it from their copies of the Bible. Ancient scrolls found in Qumran, near the Dead Sea, contain the name in many places. Some Bible translators hint that the divine name appeared in the original text by substituting the title “LORD” in capital letters. But the question remains, Why have these translators felt free to substitute or remove God’s name from the Bible when they acknowledge that it is found in the Bible text thousands of times? Who do they believe gave them authority to make such a change? Only they can say.</p></li><li><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="su">  Those who say that the divine name should not be used because it is not known exactly how to pronounce it will nevertheless freely use the name Jesus. However, Jesus’ first-century disciples said his name quite differently from the way most Christians do today. To Jewish Christians, the name Jesus was probably pronounced <em>Ye·shuʹa‛.</em> And the title “Christ” was <em>Ma·shiʹach,</em> or “Messiah.” Greek-speaking Christians called him <em>I·e·sousʹ Khri·stosʹ,</em> and Latin-speaking Christians <em>Ieʹsus Chriʹstus.</em> Under inspiration, the Greek translation of his name was recorded in the Bible, showing that first-century Christians followed the sensible course of using the form of the name common in their language. Similarly, the New World Bible Translation Committee feels that it is reasonable to use the form “Jehovah,” even though that rendering is not exactly the way the divine name would have been pronounced in ancient Hebrew.</p></li></ul><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><strong>Why does the <em>New World Translation</em> use the form “Jehovah”?</strong> In English, the four letters of the Tetragrammaton (<span class="altsize">יהוה</span>) are represented by the consonants <em>YHWH.</em> As was true of all written words in ancient Hebrew, the Tetragrammaton contained no vowels. When ancient Hebrew was in everyday use, readers easily provided the appropriate vowels.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">About a thousand years after the Hebrew Scriptures were completed, Jewish scholars developed a system of pronunciation points, or signs, by which to indicate what vowels to use when reading Hebrew. By that time, though, many Jews had the <span id="page1734" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1734" data-before-text="1734"></span>superstitious idea that it was wrong to say God’s personal name out loud, so they used substitute expressions. Thus, it seems that when they copied the Tetragrammaton, they combined the vowels for the <em>substitute expressions</em> with the four consonants representing the divine name. Therefore, the manuscripts with those vowel points do not help in determining how the name was originally pronounced in Hebrew. Some feel that the name was pronounced “Yahweh,” whereas others suggest different possibilities. A Dead Sea Scroll containing a portion of Leviticus in Greek transliterates the divine name <em>Iao.</em> Besides that form, early Greek writers also suggest the pronunciations <em>Iae, I·a·beʹ,</em> and <em>I·a·ou·eʹ.</em> However, there is no reason to be dogmatic. We simply do not know how God’s ancient servants pronounced this name in Hebrew. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001061204/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 13:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001061204/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Exodus 3:15</a>) What we do know is that God used his name repeatedly in communication with his people, that they addressed him by that name, and that they used it freely in speaking with others.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001061204/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Exodus 6:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001061204/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 Kings 8:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001061204/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Psalm 99:9</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Why, then, does this translation use the form “Jehovah”?

He used the form “Iehouah.” Over time, the English language changed, and the spelling of the divine name was modernized. For example, in 1612, Henry Ainsworth used the form “Iehovah” throughout his translation of the book of Psalms. Then, in 1639, when that work was revised and printed with the <span id="page1735" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1735" data-before-text="1735"></span>Pentateuch, the form “Jehovah” was used. In 1901, the translators who produced the <em>American Standard Version</em> of the Bible used the form “Jehovah” where the divine name appeared in the Hebrew text.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Explaining why he used “Jehovah” instead of “Yahweh” in his 1911 work <em>Studies in the Psalms,</em> respected Bible scholar Joseph Bryant Rotherham said that he wanted to employ a “form of the name more familiar (while perfectly acceptable) to the general Bible-reading public.” In 1930 scholar A. F. Kirkpatrick made a similar point regarding the use of the form “Jehovah.” He said: “Modern grammarians argue that it ought to be read <em>Yahveh</em> or <em>Yahaveh;</em> but JEHOVAH seems firmly rooted in the English language, and the really important point is not the exact pronunciation, but the recognition that it is a Proper Name, not merely an appellative title like ‘Lord.’”</p><img src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/nwt/2013/31" data-img-small-src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/nwt/2013/32" alt="The Tetragrammaton" width="300" height="35" class="east_right half" />

Thus, the understanding of the New World Bible Translation Committee is that God’s name means “He Causes to Become.” Scholars hold varying views, so we cannot be dogmatic about this meaning. However, this definition well fits Jehovah’s role as the Creator of all things and the Fulfiller of his purpose. He not only caused the physical universe and intelligent beings to exist, but as events unfold, he continues to cause his will and purpose to be realized.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Therefore, the meaning of the name Jehovah is not limited to the related verb found at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001061204/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Exodus 3:14</a>, which reads: “I Will Become What I Choose to Become” or, “I Will Prove to Be What I Will Prove to Be.” In the strictest sense, those words do not fully define God’s name. Rather, they reveal an aspect of God’s personality, showing that he becomes what is needed in each circumstance to fulfill his purpose. So while the name Jehovah may include this idea, it is not limited to what he himself chooses to become. It also includes what he causes to happen with regard to his creation and the accomplishment of his purpose.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"></p>

However, many feel that it did not appear in the original text of the Christian Greek Scriptures. For this reason, most modern English Bibles do not use the name Jehovah when translating the so-called New Testament. Even when translating quotations from the Hebrew Scriptures in which the Tetragrammaton appears, most translators use “Lord” rather than God’s personal name.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</em> does not follow this common practice. It uses the name Jehovah a total of 237 times in the Christian Greek Scriptures. In deciding to do this, the translators took into consideration two important factors: (1) The Greek manuscripts we possess today are not the originals. Of the thousands of copies in existence today, most were made at least two centuries after the originals were composed. (2) By that time, those copying the manuscripts either replaced the Tetragrammaton with <em>Kyʹri·os,</em> the Greek word for “Lord,” or they copied from manuscripts where this had already been done.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The New World Bible Translation Committee determined that there is compelling evidence that the Tetragrammaton did appear in the original Greek manuscripts. The decision was based on the following evidence:</p><ul><li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="su">  <strong>Copies of the Hebrew Scriptures used in the days of Jesus and his apostles contained the Tetragrammaton throughout the text.</strong> In the past, few people disputed that conclusion. Now that copies of the Hebrew Scriptures dating back to the first century have been discovered near Qumran, the point has been proved beyond any doubt.</p></li><li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">  <strong>In the days of Jesus and his apostles, the Tetragrammaton also appeared in Greek translations of the Hebrew Scriptures.</strong> For centuries, scholars thought that the Tetragrammaton was absent from manuscripts of the Greek Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Scriptures. Then, in the mid-20th century, some very old fragments of the Greek Septuagint <span id="page1737" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1737" data-before-text="1737"></span>version that existed in Jesus’ day were brought to the attention of scholars. Those fragments contain the personal name of God, written in Hebrew characters. So in Jesus’ day, copies of the Scriptures in Greek did contain the divine name. However, by the fourth century C.E., major manuscripts of the Greek <em>Septuagint,</em> such as the Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus, did not contain the divine name in the books from Genesis through Malachi (where it had been in earlier manuscripts). Hence, it is not surprising that in texts preserved from that time period, the divine name is not found in the so-called New Testament, or Greek Scripture portion of the Bible.</p></li><li><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="su">  <strong>The Christian Greek Scriptures themselves report that Jesus often referred to God’s name and made it known to others.</strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001061205/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 17:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001061205/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 11, 12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001061205/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 26</a>) Jesus plainly stated: “I have come in the name of my Father.” He also stressed that his works were done in his “Father’s name.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001061205/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 5:43;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001061205/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 10:25</a>.</p></li><li><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="su">  <strong>Since the Christian Greek Scriptures were an inspired addition to the sacred Hebrew Scriptures, the sudden disappearance of Jehovah’s name from the text would seem inconsistent.</strong> About the middle of the first century C.E., the disciple James said to the elders in Jerusalem: “Symeon has related thoroughly how God for the first time turned his attention to the nations to take out of them a people for his name.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001061205/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 15:14</a>) It would not be logical for James to make such a statement if no one in the first century knew or used God’s name.</p></li><li><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="su">  <strong>The divine name appears in its abbreviated form in the Christian Greek Scriptures.</strong> At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001061205/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 19:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001061205/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 3, 4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001061205/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 6</a>, the divine name is embedded in the word “Hallelujah.” This comes from a Hebrew expression that literally means “Praise Jah.” “Jah” is a contraction of the name Jehovah.

In fact, reference works explain that Jesus’ own name means “Jehovah Is Salvation.”</p></li><li><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="su">  <strong>Early Jewish writings indicate that Jewish Christians used the divine name in their writings.</strong> The Tosefta, a written collection of oral laws that was completed by about 300 C.E., says with <span id="page1738" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1738" data-before-text="1738"></span>regard to Christian writings that were burned on the Sabbath: “The books of the Evangelists and the books of the <em>minim</em> [thought to be Jewish Christians] they do not save from a fire. But they are allowed to burn where they are, they and the references to the Divine Name which are in them.” This same source quotes Rabbi Yosé the Galilean, who lived at the beginning of the second century C.E., as saying that on other days of the week, “one cuts out the references to the Divine Name which are in them [understood to refer to the Christian writings] and stores them away, and the rest burns.”<span id="page1739" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1739" data-before-text="1739"></span></p></li><li><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="su">  <strong>Some Bible scholars acknowledge that it seems likely that the divine name appeared in Hebrew Scripture quotations found in the Christian Greek Scriptures.</strong> Under the heading “Tetragrammaton in the New Testament,” <em>The Anchor Bible Dictionary</em> states: “There is some evidence that the Tetragrammaton, the Divine Name, Yahweh, appeared in some or all of the O[ld] T[estament] quotations in the N[ew] T[estament] when the NT documents were first penned.” Scholar George Howard says: “Since the Tetragram was still written in the copies of the Greek Bible [the <em>Septuagint</em>] which made up the <span id="page1740" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1740" data-before-text="1740"></span>Scriptures of the early church, it is reasonable to believe that the N[ew] T[estament] writers, when quoting from Scripture, preserved the Tetragram within the biblical text.”</p></li><li><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="su">  <strong>Recognized Bible translators have used God’s name in the Christian Greek Scriptures.</strong> Some of these translators did so long before the <em>New World Translation</em> was produced. These translators and their works include: <em>A Literal Translation of the New Testament . . . From the Text of the Vatican Manuscript,</em> by Herman Heinfetter (1863); <em>The Emphatic Diaglott,</em> by Benjamin Wilson (1864); <em>The Epistles of Paul in Modern English,</em> by George Barker Stevens (1898); <em>St. Paul’s Epistle to the Romans,</em> by W. G. Rutherford (1900); <em>The New Testament Letters,</em> by J.W.C. Wand, Bishop of London (1946). In addition, in a Spanish translation in the early 20th century, translator Pablo Besson used “Jehová” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001061205/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 2:15</a> and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001061205/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jude 14</a>, and over 100 times in his translation footnotes, he suggested the divine name as a likely rendering. Long before those translations, Hebrew versions of the Christian Greek Scriptures from the 16th century onward used the Tetragrammaton in many passages. In the German language alone, at least 11 versions <span id="page1741" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1741" data-before-text="1741"></span>use “Jehovah” (or the transliteration of the Hebrew “Yahweh”) in the Christian Greek Scriptures, while four translators add the name in parentheses after “Lord.” More than 70 German translations use the divine name in footnotes or commentaries.</p><img src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/nwt/2013/37" data-img-small-src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/nwt/2013/38" alt="The divine name Jehovah in the Greek Scriptures" width="300" height="140" class="south_center" />

The translators of these editions decided to use the divine name for reasons similar to those stated above. Some of these translations of the Christian Greek Scriptures have appeared recently, such as the Rotuman Bible (1999), which uses “Jihova” 51 times in 48 verses, and the Batak (Toba) version (1989) from Indonesia, which uses “Jahowa” 110 times.</p><img src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/nwt/2013/39" data-img-small-src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/nwt/2013/40" alt="The divine name in the Greek Scriptures of a Hawaiian-language translation" width="300" height="140" class="south_center" />
