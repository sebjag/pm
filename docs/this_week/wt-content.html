<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[39]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> This scenario can help us understand how Jehovah felt when his reputation was tarnished. One of his spirit sons lied about him to the first woman, Eve. She believed the lie. That lie led our first parents to rebel against Jehovah. As a result, sin and death entered the human family.

No. Consider an illustration. A little girl affectionately throws her arms around her father’s neck and says, “You’re the best daddy in the whole world!” The father is pleased, even touched, by her spontaneous act. Why? Should we assume that he is an insecure man who craves, even depends on, praise from his child? No. Rather, we trust that he is a strong father who is delighted to see his daughter showing love and appreciation. He knows that such qualities will contribute to her happiness as she grows up. For similar reasons, Jehovah, the greatest Father, is pleased when we praise him.</p><br/>&nbsp;

But she felt no real connection to her religion or to God. That changed after she began to study with the Witnesses. She started to see God as her Friend. And she was amazed to learn that God’s name has been removed from many Bibles and replaced with mere titles, such as Lord. Learning Jehovah’s name was a turning point in her life. She exclaimed: “My best Friend has a name!” The result? She says: “I have so much peace in my heart now. I feel very honored.” A man named Steve was a musician who came from a conservative Jewish background. He distanced himself from organized religion because he had seen so much hypocrisy. However, during a time of grief, he agreed to sit in on a Bible study conducted by one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. He was deeply touched to learn God’s name. He says: “I had never learned God’s name.” He adds: “For the first time, I understood that God is real! I saw him as a Person. I knew then that I had found a Friend.”</p><br/>&nbsp;
