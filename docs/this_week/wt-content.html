His story has been featured by playwrights, songwriters, and moviemakers. Yet, the account of his life is no mere tale. We can learn much from this man of great faith.

<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"><strong>1-2.</strong><strong> Why should the account of Samson interest us?</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;

You likely think of a man of outstanding strength. That is true. But Samson made a bad decision that led to painful results. Still, Jehovah focused on Samson’s overall record of faithfulness, which He included in the Bible for our benefit.</p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Jehovah used Samson to accomplish amazing things to help His chosen people, Israel. Centuries after Samson’s death, Jehovah inspired the apostle Paul to include Samson’s name in a list of outstanding men of faith. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023560/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Heb. 11:32-34</a>) Samson’s example can encourage us. He relied on Jehovah, even during challenging circumstances. Let us consider how we can draw encouragement as well as learn other practical lessons from his example.</p><br/>&nbsp;

In the past, brothers usually designed and constructed most new Kingdom Halls and other buildings. Eventually, though, the needs of Jehovah’s growing organization called for an adjustment. The <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>responsible brothers sought Jehovah’s direction and tried new methods, such as purchasing facilities and renovating them. “At first, it was not easy for some to embrace this new approach,” says Robert, who in recent years has worked with many of our building projects around the world. He continues: “It was very different from what we had been doing for years. But the brothers were willing to adapt, and it has become evident that Jehovah is blessing these adjustments.” This is just one example of how Jehovah is guiding his people to accomplish his will. From time to time, all of us do well to ask ourselves, ‘Am I looking for Jehovah’s direction and remaining adaptable in my service to him?’</p><br/>&nbsp;

One decision in particular that he made led to tragic consequences. After Samson had served as judge for a while, he “fell in love with a woman in the Valley of Sorek whose name was Delilah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023560/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Judg. 16:4</a>) Previously, Samson had been engaged to a Philistine woman, but that union “was from Jehovah,” who “was looking for an opportunity against the Philistines.” Later, Samson stayed in the house of a prostitute in the Philistine city of Gaza. On that occasion, God empowered Samson to carry away the doors of the city gate, weakening the city.

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> Consider the example of a young brother named Michael. He was busy in theocratic activities, serving as a ministerial servant and a regular pioneer. Sadly, though, he made a mistake, which resulted in the loss of his congregation privileges. “Until this point,” he says, “things were going full steam ahead in my service to Jehovah. Then <span id="page7" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>all of a sudden, it felt as if I had hit a brick wall. I never thought that Jehovah would abandon me, but I did wonder if my relationship with him would ever be the same again or if I would ever be able to serve him in the congregation as fully as I had.”</p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> Commendably, Michael did not give up. He adds: “I focused on repairing my relationship with Jehovah by regularly opening up my heart to him in prayer, studying, and meditating.” In time, Michael regained his good standing in the congregation. He now serves as an elder and a regular pioneer. He notes: “The support and encouragement I received, especially from the elders, helped me to realize that Jehovah still loves me. I can once again serve in the congregation with a clean conscience. This experience has taught me that Jehovah will forgive anyone who is truly repentant.” We can be confident that Jehovah will use us and bless us too even if we have made mistakes, provided that we do all we can to correct our ways and continue to rely on him.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023560/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 86:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023560/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Prov. 28:13</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;
