<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Jesus’ example teaches us that no matter how busy we are, we need to set aside time to pray. Like Jesus, we may need to reserve time for prayer​—getting up early in the morning or staying up a little later in the evening. When we do, we show Jehovah that we appreciate this special gift. A sister named Lynne remembers how moved she was when she first learned about the privilege of prayer. She recalls, “When I learned that I could talk to Jehovah anytime, it helped me to view him as my close Friend and to want to improve my prayers.” No doubt many of us feel the same way.

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> We need Jehovah’s help if we are to overcome the temptation to do what is wrong. Jesus included the following petition in the model prayer: “Do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the wicked one.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023400/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Matt. 6:13</a>) Jehovah wants to come to our aid, but we must ask him for his help. We must also act in harmony with our prayers. We can take practical steps to minimize our exposure to the wrong thinking and ideas popular in Satan’s system. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023400/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ps. 97:10</a>) We can fill our mind with wholesome thoughts by reading and studying the Bible. Attending meetings and taking part in the ministry will also safeguard our thinking. Jehovah, in turn, promises that he will not let us be tempted beyond what we can bear.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023400/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:12, 13</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> Each of us needs to pray more than ever to remain faithful to Jehovah during these difficult last days. Set aside time each day for heartfelt prayer. Jehovah wants us to ‘pour out our hearts before him’ in prayer. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023400/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ps. 62:8</a>) Praise Jehovah and thank him for all that he does. Ask him to help you to be courageous in the ministry. Beg him for help to deal with any problems and to resist any temptation that you may be facing. Do not let anything or anyone stop you from regularly praying to Jehovah. How, though, does Jehovah answer our prayers? We will consider that important question in the next article.</p><br/>&nbsp;
