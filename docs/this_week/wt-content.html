<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> There are several ways in which we benefit when we “become doers of the word.” For one thing, we know that this is a key step in our pleasing Jehovah. Realizing that makes us happy. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024560/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Eccl. 12:13</a>) As we put into practice what we read in God’s inspired Word, we improve our family life and build strong friendships with fellow believers. That has likely proved to be true in your life. Moreover, we avoid many of the problems that come to those who do not follow Jehovah’s ways. Indeed, we agree with King David. After mentioning in song the law, orders, and judgments of Jehovah, he concluded: “In keeping them, there is a large reward.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024560/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 19:7-11</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/> <strong>4.</strong><strong> Why is it a challenge to become doers of God’s Word?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Realistically, it is not always easy for us to become <span id="page3" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="3" data-before-text="3"></span>doers of God’s Word. We must make time in our busy schedules to read and study the Bible in order to understand what Jehovah wants us to do. So let us review some suggestions that can help us to read it regularly. We will also consider what will help us to think about what we read and see ways in which we can apply what we learn in our life.
<br/>

<br/> <strong>5.</strong><strong> What responsibilities take up much of our time?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> Most of Jehovah’s people lead very busy lives. We spend a great amount of time caring for our various Scriptural responsibilities. For instance, most of us work secularly to provide for ourselves and for our families. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024560/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Tim. 5:8</a>) Many Christians look after sick or elderly relatives. And all of us need to care for our own health, which takes time. In addition to these responsibilities, we have assignments in the congregation. A key responsibility is to have a zealous share in the preaching work. With all the obligations that you personally have, how can you find the time to read the Bible regularly, meditate on what you read, and apply what it says?<br/>&nbsp;

<div class="padding"><strong>[1 Tim. 5:8]</strong> <span id="v54-5-8-1" class="v"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/dx/r1/lp-e/1001070158/29863" class="vl vx vp study">8 </a>Certainly if anyone does not provide for those who are his own, and especially for those who are members of his household, he has disowned the faith and is worse than a person without faith.<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070158/102" data-bid="103-1" class="b">+</a></span>

<br/> <strong>6.</strong><strong> How can you make Bible reading a priority? (See also picture.)</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Bible reading is one of “the more important things” for us as Christians, so we need to make it a priority. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024560/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Phil. 1:10</a>) Regarding the happy man, the very first psalm says: “His delight is in the law of Jehovah, and he reads His law in an undertone day and night.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024560/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1, 2</a>) Clearly, that suggests setting time aside for such reading. When is the best time to read the Bible? The answer may be different for each of us. But put simply, it would be a time when you can do so regularly. A brother named Victor says: “I like to do my Bible reading in the morning. Even though I’m not a morning <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>person, there are fewer distractions in the early hours. My mind is clear and I can focus better.” Might this be true in your case? Ask yourself, ‘When is the best time for <strong><em>me</em></strong> to read the Bible?’<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> The reality is, though, that we may consistently read a lot of material without really absorbing it. Have you ever read something and shortly afterward could recall little of what you read? We all have had that happen. Sadly, this can be the situation with our Bible reading. Perhaps we set a goal to read a certain number of chapters of the Bible each day. That is commendable. We <strong><em>should</em></strong> set goals and strive to stick to them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024560/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Cor. 9:26</a>) However, reading the Bible is a start​—a good start, but only a start. More is needed if we are to benefit fully from reading God’s Word.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Think of this comparison: Water, often in the form of rain, is essential to life. But if too much rain falls within a short amount of time, the ground may become oversaturated. When that happens, more rain will not be beneficial. The soil needs time to absorb the rain that has fallen and make it available to the vegetation. Likewise, we should avoid reading the Bible in a hurried manner, that is, so quickly that we fail to absorb and remember and use what we read.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024560/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jas. 1:24</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/> <strong>9.</strong><strong> What should we do if we have developed the habit of speed-reading the Bible?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Have you found that on occasion you are merely speed-reading the Bible? What should you do? Slow down. Make the effort to think about what you are reading or have just read. This does not have to be daunting. If the encouragement to meditate seems that way to you, perhaps you could view meditating as simply thinking about what you <span id="page5" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>have read. You may decide to lengthen your study period to include time for such thinking, or meditation. On the other hand, you may choose to read fewer verses and use the remaining time to think over what you have read. “I keep my Bible reading short, maybe one chapter,” says Victor, quoted earlier. “Because I read early in the morning, I’m able to keep reflecting throughout the day on what I read.” Whatever method you use, it is vital to read at a pace that will allow you to get the most out of what you read.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024560/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 119:97</a>; see the box “<a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2024560#h=67-73:0">Questions to Consider</a>.”

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Regardless of when you do your Bible reading and how much time you spend doing it, be sure to look for ways to apply what you read. As you go over a portion of God’s Word, ask yourself, ‘How can I apply this information <strong><em>now or in the near future?’</em></strong> To illustrate, let’s say that your Bible reading included <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024560/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b"><strong>1 Thessalonians 5:17, 18</strong></a><strong>. (<span style="background-color:#b7ff95">Read</span> .)</strong> After reading those two verses, you could stop and think of how often and how deeply you pray. Also, you could reflect on things for which you are grateful. Maybe you determine that you will thank Jehovah for three specific things. With even a few minutes of such focused attention, you will to some extent become a hearer and a doer of God’s Word. Think of how you would benefit by repeating this process each day with other portions of the Bible that you read! Yes, you will grow as a doer of God’s Word. What, though, if it seems that there are so many things you need to work on?

Your Bible reading the next day includes a warning against becoming a friend of the world.

<br/><strong>Picture caption:</strong> Instead of trying to work on everything you read in the Bible all at once, why not set modest goals? Perhaps focus on one or two points (See paragraphs 13-14)
<br/>&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;
<br/><strong>14.</strong><strong> Which goals can you start with?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> You may decide to start with a goal that is easier for you to reach. Or you might choose to work on an area that you feel needs the most improvement. <span id="page7" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>Once you have identified your goal, do research in our publications, perhaps using the <em>Watch Tower Publications Index</em> or the <em>Research Guide for Jehovah’s Witnesses.</em> Pray about your goal, asking Jehovah for “both the desire and the power to act.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024560/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Phil. 2:13</a>) Then put into practice what you have learned. Having made progress on your first goal, you will likely feel more motivated to work on another one.
