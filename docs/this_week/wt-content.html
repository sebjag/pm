For one thing, it made him honest and trustworthy; hence, the king put him in charge of the royal household. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023443/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Nehemiah 7:2</a>.) Obadiah’s godly fear also gave him extraordinary courage​—a quality that he surely needed. He lived during the reign of wicked King Ahab, who “was worse in the eyes of Jehovah than all those [kings] who were prior to him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023443/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Ki. 16:30</a>) Also, Ahab’s Baal-worshipping wife, Jezebel, hated Jehovah so much that she tried to wipe out true worship in the northern kingdom. She even killed many of God’s prophets. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023443/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Ki. 18:4</a>) Without doubt, Obadiah worshipped Jehovah during a difficult time.</p><br/>&nbsp;
