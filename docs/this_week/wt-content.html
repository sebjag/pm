<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[56]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> For untold ages, Jehovah and his beloved Son forged a close bond of deep love and affection. Their relationship is the oldest in the universe. Jehovah clearly expressed his love for Jesus, as we read at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024246/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matthew 17:5</a>. Jehovah could have simply said, ‘This is the one whom I have approved.’ However, he wanted us to know how much he loves Jesus, so he called him “my Son, the beloved.” Jehovah was proud of who Jesus was and of what he was about to do. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024246/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Eph. 1:7</a>) And Jesus had no doubts about his Father’s feelings for him. Jehovah’s love was so real to Jesus that he could feel it deep inside.

I constantly thank Jehovah for giving me a big loving family.”</p><br/>&nbsp;

However, Jehovah’s love made him feel safe and protected. David could feel that Jehovah was with him in every situation, and that reassured him. Thus, he could sing: “[Jehovah] rescued me from all my fears.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024246/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ps. 34:4</a>) David’s fears were real, but Jehovah’s love was stronger than his fears.</p><br/>&nbsp;

A pioneer named Susi describes how she and her husband felt when their son took his own life: “Sudden tragedy is traumatic and can leave one feeling vulnerable and helpless. But Jehovah’s tender affection has made us feel safe and protected.” Rachel, mentioned earlier, recalls: “One night when my heart ached terribly and I was very worried and scared, I groaned out loud to Jehovah. Right then I felt that he soothed my heart and calmed me down, as a mother does for her baby, and I fell asleep. I will never forget that moment.” An elder named Tasos spent four years in prison for refusing to join the army. How did he experience Jehovah’s love and care? He says: “Jehovah took care of all my needs and more. This strengthened my confidence that I can fully trust in him. Also, through his spirit, Jehovah gave me joy despite being in a depressing environment. This assured me that the closer I work with him, the more I will benefit from his goodness. So I began serving him as a regular pioneer while in prison.”</p><br/>&nbsp;
