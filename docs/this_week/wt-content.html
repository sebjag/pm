<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> If we were to fear humans more than we fear God, we could be led away from the truth. Consider the example of the 12 chieftains who spied out the land that Jehovah had promised to give to the Israelites. For ten of the spies, their fear of the Canaanites was stronger than their love for Jehovah. They told their fellow Israelites: “We are not able to go up against the people, because they are stronger than we are.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024481/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Num. 13:27-31</a>) From a human standpoint, the Canaanites were stronger than the Israelites​—that part was true. But to say that the Israelites <span id="page10" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>would not be able to conquer their enemies left Jehovah out of the picture. Those ten spies should have focused on what Jehovah wanted the Israelites to do. They should also have meditated on what he had done for them in the recent past. Then they would have realized that the strength of the Canaanites was nothing in comparison to Jehovah’s almighty power. Unlike those faithless spies, Joshua and Caleb wanted to have Jehovah’s approval. They told the people: “If Jehovah is pleased with us, he will certainly bring us into this land and give it to us.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024481/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Num. 14:6-9</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

Jehovah will help us put his thoughts, which he provides through his Word and his organization, ahead of our own. In your Bible reading, look for points about how Jehovah loves humility and hates pride, arrogance, and haughtiness. And take extra care to remain humble if you receive a privilege of service that gives you a measure of prominence.

<br/><strong>11.</strong><strong> What happened to those in ancient Israel who challenged God’s choice of Moses as the one taking the lead? (See also picture.)</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> At one point in the Israelites’ journey to the Promised Land, prominent men challenged Moses and the role that Jehovah had assigned him. They said: “The whole assembly [not just Moses] is holy, all of them, and Jehovah is in their midst.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024481/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Num. 16:1-3</a>) Although it was true that in God’s eyes “the whole assembly” was holy, Jehovah had chosen Moses to take the lead among His people.

They did not focus on what Jehovah wanted; they focused on what they wanted​—more power and recognition. God struck down the leaders of the rebellion as well as thousands more who sympathized with them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024481/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Num. 16:30-35,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024481/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 41,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024481/23/2" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> 49</a>) Today we can be sure that Jehovah disapproves of those who disrespect his organizational arrangements.<br/>&nbsp;

Without taking the time to check the facts, some Christians in Thessalonica believed the rumor and were even spreading it. They would not have been fooled had they remembered the things Paul had taught them when he was still with them.
