<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>2.</strong><strong> Why may we find it challenging to examine Jehovah’s creation?</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> We too can learn more about our God when we examine his creative works. However, we may not always find it easy to do so. If we live in a city, we may see little evidence of nature in our daily lives. Even if we do live close to nature, we may feel that we have little time to study it. So let us discuss why it is worthwhile to take the time and make the effort to observe creation. We will consider how Jehovah and Jesus used creation to teach and what we can do to learn further lessons from nature.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>3.</strong><strong> What shows that Jehovah wanted Adam to enjoy creation?</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> Jehovah wanted the first human to enjoy His creation. When God made Adam, He gave him an unspoiled <span id="page16" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>paradise to explore and assigned him to cultivate and expand that paradise. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023324/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 2:8, 9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023324/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 15</a>) Imagine Adam’s excitement as he watched seeds germinate and flowers blossom. What a privilege Adam had to care for the garden of Eden! Jehovah also invited Adam to name the different animals. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023324/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 2:19, 20</a>) Jehovah could have chosen each name himself; instead, he delegated the task to Adam. No doubt before deciding what to call them, Adam studied the animals carefully, observing their specific traits and behaviors. Adam must have enjoyed this experience. It surely gave him an opportunity to increase his appreciation for his Father’s wisdom, artistry, and creativity.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> One reason why we should examine creation is that Jehovah wants us to do so. “Lift up your eyes to heaven and see,” he invites us.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> The Bible reveals another important reason why we should examine creation.

Do they not reveal God’s wisdom? And think about the variety of foods we can enjoy. That is clear proof of his love for mankind. When we perceive Jehovah’s personality from the things he made, we come to know him better and we are moved to draw closer to him. Now let us look at some ways in which Jehovah has used creation to teach humans important lessons.</p><br/>&nbsp;

Both of these are essential for the preservation of life. Jehovah could have withheld these from undeserving humans. Instead, he lovingly provides the sun and the rain for all. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023324/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 5:43-45</a>) Jesus used this lesson to teach his disciples that Jehovah wants us to show love toward everyone. Whenever we enjoy a stunning sunset or see a refreshing rain shower, we can reflect on Jehovah’s impartial love. His example can move us to show similar love by preaching to all.</p><br/>&nbsp;
