<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[39]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>TRAGIC events can change our life overnight. For example, a faithful brother named Luis<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2024245/0">a</a> was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. The doctor told him that he had only a few months to live. Monika and her husband were busy in spiritual activities. Then one day, Monika learned that her husband, an elder, had been living a double life for years. Olivia, a single sister, was forced to evacuate her home because a devastating hurricane was approaching. When she returned, she found that the storm had destroyed her house. In one brief moment, the lives of these individuals changed drastically. Can you relate to what they experienced? Have you faced an event that suddenly turned your world upside down?</p><br/>&nbsp;

We may also have to endure opposition or persecution from those who hate God’s people. Though Jehovah does not shield us from such hardships, he does promise to help us. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024245/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 41:10</a>) With his assistance, we can maintain our joy, make good decisions, and stay loyal to him even through the most difficult situations. In this article, we will examine four ways that Jehovah helps us during dark times in our life. We will also consider what we need to do to benefit from the help that he provides.</p><br/>&nbsp;

Why? Our heart may be in extreme pain. Our mind may feel weighed down by anxiety. We could feel as if we were wandering through a fog, uncertain which direction to take. Note how the two sisters mentioned earlier felt during their trials. Olivia says: “After the hurricane demolished my home, I felt lost and completely overwhelmed.” Monika says regarding her husband’s betrayal: “I felt more than disappointed. I felt a pain that truly crushed me from within. I didn’t know how to function normally anymore. What seemed unbelievable had happened to me.” How does Jehovah promise to help us when we feel overwhelmed?</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[45]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> The same passage states that the peace of God “will guard,” or protect, “your hearts and your mental powers.” The original word for “guard” was a military expression and was used to refer to soldiers who guarded a city and kept it safe from attack. The inhabitants of a guarded city slept in peace, knowing that troops were posted at the gates. Similarly, when the peace of God guards our hearts and minds, we feel calm, knowing that we are safe. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024245/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 4:8</a>) As in the case of Hannah, even if our situation does not change immediately, we can still feel a measure of peace.

He said: “In a moment like this, it is extremely difficult to make decisions about health care and other matters. But prayer has been indispensable in bringing us peace during this process.” Luis and his wife said that they prayed intensely and repeatedly, asking Jehovah to give them peace of mind, a calm heart, and the wisdom to make good decisions.

We could feel as if we were being tossed from one strong emotion to the next. Ana, mentioned earlier, stated that she went through a wide range of emotions after Luis’ death. She said: “When feelings of emptiness set in, I would start feeling sorry for myself. I would also get angry that he was gone.” Furthermore, Ana felt lonely and was frustrated at having to make decisions on matters that Luis had cared for so well.

To counteract this movement, many ships have stabilizers that extend from each side of the ship under the water. These stabilizers can significantly reduce the rocking of the ship, making the situation safer and more bearable for passengers.

When we face frightening trials, we may need our heavenly Father to hold us figuratively until the intense feelings pass. How can we receive such comfort from Jehovah?</p><br/>&nbsp;
