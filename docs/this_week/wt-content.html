How the theme of the Bible is developed from Genesis to Revelation2. A clearer understanding of the meaning of Jehovah’s name3. How the covenants outlined in the Scriptures relate to God’s purpose4. The significance of the sacrifices that were required in the Mosaic Law5. The encouragement we get from the restoration prophecies of Isaiah6. How Jehovah uses his holy spirit to accomplish his will7. The similarities between the prophecies in the book of Daniel and the prophecies in the book of Revelation</aside>PONDER GOD’S PURPOSE 6. (a) What is the difference between a plan and a purpose? (b) Why can it be said that Jehovah’s purpose for man and the earth is “eternal”? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023605/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ephesians 3:11</a>)6 Consider for example what the Bible says about God’s purpose. There is a distinct difference between a plan and a purpose. A plan is like a specific and fixed route that can lead you to your chosen destination. However, the plan can fail when a roadblock appears along the route. A purpose focuses on the destination itself. We know exactly where we want to complete our journey, but the route is not set. It can be adjusted as needed. Thankfully, Jehovah has progressively revealed his “eternal purpose” in the Bible. (See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/2023605/1/0">study note on Ephesians 3:11</a>.) One way or another, he always succeeds because he “has made everything work for his purpose.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023605/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Prov. 16:4</a>) And the results of what Jehovah does will endure forever. What is Jehovah’s purpose, and what adjustments has he made in order to accomplish it? 7. After the first humans rebelled, how did Jehovah adjust the way he would achieve his purpose? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023605/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Matthew 25:34</a>)7 God told the first humans what his purpose was for them. They were to “be fruitful and become many, fill the earth and subdue it, and have in subjection . . . every living creature” on earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023605/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gen. 1:28</a>) When Adam and Eve rebelled, causing sin to enter the human family, Jehovah’s purpose was not thwarted. He adjusted the way it would be achieved. Immediately, he determined to set up a Kingdom in heaven that would accomplish his original purpose for mankind and the earth. (Read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023605/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 25:34</a>.) At his due time, Jehovah lovingly sent his firstborn Son to the earth to teach people about the Kingdom and to give his life to ransom us from sin and death. Then Jesus was resurrected back to heaven to rule as King of God’s Kingdom. But there is more to ponder about God’s purpose.Imagine the time when all intelligent creatures in heaven and on earth will be united in their loyalty to Jehovah! (See paragraph 8) 8. (a) What is the theme of the Bible? (b) As explained at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023605/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Ephesians 1:8-11</a>, what is Jehovah’s ultimate purpose? (See cover picture.)8 The main theme of the Bible is that Jehovah’s name will be vindicated as he fulfills his purpose for the earth by means of his Kingdom under Christ. Jehovah’s purpose cannot be changed. He has guaranteed that he will carry it out with success. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023605/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isa. 46:10, 11</a>, ftns.; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023605/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Heb. 6:17, 18</a>) In time, the earth will be transformed into a paradise where perfect, righteous descendants of Adam and Eve will “enjoy life forever.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023605/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 22:26</a>) More than that, Jehovah has an even broader purpose in mind. His ultimate purpose is to unite all his intelligent creatures in heaven and on earth. Then all those living will loyally submit to him as their Sovereign. (Read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023605/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ephesians 1:8-11</a>.) Are you not amazed at the beautiful way that Jehovah accomplishes his purpose?CONTEMPLATE YOUR FUTURE 9. By reading the Bible, how far into the future can we see?9 Consider the prophecy that Jehovah stated in the garden of Eden, as recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023605/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a>.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2023605/1">b</a> It pointed to events that would fulfill his purpose but would not occur until thousands of years later. These events included producing Abraham’s offspring, the lineage that would lead to the birth of the Christ. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023605/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Gen. 22:15-18</a>) Then, in 33 C.E., Jesus was struck in the heel, as foretold. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023605/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 3:13-15</a>) The final event of that prophecy, the crushing of Satan’s head, is still over 1,000 years away.

But we will still feel that there are countless wonderful things to be learned. . . . Eternal life will be unimaginably rich and varied​—and drawing closer to Jehovah will always be the most rewarding part of it.” Meanwhile, as we continue studying God’s Word, what else can we explore?GAZE HIGH INTO THE HEAVENS12. How can we gaze high into the heavens? Give an example.12 God’s Word gives us a glimpse of Jehovah’s presence “in the heights above.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023605/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Isa. 33:5</a>) The Bible reveals amazing things about Jehovah and the heavenly part of his organization.

Commenting on this scripture in his book Studies in the Psalms, Bible translator Joseph Rotherham said that a person should “take so much pleasure in divine guidance that he will look out for it, learn it, linger over it.” He added that a Bible reader could “count every day lost in which he does not gain clearer insight into its wisdom.” You can find delight in studying the Bible by taking in all that you can of its rich details and seeing how it all connects together. What a joy it is to explore every dimension of God’s Word!16. What will we discuss in the next article?16 The beautiful truths that Jehovah teaches us in his Word are not beyond our grasp. In the next article, we will consider one of the deeper truths​—Jehovah’s great spiritual temple, which Paul described in his letter to the Hebrew Christians.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Consider for example what the Bible says about God’s purpose. There is a distinct difference between a plan and a purpose. A <strong><em>plan</em></strong> is like a specific and fixed route that can lead you to your chosen destination. However, the plan can fail when a roadblock appears along the route. A <strong><em>purpose</em></strong> focuses on the destination itself. We know exactly where we want to complete our journey, but the route is not set. It can be adjusted as needed. Thankfully, Jehovah has progressively revealed his “eternal purpose” in the Bible. (See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/2023605/1/0">study note on Ephesians 3:11</a>.)

<div class="padding"><strong>[study note on Ephesians 3:11]</strong> <br/><strong>the eternal purpose:</strong> In this context, the term “purpose” refers to a specific goal, or aim, that can be achieved in more than one way. It relates to Jehovah’s determination to accomplish what he originally intended for mankind and the earth, despite the rebellion in Eden. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070771/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ge 1:28</a>) Immediately after that rebellion, Jehovah formed this purpose <strong>in connection with the Christ, Jesus our Lord.</strong> He foretold the appearance of an “offspring” who would undo the damage done by the rebels.
