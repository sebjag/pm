<div class="padding"><strong>[a]</strong> Footnote: 	<a href="#footnotesource1" class="fn-symbol">a</a> We are regularly encouraged to set spiritual goals. But what if we have already set a worthy goal that we are struggling to reach? This article will provide various suggestions on how we can reach our goals.

For example, Philip wanted to improve the quality and frequency of his prayers, but he struggled to find time to pray. Erika’s goal was to be punctual for meetings for field service; yet, she still arrived late for nearly every meeting. Tomáš tried several times to read the entire Bible. He says: “I simply didn’t enjoy reading the Bible. I made three attempts, but each time I only made it to Leviticus before stopping.”</p><br/>&nbsp;

<div class="padding"><strong>[b]</strong> Footnote: 	<a href="#footnotesource2" class="fn-symbol">b</a> EXPRESSION EXPLAINED: A spiritual goal can include anything you work hard to improve or to achieve so that you can serve Jehovah more fully and make him happy. For example, you may set the goal of cultivating a Christian quality or of improving in a facet of your worship, such as Bible reading, personal study, or the field ministry.

Even reaching a simple goal often requires time and hard work. The fact that you still want to reach your goal shows that you treasure your relationship with Jehovah and want to give him your best. Jehovah values your efforts. Of course, he does not expect more from you than what you can give.

<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> Pray for more motivation (See paragraphs 3-4)</p></figcaption><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>3.</strong><strong> Why is motivation important?</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> Motivation plays a key role in reaching spiritual goals. A motivated person has a strong incentive or desire to work toward his goal. We could liken motivation to the wind that pushes a sailboat toward its destination. If the wind continues blowing, the sailor will likely reach his destination. And with a strong wind, he may even arrive sooner. Likewise, the more motivated we are, the more likely we are to reach our goals. “When you feel motivated, you try harder,” says David, a brother in El Salvador. “You try not to let anything prevent you from reaching your goal.” So, what can you do to feel more motivated?</p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>4.</strong><strong> What can we pray for? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023406/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Philippians 2:13</a>) (See also picture.)</strong></p><br/>&nbsp;
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>Pray for more motivation.</em></strong> By means of his spirit, Jehovah can motivate you to reach your goal. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023406/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Philippians 2:13</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Sometimes we set a goal because we know we should, and that is a good thing. But we may not really have the desire to reach it. This was the case with a sister in Uganda named Norina. She had set the goal of conducting a Bible study, although she lacked motivation because she felt inadequate as a teacher. What helped her? She relates: “I began to ask Jehovah daily to help me increase my desire to conduct a Bible study. In harmony with my prayers, I worked on my teaching skills. After a few months, I noticed that my desire had grown. That same year, I started two Bible studies.”</p><br/>&nbsp;

<div class="padding"><strong>[<strong>Philippians 2:13</strong>]</strong> <span id="v50-2-13-1" class="v"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/dx/r1/lp-e/1001070154/29496" class="vl vx vp study">13 </a>For God is the one who for the sake of his good pleasure energizes you, giving you both the desire and the power to act.<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1001070154/49" data-bid="50-1" class="b">+</a> </span>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023406/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 116:12</a>) Consider what helped a sister in Honduras to reach her goal of becoming a regular pioneer. She says: “I reflected on how much Jehovah loves me. He brought me to his people. He cares for me and protects me. Such meditation strengthened my love for him and increased my motivation.”</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> Realistically, though, we all have days when we do not feel motivated. Does this mean that we cannot work on our goal? No. To illustrate: The wind can be a strong force that pushes a sailboat toward its destination. Yet, the wind varies in strength, and on some days, there may be no wind at all. Does this mean that the sailor cannot keep moving? Not necessarily. For example, some sailboats have a motor; others have oars. The sailor can use these means to keep moving toward his destination. Our motivation can be likened to the wind; how motivated we feel may vary. And on some days, we may feel no motivation to work on our goal. So if we were to work on our goal only when we felt motivated, we might never reach it. But just as the sailor finds other ways to reach his destination, we can still work toward our goal even when we are not motivated. Though this will require self-discipline, <span id="page29" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>the results are worthwhile. Before discussing what we can do, let us address a question that may arise.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><strong><sup>10</sup></strong></span> Similarly, Jehovah is pleased to see us working toward our goal even when we do not feel motivated to do so. He is pleased because although we may not always be doing it out of love for <strong><em>that activity,</em></strong> he knows that we are doing it out of love <strong><em>for him.</em></strong> Just as Jehovah blessed Paul, He will bless us for our efforts. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023406/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 126:5</a>) And as we experience Jehovah’s blessing, we may even start to feel motivated.

However, self-control is also required in order to move us to do good, especially if a task is difficult or if we do not feel motivated. Remember, self-control is part of the fruitage of the spirit, so ask Jehovah for holy spirit to help you cultivate that important quality.

However, it also makes clear that we can get up again, especially with Jehovah’s help. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2023406/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 145:14</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> The brother named Philip, mentioned earlier, measures success this way: “My success is not based on how many times I fall. Rather, it is based <span id="page31" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="31" data-before-text="31"></span>on how many times I get myself back on track.” David, quoted earlier, says: “I try to view setbacks and bad days, not as obstacles, but as opportunities to show Jehovah how much I love him.” Yes, by moving forward despite a setback, you prove to Jehovah that you want to please him. How happy Jehovah must be when he sees you continuing to strive for your goal!</p><br/>&nbsp;
