Of course, our study of the Bible has freed us from fear of the dead, fear of the supernatural, and fear of the future. But we still live in a time that is marked by “fearful sights,” such as war, crime, and disease. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024240/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 21:11</a>) We may also fear men, including governments that oppress us or even family members who oppose true worship. Some worry that they will not be able to endure either a current trial or one that they may face in the future.</p><br/>&nbsp;

For instance, when King Saul was trying to hunt him down, David decided to flee to the Philistine city of Gath.

But <strong><em>how</em></strong> do we strengthen our trust in Jehovah, especially when we are afraid? Consider an illustration. If you learn that you have an illness, you may at first feel afraid. However, you can ease your fears if you trust your doctor. He may have an outstanding record of treating patients with that illness. He may listen attentively, convincing you that he really understands your feelings. And he may propose a treatment that has worked well for others. Similarly, we strengthen our trust in Jehovah by considering what he has already done, what he is doing now, and what he will yet do for us. That is what David did. As we consider some of his inspired words found in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024240/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 56</a>, think about how you too can strengthen your trust in Jehovah and conquer your fears.</p><br/>&nbsp;

A man in her community called her and sent her messages every day, pressuring her to have a relationship with him. Vanessa flatly refused. But the man became more aggressive and even threatened her. “I was scared,” she says. How did Vanessa conquer her fear? She took practical steps to protect herself. An elder helped her to contact the authorities. But she also focused on how Jehovah had protected his servants in the past. “The first person I thought of was the prophet Daniel,” Vanessa relates. “He was thrown into a den with hungry lions even though he was innocent. Yet, Jehovah cared for him. I asked Jehovah to take charge of the whole situation. After that, I wasn’t afraid anymore.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024240/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Dan. 6:12-22</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

Since she is the eldest child, her parents expected her to make enough money to care for both herself and them. But after she simplified her life in order to pioneer, Aida struggled financially. Her family now resented her and criticized her. “I was afraid that I would not be able to help my parents and that everyone would reject me,” she says. “I even blamed Jehovah for letting things get so bad.” Then she heard a talk at a meeting. “The speaker reminded us that whatever the wounds of our heart, Jehovah knows them. Little by little, through advice from the elders and others, I was reassured of Jehovah’s love. I began to pray to Jehovah with renewed confidence, and I felt a profound <span id="page6" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>peace as I saw my prayers answered.” In time, Aida found employment that helped her not only to support herself as a pioneer but also to give financial aid to her parents and others. “I have learned to trust in Jehovah completely,” she says. “Now, after I pray, my fears often vanish.”</p><br/>&nbsp;

She says: “I focused on how happy I would be for all eternity for choosing to keep my integrity. I also thought about how Jehovah <span id="page7" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>would reward me in the new world for anything I might lose in this system and how all bad things would be forgotten.” Tanja did keep her integrity. And with Jehovah’s help, she found a place to live. Today, Tanja is married to a faithful brother and they serve happily together in the full-time ministry.</p><br/>&nbsp;

Because we will have already learned to trust in Jehovah. Tanja, quoted earlier, says that her past experiences are helping her to face other unsettling situations. “I have learned that there is no situation that Jehovah cannot work out for our good,” she observes. “Sometimes it may seem that others are controlling things, but the reality is that they have only as much control as Jehovah allows. And though a trial may be hard, it will end.”</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[73]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> Fear is normal today. But like David, we can refuse to be trapped by fear. Our 2024 yeartext is David’s prayer to Jehovah: “When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024240/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ps. 56:3</a>) As one Bible reference work stated about this verse, David “neither feeds his fear nor stares at his problems but looks to his Redeemer who will deliver him.” Think about our yeartext in the coming months, especially when you are facing frightening situations. Take time to reflect on Jehovah’s actions in the past, present, and future. Then, like David, you can declare: “In God I put my trust; I am not afraid.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024240/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ps. 56:4</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;
