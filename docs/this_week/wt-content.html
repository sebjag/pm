<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[49]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> A mature Christian is someone who lives by all of God’s requirements, not picking and choosing the ones he wants to follow. Of course, being imperfect, he will make mistakes. Still, he shows by his daily life that he thinks and acts in harmony with God’s will. He has put on the new personality and constantly strives to bring his thinking closer to God’s thinking.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[53]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> As mentioned earlier, the Scriptures compare the process of growing to spiritual maturity to the process of growing to adulthood. A child lacks insight, so he needs the protection and supervision of an adult. To illustrate, a mother might ask her young daughter to hold her hand while crossing the street. As the girl grows older, the mother might allow her to cross the street on her own but will still remind her to look both ways for traffic. When the child becomes an adult, she avoids such hazards on her own. Just as young children need help from adults to avoid danger, immature Christians often need help from mature Christians to avoid spiritual dangers and <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>to make wise decisions. By contrast, when mature Christians have to make a decision, they reason on Bible principles to get Jehovah’s thinking on the matter and then follow through accordingly.</p><br/>&nbsp;

No. Mature ones also need to ask for help at times. But someone who is immature may expect others to tell him what to do or to make a decision that he himself should make. A mature Christian, on the other hand, will draw on the wisdom and the experience of others while recognizing that Jehovah expects him to “carry his own load.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024365/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Gal. 6:5</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;

Further, when two mature Christians face a similar situation, they might come to different conclusions that are both Scripturally acceptable. That is especially true in matters of conscience. Recognizing this, they avoid judging each other over such differences.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[69]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> Immature Christians often struggle when faced with situations that call for reasoning on Bible principles and applying them. If no Bible law exists, some might feel that they can do whatever they want. Others might ask for a rule when no rule is required. For instance, Christians in Corinth apparently asked Paul for a rule about whether they could eat food that had been offered to an <span id="page6" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>idol. Rather than tell them what to do, Paul acknowledged the role of the conscience and the fact that each person has a “right to choose.” He reasoned on principles that would allow each individual to be at peace with his conscience while not stumbling others. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024365/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Cor. 8:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024365/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 7-9</a>) Paul was thus helping the Corinthians to grow up spiritually so that they could use their own powers of discernment instead of depending on someone else or simply looking for rules.</p><br/>&nbsp;

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[71]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> We learn a valuable lesson from what Paul wrote to the Hebrew Christians. Some had not continued to grow spiritually; they had actually <strong><em>“gone back</em></strong> to needing milk, not solid [spiritual] food.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024365/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Heb. 5:12</a>) They had failed to keep up with the truth, which was being progressively revealed through the congregation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024365/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Prov. 4:18</a>) For example, many Jewish believers were still promoting the Mosaic Law even though some 30 years earlier the Law had been done away with on the basis of Christ’s sacrifice.

It was just what those Christians needed to strengthen their faith in the superiority of the Christian arrangement for worship and to give them the courage to keep preaching in spite of opposition from the Jews.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024365/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Heb. 10:19-23</a>.</p><br/>&nbsp;
