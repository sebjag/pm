<br/>We benefit greatly by remembering that the God whom we worship is “the living God.”<br/>&nbsp;
<br/> <strong>1.</strong><strong> What helps Jehovah’s people to keep worshipping him despite the problems they face?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>“CRITICAL times hard to deal with”​—that is how the Bible describes the days we live in. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024441/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1</a>) In addition to the challenges that everyone faces in this system of things, Jehovah’s people have to deal with opposition and persecution. What helps us to keep worshipping Jehovah despite these problems? One main thing is that we have come to know Jehovah as “the living God.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024441/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jer. 10:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024441/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 2 Tim. 1:12</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Jehovah is a real Person who sustains us during our trials and looks for opportunities to support us.

<br/> <strong>3.</strong><strong> What did David mean when he said that “Jehovah is alive”?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></span> David knew Jehovah and relied on Him. When pursued by his enemies, including King Saul, David prayed to Jehovah for help. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024441/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 18:6</a>) After God answered his prayer and rescued him, David declared: “Jehovah is alive!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024441/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 18:46</a>) With these words, David was not merely acknowledging that God exists. One reference work notes that David was expressing confidence in Jehovah “as a living god who constantly acts on behalf of his people.” Yes, David knew from personal experience that his God was alive, and that conviction renewed his <span id="page21" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>determination to serve and praise Jehovah.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024441/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 18:28, 29,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024441/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 49</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/> <strong>6.</strong><strong> What experiences during David’s youth increased his confidence in Jehovah?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Consider two personal experiences that increased David’s confidence in Jehovah. When David was a young shepherd, a bear and a lion each carried off one of his father’s sheep. On both occasions, David courageously chased after the animals and saved the sheep. Yet, he did not claim the victory for himself. He knew that Jehovah was behind it. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024441/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Sam. 17:34-37</a>) David never forgot those experiences. By meditating on them, he gained confidence that the living God would strengthen him in the future.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/> <strong>7.</strong><strong> How did having the right perspective help David to face Goliath?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> Later, likely while he was still a teenager, David visited the army camp of the Israelites. He found that the soldiers were terrified because a giant Philistine named Goliath had come out to “taunt the battle line of Israel.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024441/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Sam. 17:10, 11</a>) The soldiers’ fear was a result of their focusing on the giant and the taunts they heard on the battlefield.

He viewed what was happening as a challenge, not merely against the battle line of Israel but against “the battle line of the living God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024441/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Sam. 17:26</a>) David had Jehovah foremost in mind.

<br/> <strong>8.</strong><strong> How can we keep Jehovah in mind when facing trials? (See also picture.)</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> We too can face trials successfully if we remember that the living God is ready to assist us. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024441/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 118:6</a>) We can build our confidence in that fact by considering what he has done in the past. Read Bible accounts that remind you of how Jehovah saved his worshippers. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024441/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Isa. 37:17,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024441/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 33-37</a>) Also, consider reports on our jw.org website that illustrate how Jehovah has supported our brothers and sisters in modern <span id="page22" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>times. Furthermore, recall times when Jehovah has acted in your behalf. Do not worry if you cannot point to some spectacular experience, such as fighting off a bear or a lion. Why not? The fact is, Jehovah has been involved in your life! He has drawn you into a relationship with him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024441/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">John 6:44</a>) Even now, it is only thanks to his help that you are still in the truth. Why not ask him to help you to remember moments when he answered your prayers, gave you support at just the right time, or sustained you through a difficult situation? Reflecting on such experiences will strengthen your conviction that Jehovah will continue to act in your behalf.<br/>&nbsp;

Consider what happened to the Israelites when they were in the wilderness. They were aware that Jehovah existed, but they began to doubt that he would provide for them. They even asked: “Is Jehovah in our midst or not?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024441/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ex. 17:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024441/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 7</a>) Thereafter, they rebelled against God.

<br/><span id="page25" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> The world makes it challenging for us to remain close to Jehovah. Many reject the idea that God exists. Often, those who ignore what God requires seem to prosper. When we see that happen, our faith can be tested. While we would not deny that God exists, we could begin to wonder whether he will act in our behalf. The writer of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024441/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalm 73</a> found himself wondering about this. He saw those around him ignoring God’s laws and still enjoying life. As a result, he began to question whether it was worth serving God.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024441/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ps. 73:11-13</a>.<br/>&nbsp;

<br/><strong>17.</strong><strong> What will help us to remain close to Jehovah?</strong><br/>&nbsp;
<br/><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> What eventually helped the psalmist to correct his view? He meditated on what would happen to those who forget Jehovah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024441/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Ps. 73:18, 19,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024441/32/1" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> 27</a>) He also considered the benefits that come from serving God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024441/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ps. 73:24</a>) We too can reflect on the blessings that Jehovah has given us. Contrast that with how our life would be if we were not serving Jehovah. Doing so can help us to stick to a faithful course and conclude as did the psalmist: “As for me, drawing near to God is good for me.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024441/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ps. 73:28</a>.<br/>&nbsp;
