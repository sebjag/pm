If not, you are in good company! Throughout the ages, all who have truly loved Jehovah have felt like strangers, or aliens, in this system of things. For example, while moving from encampment to encampment in the land of Canaan, faithful worshippers of God “publicly declared that they were strangers and temporary residents.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Heb. 11:13</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> Likewise, Christ’s anointed followers, whose “citizenship exists in the heavens,” view themselves as “aliens and temporary residents” in the present system of things.

The <span id="page20" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>topic is Jehovah. The image is that of a dwelling, or place of habitation. Jehovah has much in common with such a place. For example, Jehovah provides protection for his people. This is in harmony with the fact that he is the very personification of love. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 John 4:8</a>) He is also a God of peace, who makes his loyal ones “dwell in security.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 4:8</a>) Consider, for instance, his dealings with faithful patriarchs, beginning with Abraham.</p>

And I will bless those who bless you, and him that calls down evil upon you I shall curse.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Gen. 12:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> With those words, Jehovah took it upon himself to become a secure dwelling for Abraham and for his descendants. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Gen. 26:1-6</a>) Jehovah fulfilled his promise. For example, he prevented Pharaoh of Egypt and King Abimelech of Gerar from violating Sarah and doing away with Abraham. He protected Isaac and Rebekah in a similar manner. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gen. 12:14-20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 20:1-14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 26:6-11</a>) We read: “[Jehovah] did not allow any human to defraud them, but on their account he reproved kings, saying: ‘Do not you men touch my anointed ones, and to my prophets do nothing bad.’”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 105:14, 15</a>.</p><img src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/w13/2013/421" data-img-small-src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/w13/2013/422" alt="" width="75" height="93" class="east_right" />

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> <strong>6.</strong><strong> What did Isaac tell Jacob to do, and how may Jacob have felt?</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> Those prophets included Abraham’s grandson Jacob. When the time came for Jacob to take a wife for himself, Isaac, his father, said to him: “You must not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan. Get up, go to Paddan-aram to the house of Bethuel the father of your mother and from there take yourself a wife from the daughters of Laban.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. 28:1, 2</a>) Jacob promptly obeyed Isaac. Jacob left the security of his immediate family, who were living in Canaan, to travel, evidently alone, hundreds of miles to the area of Haran. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Gen. 28:10</a>) Perhaps he wondered: ‘How long will I be away? Will my uncle warmly welcome me and grant me a God-fearing wife?’ If Jacob had such anxieties, these no doubt melted away when he reached Luz, some 60 miles (100 km) from Beer-sheba. What happened at Luz?</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong><strong> By means of a dream, how did God reassure Jacob?</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span id="page21" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> At Luz, Jehovah appeared to Jacob in a dream, saying: “Here I am with you and I will keep you in all the way you are going and I will return you to this ground, because <em>I am not going to leave you</em> until I have actually done what I have spoken to you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Gen. 28:15</a>) How those kind words must have reassured and comforted Jacob! Can you picture him thereafter striding along, eager to see how God would fulfill His word? If you have left home, perhaps to serve in a foreign land, you likely understand Jacob’s range of emotions. No doubt, though, you have seen evidence of Jehovah’s care for you.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"><strong>8, 9.</strong><strong> In what ways did Jehovah prove to be “a real dwelling” for Jacob, and what can we learn from this?</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><strong><sup>8</sup></strong></span> When Jacob reached Haran, his uncle Laban extended a warm welcome to him and later gave him Leah and Rachel as wives. In time, though, Laban tried to exploit Jacob, changing his wages ten times! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Gen. 31:41, 42</a>) Yet, Jacob endured these injustices, confident that Jehovah would continue to care for him​—and He did! Indeed, by the time God told Jacob to return to Canaan, the patriarch possessed “great flocks and maidservants and menservants and camels and asses.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Gen. 30:43</a>) Deeply appreciative, Jacob prayed: “I am unworthy of all the loving-kindnesses and of all the faithfulness that you have exercised toward your servant, for with but my staff I crossed this Jordan and now I have become two camps.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Gen. 32:10</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><strong><sup>9</sup></strong></span> Yes, how true was Moses’ prayer of reflection: “O Jehovah, you yourself have proved to be a real dwelling for us during generation after generation”!

Its leader is a very intelligent, powerful, and ruthless liar and murderer. How would you feel when you stepped outside the court at day’s end? Safe? Hardly! Indeed, you would have good reason for requesting protection. This scenario illustrates the situation of Jehovah’s servants, who boldly testify for Jehovah and fearlessly expose his vicious archenemy, Satan! <strong>(<em>Read</em></strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b"><strong><em>Revelation 12:17</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em>)</strong> But has Satan been able to silence God’s people? No! In fact, we continue to thrive spiritually​—a reality that can have only one explanation: Jehovah is still our refuge, “a real dwelling” for us, especially during these last days. <strong>(<em>Read</em></strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><strong><em>Isaiah 54:14,</em></strong></a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> <strong><em>17</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em>)</strong> That said, however, Jehovah cannot be a secure dwelling for us if we allow Satan to lure us away from our dwelling place.</p><img src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/w13/2013/423" data-img-small-src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/w13/2013/424" alt="" width="75" height="108" class="east_right" />

Although they lived in the land of Canaan, they remained separate from the people of the land, whose wicked, immoral ways they hated. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Gen. 27:46</a>) They were men of principle who did not depend on a long list of dos and don’ts to guide them. What they knew about Jehovah and his personality was sufficient for them. Because <span id="page22" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>he was their dwelling, they did not want to get as close to the world as they could. Rather, they stayed as far away from it as possible. What a fine example they set for us! Do you strive to imitate the faithful patriarchs as to your choice of associates and entertainment? Sadly, some within the Christian congregation give evidence that, at least to a degree, they feel comfortable in Satan’s world. If you feel that way even a little, pray about the matter. Remember, this world is Satan’s. It reflects his cold, self-serving spirit.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Eph. 2:1, 2</a>.</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Eph. 4:8-12</a>) Brother George Gangas, who was a member of the Governing Body for a number of years, wrote: “When I am among [God’s people] I feel at home with my family, in a spiritual paradise.” Do you feel the same way?</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"><strong>13.</strong><strong> What important lesson can we draw from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:13</a>?</strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> Another quality of the patriarchs that is worthy of imitation is their willingness to stand out as different from the people around them. As noted in <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2013205#h=7">paragraph 1</a>, they <em>“publicly</em> declared that they were strangers and temporary residents in the land.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Heb. 11:13</a>) Are you resolved to stand out as being different? Granted, doing so is not always easy. But with God’s help and with support from your fellow Christians, you can succeed. Remember, you are not alone. <em>All</em> who want to serve Jehovah have a fight on their hands! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Eph. 6:12</a>) Still, it is a fight we can win if we trust in Jehovah and make him our secure dwelling.</p>

We will have to wait and see. But of this we can be sure: Like the Israelites at the time of the Exodus, the “great crowd” will remain organized, ever alert to divine direction. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Rev. 7:9</a>; <strong><em>read</em></strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b"><strong><em>Exodus 13:18</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em>)</strong> That direction will come theocratically, probably by means of the congregation arrangement.

Long after the faithful patriarchs had died, Jehovah said to Moses: “I am the God of . . .

Says <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Revelation 21:3</a>: “Look! The tent of God is with mankind, and he will reside with them.” Initially, Jehovah will reside with his earthly subjects representatively by means of Christ Jesus. At the end of the thousand years, Jesus will hand the Kingdom over to his Father, having fully accomplished God’s purpose for the earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:28</a>) Thereafter, perfected mankind will no longer need Jesus as an intercessor; Jehovah will be with them. What a wonderful prospect lies before us! In the meantime, then, let us strive to imitate the faithful generations of old by making Jehovah our “real dwelling.”</p>

<strong>Did God Have a Beginning?</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Keep in mind, though, that the concept of God’s eternal existence is not just a cold fact. A closer look at Moses’ prayer reveals that God’s eternity guarantees a warm promise of everlasting life for us. In contrast with the fleeting nature of our present life, God is described as “a real dwelling for us during generation after generation.” As a loving Father, Jehovah has been, is, and always will be there for his people.

Not that Jehovah God himself was formed by someone. If, like modern atheists, we were to insist that Jehovah God was formed, we should be obliged logically to ask, Who formed Jehovah God? This would lead to the question, Who, then, formed the former of Jehovah God? Also, Who formed the one that formed the former of Jehovah God? In fact, we should never get to the end of asking that same question over and over again. Thus the mystery about Godship would only thicken, get more complicated and lead to no satisfaction of an intelligent mind.

<strong>Can We Really Find God?</strong><br/>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn"><strong>GOD’S ETERNAL EXISTENCE:</strong> The Bible teaches that God exists “from everlasting to everlasting.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2015730/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 90:2</a>) In other words, God had no beginning and will have no end.

Only “the King of eternity” could fulfill such a promise.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2015730/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Timothy 1:17</a>.</p>

<strong>Did God Have a Beginning?</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Moses said in prayer to Jehovah: “You have always been, and you will always be.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010491/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 90:2</a>, <em>The Holy Bible, New Century Version</em>) Here Moses describes God’s existence as stretching in two directions. One is toward the future. Jehovah is “the One that lives forever and ever.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010491/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 4:10</a>) Thus, God’s existence stretches forward into the eternal future. The other is toward the past. In other words, God was neither created nor did he come into existence. Rather, God’s existence stretches back into the infinite past.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Abstract ideas are hard for most of us to comprehend. Yet, we sometimes deal with challenging concepts, such as positive and negative numbers. Counting numbers can go on endlessly, either up or down. Could we not apply this example to the years in the life of the Creator?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">It is therefore fitting that only God bears the unique title “King of eternity.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010491/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Timothy 1:17</a>) Just think: Jesus Christ, the myriads of angels in heaven, and mankind on earth all have a beginning because of being created.

The peace of many families is shattered by such abominations as spouse beating and child abuse.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Who will guide us through these difficult times? Well, there is no lack of advice from psychologists, educators, and others, but much of it is contradictory. For a whole generation in the West, Dr. Benjamin Spock was the foremost adviser in the matter of educating children. Then he admitted that his advice had been mistaken!</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">How much wiser to have God as our “dwelling place”! In these turbulent times, he is a rock of stability, existing “from everlasting to everlasting.” He said of himself through the prophet Malachi: “I am Jehovah; I have not changed.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993169/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Malachi 3:6</a>) God’s standards, as recorded in the Bible, are completely reliable. He existed “before the mountains,” and his counsel, accessible in the Holy Scriptures, is based on his eternal wisdom.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974033/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 42:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974033/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ephesians 3:9</a>) No creation existed. So for an eternal past this God was all by himself and he had not yet become a Creator. That is why the prophet Moses said in prayer to God: “Before mountains were born or earth and universe came to the pangs of birth, and from eternity to eternity, you are Deity.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974033/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 90:2</a>, Byington’s translation) During all that eternal past before creation God was able to enjoy Himself.</p>

<strong>Does the God of Justice Care?</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Jehovah God, however, has no limitations affecting him by a time element. He is God “from time indefinite to time indefinite.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973240/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 90:2</a>) “One day is with Jehovah as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973240/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:8</a>) Unlike short-lived humans who cannot long postpone their plans if they are to be carried out, Jehovah God can wait until developments in the stream of time are just right for the accomplishment of the greatest good possible.</p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><span id="page256" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="256" data-before-text="256"></span><strong>● Why does the <em>New World Translation</em> render</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 90:2</strong></a> <strong>so differently from other translations?—B. B., United States.</strong></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">According to the <em>Revised Standard Version</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 90:2</a> reads: “Before the mountains were <em>brought forth,</em> or ever thou hadst <em>formed</em> the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting thou art God.” <em>The New World Translation</em> of this verse reads: “Before the mountains themselves were born, or you proceeded to bring forth as with labor pains the earth and the productive land, even from time indefinite to time indefinite you are God.”</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The Hebrew word for the first of these expressions is the passive voice of <em>yalad</em> and, according to Hebrew lexicographers, it means to be begotten, born, and relates to the ordinary birth process. <em>Yalad</em> is applied to both the father’s and the mother’s part, as can be seen from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 14:1</a> (“Man, <em>born</em> of woman”) and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 2:7</a> (“I have <em>become</em> your <em>father”</em>).</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The Hebrew word for the second verb in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 90:2</a> is entirely another verb and is used in connection with the birth process to call attention to the pain and travail thereof. It is the Hebrew word <em>hhil,</em> which, according to Hebrew authorities, means basically, “to have labor pains.” The form of this verb in the Hebrew text here has a sort of reflexive force in which the performer of the act suffers the accompanying sensations. In other words, he experiences the labor pains or childbirth pains. That is why the word is also defined as “to bring forth (in pain).”—Young’s <em>Analytical Concordance to the Bible.</em></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">This same word is found at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:18</a>, which reads: “The Rock who fathered you, you proceeded to forget, and you began to leave God out of memory, the One bringing you forth with childbirth pains,” without doubt referring to the miracles Jehovah wrought in Egypt in connection with the deliverance of the nation of Israel. Also, we find this Hebrew term at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Isaiah 51:2</a>, where we read: “Look to Abraham your father and to Sarah who gradually brought you forth with childbirth pains.” Also at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Proverbs 25:23</a>: “The wind from the north brings forth as with labor pains a downpour.”</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">From the foregoing references we can see the use of these words particularly in poetic writing, and we see that they are full of meaning, expressive indeed. Modern translations hide the force of these expressions by their free renderings.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Regarding the use of these terms in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963288/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Psalm 90:2</a>, it might be said that, judged by human standards, the producing of this earth and the productive land with all its complicated mechanisms and chemistry would certainly call for a great deal of effort, painful effort, as measured even by scientists today. The psalmist here speaks from a purely human standpoint and thereby shows both an active imagination and great respect for the amount of work involved for Jehovah to create these things; with what expenditure of time, of course, we do not know.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"></p>

This is even more true of what might be called spiritual light, light for the mind and the heart. Without this light men are blind, lost, do not know which way to go, for it simply is not in man himself to direct his own steps. Proof of this is seen in the sorry state of affairs in which men find themselves today. Look where we may, we find confusion, strife and wickedness due to selfishness and conflicting theories as to what is best for man in science and art, in religion and politics.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jer. 10:23</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Who is to blame for this sorry state of affairs? Not the Creator, for he has provided man with spiritual light, with an infallible guide, his Word, the Bible. Concerning it the one man whose life more greatly affected mankind for good than any other one that ever lived, Jesus Christ, once said, “Your word is truth.” It is, as a psalmist long ago expressed it, ‘a lamp for our feet, a light for our roadway.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 17:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ps. 119:105</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">This Word of God is known as The Book and itself consists of sixty-six books. The term “books” here is used in a special sense, since twenty-eight of these are less than six pages in length, and the five shortest average less than a page each of the ordinary Bible. The largest as well as perhaps the best known among the sixty-six books is the book of Psalms, it accounting for about 8 percent of the entire inspired Scriptures.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In the original Hebrew this book was known as <em>T<sup>e</sup>·hil·limʹ,</em> meaning “Praises.” There are 150 of these psalms, almost half of which are credited to David, the shepherd king. Written over a period of more than a thousand years, they do indeed have as their theme the praises of Jehovah God. In them their writers praise Jehovah God, call on others to praise him and give many, many reasons for doing so. Interwoven in among these many psalms is what might be termed an epitome of the Hebrew Scriptures, for in them much is found to throw light on life’s roadway in the way of Bible history, Bible prophecy, Bible doctrine and exhortation to right conduct.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>THE LIGHT OF BIBLE HISTORY</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Information concerning God’s mighty deeds and his dealings with human creatures in times past throws light on life’s roadway.

<strong>From Our Readers</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>Reincarnation</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">With interest I read your article “Did You Ever Live Before?” (February 22, 1982) I was surprised that not a word was said about either <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101982772/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 90:3</a> or <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101982772/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 3:9</a>. Both scriptures provide more information about eternity than your entire article does. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101982772/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 90</a> we read: “Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.” [<em>Authorized Version</em>] It is not said when, how, where or as what a person will come again, it is simply stated THAT he will return. According to John the Baptist, a person could even return in the form of a stone, because he once told the Jews: “God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.”</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sj">H.

The Pharis</em>e<em>es and the Sadducees failed to demonstrate this faith, relying instead on their natural line of descent from Abraham. Thus neither scripture can be used to support the unbiblical teaching of human reincarnation.​—ED.</em></p>

Thus Moses was told that no human could see God and live. Samuel was reminded that a human can see only the outside, but God can see the heart. David prayed that he might not fall into human hands but into God’s hands, for having numbered the fighting men of his nation presumptuously. The temple of Solomon, David said, was to be built, not for humans, but for God. Jehoshaphat counseled the judges to remember that they were judging, not for humans, but for God.

How could they, since they received their “theology,” not from pagan sources, but from God himself, who made plain man’s mortal nature both by warning him of death in the event he sinned and by sentencing him, after he had sinned, to return to the dust from which man had been taken.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. 2:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 3:19</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><em>Enósh</em> always has an unfavorable connotation and, therefore, is never used in a complimentary sense. Fittingly, it is frequently coupled with <em>adám,</em> human, when man is contrasted with his immortal Maker, Jehovah God. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalms 8:4 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Ps 144:3</a> are typical of this coupling of <em>enósh</em> with <em>adám</em> when contrasting man with God. Thus also Moses wrote: “You make mortal man [<em>enósh</em>] go back to crushed matter, and you say: ‘Go back, you sons of men [<em>adám</em>].’” Because of the wickedness of man God warned that he would make <em>‘enósh</em> scarcer than refined gold and <em>adám</em> scarcer than the gold of Ophir.’ Putting both <em>enósh</em> and <em>adám</em> in their places are the words of Jehovah to Isaiah: “I myself am the One that is comforting you people.

<strong>Day</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Man’s situation does not compare with that of the Creator, who does not reside within our solar system and who is not affected by its various cycles and orbits. Of God, who is from time indefinite to time indefinite, the psalmist says: “For a thousand years are in your eyes but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch during the night.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001132/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Ps 90:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001132/52/1" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> 4</a>) Correspondingly, the apostle Peter writes that “one day is with Jehovah as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001132/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">2Pe 3:8</a>) For man, a 1,000-year period represents some 365,242 individual time units of day and night, but to the Creator it can be just one unbroken time period in which he begins the carrying out of some purposeful activity and brings it on to its successful conclusion, much as a man begins a task in the morning and concludes it by the day’s end.</p>

<strong>Bearing the Burden of Injustice</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> To us, it may seem that it takes a long time for justice to be executed against those who merit punishment. But it is a very short time in the sight of the eternal God. The Bible says: “A thousand years are in your eyes but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch during the night.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978765/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 90:4</a>) How long does yesterday seem to you today? Perhaps you did have a <span id="page17" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>trying day, and it may have seemed that the day would never end. Now that it is over, does it not appear as if that day hardly existed? To the Creator, a thousand years are like this, in fact, even as brief as a four-hour watch during the night. Hence, the human life-span of but 70 or 80 years is virtually nonexistent in God’s sight. “We have finished our years just like a whisper,” wrote the prophet Moses. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978765/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 90:9</a>) Yes, our brief life-span may be compared to a breath that passes our lips in a whisper. When we consider that Jehovah God promises to give his loyal servants an eternity of happy living in peace and security, even a lifetime of extreme suffering is nothing at all. This viewpoint can help us to be patient when we are troubled by having to face injustice, oppression and favoritism.</p>

<strong>Awaiting the “New Heavens and a New Earth”</strong><br/><p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[106]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"><sup>26</sup></span> The prophet Moses was the first man to be inspired to equate a thousand years of human existence with a twenty-four-hour day in the experience of the everlasting Creator of heaven and earth. This first such comparison is found in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101975076/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Psalm 90:1-4</a>, as written by Moses, in these words addressed to the Creator: “O Jehovah, you yourself have proved to be a real dwelling for us during generation after generation. Before the mountains themselves were born, or you proceeded to bring forth as with labor pains the earth and the productive land, even from time indefinite to time indefinite <span id="page294" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="294" data-before-text="294"></span>you are God. You make mortal man go back to crushed matter, and you say: ‘Go back, you sons of men.’ For [in view of God’s turning sinful man back to the dust of the ground in death after such a short life-span] a thousand years are in your eyes but as yesterday [of twenty-four hours’ length] when it is past, and as a watch [of four hours] during the night.” (Note the <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101975076/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">superscription of Psalm 90</a>.) Jehovah God inspired Moses also to speak of the seven-thousand-year-long creative period as “days.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101975076/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Genesis 1:1-31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101975076/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> Exodus 20:11</a>) What is quite long in time for mortal man is infinitesimally short to the immortal God.</p>

Could he not just as easily foretell with accuracy what will happen during a thousand years beginning with some point of time after 1914 C.E.? Most reasonably so! And what if He has already given us a description of such a thousand-year period? Then with that word as our basis, we can confidently speak of a thousand years to come.</p>

Nearly three thousand five hundred years ago! But to the Eternal One whose name must be vindicated such a time period is not calculated according to the earth’s daily spinning on its axis and its yearly movement around the sun. Those three and a half millenniums are viewed as but three and a half of our days. And what is a mere half a week of time to Him? To Him it was just half a week ago that he confronted the first-class political power of the sixteenth century before our Common Era. So it was no mere poetic outburst when an inspired songwriter of that day said to Him: “A thousand years are in your eyes but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch during the night.”<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1101971001/0">a</a></p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 4.

Its highly prized wisdom and its high degree of civilization made no difference to Him. The great number of its religious gods and goddesses did not overawe Him but showed how ignorant and misguided that highly civilized world power was in a religious way. What counted with Him then was that this world power had got into difficulty with him. How?</p>

<strong>Bearing the Burden of Injustice</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> To us, it may seem that it takes a long time for justice to be executed against those who merit punishment. But it is a very short time in the sight of the eternal God. The Bible says: “A thousand years are in your eyes but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch during the night.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978765/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 90:4</a>) How long does yesterday seem to you today? Perhaps you did have a <span id="page17" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>trying day, and it may have seemed that the day would never end. Now that it is over, does it not appear as if that day hardly existed? To the Creator, a thousand years are like this, in fact, even as brief as a four-hour watch during the night. Hence, the human life-span of but 70 or 80 years is virtually nonexistent in God’s sight. “We have finished our years just like a whisper,” wrote the prophet Moses. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978765/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 90:9</a>) Yes, our brief life-span may be compared to a breath that passes our lips in a whisper. When we consider that Jehovah God promises to give his loyal servants an eternity of happy living in peace and security, even a lifetime of extreme suffering is nothing at all. This viewpoint can help us to be patient when we are troubled by having to face injustice, oppression and favoritism.</p>

<strong>Death</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Certain texts are, at times, brought forth as supposed evidence that physical death was intended as a natural eventuality for humans, even as for the animals; for example, the references to man’s life span as being ‘seventy or eighty years’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001136/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps 90:10</a>) and the apostle’s statement that “it is reserved for men to die once for all time, but after this a judgment.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001136/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Heb 9:27</a>) Nevertheless, all such texts were written <em>after</em> the introduction of death among mankind, and are applied to imperfect, sinful humans. The tremendous longevity of the men living prior to the Flood must at least be considered as reflecting a remarkable potential in the human body, surpassing that found in any animal even under the most ideal conditions. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001136/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ge 5:1-31</a>) The Bible unmistakably relates the entrance of death into the human family to Adam’s sin, as already shown.</p>

<strong>Life Span</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>Since Moses’ Time.</strong> About 3,500 years ago Moses wrote concerning the life span: “In themselves the days of our years are seventy years; and if because of special mightiness they are eighty years, yet their insistence is on trouble and hurtful things.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002740/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps 90:10</a>) The situation in this regard has not changed substantially.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Throughout the centuries, man’s efforts to extend his life span have been unsuccessful. However, in many lands <em>life expectancy</em> has increased. Hence, James Fries and Lawrence Crapo noted: “The average length of life in the United States has increased from approximately 47 years at the turn of the century to over 73 years today, an increase of more than 25 years. . . . A critical look at these data, however, shows that the increase in life expectancy results from the elimination of premature death rather than by extension of the natural life span.”​—<em>Vitality and Aging,</em> 1981, pp. 74, 75.</p>

<strong>How Long Can You Live?</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In 1990 a news report heralded the possibility of extending the human life span to “five score years and ten.” No doubt this was a veiled reference to these words of the Bible psalmist Moses: “The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993840/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 90:10</a>, <em>King James Version</em>) So the Bible gives 70 or 80 years as the average human life span. But what is the probable number of years a person can expect to live today?</p>

<strong>What Hope for Longer Life?</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">How long can humans expect their life span to be? The prophet Moses described the situation in his day, some 3,500 years ago: “In themselves the days of our years are seventy years; and if because of special mightiness they are eighty years, yet their insistence is on trouble and hurtful things; for it must quickly pass by, and away we fly.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101995761/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 90:10</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Seventy years​—that is only 25,567 days. And 80 years consist of just 29,219 days. Really, so few! Can anything be done to extend human life?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>Can Medical Science Help?</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><em>Science</em> magazine noted: “Life expectancy at birth [in the United States] has increased from 47 years in 1900 to about 75 years in 1988.” As a result of reducing the infant death rate through better health care and nutrition, people in the United States can now expect to live about as long as Moses stated. Nonetheless, are any dramatic increases anticipated in how long most people live?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Significantly, Leonard Hayflick, a leading authority on aging, said in his book <em>How and Why We Age:</em> “Advances in biomedical research and the implementation of improved medical care in this century have certainly had an impact on human longevity, but only by allowing more people to approach the fixed upper limit of the human life span.” So he explained: <em>“Life expectation</em> has increased but <em>life span</em> has not; the distinction is critical.”</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">What is the “fixed upper limit” of man’s life span? Some say it is uncertain that anyone in recent times has lived beyond the age of 115. Yet, <em>Science</em> magazine said: “As of 1990, the oldest verified age that an individual has survived is just over 120 years.” And early this year the French minister of health, along with droves of reporters and photographers, visited Jeanne Calment of Arles, France, to mark her 120th birthday. Moses too lived to the age of 120, far beyond the norm.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101995761/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 34:7</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Do scientists hold out hope that people may commonly live that long or longer? No, most do not. A headline in the <em>Detroit News</em> read: “Researchers Say 85 May Be the Outer Limit of Average Lifespan.” In the article a recognized authority on aging, S. Jay Olshansky, said: “Once you go beyond the <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>age of 85, people die from multiple-​organ failure. They stop breathing. Basically, they die of old age. And there’s no cure for that.” He added: “Barring a reversal of human aging on a molecular level, the rapid increases in life expectancy are over.”</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><em>Science</em> magazine noted that perhaps “the upper limit to longevity has already been approached and that further significant declines in mortality are unlikely.” It is said that if all causes of death reported on death certificates could be eliminated, life expectancy would be increased less than 20 years.</p>

<strong>Wonderfully Made to Live, Not Die</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The dramatic increases noted above are due largely to a lower infant-mortality rate. Today, more babies survive to adulthood than in past centuries. “Medical advances,” explains <em>The Body Book,</em> “have increased <em>average life expectancy,</em> but they have not increased the <em>maximum life span.”</em> As Brian Stableford, a biologist at the University of Reading, England, expressed it in his book <em>Future Man:</em> “Our lifespan has been reckoned since Biblical times as 70 years, and although two thousand years of scientific advancement have allowed many more <span id="page24" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>people to reach that term, scientists have so far done nothing to extend it.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Stableford was referring to words penned 3,500 years ago by the ancient Israelite Moses: “In themselves the days of our years are seventy years; and if because of special mightiness they are eighty years, yet their insistence is on trouble and hurtful things.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101988729/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 90:10</a>) ‘Why,’ you may wonder, ‘has modern medicine been unable to change this fact of life?’</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">● Great strides in lengthening the human life-span do not mean that such improvements will continue, according to an official of America’s national Center for Disease Control. He pointed out that, although the average life-span since 1900 has increased by 25 years, life expectancy for middle-aged adults increased only about four years during the same period, rising from 69 to 73 years in all. The 25-year increase in the average for all ages “was achieved by reducing the risk of dying during infancy and childhood through environmental sanitation, immunization and improved nutrition,” he said. “The highly touted lengthening of life span for Americans is largely due to prevention, not cure.” He indicated that any future increases in the life-span would be slow in coming and would require public habit changes, such as elimination of smoking, overdrinking, stress and hard living.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Thus, human age limitations stated by the inspired psalmist over 3,000 years ago remain accurate: “Seventy years is the span of our life, eighty if our strength holds.” The only Source of any meaningful extension of life is the Author of life, Jehovah God, who will grant, not just a few years, but “eternal life” to those who truly know and serve him.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980288/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 90:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980288/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> John 17:3</a>, “New English Bible.”</p>

According to <em>The World Almanac</em> (1979), human life-expectancy rates range from between 30 and 40 years in such countries as Bangladesh, Benin, Chad and Mali to a high of just over 70 (but well below 80) in Iceland, Japan, the Netherlands and a few other countries.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Nearly 3,500 years ago the prophet Moses wrote: “In themselves the days of our years are seventy years; and if because of special mightiness they are eighty years . . .” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101978288/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 90:10</a>) This situation has not changed despite the advances of medical science.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Regarding the United States, where “life expectancy has stalled around 70,” David Borenstein writes: “Modern science, despite tremendous strides, has not been able to add significantly to the average person’s life expectancy. Although the rising number of those sixty-five years and older would seem to indicate that we are living longer, this is just not the case. In fact, life expectancy at age 50 is only 3 years longer than it was TWO CENTURIES ago. . . . Dramatic advances in the first half of the twentieth century did result in the eradication of many killing illnesses. However, this means that while more people are making it to middle age than before, few, if any, can expect to live appreciably longer than their ancestors.”</p>

<strong>Consulting the Finest Heart Specialist for Our Times</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> However, with the Designer of the heart it is different. He created it with the ability to keep circulating the life-sustaining blood through our bodies forever. To his credit he has the unmatched record of keeping a human heart doing its vital duty for nine hundred and sixty-nine years. This was in the case of Methuselah the son of Enoch, for he lived that long. He was the eighth in the line of descent from the first man on earth, Adam. Methuselah’s heart holds the record for showing what the human heart can really do. According to the ancient historian Moses, the son of Amram, this long-lived Methuselah died in the year 2370 before our Common Era. Since then human hearts have greatly weakened in their vitality and capability. In the most advanced lands of today the average life expectancy of the male sex is seventy years. So there has been no improvement over what the historian Moses said in his day: “In themselves the days of our years are seventy years; and if because of special <span id="page657" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="657" data-before-text="657"></span>mightiness they are eighty years, yet their insistence is on trouble and hurtful things; for it must quickly pass by, and away we fly.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977804/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 90:10</a>.</p>

The <em>Scientific American,</em> summing up the matter, said:</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="si">“Even if the major causes of death in old age​—heart disease, stroke and cancer—​were eliminated, the average life expectancy would not be lengthened by much more than 10 years.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● “The dream of everlasting life is probably as old as mankind,” wrote Dr. Viktor Tobiasch in “Ausblick,” a West German journal. He cited various efforts to lengthen the human life-span. These have included use of organ extracts and even the ‘freezing’ of the body in liquid nitrogen so that it might be thawed out “to a new life.”</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Prof. Tobiasch also said that around 1955, in highly developed lands, average life expectancy rose to about seventy years. However, he explained that this was due to improvement in life expectancy for the newborn and small children. The average life-span for adults has not increased.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">These comments underscore two points made in the Bible. First, “in themselves the days of our years are seventy years; and . . . because of special mightiness they are eighty years.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976362/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 90:10</a>) Second, it is not surprising that mankind should dream of everlasting life, for “even time indefinite he [Jehovah God] has put in their heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976362/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:11</a>) Of all earth’s creatures, humans alone have a God-given concept of past and future time indefinite or eternity.

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Webster’s unabridged dictionary gives, in part, this definition of generation: “The average lifetime of man, or the ordinary period of time at which one rank follows another, or father is succeeded by child; an age. A generation is usually taken to be about 33 years.” But the Bible is not so specific. It gives no number of years for a generation. And in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952648/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 24:34,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952648/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Mark 13:30 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952648/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Luke 21:32</a>, the texts mentioning the generation the question refers to, we are not to take generation as meaning the average time for one generation to be succeeded by the next, as Webster’s does in its 33-year approximation; but rather more like Webster’s first-quoted definition, “the average lifetime of man.” Three or even four generations may be living at the same time, their lives overlapping. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952648/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 78:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952648/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 145:4</a>) Before the Noachian flood the life span was hundreds of years. Down through the centuries since, it has varied, and even now is different in different countries. The Bible does speak of a man’s days <span id="page543" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="543" data-before-text="543"></span>as being threescore and ten or fourscore years; but it assigns no specific number of years to a generation.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952648/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 90:10</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Even if it did, we could not calculate from such a figure the date of Armageddon, for the texts here under discussion do not say God’s battle comes right at the end of this generation, but before its end. To try to say how many years before its end would be speculative. The texts merely set a limit that is sufficiently definite for all present practical purposes. Some persons living A.D. 1914 when the series of foretold events began will also be living when the series ends with Armageddon. All the events will come within the span of a generation. There are hundreds of millions of persons living now that were living in 1914, and many millions of these persons could yet live a score or more years. Just when the lives of the majority of them will be cut short by Armageddon we cannot say.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>●</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952648/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Deuteronomy 21:10-13</strong></a> <strong>shows that Israelite men could marry foreign captive women, yet other texts forbid intermarriage with foreigners. Is this not contradictory?—M. H., Pennsylvania.</strong></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Jehovah gives the reason for the general prohibition concerning foreign wives, as follows: “They would turn your sons from following me to serving alien gods.” Also divine warning was sounded against “marrying your sons to their daughters, who will desert to their gods and make your sons desert also”. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952648/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex. 34:16</a>, <em>Mo;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952648/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Deut. 7:4</a>, <em>AT</em>) The prohibition was based on no racial prejudice nor any nationalistic grounds, but it was solely for the purpose of protecting the Israelites from religious contamination. It was to avoid contacts that might jeopardize the purity of worship rendered to Jehovah.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">But notice how the special circumstances involved in the case discussed at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952648/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 21:10-13</a> eliminate this danger of contamination: “When thou shalt go forth to war against thine enemies, and Yahweh thy God shall deliver them into thy hand and thou shalt take them captive; and shalt see among the captives a woman of beautiful figure, and shalt have a desire unto her, and wouldest take her to thee to wife, then shalt thou bring her into the midst of thy house, and she shall shave her head and pare her nails; and put away the raiment of her captivity from off her and shall remain in thy house, and bewail her father and her mother for the space of a month, and after that mayest thou go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.”—<em>Ro.</em></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">She cut off her hair, which was the usual sign of mourning. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952648/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 1:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952648/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Isa. 15:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952648/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Jer. 7:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952648/7/3" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> Amos 8:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952648/7/4" data-bid="8-5" class="b"> Mic. 1:16</a>) She either cut her nails close, which would remove this means of adornment, since they were stained to be attractive; or she let them grow to become unkept, without their usual manicured attractiveness. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952648/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Deut. 21:12</a>, <em>Knox; Le</em>) She put off the raiment in which she was taken captive, since the women of defeated forces put on their finest dresses and ornaments in the hope of finding favor in the eyes of their captors. For a month she was in mourning, bewailing the loss of her loved ones, thus possibly indicating the thoroughness of the war’s destructiveness at the time of her capture. The captive women were possibly the only survivors, and the heathen gods were doubtless destroyed by the Israelite warriors. So no ties were left with the pagan nation, either socially or religiously. There were no heathen in-laws for the Israelite man to mix in with.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Hence to marry a foreign woman so completely severed from connection with false gods and false worshipers was permissible. It was quite different from marrying a foreign woman not a captive whose relatives were living, whose religious gods were still worshiped by her family, who would from time to time have some contact with her heathen relatives and their gods, and who might bring her Israelite husband into contact with them also, thereby exposing his pure worship to contamination. So it was the special circumstances of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952648/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 21:10-13</a> that allowed for an exception to the general prohibition of intermarriage with foreign women.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sd">Let your utterance be always with graciousness, seasoned with salt, so as to know how you ought to give an answer to each one.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952648/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Col. 4:6</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"></p>

What specifically was he asking for? Should we make a similar worshipful request?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In verse 10, Moses lamented the shortness of the human life span. On another occasion, he recorded the testimony of Job, who said: “Man, born of woman, is short-lived and glutted with agitation.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005329/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 14:1</a>) It is evident that Moses was painfully aware of the transitory nature of imperfect human life. Therefore, he viewed each day of life as a precious resource. In directing this plea to God, Moses expressed his desire to live his remaining days wisely, in a way that would please his Creator. Should not we too seek to spend our days meaningfully? That will be our endeavor if we want God’s approval now.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">There was an additional factor that motivated both Moses and Job, a factor that should also motivate us. Both of these godly men looked forward to a future reward​—life on earth under better conditions. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005329/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 14:14, 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005329/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Hebrews 11:26</a>) At that time, no one’s good works will be cut short by death. Our Creator purposes that faithful ones will live forever on a paradise earth.

<strong>How Can We Make Our Days Count Before Jehovah?</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Moses was another man of faith who recognized his dependence on God. Like David, Moses could see that life is filled with trouble. He therefore petitioned God to show him ‘how to count his days in such a way as to bring in a heart of wisdom.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002844/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 90:10-12</a>) A heart of wisdom would come only from learning and living in accord with Jehovah’s laws and principles. Moses knew this and subsequently endeavored to impress that vital truth upon the nation of Israel by repeating God’s laws and regulations to them prior to their taking possession of the Promised Land. Any human king whom Jehovah would later choose to rule over Israel was to write for himself a copy of the Law and read in it all the days of his life. Why? In order that he might learn to fear God. This would be a test of a king’s obedience. It would protect him from exalting his heart above his brothers and would also lengthen his days upon his kingdom. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002844/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>) This promise was reiterated when Jehovah said to David’s son Solomon: “If you will walk in my ways by keeping my regulations and my commandments, just as David your father walked, I will also lengthen your days.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002844/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Kings 3:10-14</a>.</p>

<strong>Make Your Life Successful!</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> How can you make your life a success and “reap everlasting life”? Moses wrote: “The days of our years are seventy years; and if because of special mightiness they are eighty years . . . It must quickly pass by, and away we fly.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999644/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 90:10</a>) You may rarely, if ever, think about death. In fact, many youths behave as if they were indestructible. But Moses brings us face-to-face with the painful reality that life is short. There is not even a guarantee that we will live to be 70 or 80. “Time and unforeseen occurrence” can cut down even those who are young and healthy. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999644/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:11</a>) How, then, will you use the precious life that you now enjoy? Moses prayed: “Show us just how to count our days in such a way that we may bring a heart of wisdom in.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999644/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 90:12</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> What does it mean to count your days? It does not mean that you should become obsessed with how long you might live. Moses was praying that Jehovah teach His <span id="page21" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>people how to <em>use</em> their remaining days in a way that brings honor to Him. Are you counting the days of your life​—viewing each day as a precious resource to be used to bring praise to God? The Bible gives young people this encouragement: “Remove vexation from your heart, and ward off calamity from your flesh; for youth and the prime of life are vanity. Remember, now, your Grand Creator in the days of your young manhood.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999644/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 11:10–12:1</a>) Remembering our Creator means more than just not forgetting that he exists. When the criminal implored Jesus, “Remember me when you get into your kingdom,” he wanted Jesus to do more than recall his name. He wanted Jesus to act, to resurrect him! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999644/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Luke 23:42</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999644/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Genesis 40:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999644/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999644/15/2" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> Job 14:13</a>.) In a similar way, to remember Jehovah involves action, doing what pleases him. Can it be said that you are remembering Jehovah?</p>

However, we “bring a heart of wisdom in,” not by speculating about how many years or days make up a generation, but by thinking about how we “count our days” in bringing joyful praise to Jehovah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995805/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 90:12</a>) Rather than provide a rule for measuring time, the term “generation” as used by Jesus refers principally to contemporary people of a certain historical period, with their identifying characteristics.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1995805/1">b</a></p>

In fact, divine teaching shows us how to count our days in a special way. A life expectancy of 70 years holds promise of some 25,550 days. A person 50 years old has already spent 18,250 of them, and his 7,300 remaining hoped-for days seem few indeed. Especially then may he appreciate more fully why the prophet Moses prayed to God at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994083/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 90:12</a>: “Show us just how to count our days in such a way that we may bring a heart of wisdom in.” But what did Moses mean by that?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Moses did not mean that God would reveal the exact number of days there would be in the lifetime of each Israelite. According to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994083/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 90, verses 9 and 10</a>, that Hebrew prophet recognized that a life span might be some 70 or 80 years​—brief indeed. So the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994083/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 90:12</a> evidently expressed Moses’ prayerful desire that Jehovah show, or teach, him and His people to exercise wisdom in valuing ‘the days of their years’ and using them in a God-approved way. Well, then, what about us? Do we appreciate each precious day? Are we bringing in a heart of wisdom by seeking to spend every day in a worthwhile way to the glory of our Grand Instructor, Jehovah God? Divine teaching helps us to do just that.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 9. What can be expected if we learn to count our days to Jehovah’s glory?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> If we learn to count our days to Jehovah’s glory, we may be able to keep right on counting, for divine teaching imparts knowledge for life eternal. “This means everlasting life,” said Jesus, “their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994083/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) Of course, if we acquired all the worldly knowledge available, it would not bring us life eternal. But everlasting life can be ours if we gain and apply accurate knowledge of the two most important persons in the universe and really exercise faith.</p>

<strong>Are You Too Busy?</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">While we do not want to be so time conscious as to make life unpleasant for ourselves and others, we should give serious thought to our use of time. It is good to view time as a valuable asset, something not to be squandered. Never should the daily cares of life and our personal interests so occupy us that we have no time for serving God and helping fellowmen. Rather, we should want to feel like Moses, who said in prayer: “Show us just how <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>to count our days in such a way that we may bring a heart of wisdom in.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101978361/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 90:12</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">What would the answer to this request mean for us?

<strong>Will This Be a Good Day?</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">True, a life expectancy of seventy years (as enjoyed in some lands) gives promise of some 25,567 days in all. But to the person who is fifty years old the 18,262 days by then spent seem to have swept swiftly by, and the 7,305 remaining hoped-for days look few indeed. He may now begin to appreciate why the prophet Moses long ago prayed to God: “Show us just how to count our days in such a way that we may bring a heart of wisdom in.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101971561/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 90:12</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">What did Moses mean? He certainly did not mean that God would reveal the exact number of days the lifetime of each Israelite would hold. To the contrary, the Bible frequently reminds us that we should not count on living a presumed period of time, but realize instead that “you do not know what your life will be tomorrow. For you are a mist appearing for a little while and then disappearing.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101971561/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jas. 4:13-15</a>) Jesus gave a parable of a rich and self-centered farmer who thought he had a good idea of the number of his days. He expanded his storehouses and then said to himself: “Soul, you have many good things laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, enjoy yourself.” But in reality for him there was not even a tomorrow, for God said to him: “Unreasonable one, this night they are demanding your soul from you. Who, then, is to have the things you stored up?”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101971561/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 12:19, 20</a></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Actually, Moses’ own words in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101971561/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 90</a> show that he too recognized the brevity, the transitoriness, the uncertainty of human life. (See verses 9 and 10.) So his prayer evidently expressed the desire for God’s guidance to help Moses and his people wisely to value, estimate and appraise the ‘days of their years,’ using them, not in vanity, but so as to gain God’s favor.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">What of us? How much does a day mean to us? Will we spend the “days of our years” as if we had a guaranteed supply of them with no danger of ever running out? When do we begin to “count” them​—only when the normal supply is far diminished in old age? Or will we begin early to recognize the true value and preciousness of each day, ‘bringing in a heart of wisdom’ as Moses said, by seeking to spend each day in a worthwhile way?</p>

<strong>Be Taught by Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Still, at times, because of human frailty or some other valid reason, Jehovah does teach his servants by experience. That is, by means of miracles or his providences <span id="page342" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="342" data-before-text="342"></span>he indicates his will or drives home certain lessons. He let the Israelites go hungry in the wilderness and then fed them on miraculous manna ‘in order to make them know,’ that is, to teach them, “that not by bread alone does man live.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Deut. 8:2, 3</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Because the Israelite Achan let covetousness overreach him God permitted the entire nation to suffer defeat at Ai to impress upon Joshua and all his people the seriousness of Achan’s offense. Thereafter God repeatedly let his people come under pagan subjection to bring them to their senses. This thought is inherent in the psalmists’ words: “Before I was under affliction I was sinning by mistake.” “Show us just how to count our days in such a way that we may bring in a heart of wisdom.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Josh. 7:1-26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Judg. 10:9-16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Ps. 119:67;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/10/3" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 90:12</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">While God’s servants today cannot point to like miracles, God does, at times, indicate his will for them by means of his providences. Thus the wholly unexpected obtaining of an abundance of essential fuel back in 1919 indicated to them what was God’s will in a certain matter, even as their inability to find suitable accommodations in 1958 indicated that it was not God’s will to have certain camping facilities in connection with the Divine Will International Assembly.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>TAUGHT BY HOLY SPIRIT</strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Jehovah God also uses his holy spirit to teach us. By holy spirit is not meant a third person of a mysterious trinity, but God’s active force, by means of which he carries out his purposes. Even as he used it to inspire men to write his Word, so by means of it he gives understanding of that Word. Thus only after receiving holy spirit at Pentecost did the early Christians understand God’s will for them, even as Jesus foretold: “The helper, the holy spirit which the Father will send in my name, that one will teach you all things and bring back to your minds all the things I told you.” As the apostle Paul also noted: “Eye has not seen and ear has not heard, neither have there been conceived in the heart of man the things which God has prepared for those who love him.” But “to us God has revealed them through his spirit, for the spirit searches into all things, even the deep things of God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">John 14:26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 2:9, 10</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">To receive this enlightening holy spirit requires knowledge of God’s Word, faith in it and works in harmony with that faith. We “receive the spirit . . . due to obedient hearing by faith.” Only then will God answer our prayers for the holy spirit. But more than that, it is also necessary for us to have contact or association with God’s visible channel or earthly organization—a fact driven home by the experience of the early Christians.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gal. 3:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Acts 8:15-17</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong>BY A VISIBLE ORGANIZATION</strong></p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Jehovah as the great Teacher has ever used human instruments to teach his earthly children. Adam taught Eve; Noah taught his family; Abraham taught his household; Moses taught his people. In particular was the tribe of Levi, together with its priests, the teaching instrument in ancient Israel: “For the lips of a priest are the ones that should keep knowledge, and the law is what people should seek from his mouth; for he is the messenger of Jehovah.” When this teaching body failed to do its duty, God “kept sending against them by means of his messengers [the prophets], . . . because he felt compassion for his people.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Mal. 2:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 36:15</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">When on earth Jesus proved himself to be the greatest instrument or Teacher this earth had ever seen.

He taught his people on the mountainside, on the seaside, in their homes, synagogues and the temple. As he himself testified: “Day after day I used to sit in the temple teaching.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 26:55</a>.</p>

It is a fruit of God’s holy spirit, and he grants that spirit to his faithful dedicated people who ask for it.

Moreover, he graciously provides reliable guidelines that promote joy. By way of example, observe how wise sayings embodied in certain portions of the Bible book of Proverbs can produce deep joy. Indeed, if applied in life such counsel can cause us to “rejoice during all our days.”</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>Joy Within the Family</strong></p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 5.

For instance, Jehovah expects parents to do their best in training their children. In this the father is to take the lead, but the mother should share in it actively. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 31:1</a>) And what of the children? Well, a child “that holds a father in derision and that despises obedience to a mother” certainly will not fare well and will bring grief, not joy, to his or her parents. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 30:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 17:21</a>) On the other hand, wise sons and daughters who obediently accept the discipline given by godly parents and live in harmony with Scriptural principles bring joy and honor to a family.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Proverbs 10:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 15:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 23:15, 16</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 6, 7.

(b) The counsel to ‘buy truth and not sell it’ means what?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Godly parents who raise their children in a way that moves them to pursue a righteous course have reason for real joy. Concerning this we are told in the Scriptures: “Listen to your father who caused your birth, and do not despise your mother just because she has grown old. Buy truth itself and do not sell it​—wisdom and discipline and understanding. The father of a righteous one will without fail be joyful; the one becoming father to a wise one will also rejoice in him. Your father and your mother will rejoice, and she that gave birth to you will be joyful.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Proverbs 23:22-25</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> A wise child will heed his Christian father’s spiritual instruction and will not ignore what his godly mother says, even though she may have grown old. After all, a responsible adult can still learn something from his or her aged parents. The counsel to ‘buy truth and not sell it’ clearly means sticking to true principles as a guide in life. A righteously disposed child will not give up truth for pleasures, riches or honor. And surely a family in which all members cling to Jehovah will have abiding joy.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 10:20, 21</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span><strong>Maintaining Joy Despite Wrongdoers</strong></p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 8, 9.

For example, by using godly wisdom, we can find protection from wrongdoers. The Scriptures state: “When wisdom enters into your heart and knowledge itself becomes pleasant to your very soul, thinking ability itself will keep guard over you, discernment itself will safeguard you, to deliver you from the bad way, from the man speaking perverse things, from those leaving the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness, from those who are rejoicing in doing bad, who are joyful in the perverse things of badness.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:10-14</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Jehovah’s approval rests upon those who cherish true wisdom and let their hearts be influenced by it. They wisely avoid associating with anyone “speaking perverse things,” that is, things contrary to what is true and right. Proper thinking ability and true discernment furnish protection against those who reject godly wisdom, find pleasure in evil deeds and seek to corrupt others.​—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Proverbs 4:16</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">10. How does a bad man’s transgression ensnare him?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> The wrongdoer may ‘rejoice in doing bad,’ but who has real joy? Another proverb answers: “In the transgression of a bad man there is a snare, but he that is righteous cries out joyfully and is glad.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Proverbs 29:6</a>) Yes, a bad man’s transgression ensnares him. One sin may lead to another, and woes may come upon him unexpectedly. For example, he may plot the undoing of another, only to have his scheme boomerang on him. In ancient Israel, a false witness might seek the death of an innocent person by testifying against him falsely. But the schemer himself would be put to death if his plot was uncovered.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 19:16-21</a>.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">11. Why can the righteously inclined person ‘cry out joyfully’?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> How much better the lot of the righteous one! He neither schemes against his neighbor nor practices sin. Hence, he avoids being ensnared by transgression and does not suffer the troubles that attend wrongdoing or the penalty <span id="page16" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>that results from being discovered as a scheming wrongdoer. So the righteously inclined person “cries out joyfully and is glad.” For one thing, he is not plagued by a guilty conscience. Moreover, he enjoys God’s favor, “for the devious person is a detestable thing to Jehovah, but His intimacy is with the upright ones.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:32</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>Rejoice When a Foe Fares Badly?</strong></p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">12.

Why?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Yet, how should a Christian react if a foe happens to fare badly? “When your enemy falls,” says another proverb, “do not rejoice; and when he is caused to stumble, may your heart not be joyful.” Why? “That Jehovah may not see and it be bad in his eyes and he certainly turn back his anger from against him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Proverbs 24:17, 18</a>) This rules out what might be termed malicious joy when an enemy meets with some disaster. Since it would be wrong to wish calamity upon an enemy merely for personal satisfaction, an individual who did thus rejoice would have to account to Jehovah for his sin. For that matter, God can read the heart and therefore knows if we are secretly rejoicing over another person’s calamity. So, that wrong spirit, though concealed from fellow humans, is evident to Jehovah, who says: “Vengeance is mine, and retribution.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Hebrews 10:30</a>) Accordingly, God may punish the gloating one in some way.​—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:5</a>.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">13.

Well, righteous people generally are beloved and they make their neighbors happy. But no one is fond of “wicked ones.” A cruel person brings ostracism upon himself. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Proverbs 11:17</a>) Additionally, when the wicked die they are not mourned by people in general, and certainly there would be no sorrow when Jehovah destroys these wrongdoers. Rather, there would be joy because they had been removed from the scene. Are we conducting ourselves in a way that contributes to the joy or ‘elation’ of others?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>The Joyful Heart a Blessing</strong></p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">14.

Accepting God’s guidance protects us from the bad influence of wrongdoers and makes us joyful. Furthermore, adhering to Jehovah’s instructions keeps us from developing a wrong attitude toward any misfortunes of the wicked, and thus we are able to maintain joy. Yes, by obeying Jehovah God we will have a joyful heart. This in itself is a blessing.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">15. Rather than allowing “anxious care” to cause our heart to “bow down” with sadness, what should we do, and why?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> Wise King Solomon said: “A joyful heart has a good effect on the countenance, but because of the pain of the heart there is a stricken spirit.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:13</a>) Indeed, the emotions of joy and sorrow are reflected in a person’s countenance. Of course, there are many anxieties in life and these could make us very sad. “Anxious care in the heart of a man is what will cause it to bow down,” says another proverb, “but the good word is what makes it rejoice.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Proverbs 12:25</a>) So rather than permitting “anxious care” to cause our hearts to “bow down” with sadness, how wise it is to draw close to Jehovah by meditating on that storehouse of good things, <span id="page17" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>his inspired Word! Surely, this can bring joy back into a sad but righteous heart.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">16. (a) How does a good report ‘make the bones fat’?

Thus the whole body is invigorated, and a joy-filled heart is reflected when the eyes shine brightly. Whereas mental depression, or a ‘stricken spirit,’ has a bad effect physically, ‘a joyful heart is good medicine.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:22</a>; compare <em>The Amplified Bible.</em>) Obviously, though, a heart should not constantly be given over to senseless mirth, for Solomon “said to laughter: ‘Insanity!’ and to rejoicing: ‘What is this doing?’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 2:2</a>) However, a person certainly is benefited by a heart that rejoices in doing God’s will.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">17, 18. (a) Why can a loyal friend be likened to ‘oil and incense that make the heart rejoice’? (b) How has Jesus Christ been a straight-talking heavenly Friend? (c) What personal question is raised?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Pointing to something else that results in joy, another proverb says: “Oil and incense are what make the heart rejoice, also the sweetness of one’s companion due to the counsel of the soul.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Proverbs 27:9</a>) Just as oil is soothing and incense gives pleasure because of its sweet scent, a loyal friend who provides counsel with the aim of being helpful makes the recipient’s heart rejoice. There is sweetness in such friendship, for those who talk in a frank way can help each other to improve, to make corrections and to strengthen themselves in areas of life wherein they are weak. Indeed, having a good friend who thinks and talks straight can be a cause of joy.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> The glorified Jesus Christ is a straight-talking heavenly Friend who directed messages to the seven congregations mentioned in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Revelation, chapters two and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> three</a>. Commendation was offered when appropriate, but so was admonition. For instance, the congregation at Ephesus no longer had the fervor of Christian love for Jehovah that it had at its beginning.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Revelation 2:1-7</a>) Any Ephesian Christian who prayerfully considered the counsel of this heavenly Friend and took corrective measures could continue serving Jehovah with a joyful heart.

And active kingdom proclaimers often have such rewarding experiences and blessings in Jehovah’s service that they are moved to “cry out joyfully.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 90:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/31/1" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> Malachi 3:10</a>.</p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">20.

Moreover, some Christian families have found real satisfaction in serving where the need for kingdom proclaimers is great. Others have enjoyed full-time witnessing work during certain months of the year, while still others have been able to share regularly in the full-time ministry. With such earnest, wholehearted efforts Jehovah is well pleased.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Mark 12:29, 30</a>.</p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">21.

No, seeing the blessings and the growth of Jehovah’s organization makes me feel as did Caleb, after being preserved for more than forty-five years, through the wilderness sojourn and into the Promised Land. He said: ‘Yet I am today as strong as on the day of Moses’ sending me out. As my power was then, so my power is now.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982804/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Joshua 14:11</a>) Despite the inconveniences and hardships, these past years have been excellent training and preparation for the future.”</p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">22.

This involves work directly associated with the publishing of Bible literature and the advancement of kingdom interests. Those thus privileged serve either as part of the Watch Tower Society’s Bethel staffs in New York State, or with such families at branch office locations worldwide. One woman, who began her full-time service in Switzerland in January 1924 and now serves as a member of the Bethel family in the Federal Republic of Germany, wrote: “I wish to thank Jehovah for all his goodness toward me, letting me spend a happy and rich life filled with wonderful opportunities in his service.” Yes, she rejoices in Jehovah’s service.</p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">23.

Well, Jehovah protected some of his ancient servants physically​—in some cases to preserve the genealogical line leading to the promised Messiah. However, many other faithful men were imprisoned, tortured, and killed in devilish attempts to turn them away from faithfulness to God.

It is a place of shelter for them, a place of protection for them. Since it is a place of spiritual security, the people of the world cannot see it with their natural eyes, and, not having spiritual discernment, they cannot see that the dwellers therein are in that “secret place.”</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">19.

It was called to the attention of the world of mankind in the midst of World War II, in which the nations were battling over the question of who shall rule the earth, and some months before the United States of America became involved in that world struggle. At the international assembly of Jehovah’s Christian witnesses at St. Louis, Missouri, U.S.A., in the summer of 1941, the then president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society delivered the speech on the subject “Integrity.” In that speech to scores of thousands of conventioners, he stated and made clear that the issue before all creation was Universal Domination.​—See the leading article “Integrity,” published in the <em>Watchtower</em> issue of August 15, 1941, page 245, paragraph 19.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">20.

The world situation as well as Bible chronology marks this as the generation in which the Most High must once and for all time settle the age-long issue of Universal Domination or Universal Sovereignty. The ones occupying the “secret place of the Most High” are the ones who see the issue and have unequivocally come out in favor of His universal sovereignty and therefore maintain Christian neutrality toward the conflicts of the worldly nations for national sovereignty and domination of the earth. The nonpolitical dwellers in the “secret place of the Most High” could not enter and remain there unless they recognized and held fast to His universal sovereignty. They eagerly look forward to His vindicating of his universal sovereignty within this generation, in the “war of the great day of God the Almighty” at the symbolic place called Har–Magedon.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974884/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Rev. 16:13-16</a>.</p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">21. In the twentieth century B.C.E., what king was on the right side of the issue of universal sovereignty, and what patriarch did he bless and with what words?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> On Bible record Melchizedek, the king of Salem in the Middle East, was on the right side of the issue of universal sovereignty in the twentieth century before our Common Era. The short account written about him by the prophet Moses proves that. To the Universal Sovereign this ancient king ascribed the victory gained by the patriarch Abram (or Abraham) over the four invader kings from the land of Mesopotamia. To this effect, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974884/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Genesis 14:18-20</a> tells us: “And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine, and he was priest of the Most High God. Then he blessed him and said: ‘Blessed be Abram of the Most High God, Producer of heaven and earth; and blessed be the Most High God, who has delivered your oppressors into your hand!’ At that Abram gave him a tenth of everything.”</p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">22, 23. (a) How did Abram, immediately afterward, give public evidence of taking his stand on the side of the Universal Sovereign? (b) How did the Universal Sovereign act within his right, as recorded in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974884/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>?</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> By giving Melchizedek as the priest of the Producer of heaven and earth a tenth part of all the spoils of victory over the four marauder kings, Abram took his stand with priest-king Melchizedek on the side of the Universal Sovereign. In public evidence of this Abram swore in the name of the Universal Sovereign. This he did when restoring to the king of Sodom the properties that he, Abram, had recovered for him. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974884/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Genesis 14:21-24</a> informs us: “After that the king of Sodom said to Abram: ‘Give me the souls [the rescued people], but take the goods for yourself.’ At this Abram said to the king of Sodom: ‘I do lift up my hand in an oath to Jehovah the Most High God, Producer of heaven and earth, that, from a thread to a sandal lace, no, I shall take nothing from anything that is yours, in order that you may not say, <span id="page726" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="726" data-before-text="726"></span>“It was I who made Abram rich.” Nothing for me!’” The One in whose name Abram swore acted as the Universal Sovereign when he reserved for Abram’s descendants, the Israelites, the land in the Middle East that he had promised to Abraham. Says Moses on this:</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> “When the Most High gave the nations an inheritance, when he parted the sons of Adam from one another, he proceeded to fix the boundary of the peoples with regard for the number of the sons of Israel.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974884/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Deut. 32:8</a>.</p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">24.

So, when the angel Gabriel explained to the Jewish virgin, Mary, how she would miraculously become the mother of her firstborn son, who was to be called Jesus, he said to her: “Holy spirit will come upon you, and power of the Most High will overshadow you. For that reason also what is born will be called holy, God’s Son.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974884/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Luke 1:35</a>) And later that full-grown Son showed that he also recognized who was the Universal Sovereign when he said to his disciples: “Continue to love your enemies and to do good and to lend without interest, not hoping for anything back; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, because he is kind toward the unthankful and wicked.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974884/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Luke 6:35</a>.</p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">25.

The reasonable thing to do is to recognize His rightful sovereignty and be submissive, loyal and true to it, always acknowledging him as the Sovereign of one’s life.

But as long ago as the twentieth century before our Common Era, the Most High, the Producer of heaven and earth, called that fact to the attention of his earthly friend, the patriarch Abram. In the year before the birth of Abram’s son Isaac, the Most High by means of His angel spoke of himself as all-powerful. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974884/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Genesis 17:1, 2</a> tells us: “When Abram got to be ninety-nine years old, then Jehovah appeared to Abram and said to him: ‘I am God Almighty.

And I will give my covenant between me and you, that I may multiply you very, very much.’” He proved that nothing was impossible for him by miraculously giving to Abram and his aged wife their son Isaac, when they were both dead as far as reproducing children was concerned. He was a hundred years old and she ninety years old at Isaac’s birth.

Just think of being a guest of His in the “secret place of the Most High”! But today, we must remember, we are admitted into this intimacy only through the good offices of his most intimate heavenly Son, Jesus Christ. During the night before laying down his perfect human life as a sacrifice to God for our sins, Jesus said to his faithful apostles: “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974884/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">John 14:6</a>) So it is through him that we approach to the Loftiest One in all existence and acknowledge Him as the Universal Sovereign, our Sovereign to whom our lives and loving loyalty and devotion belong. In this way we procure for ourselves “lodging under the very shadow of the Almighty One.”</p><p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="qu">30, 31.

That such bird <span id="page728" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="728" data-before-text="728"></span>flight overhead denotes attention and protection is confirmed by what is said in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974884/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Isaiah 31:4, 5</a>: “In the same way Jehovah of armies will come down to wage war over Mount Zion and over her hill.

Their being “under the very shadow of the Almighty One” makes the “secret place” all the more secure for them. He being the Most High, everything else is beneath him, and nothing below can escape his almighty powers of vision. He can at once detect any movement on the part of anything or anyone below against those who are under his “very shadow.” Instantly he can come to the defense and preservation of his overshadowed ones who are lodging with him as spiritual guests. He as Host faithfully keeps his honor with regard to his responsibility toward those whom he entertains as his guests. How consoling this thought! Where else could we find real spiritual security?</p>

Really, we should have this in our minds all the time because we know that we are in the wicked world, but not part of it. So we live in Satan’s world and, being there, we surely need a place of refuge.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Refuge means a place of shelter or protection from danger or trouble, and the god of this world Satan the Devil has brought only trouble to this world since he started the trouble in the Garden of Eden. Job’s critic Eliphaz said: “For man himself is born for trouble.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/301975005/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 5:7</a>) However, to his faithful followers, Jesus said: “Do not let your hearts be troubled.

Jehovah has brought his people into the spiritual paradise since 1919 and has, in a wonderful way, cared for them. That does not mean, though, that no trouble or danger comes to them; it does. But when it does they understand why, and God’s Word shows them the way out.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/301975005/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/301975005/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 4:8, 9</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">We can be sure, if we stay close to Jehovah’s organization, study his Word and live by it, that we, along with God’s name people, Jehovah’s witnesses, will find refuge in Jehovah because “the name of Jehovah is a strong tower. Into it <span id="page261" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="261" data-before-text="261"></span>the righteous runs and is given protection.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/301975005/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Prov. 18:10</a>) A righteous man is a wise man, for he loves Jehovah’s Word. If we stay in God’s stronghold we stay there because we want to live, and with life we can praise Jehovah continually. Jehovah’s witnesses want only to do Jehovah’s will, and that they do with a sense of security, saying: “Because you said: ‘Jehovah is my refuge,’ you have made the Most High himself your dwelling; no calamity will befall you, and not even a plague will draw near to your tent.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/301975005/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 91:9, 10</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Is it not wonderful to know that you can make the Most High God “your dwelling,” and that you can continue to proclaim that to others? You can, because of your dedication to do Jehovah’s will, and by your doing it you are one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Jesus said that all of his disciples should preach and teach. This we happily do to help others to gain the spiritual security provided by God. By your preaching the good news of His kingdom, continue to let mankind know where they can dwell so as to make Jehovah their refuge and stronghold.</p>

However, birds are naturally cautious, skittish creatures, difficult to trap. Therefore, a birdcatcher in Bible times first carefully studied the peculiarities and habits of the type of birds he wished to ensnare. Then, he devised cunning methods to trap them. In likening Satan to a birdcatcher, the Bible helps us understand his methods. The Devil studies us as individuals. He notes our habits and characteristics and sets hidden traps in an attempt to catch us alive. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007726/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Timothy 2:26</a>) Being caught by him would mean our spiritual ruin and could lead to our ultimate destruction.

<strong>Freedom from Fear of Spiritual Dangers</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>THE MENACING “TRAP” OF THE “BIRDCATCHER”</strong></p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">14, 15. (a) What kind of language do we find in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Psalm 91:3</a>, and why? (b) What like illustration does David give in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Psalm 124</a>, and with application to whom?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> “For,” says the psalmist in detailing just how the things mentioned in the first two verses are true and realistic, “he himself will deliver you from the trap of the birdcatcher, from the pestilence causing adversities.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ps. 91:3</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> The language here is figurative, pictorial, for we are not literal birds in danger of the trap of a literal “birdcatcher.” But the likening of us to birds “under the very shadow of the Almighty One” is carried forward here. The psalmist David likens himself and his companions to birds that have actually been caught in the trap, but from which they have been delivered. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 124:1-8</a> he says: “Let Israel now say, ‘Had it not been that Jehovah proved to be for us when men rose up against us, then they would have swallowed us up even alive, . . . Blessed be Jehovah, who has not given us as a prey to their teeth. Our soul is like a bird that is escaped from the trap of baiters. The trap is broken, and we ourselves have escaped. Our help is in the name of Jehovah, the Maker of heaven and earth.’” In this case the “baiters” were not literal “birdcatchers,” and the “bird” that escaped from their broken trap was not a literal bird, but refers to “our soul,” the soul or life of the nation of Israel.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">16. How was there a modern fulfillment of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Psalm 124</a>, and is there danger of another “trap”?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> In fulfillment of that prophetic psalm, Jehovah God did break the trap in which the anointed remnant of spiritual Israel was caught. It was the trap sprung by Babylon the Great and her political, judicial, military accomplices. In the spring of the postwar year of 1919 Jehovah broke that trap for his repentant remnant and did not let the “baiters,” the symbolic birdcatchers, sink their teeth into the flesh of the trapped “bird.” Thereafter the escaped remnant of spiritual Israel were taken into the “secret place of the Most High,” and “under the very shadow of the <span id="page732" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="732" data-before-text="732"></span>Almighty One.” Yet a “trap” is still set for them by a “birdcatcher,” and Jehovah must deliver them from being caught in it.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">17. Who is the symbolic “fowler” or “birdcatcher” as pointed out in <em>Watch Tower</em> issues of 1904 and 1927?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Who, then, is that “birdcatcher,” and what is his “trap”? It has long been discerned and agreed to that the symbolic “birdcatcher” is Satan the Devil. Away back in the issue of March 1, 1904, of the <em>Watch Tower,</em> the article entitled “Under His Wings!” commented on <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Psalm 91:3</a> and said regarding “the snare of the fowler,” that this was “the deceptions of Satan, in which all those not protected shall stumble.” (Page 74, column 2) A much later issue of <em>The Watch Tower</em> agreed with that and said: “It seems certain that ‘the fowler’ here named by the prophet is the Devil, and that his snare consists of his methods employed, and by his organization, working in divers and numerous deceptive ways to entrap those who claim to be servants of the Most High God.” (Page 231, paragraph 37, of the <em>Watch Tower</em> issue of August 1, 1927, presenting the first of a series of three articles on <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalm 91</a>, <em>Authorized Version</em>) Of all the symbolic “fowlers” or “birdcatchers” referred to in the Bible, Satan the Devil is the outstanding one.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">18.

They keep peering, as when birdcatchers crouch down. They have set a ruinous trap. It is men that they catch.” How false prophets acted like birdcatchers in the apostate nation of Ephraim (the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel), <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Hosea 9:8</a> said: “As regards a prophet, there is the trap of a birdcatcher on all his ways.” The great “fowler” or “birdcatcher,” Satan the Devil, is out to catch men, those who are lodging “under the very shadow of the Almighty One.”</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">19.

The symbolic “trap” that Satan the Devil has set for those who trust in Jehovah God as their “refuge” and “stronghold” is the earthly organization that is opposed to God’s organization, namely, Satan’s visible organization. In it God’s great Adversary tries to catch Jehovah’s worshipers and to hold them as victims, to their spiritual ruin and ultimate destruction.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">20. (a) From when onward notably was it pointed out that God has an organization and that, if not belonging to it, one belongs to what? (b) According to direct statement, to which organization did Jesus and his disciples belong?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> Notably from the year 1922 onward it was pointed out from the inspired Scriptures that Jehovah God has an organization, including his organized “remnant” on earth, and that there is an enemy <span id="page733" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="733" data-before-text="733"></span>organization, Satan’s organization, with an invisible demonic part and a visible earthly part. It was pointed out that, if one does not belong to Jehovah’s visible organization, then one belongs to the Adversary’s organization. Jesus Christ, to whom <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Psalm 91</a> applies in the first instance, belonged to the organization of Jehovah God. His faithful disciples also belonged to that same divine organization. That was why, when leading his eleven faithful apostles in prayer, he said to God: “They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">John 17:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 16</a>) This, he said, was why the world hated them.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">John 15:18-20</a>.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">21, 22. (a) What is generally used as a lure into a trap, and what is the lure used by the Great Birdcatcher? (b) What did God inspire John to write against the deceptive bait?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> Usually a person or creature walks into a trap without knowing it. Generally, the trapper sets out some bait to lure the unsuspecting creature within range of the trap and to trigger the trap by nibbling at the bait. The “birdcatcher” Satan the Devil is a great Baiter. What bait does he use to lure people into his visible worldly organization, to become victimized in it as in a trap? The bait is the selfish attractions of this world, its promising opportunities for selfishly gaining wealth, fame, position and power. Warning against such deceptive bait, Jehovah God inspired the Christian apostle John to write to those lodging “under the very shadow of the Almighty One”:</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> “Do not be loving either the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him; because everything in the world​—the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one’s means of life—​does not originate with the Father, but originates with the world. Furthermore, the world is passing away and so is its desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">1 John 2:15-17</a>.</p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">23. (a) Why do we not want to become like Demas, mentioned in association with Paul? (b) Obedience to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Revelation 18:4</a> has brought us out of what “trap,” and into what place?</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> Now, nineteen hundred years after those words were penned by John, the traplike organization of Satan the Devil is very close to passing away forever. Those of us who have come out of Satan’s visible organization into the “secret place of the Most High,” why should we desire to be lured back into that doomed organization? We do not care to be like the onetime Christian Demas, concerning whom the apostle Paul in a final letter before his death said: “Demas has forsaken me because he loved the present system of things, and he has gone to Thessalonica.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">2 Tim. 4:10</a>) Religious Babylon the Great, including Christendom, has been caught and is held fast in the trap of Satan’s visible organization and will suffer early destruction with it. In obedience to God’s command in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Revelation 18:4</a> we have come out of Babylon the Great and out of Satan’s trap in which she is caught. By not going back to her, we can keep on enjoying the benefits of our deliverance from the “trap of the birdcatcher.” Under the “very shadow of the Almighty One” we have spiritual security.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="ss"><strong>“THE PESTILENCE CAUSING ADVERSITIES”</strong></p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">24, 25. (a) What does the psalmist associate with the birdcatcher’s trap, in the same verse? (b) What does this symbolize, and why appropriately so?</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> In the same verse, along with the “trap of the birdcatcher,” the psalmist mentions another potential threat to spiritual security, namely, a deadly epidemic disease that is very contagious, infectious. He says: “For he himself will deliver you from the trap of the birdcatcher, from the pestilence causing adversities.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Ps. 91:3</a>.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"><sup>25</sup></span> Like the birdcatcher’s “trap,” this <span id="page734" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="734" data-before-text="734"></span>adversity-causing “pestilence” is symbolic. Since the psalmist under inspiration associates the two together, the symbolic pestilence of today is something that goes along with the birdcatcher’s trap, that is to say, with Satan’s visible, earthly organization. This figurative “pestilence” is, in fact, bred, cultured, within that selfish, worldly organization. This infectious “pestilence” that rages like a tempest throughout the earth is nationalism.</p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">26. Since when has nationalism seized upon peoples, and what did historian Toynbee say recently about nationalism?</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"><sup>26</sup></span> Secular historians have noted the fact that, since World War I of 1914-1918 C.E., the spirit of nationalism has seized upon the peoples of the world. Quite naturally, this, because that war was fought by the Allies “for self-determination of peoples.” Said British historian Arnold Toynbee as recently as November 21, 1972:</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="si"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"></span>“Since the end of World War II nationalism has doubled the number of local sovereign independent states and has halved their average size. . . . Mankind’s strategic and hygienic problems are global and they are pressing; they cannot be solved by the governments of local states. They call for the establishment of a global authority endowed with overriding power. Mankind’s survival demands political unity, yet mankind’s present mood is increasingly divisive. Have we gone mad?”</p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">27. How has nationalism been like a “pestilence causing adversities”?</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"><sup>27</sup></span> Satan the Devil, whom Jesus Christ called “the ruler of this world,” is responsible for this wave of nationalism by means of which he has hoped to destroy those who have said to Jehovah: “You are my refuge and my stronghold, my God, in whom I will trust.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974885/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Ps. 91:2</a>) This political “pestilence” of nationalism has caused many and great “adversities.” Despite the establishment of the League of Nations in 1920, intensely nationalistic dictators have come forth, like Mussolini of Italy, Stalin of Russia, Hitler of Germany, the empire-minded political party of Japan, and so forth. So it furnished the driving force for World War II. It has fanned up fanatical patriotism, religiously fervent gestures to national symbols and emblems, military preparedness accompanied by burdensome taxation, international rivalries, insistence on national sovereignty rather than submission to Jehovah’s universal sovereignty and Messianic kingdom.</p><p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu">28. for whom has this “pestilence” caused special hardship, but on what issue have these not compromised?</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="28"><sup>28</sup></span> Not to speak of the adversities that all of this has caused for the human race in general, it has resulted in special hardships for Jehovah’s Christian witnesses. But the Almighty One has not let them become infected with the “pestilence” of nationalism and fall victim to its deadly effect upon Christian spirituality. They have not been lured nor pressured into worshiping the political “wild beast” bearing the number 666, nor its political “image,” the United Nations, the successor to the League of Nations.

<strong>Planting and Watering God’s Field</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Parts of Czechoslovakia were already occupied by the Nazis by the spring of 1938. That was when I received a telegram from the Society’s office in Switzerland instructing me to bring them the various records of the former Czechoslovakian branch without delay. In order to cross the border I had to get permission from the Nazi secret police who were being organized in the country at that time. I succeeded in getting the permit and took advantage of the opportunity to make a short visit to my mother and other relatives en route. Arriving and leaving during the <span id="page286" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="286" data-before-text="286"></span>night, I continued my journey to Switzerland. The very next day a squad of secret police descended on my family’s home and searched it from top to bottom looking for me. Certainly Jehovah God had delivered me from the “trap of the birdcatcher.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963328/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 91:3</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>TO A DISTANT FIELD</strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">In 1939 I was assigned to Brazil, far across the Atlantic. Three other brothers from Czechoslovakia traveled with me to the new field of service. At the port of Santos we were happy to see four of the brothers who worked at the branch office in Brazil. One of them spoke our language, and that helped a great deal. Since I did not know Portuguese, how was I going to help plant and water God’s field here? The brothers kindly provided me with a card bearing a short typed sermon. All I had to say at each door was, “Please read this!” Although I had difficulty with Portuguese, I began to arouse interest in God’s kingdom through the Society’s literature. I kept a record of the most interested ones, made return visits and began home Bible studies.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">After I had been in Brazil for a month I received an assignment to serve in Pôrto Alegre, in the far south of the country. A couple who had just arrived from Switzerland and another brother who had worked in Czechoslovakia accompanied me. However, problems arose. Due to opposition our supply of literature was cut off. But with only my Bible I was able to go on talking about Jehovah’s kingdom through Christ. As we continued to plant and water, God gave the increase. Two congregations sprouted in that section, one in the Brazilian city of Livramento and the other in Rivera, a city just across the border in Uruguay.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">After twenty-five months of restriction, Jehovah opened the door for me to continue in the blessed privilege of full-time service. When Brother Knorr, the Society’s president, visited Brazil in 1945 I was asked to report to the branch office as I was to serve as a special pioneer minister in Rio de Janeiro. Selling some things of value, I raised the needed money for my ticket and soon arrived safe and sound in my new assignment. After six months I succeeded in getting a permanent residence visa, thus having the guarantee of remaining in Brazil. I was then able to carry on my ministry from house to house in a better organized way than back in 1939.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Jehovah continued to enlarge my privileges as I entered the circuit work in 1949. In 1955 I was called to serve in the Brazilian branch office, where, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, I enjoy the companionship of more than twenty-five brothers who are unreservedly dedicated to doing the divine will. In addition to my duties here I find great happiness in working closely with the local congregation of Jehovah’s people.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="ss"><strong>HARVEST IS GREAT</strong></p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">I am very grateful to Jehovah that the sowing work has yielded fine fruit here in Brazil. Back in 1939 there were only 114 Kingdom publishers in the country. Today more than 26,000 are sharing in the planting and watering!</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">I think back over forty-two years of service to Jehovah and am glad that I have always accepted each assignment gratefully. A physical handicap prevents me from doing all that I would like to right now, but I am convinced that the one thing I want to do is serve Jehovah and his King, Christ Jesus, forever.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"></p>

With them a bird covers its young, protecting them from predators. Like mere fledglings, we are secure under Jehovah’s figurative pinions because we have taken refuge in his true Christian organization.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001844/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ruth 2:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001844/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Psalm 5:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001844/24/2" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> 11</a>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 8.

<strong>Be Joyful With the Kingdom Hope!</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Brother Gerrit Lösch, a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses, rounded out the spiritual program by speaking on the subject “On and Under Jehovah’s Wings.” He explained how God’s protection and support of his faithful servants are illustrated Biblically by the wings of the eagle. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001445/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:11, 12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001445/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Psalm 91:4</a>) The adult eagle sometimes spreads out its wings for hours in order to shield its offspring. At times, a mother eagle may even wrap her wings around her offspring to protect them from cold winds. In a similar way and in harmony with his purpose, Jehovah can come to the aid of his faithful servants, particularly when they face spiritual trials. Jehovah does not allow his servants to be tempted beyond what they can bear but makes the way out for them to be able to endure it. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001445/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>) Brother Lösch concluded by saying: “In order to remain spiritually protected, we must remain under the wings of Jehovah. This means that we must not develop a spirit of independence. Let us always stay close to Jehovah and his motherlike organization, not separating ourselves from their direction and loving counsel.”</p>

<strong>Take Comfort in Jehovah’s Strength</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">When the gusting winds of adversity begin to howl, and the merciless rain and hail of distress keep pounding, God is ready to provide consoling protection. This is how one of the psalms describes him as providing comforting shelter: “With his pinions he will block approach to you, and under his wings you will take refuge.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000281/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Psalm 91:4</a>) The image here may be that of an eagle. It is a picture of a bird that senses danger and then protectively spreads its wings over its young. In an even greater sense, Jehovah becomes a true Protector for all who find refuge in him.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000281/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Psalm 7:1</a>.</p>

Thus the bird can keep away all predators from its young. We, too, like helpless fledglings, can take cover under the outspread pinions of the protective symbolic bird, Jehovah God, and there we can rejoice in our spiritual security. It is just as the psalmist David said to Jehovah: “All those taking refuge in you will rejoice; to time indefinite they will cry out joyfully. And you will block approach to them, and those loving your name will exult in you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974925/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 5: superscription, 1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974925/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 11</a>) Being blocked from getting near us, those desiring to do us spiritual harm cannot do so.

How beautifully this was illustrated in the case of the Moabitess Ruth, who forsook the false gods of Moab, and went with her widowed mother-in-law Naomi to Israel! In appreciation, Boaz, who later became Ruth’s husband, said to her: “May Jehovah reward the way you act, and may there come to be a perfect wage for you from Jehovah the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to seek refuge.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974925/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ruth 2:12</a>) As a reward to her, Jehovah chose Ruth as wife of Boaz, to contribute to the ancestry of Jesus Christ.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974925/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 1:5-25</a>.</p>

They “fall” in spiritual death because they are not in Jehovah’s place of spiritual security. Hence, they are exposed to the spiritually death-dealing things described by the psalmist, the dreadful thing of earth’s night, the flying arrow of the day, the gloom-infesting pestilence, the “destruction that despoils at midday.” They have not really made God their strong “refuge.”</p><p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu">27.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974925/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Ps. 98:1</a>) So those to whom we have had to offer the stronger spiritual resistance because of their greater religious strength fall victim because they are not proof against worldliness, modernism, antireligious propaganda, popular theology and demon-inspired religious doctrines and practices. They are not immunized by the help of God’s spirit.</p><p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="qu">28.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974925/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Rev. 7:9-17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974925/40/1" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> John 10:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974925/40/2" data-bid="41-3" class="b"> Matt. 25:31-46</a>) Jehovah has been raising these up as companions of the remnant notably since the year 1935.

But to those standing in God’s place of spiritual security, “to you it will not come near.” Since the postwar year of 1919 C.E., the remnant have accepted the spiritual healing provided by the Great Physician, Jehovah God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974925/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Ps. 103:1-3</a>) But not so Christendom, as foretold in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974925/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Isaiah 6:9-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974925/42/1" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> Matthew 13:14, 15</a>. Consequently, Christendom’s more than a thousand million members succumb to the spiritually ruinous influences and pressures of this disease-ridden world. But God has immunized his remnant and the “great crowd” of their Christian companions. To their place of spiritual immunity God does not let the worldly contagion draw near. Their obediently staying in God’s “secret place” keeps them safe, well.</p>

God could well accomplish his purposes by other means. But Jehovah God simply has not chosen to do so. He also could have created everything himself, even as by himself he brought forth his only-begotten Son, the Word, later to be known as Jesus Christ. But God chose to let his Son serve as the active agent in the creation of all other creatures and things, thereby giving his Son much pleasure as well as receiving joy himself as he noted his Son’s dutiful course. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Prov. 8:22-30</a>) This wise course Jehovah also pursued with the angels. They are not indispensable, <span id="page59" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="59" data-before-text="59"></span>but God has seen fit to create them for the purpose of giving them happiness and to serve his purposes in carrying out his will for them.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">For one thing, angels are shown as ministering to God: “There were a thousand thousands that kept ministering to him.” Repeatedly they are pictured as being in his presence: “Seraphs were standing above him.” “I heard a voice of many angels around the throne.” Often they were sent to bring good news to man, thus serving as evangelists, as when they announced the birth of the Savior. God used angels to communicate his will to such of his servants as Abraham, Moses, Joshua, Daniel, Peter, Paul and others. And in that their messages became part of God’s written Word, they contributed toward the writing of the Bible.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Dan. 7:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Isa. 6:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/25/2" data-bid="26-3" class="b"> Rev. 5:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/25/3" data-bid="26-4" class="b"> Luke 2:13</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Note also God’s use of angels in the life of Jesus. Angels announced his conception and birth. They ministered to him after his forty-day fast and strengthened him in his final trial. When the mob came to arrest him, twelve legions of angels were at his call had he chosen to ask for them. Angels also announced his resurrection and were present at his ascension into heaven.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Matt. 4:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Luke 22:43;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/26/2" data-bid="27-3" class="b"> Matt. 26:53;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/26/3" data-bid="27-4" class="b"> 28:5-7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/26/4" data-bid="27-5" class="b"> Acts 1:10, 11</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Angels are further shown as accompanying Jesus Christ when he comes for judgment, separating the wheat from the weeds and the sheep from the goats. Angels joined with Michael in his war on the dragon and his demons at the time of the birth of God’s kingdom in heaven. They will also support Michael in fighting the war of the great day of God the Almighty, Armageddon, even as in times of old they were used by Jehovah God to execute the wicked.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Matt. 13:41;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 25:31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/27/2" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> Rev. 12:7-10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/27/3" data-bid="28-4" class="b"> 16:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/27/4" data-bid="28-5" class="b"> 16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/27/5" data-bid="28-6" class="b"> 19:14</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">And finally, God’s spirit messengers minister to his servants on earth today, which is a most comforting thought: “Are they not all spirits for public service, sent forth to minister for those who are going to inherit salvation?” “Do not despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that their angels in heaven always have access to my Father who is in heaven.” Not necessarily that each one of God’s faithful servants has an angel assigned to him; but that one angel is assigned to a number of God’s servants on earth.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Heb. 1:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> Matt. 18:10</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Yes, “the angel of Jehovah is encamping all around those fearing him and he rescues them.” “He will give his own angels a command concerning you, to guard you in all your ways.” True, angels do not appear visibly the way they did to the apostles to deliver them from prison and the way one appeared to Paul when he was shipwrecked. But we may rest assured that, regardless of the odds against us, regardless of how many foes press in upon us, had we spiritual vision we could see surrounding and protecting us armies of God’s spirit messengers, even as they protectingly surrounded the prophet Elisha and his servant when the king of Syria dispatched a heavy military force, including horses and war chariots, to capture Elisha.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ps. 34:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 91:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/29/2" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> Acts 5:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/29/3" data-bid="30-4" class="b"> 12:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/29/4" data-bid="30-5" class="b"> 27:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/29/5" data-bid="30-6" class="b"> 2 Ki. 6:13-17</a>.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Truly, what God’s Word has to say about his spirit messengers, the angels, is both enlightening and faith-strengthening.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sd">Oh the depth of God’s riches and wisdom and knowledge!

<strong>The Place of God’s Word in Our Lives</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> If you are observing the commandments of God and carrying on the work of bearing witness to Jesus, you can be certain that the dragon Satan the Devil is waging a war of attrition upon you and is maneuvering to change you from being a true Christian or to wipe you out. Take <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951443/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Revelation 12:17</a> as the absolute truth for it. What a consolation and encouragement it is to realize that we have still mightier angelic protection! Mighty forces of destruction are held in restraint by angels until the last of the spiritual Israelites, the slaves of God, are sealed with his final approval and also until the “great crowd” of fellow worshipers of God are gathered out and brought under the care of the Right Shepherd Jesus Christ. As John foresaw it: “After this I saw four angels standing upon the four extremities of the earth, holding tight the four winds of the earth, that no wind might blow upon the <span id="page369" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="369" data-before-text="369"></span>earth or upon the sea or upon any tree.” Till when? “Until after we have sealed the slaves of our God in their foreheads.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951443/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Rev. 7:1-4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951443/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 9-17</a>, <em>NW</em>) So the remnant of these sealed slaves of God and the great crowd of their fellow witnesses out of all nations are an object of high concern to the angels. We get the benefit of their care.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">14. According to the psalmist, who is it that encamps round about us, and why?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Now the dragon Satan the Devil is concentrating his bitter warfare upon the remnant and their fellow witnesses. For this time the blessed assurance was written and preserved: “This poor man cried, and Jehovah heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles. The angel of Jehovah encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951443/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 34:6, 7</a>, <em>AS</em>) True, there is a great encampment of visible enemies round about us, backed by the invisible dragon and his demons. But we have faith to believe we have encamped about us invisibly the angel of Jehovah who defeated the dragon and his demons in the war in heaven and who now holds them underfoot here at the earth before he crushes them at Armageddon. Were it not for this superior angelic protection, the remnant of spiritual Israelites and their faithful fellow worshipers would have been overwhelmed and wiped out before now, in order to halt their bearing witness to Jehovah and his King Jesus Christ.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu">15. Of what responsibility as to personal welfare does this angelic guardianship not relieve us, and how was this shown in Jesus’ case?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> We have approached God’s kingdom now established on the heavenly Mount Zion, and also “myriads of angels, in general assembly”. We have the satisfying evidence of their help and protection. In what way? In that the visible organization of Jehovah’s servants is preserved amid an embattled world and our Kingdom witness prospers. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951443/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Heb. 12:22, 23</a>, <em>NW</em>) This angelic guardianship, however, does not relieve us of being just as careful as we can, to guard against accidents. We cannot expect the angels to protect us against our own carelessness, rashness and foolhardiness. In the midst of wolves, we are instructed to be as cautious as serpents and to beware of men. We must not test God too far with what is unreasonable. The Devil quoted a Scriptural truth, when he said to Jesus at the temptation in the wilderness: “He will give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.” But this was no basis for the Devil to suggest that Jesus defy the known laws of gravity and hurl himself from the high temple battlement and force God to save his Son by means of the angels. That was unreasonable and contrary to other scriptures. It was a tempting of God or putting him to the test beyond what he had really promised. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951443/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 91:11, 12</a>, <em>AS;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951443/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Matt. 4:5-7</a>, <em>NW</em>) So with us today, who are God’s children, but not nearly as important as Jesus. While we have angelic protection for the sake of God’s work and cause, yet we dare not put God to the test with irrational actions and carelessness and expect his angels to keep us from harm and accident in spite of it.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>A BOOK FOR CONSULTATION AND ADVICE</strong></p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">16. In view of our having what may we not expect miraculous intervention in deciding our problems, and why not?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> We are therefore not to look for miraculous intervention by these innumerable holy angels to help us decide what is God’s will in personal matters and problems. God has given us his written Word, and he provided it for us to consult. If we do not consult it, it will not serve us as a guide. In his Word he reveals himself to us. He opens up his mind and heart to us, telling us what he thinks, what he has already done and is now doing and will yet <span id="page370" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="370" data-before-text="370"></span>do, and informing us what he would like us to do in order to gain his favor and the gift of eternal life in his new world. We need his Word, because in our flesh it is impossible for us to see him. He makes known to us that his name is Jehovah, meaning the One who causes to be; and he shows us his attributes of wisdom, justice, power and love and how all four attributes work together without clash. So the only way we definitely know about him is by his written Word. Getting to know him through the Word we learn to develop confidence in Him and to respect his advice and to see that his commands are authoritative. We build up faith that his Word is right and without mistake or misdirection. This makes us consult it in our problems and take its advice.</p>

<strong>Vision of the “Time of the End”</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> In a miniature way many prophecies received partial fulfillment when Israel returned after the 70-year desolation. Thousands made their long journey back over the rough roads from Babylon to Jerusalem, <span id="page402" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="402" data-before-text="402"></span>and amidst very troublous times they rebuilt the city and temple and repaired the walls which had fallen down. Jehovah directed and blessed that return. He even disclosed information for the comfort of Daniel by one of his angels. “At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment went forth, and I am come to tell thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore consider the matter, and understand the vision.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951484/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Dan. 9:23</a>, <em>AS</em>) It is thrilling to learn how Jehovah uses some of his angels. “And I heard a man’s voice between the banks of the Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951484/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Dan. 8:16</a>, <em>AS</em>) This same Gabriel was appointed to express Jehovah’s purpose concerning the birth of the Son of God to Mary. “In her sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent forth from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin promised in marriage to a man named Joseph of David’s house; and the name of the virgin was Mary.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951484/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 1:26, 27</a>, <em>NW</em>) Truly this use of angelic messengers to connect earth and heaven constituted a marvelous means of communication.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 7. Why can it be said that today also there is in operation such a marvelous method of communication?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> It is also a fact that in these last days the angels are used invisibly to care for the same sacred service. “For he will give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951484/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 91:11</a>, <em>AS</em>) How beautifully this is portrayed for us in the dream given to Jacob the chosen servant of God! “And he dreamed; and, behold, a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven; and, behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it. And, behold, Jehovah stood above it, and said, I am Jehovah, the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951484/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gen. 28:12, 13</a>, <em>AS</em>) And the Lord Jesus promised Nathaniel he would see a like thing. “He further said to him: ‘Most truly I say to you men, You will see heaven opened up and the angels of God ascending and descending to the Son of man.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951484/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">John 1:51</a>, <em>NW</em>) Yes, Jehovah commissioned angels to attend to the King’s commands in those days, and so, too, now: “But when he again brings his Firstborn into the inhabited earth, he says: ‘And let all God’s angels worship him.’ Also with reference to the angels he says: ‘And he makes his angels spirits, and his public servants a flame of fire.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951484/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Heb. 1:6, 7</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>GENTILE TIMES ENDED</strong></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 8.

Powerful Gentile kingdoms have ruled on earth and over God’s people since 607 B.C., as was indicated to Israel’s king: “And thou, O deadly wounded wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day is come, in the time of the iniquity of the end, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Remove the mitre, and take off the crown; this shall be no more the same; exalt that which is low, and abase that which is high. I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: this also shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951484/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ezek. 21:25-27</a>, <em>AS</em>) This period of time stretches for 2,520 years, from 607 B.C. to A.D. 1914. Throughout those many centuries God’s nation never had a king of David’s line ruling on the throne, for the crown was reserved for him whose right it is, namely, God’s anointed King, Christ Jesus. “Yet I have set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.

<strong>Part 2—Spiritual Gems From the Christian Greek Scriptures</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Consider Jesus’ encounter with his Adversary, Satan, recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985848/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matthew 4:3-11</a>. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985848/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Mt 4 verse 4</a> Jesus counters Satan’s first temptation by saying: “It is written, ‘Man must live, not on bread alone, but on every utterance coming forth through Jehovah’s mouth.’” The reference indicates that Jesus was here quoting a scripture, found in our Bibles in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985848/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>. Satan presented Jesus with a second temptation, trying to support it by asserting: “It is written, ‘He will give his angels a charge concerning you, and they will carry you on their hands, that you may at no time strike your foot against a stone.’” Where did Satan find those words? The marginal reference directs the student to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985848/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Psalm 91:11, 12</a>. Yes, Satan was quoting scripture, acting as “an angel of light.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985848/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 11:14</a>) Jesus replied, “Again it is written, ‘You must not put Jehovah your God to the test.’” This also was a scripture quotation, but correctly applied. From where was it quoted? The marginal reference points us to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985848/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:16</a>.

<strong>The Spiritual Security Provided for Us by God</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> For example, in the year 29 of our Common Era, God’s great Adversary applied <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974884/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps 91 verses eleven and twelve</a> to a certain man in the Middle East. Satan the Devil, the Tempter, was out to wreck the spirituality of this man, deceptively by the misuse of God’s own inspired Word. In those <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974884/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">verses 11, 12 of Psalm 91</a> the Tempter worked in the idea of physical security. He argued that especially a “son of God” would have such personal bodily protection and safeguarding. In proof of this to the Devil and to the Jewish people, the man should hurl himself down from the battlement of the temple at Jerusalem and let the angels carry him gently to the temple pavement against the laws of gravitation. This would be like a “sign from heaven.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Of all persons, this <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974884/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 91</a> should fit this man who had recently been anointed with God’s spirit to be the Messiah, the Christ. So the Devil schemed what he thought was a real temptation for this man anointed of God. But the man, Jesus Christ, saw through the trick, saw the wrong thrust given to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974884/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 91:11, 12</a>.

<strong>Benefits and Rewards from Being Spiritually Secure</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> The “ways” that we, as worshipers of Jehovah God, take lie amid this worldly system of things of which Satan the Devil is “the god.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974926/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:4</a>) Hence, it might be expected that the earthly agents of this false god would place in our path figurative stones for Jehovah’s worshipers to trip over to a disastrous fall. But with reference to such causes for stumbling the psalmist speaks further about Jehovah’s angels, saying: “Upon their hands they will carry you, that you may not strike your foot against any stone.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974926/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 91:12</a>.</p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">14. In the first century of our Common Era, what proved to be “a stone to strike against” for the nation of fleshly Israel, and why?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> This means that these heavenly angels will sustain us, support us, so that we are not affected by such a “stone.” Back in the first century of our Common Era the apostate Israelites, “both the houses of Israel,” did not have such angelic assistance against stumbling into spiritual ruin. They stumbled over Jehovah’s true Messiah, Jesus Christ, who was to them “a stone to strike against” and “a rock over which to stumble,” as foretold in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974926/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Isaiah 8:14</a>. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974926/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:7, 8</a>) Their rejection of Jesus as the Messiah has hurt the circumcised Jewish people spiritually to this very day. However, this is not the “stone” spoken of in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974926/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Psalm 91:12</a>.</p><p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu">15.

This is unlike the Messianic “stone” of the first century, which, if accepted by the Jewish nation, would serve for their continued favor with God. But back there the nationalistic Jews followed false Messiahs not from God. Looking forward also to our time, Jesus Christ warned his disciples against false Messiahs or Christs in this “conclusion of the system of things.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974926/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matt. 24:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974926/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974926/24/2" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> 23-26</a>) True to prediction, these “false Christs” have risen up, not particularly in the form of individual men, but in political and economic systems to whom Messianic powers have been ascribed and through which Messianic blessings were expected. For example, as when Nikita Khrushchev promised that Russian Communism of his brand would establish paradise for the people. And how could we ever forget that, in December of 1918, the Federal Council of the Churches of <span id="page762" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="762" data-before-text="762"></span>Christ in America hailed the proposed League of Nations as “the political expression of the Kingdom of God on earth”?</p><p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="qu">16.

When, in November of 1939, they came out publicly in adherence to Christian “neutrality” toward all worldly controversies, this fortified them in their already chosen course of refusal of military conscription, in peacetime as well as wartime. Dictators in political government rose up after World War I, such as Adolf Hitler who aimed at reestablishing the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation for a thousand years. But Jehovah’s Christian witnesses never yielded to such dictators as taking the place of Jehovah’s true Messiah, Jesus Christ. In times of test regarding the supremacy of the law of the Most High God, they have taken up the words of Christ’s apostles and have said to politicians, judges and police: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974926/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Acts 5:29</a>) Thanks to Jehovah’s angels, not even “any stone” like bans and proscriptions against them and their preaching of God’s kingdom has caused His worshipers to stumble and fall.</p>

<strong>The Place of God’s Word in Our Lives</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> If you are observing the commandments of God and carrying on the work of bearing witness to Jesus, you can be certain that the dragon Satan the Devil is waging a war of attrition upon you and is maneuvering to change you from being a true Christian or to wipe you out. Take <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951443/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Revelation 12:17</a> as the absolute truth for it. What a consolation and encouragement it is to realize that we have still mightier angelic protection! Mighty forces of destruction are held in restraint by angels until the last of the spiritual Israelites, the slaves of God, are sealed with his final approval and also until the “great crowd” of fellow worshipers of God are gathered out and brought under the care of the Right Shepherd Jesus Christ. As John foresaw it: “After this I saw four angels standing upon the four extremities of the earth, holding tight the four winds of the earth, that no wind might blow upon the <span id="page369" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="369" data-before-text="369"></span>earth or upon the sea or upon any tree.” Till when? “Until after we have sealed the slaves of our God in their foreheads.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951443/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Rev. 7:1-4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951443/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 9-17</a>, <em>NW</em>) So the remnant of these sealed slaves of God and the great crowd of their fellow witnesses out of all nations are an object of high concern to the angels. We get the benefit of their care.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">14. According to the psalmist, who is it that encamps round about us, and why?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Now the dragon Satan the Devil is concentrating his bitter warfare upon the remnant and their fellow witnesses. For this time the blessed assurance was written and preserved: “This poor man cried, and Jehovah heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles. The angel of Jehovah encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951443/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 34:6, 7</a>, <em>AS</em>) True, there is a great encampment of visible enemies round about us, backed by the invisible dragon and his demons. But we have faith to believe we have encamped about us invisibly the angel of Jehovah who defeated the dragon and his demons in the war in heaven and who now holds them underfoot here at the earth before he crushes them at Armageddon. Were it not for this superior angelic protection, the remnant of spiritual Israelites and their faithful fellow worshipers would have been overwhelmed and wiped out before now, in order to halt their bearing witness to Jehovah and his King Jesus Christ.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu">15. Of what responsibility as to personal welfare does this angelic guardianship not relieve us, and how was this shown in Jesus’ case?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> We have approached God’s kingdom now established on the heavenly Mount Zion, and also “myriads of angels, in general assembly”. We have the satisfying evidence of their help and protection. In what way? In that the visible organization of Jehovah’s servants is preserved amid an embattled world and our Kingdom witness prospers. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951443/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Heb. 12:22, 23</a>, <em>NW</em>) This angelic guardianship, however, does not relieve us of being just as careful as we can, to guard against accidents. We cannot expect the angels to protect us against our own carelessness, rashness and foolhardiness. In the midst of wolves, we are instructed to be as cautious as serpents and to beware of men. We must not test God too far with what is unreasonable. The Devil quoted a Scriptural truth, when he said to Jesus at the temptation in the wilderness: “He will give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.” But this was no basis for the Devil to suggest that Jesus defy the known laws of gravity and hurl himself from the high temple battlement and force God to save his Son by means of the angels. That was unreasonable and contrary to other scriptures. It was a tempting of God or putting him to the test beyond what he had really promised. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951443/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 91:11, 12</a>, <em>AS;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951443/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Matt. 4:5-7</a>, <em>NW</em>) So with us today, who are God’s children, but not nearly as important as Jesus. While we have angelic protection for the sake of God’s work and cause, yet we dare not put God to the test with irrational actions and carelessness and expect his angels to keep us from harm and accident in spite of it.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>A BOOK FOR CONSULTATION AND ADVICE</strong></p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">16. In view of our having what may we not expect miraculous intervention in deciding our problems, and why not?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> We are therefore not to look for miraculous intervention by these innumerable holy angels to help us decide what is God’s will in personal matters and problems. God has given us his written Word, and he provided it for us to consult. If we do not consult it, it will not serve us as a guide. In his Word he reveals himself to us. He opens up his mind and heart to us, telling us what he thinks, what he has already done and is now doing and will yet <span id="page370" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="370" data-before-text="370"></span>do, and informing us what he would like us to do in order to gain his favor and the gift of eternal life in his new world. We need his Word, because in our flesh it is impossible for us to see him. He makes known to us that his name is Jehovah, meaning the One who causes to be; and he shows us his attributes of wisdom, justice, power and love and how all four attributes work together without clash. So the only way we definitely know about him is by his written Word. Getting to know him through the Word we learn to develop confidence in Him and to respect his advice and to see that his commands are authoritative. We build up faith that his Word is right and without mistake or misdirection. This makes us consult it in our problems and take its advice.</p>

<strong>Benefits and Rewards from Being Spiritually Secure</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Near the end of the year 32 C.E., Jesus Christ sent out seventy disciples as evangelizers of God’s Messianic kingdom. Evidently speaking in symbolic language to them, he said: “Look! I have given you the authority to trample underfoot serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing will by any means do you hurt.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974926/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Luke 10:19</a>) Similarly, in a symbolic sense, the psalmist now says to the class that has made Jehovah its dwelling: “Upon the young lion and the cobra you will tread; you will trample down the maned young lion and the big snake.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974926/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ps. 91:13</a>.</p><p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="qu">18.

So, too, powerful political states have resorted to legislative action that names the victim. They have openly passed laws aimed at Jehovah’s witnesses. Or they have applied nationalistic laws against these. With what purpose? To devour them, to assimilate them, to make them religiously subservient to the State, making them a national religious institution, torn apart from the worldwide body of Jehovah’s witnesses that is ruled from God down. Loyal witnesses of Jehovah have turned down such a totalitarian, State-controlled arrangement. Theocratically they have held firmly to God’s Rule!</p><p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="qu">19. How, figuratively, has “the cobra” been trodden down?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> Unlike the young lion, the cobra strikes in the dark from a place of concealment. It is dangerous, like a “serpent by the roadside,” to which the tribe of Dan was compared and which “bites the heels of the horse.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974926/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Gen. 49:16, 17</a>) Venomous, unsuspected attacks like those of the cobra have been made upon the intentionally victimized witnesses of Jehovah as they carry on their public work of proclaiming God’s kingdom from house to house, even in lands where State religions hold power. Hiding behind the State <span id="page763" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="763" data-before-text="763"></span>as executioner for them, clergymen of Christendom have made covert attacks upon Jehovah’s witnesses through the politicians, the lawmakers, the police authorities and the judges of law courts. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974926/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ps. 94:20</a>) But as respects Jehovah’s witnesses, they have not been paralyzed with fear by the venom of the unfair attacks. They have remained law abiding and have peacefully applied to the law courts for their constitutional rights, appealing to the Bill of Rights granted by the State. To the highest courts of the land they have carried their legal fight for establishing and defending by law freedom of religion and the right to preach God’s kingdom. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974926/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Phil. 1:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974926/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 16</a>) Victory has often crowned their efforts!</p><p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu">20.

When their literature has been banned they have kept pressing forward in their Scriptural work of making disciples of Christ by using just the Bible alone in their witnessing work. Disciples have resulted!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974926/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>.</p><p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu">21.

They walk right on, obeying the Most High God as Sovereign Ruler rather than lionlike men or lionlike man-made organizations. They render to lionlike Caesar only what belongs to Caesar and in no way holding back anything that belongs to God, giving to him <em>all</em> the things belonging to Him.

<strong>Name</strong><br/><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">This clearly shows that the only ones truly knowing God’s name are those who are his obedient servants. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003177/73/0" data-bid="74-1" class="b">1Jo 4:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003177/73/1" data-bid="74-2" class="b"> 5:2, 3</a>.)

Thus the name represents God himself. That is why the proverb says: “The name of Jehovah is a strong tower.

<strong>Can You Know God by Name?</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">While <em>addressing</em> Jehovah by name is important, truly <em>knowing</em> him by name involves more. Regarding an individual who loves him and trusts in him, Jehovah promises: “I shall protect him because he has come to know my name.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010482/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 91:14</a>) Clearly, knowing God’s name must embrace a wealth of meaning, since it is a key factor in receiving God’s protection. What, then, would be required for you to know Jehovah by name?</p>

<strong>Jehovah Is Our Refuge</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> Concerning the true worshiper, the psalmist represents God as saying: <em>“Because on me he has set his affection, I shall also provide him with escape.

We take refuge in Jehovah as his worshipers especially because ‘we have set our affection on him.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001844/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Mark 12:29, 30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001844/56/1" data-bid="57-2" class="b"> 1 John 4:19</a>) In turn, God ‘provides us with escape’ from our enemies.

<strong>Is the Name Really Important?</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Then, regarding God’s name, the <em>Dictionary</em> states: “Yahweh, therefore, in contrast with Elohim [God], is a proper noun, the name of a Person, though that Person is divine. As such, it has its own ideological setting; it presents God as a Person, and so brings him into relationship with other, human, personalities . . . , and he speaks to the Patriarchs as one friend to another.”</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">So the only way anyone can come near to God and have a personal relationship with him is by knowing him by his name, Yahweh, or Jehovah, and by learning to use that name respectfully in worshiping him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982002/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 17:26</a>) Indeed, such ones will ‘come under his influence and protection,’ for Jehovah himself said, “I shall protect him because he has come to know my name.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982002/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 91:14</a>.</p>

But the Most High God appreciates the true love of even earthly creatures of His.

They are commanded to love him, but they love him because he first loved them and expressed this love through his only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ.

So right at the start of the following year, readers of <em>The Watch Tower</em> were confronted with the challenging question, “Who Will Honor Jehovah?” this being the title of the leading article published in the magazine issue of January 1, 1926.</p><p id="p72" data-pid="72" class="qu">28.

To advertise the divine name still further, on March 1, 1939, some months before World War II broke out, the official magazine of the Witnesses came forth with the new legend, “The Watchtower Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom.” And now, as the critical year of 1975 enters, it may well be asked: Has the Most High God of prophecy made a name for himself?

Peter, as well as Joel, whom Peter quoted, referred to the heavenly Jerusalem, the heavenly Zion, which is a symbol of God’s kingdom by his Christ. We must therefore seek the now established kingdom of Almighty God and his Christ. Only on its side and under it can we be among the survivors.</p><p id="p116" data-pid="116" class="qu">52. According to Joel, those doing what will get away safe, and what does the doing of this today mean?</p><p id="p59" data-pid="59" data-rel-pid="[116]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="52"><sup>52</sup></span> The prophet Joel, whom Peter quoted, said concerning these days before the “coming of the great and fear-inspiring day of Jehovah,” that “everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will get away safe.” As we obey the prophet Zephaniah’s words to “seek Jehovah,” we must also do as Joel said, ‘call upon the name of Jehovah.’ Then we shall get away safe during the universal war of the great day. This now requires us to call on Jehovah through his reigning King Jesus Christ. It also means calling out Jehovah’s name publicly, just as his witnesses are doing in all nations, from city to city and from house to house, by word of mouth and by printed page. His name will be glorified by his kingdom, and his kingdom is the all-transcending issue today. So the good news of this kingdom is what seekers of Jehovah today must preach in all the earth for a final witness to all nations, before the end of these nations comes in the “war of the great day of God the Almighty.” Jehovah’s King, Jesus Christ, has commanded this witness to be given now.</p><p id="p117" data-pid="117" class="qu">53.

What rest, what peace, what freedom from fear, what buoyant expectation of surviving through the day of his anger against the enemy nations of this world! The inspired psalmist beautifully describes the miraculous safety to be enjoyed there, saying: “Anyone dwelling in the hiding place of the Most High will procure himself lodging under the very shadow of the Almighty One. I will say to Jehovah: ‘You are my refuge and my stronghold, my God, in whom I will trust.’”</p><p id="p118" data-pid="118" class="qu">54, 55. (a) Under concealment, what may one look on and see?

Only with your eyes will you look on and see the retribution itself of the wicked ones.” O, then, may we be wise and take advantage of the remaining time and seek Jehovah and call upon his name!

So our security through the immediate future and for all time to come lies with his Kingdom. Our course will be life-rewarding if we seek it now.</p>
