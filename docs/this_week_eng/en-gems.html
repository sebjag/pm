<strong>Children, Do You Obey Jehovah?</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> It is of the utmost importance that you learn to control the natural desire for material things and for pleasures. Do not let them become more important to you than obedience to Jehovah God. If they <span id="page493" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="493" data-before-text="493"></span>do, you will be actually sacrificing your life for them. Is not your life worth more than something that will become old, outmoded and useless? Is it not worth more than the few moments of pleasure you may get from a material possession or from satisfying fleshly desires? The wise thing is to exercise control over them rather than to permit them to control you.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">18. Why should not children be absorbed in the present and ignore the future?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Avoid the tendency of youth to be completely absorbed with the present, having little concern about how one’s actions today may affect one in the future. This tendency can be an obstacle to obeying Jehovah, as obedience or disobedience to him now will reap its results in the future. You cannot ignore the future if you want his approval. You are alive today, but when tomorrow comes you want to be still living, do you not? It will not be possible if you give no thought to your Creator today or to what he requires of you. Be wise, therefore, and heed this admonition: “Remember, now, your grand Creator in the days of your young manhood.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962603/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Eccl. 12:1</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>SHOW WILLINGNESS TO OBEY</strong></p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">19.

(b) How can the right attitude be cultivated?</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> God has no pleasure in the person that serves him reluctantly and has to be prodded continually by others to do the divine will. If you truly love your Creator you will want to obey him. You will have the attitude expressed at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962603/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 40, verse 8</a>: “To do your will, O my God, I have delighted.” This appreciation must be cultivated by personal study of God’s Word, by taking his instructions to heart and by keeping vividly in mind the great things Jehovah has done and will yet do. Deep appreciation for such things prompts willing obedience. Consider this good counsel: “My son, my law do not forget, and my commandments may your heart observe, because length of days and years of life and peace will be added to you. May loving-kindness and trueness themselves not leave you. Tie them about your throat. Write them upon the tablet of your heart.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962603/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Prov. 3:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">20, 21.

It is by using this knowledge to magnify Jehovah and to help others to learn about him and his wonderful purposes that you manifest your desire to do his will. You will then be doing as you are Scripturally commanded: “Give thanks to Jehovah, call upon his name, make known among the peoples his dealings. Sing to him, make melody to him, concern yourselves with all his wonderful works.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962603/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 105:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> Activity in the Christian ministry cannot be confined to adults. It is a privilege of service that you children can Scripturally participate in and should engage in. If you want to obey Jehovah you will engage regularly in the ministerial activities that are arranged by the theocratic organization. Aside from weekly service in the ministry that the organization makes available to you, it gives you the splendid opportunity to serve your Creator every day during vacation periods by being a vacation pioneer out in the witness field. What better way is there to spend the major portion of a vacation? Since the proclamation of Jehovah’s truths and purposes to the people has been commanded by him, do you obey him by zealously engaging in it regularly?</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">22. How should young people view theocratic assignments?</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> Aside from opportunities to preach <span id="page494" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="494" data-before-text="494"></span>from house to house, willingness to obey Jehovah can be shown when you are given theocratic assignments and responsibilities in the congregation. At first the assignments are small, but as you grow older they become bigger, with more responsibility attached to them. Shunning such responsibilities by rejecting the assignments reveals a wrong mental attitude, an unwillingness to use your strength and abilities fully in advancing the interests of God’s kingdom. This is not serving him with delight. It is not showing wholehearted devotion to him. Do not reject theocratic assignments but be grateful that you were found worthy of greater service privileges.</p>

<strong>Answering the Roman Governor’s Question, “What Is Truth?”</strong><br/><p id="p48" data-pid="48" data-rel-pid="[109]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="40"><sup>40</sup></span> When on earth as a man, Jesus was determined to bear witness to the truth of God’s recorded word in the Hebrew Scriptures. On the night of falling into the hands of his enemies he said to his faithful apostles: “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">John 14:6</a>) Was he not correct in saying this? Yes, for he was indeed the Truth. He was no <em>shadow</em> Messiah or Christ. He was the <em>real</em> one promised. <span id="page655" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="655" data-before-text="655"></span>He was no <em>shadow</em> king-priest. He was substantially the <em>true</em> one that had been prefigured. As such, he benefits not only the circumcised Jews but also all the non-Jewish nations. Hence the apostle Paul says:</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" data-rel-pid="[109]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="41"><sup>41</sup></span> “I say that Christ actually became a minister of those who are circumcised in behalf of God’s truthfulness, so as to verify the promises He made to their forefathers, and that the nations might glorify God for his mercy. Just as it is written: ‘That is why I will openly acknowledge you among the nations and to your name I will make melody.’ And again he says: ‘Be glad, you nations, with his people.’ And again: ‘Praise Jehovah, all you nations, and let all the peoples praise him.’ And again Isaiah says: ‘There will be the root of Jesse [father of King David], and there will be one arising to rule nations; on him nations will rest their hope.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Rom. 15:8-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/37/1" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> Ps. 18:49;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/37/2" data-bid="38-3" class="b"> 117:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/37/3" data-bid="38-4" class="b"> Deut. 32:43;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/37/4" data-bid="38-5" class="b"> Isa. 11:10</a>.</p><p id="p110" data-pid="110" class="qu">42. (a) How did Jesus actually become “a minister of those who are circumcised”? (b) How did Jesus “verify” God’s promises made to the forefathers?</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" data-rel-pid="[110]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="42"><sup>42</sup></span> Once when he encountered a Phoenician woman, Jesus Christ said: “I was not sent forth to any but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” When sending out his twelve apostles to preach the kingdom of the heavens, Jesus said to them: “Do not go off into the road of the nations, and do not enter into a Samaritan city; but, instead, go continually to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Matt. 15:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/38/1" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> 10:5, 6</a>) Thus, because he was born and circumcised as a Jew under the Mosaic law, Jesus “actually became a minister of those who are circumcised.” This ministry of Jesus Christ to the circumcised Jews was rendered “in behalf of God’s truthfulness,” because Jehovah God had said to the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob that all the nations of the earth would bless themselves by means of their seed. Naturally, by human birth, their “seed” would be Israelites or Jews, Hebrews. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Gen. 22:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/39/1" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> 26:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/39/2" data-bid="40-3" class="b"> 28:14</a>) Hence according to the natural order of things it was necessary for Jesus Christ to establish “God’s truthfulness” as regards those promises made to the three Hebrew patriarchs; how? By offering first to Jews the opportunity to receive the Abrahamic blessing and become the spiritual seed of Abraham. It was absolutely obligatory upon Jesus to respect the sworn oath of Jehovah God, because God had sworn with an oath that his promises to the patriarchs were truthful, and Jesus had to “verify” those promises.</p><p id="p111" data-pid="111" class="qu">43.

Get up, go to Paddan-aram to the house of Bethuel the father of your mother and from there take yourself a wife from the daughters of Laban.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013205/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. 28:1, 2</a>) Jacob promptly obeyed Isaac. Jacob left the security of his immediate family, who were living in Canaan, to travel, evidently alone, hundreds of miles to the area of Haran.

Consider, for example, what happened about 1919 B.C.E. when Abraham and Sarah took up temporary residence in Gerar. Not knowing that Sarah was Abraham’s wife, Abimelech, the king of Gerar, took Sarah with the intention of making her his wife. Was Satan manipulating matters behind the scenes, trying to prevent Sarah from bearing Abraham’s seed? The Bible does not say. What it does tell us is that Jehovah intervened. In a dream, he warned Abimelech not to touch Sarah.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010282/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gen. 20:1-18</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> That was not just an isolated incident.

<strong>Proclaimers of God’s Kingdom</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">While a life centered around the worship of God is a very active one, it is also a very rich and satisfying life if you have a proper motive in serving.

The land upon which you are lying, to you I am going to give it and to your seed. And your seed will certainly become like the dust particles of the earth, and you will certainly spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and by means of you and by means of your seed all the families of the ground will certainly bless themselves.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962442/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Gen. 28:13, 14</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[99]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Because of this divine promise everyone who wants to bless himself on earth, no matter of what family he is, will have to do so through a “seed” or descendant of this Jacob. Later Jehovah God changed Jacob’s name to Israel, so that in the Bible he is called by both names, now Jacob, now Israel. Like Abraham and Isaac, Jacob became a prophet of Jehovah. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962442/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 105:14, 15</a> plainly calls Jacob a prophet. After telling about the wanderings of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the Promised Land, it tells how Jehovah God protected them and says: “He did not allow any human to defraud them, but on their account he reproved kings, saying: ‘Do not you men touch my anointed ones, and to my prophets do nothing bad.’”</p><p id="p100" data-pid="100" class="qu">12.

But in no case does his office as prophet show up to better effect than when he gave words of farewell to his sons and grandsons. When, now, in 1712 B.C.E. he was on his deathbed, he called together his twelve sons to his sickroom for his last words to them, as he sat with his feet hanging down over the side of the bed. This was shortly after he had blessed his grandsons, Manasseh and Ephraim, who were the sons of Joseph, Jacob’s eleventh son. Joseph was then serving as prime minister of Egypt, the chief servant of Pharaoh the king of Egypt.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962442/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 48:1-22</a>.</p><p id="p101" data-pid="101" class="qu">13. In giving his final prophecy, what style of expression did Jacob use?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[101]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> As Jacob gave his final messages to his twelve sons, he used the poetic style of the Hebrew prophets, for Jacob was a Hebrew, even as Abraham and Isaac were. His poetry did not show itself in making the ends of lines or verses rhyme or sound alike. It consisted in making rhythmic lines give parallel thoughts or ideas, as, for instance, in speaking of himself in one clause as Jacob and then in the next clause as Israel, both names referring to the same person. So this prophetic poetry is something more than what is called blank verse, which is unrhymed verse in which the ends of the lines do not sound alike. Hebrew poetry expresses itself in lines that run alongside each other in the same direction of thought and that thus express like ideas but that really enlarge on the thought or idea or theme. As we go through Jacob’s poetic deathbed prophecy we shall be able to note this.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>DEATHBED PROPHECY</strong></p><p id="p102" data-pid="102" class="qu">14. Under what force did Jacob then speak, and what does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962442/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Genesis 49:1, 2</a> say to indicate this?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[102]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> The deathbed scene in Jacob’s home in Egypt in 1712 B.C.E. is described in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962442/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Genesis, chapter forty-nine</a>. God’s spirit of inspiration came upon Jacob on this occasion, and he spoke as a prophetic witness of Jehovah. Indicative of this, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962442/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Genesis 49:1, 2</a> tells us: “Later on Jacob called his sons and said:</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="si"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span>‘Gather yourselves together that I may tell you what will happen to you in the final part of the days. Assemble yourselves and listen, you sons of Jacob, yes, listen to Israel your father.’”</p><p id="p103" data-pid="103" class="qu">15. What features of Hebrew poetry do we note in Jacob’s opening words?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[103]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> Notice how (1) the expression “Assemble yourselves” parallels poetically the expression “Gather yourselves together”; (2) the expression “and listen” parallels the expression “that I may tell you”; <span id="page363" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="363" data-before-text="363"></span>(3) the expression “yes, listen to,” the expression “and listen”; and (4) the expression “Israel your father,” the expression “you sons of Jacob.” All through Jacob’s prophecy we shall notice this poetic parallelism of thoughts or of related expressions. All this serves to give extension to the thought and to enlarge the meaning as well as to make more sure of the thought meant.</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ge 20:7</a>) Abraham was not notable for foretelling the future, certainly not in a public way. Yet God had given him a message, a prophetic <span id="page695" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="695" data-before-text="695"></span>promise. Abraham must have felt agitated, impelled to ‘speak forth’ about this, particularly to his family, explaining why he was leaving Ur and what God’s promise to him was. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ge 12:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 13:14-17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 22:15-18</a>) In a similar way, Isaac and Jacob, the inheritors of the promise, were “prophets” having intimate communication with God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003562/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps 105:9-15</a>) Additionally, they gave predictive blessings to their sons.

Consider, for example, what happened about 1919 B.C.E. when Abraham and Sarah took up temporary residence in Gerar. Not knowing that Sarah was Abraham’s wife, Abimelech, the king of Gerar, took Sarah with the intention of making her his wife. Was Satan manipulating matters behind the scenes, trying to prevent Sarah from bearing Abraham’s seed? The Bible does not say. What it does tell us is that Jehovah intervened. In a dream, he warned Abimelech not to touch Sarah.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010282/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gen. 20:1-18</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> That was not just an isolated incident.

His judicial decisions are in all the earth. He has remembered his covenant even to time indefinite, the word that he commanded, to a thousand generations, which covenant he concluded with Abraham, and his sworn statement to Isaac, and which statement he kept standing as a regulation even to Jacob, as an indefinitely lasting covenant even to Israel, saying: ‘To you I shall give the land of Canaan as the allotment of your inheritance.’ This was when they happened to be few in number, yes, very few, and alien residents in it. And they kept walking about from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people. He did not allow any human to defraud them, but on their account he reproved kings, saying: ‘Do not you men touch my anointed ones [in Hebrew the plural number of <em>ma·shiʹahh,</em> or messiahs], and to my prophets do nothing bad.’”—<em>Marginal reading.</em></p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">17.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 1:70;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Acts 3:18-21</a>) Some scholars think that the Hebrew term, <em>na·viʼʹ,</em> comes from an unknown Hebrew root related to Arabian and Akkadian words meaning “to call” or “to announce.” However, other lexicographers, such as Gesenius, suggest that the verb root (<em>na·vaʼʹ</em>) is a weakened form of <em>na·vaʽʹ,</em> meaning “to flow, spring or bubble up.” (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalms 78:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 119:171;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Proverbs 1:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/1/3" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 18:4</a>.) According to this latter explanation, the <em>na·viʼʹ</em> would be one whose speech flows forth due to the impulse or pressure of the message granted him by God. Whatever its origin, the actual use of the term shows that true prophets were no ordinary announcers but were spokesmen for God, ‘men of God’ with inspired messages. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Ki. 12:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 4:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 23:17</a>) They stood in God’s “intimate group” and he revealed his “confidential matter” to them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jer. 23:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Amos 3:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 1 Ki. 17:1</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The English word “prophet” comes from the Greek <em>pro·pheʹtes. Pro·pheʹtes</em> literally means “a speaker out [Gr., <em>pro,</em> “before” or “in front of,” and <em>phe·miʹ,</em> “to speak”],” and thus describes a proclaimer, one who makes known messages attributed to a divine source. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Titus 1:12</a>.) Though the English word retains this same basic meaning, to many persons today it conveys only the restricted thought of a predicter of the future. But, as the foregoing information shows, the <em>fundamental</em> meaning of the word is not that of prediction. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Judges 6:7-10</a>.) Nonetheless, living in harmony with God’s will requires that one know what Jehovah’s purposes for the future are so that the individual may bring his ways, desires and goals into line with the divine will. Hence, in the great majority of cases, the Biblical prophets did convey messages that were, directly or indirectly, related to the future.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>THE PROPHETIC OFFICE IN THE HEBREW SCRIPTURES</strong></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The first human spokesman for God obviously was Adam, who initially conveyed God’s instructions to his wife Eve and to that extent fulfilled the role of prophet. Those instructions had to do not only with the present (for them) but also with the future, outlining God’s purpose for earth and mankind and the course humans must take to enjoy a blessed future. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gen. 1:26-30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 2:15-17,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 23, 24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/6/3" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> 3:1-3</a>) The first faithful human prophet mentioned was Enoch and his message did contain direct prediction.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Gen. 20:7</a>) Abraham was not notable for foretelling the future, certainly not in a public way. Yet God had given him a message, a prophetic promise. Abraham must have felt agitated, impelled to ‘speak forth’ about this, particularly to his family, explaining why he was leaving Ur and what God’s promise to him was. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gen. 12:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 13:14-17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 22:15-18</a>) In a similar way, Isaac and Jacob, the inheritors of the promise, were “prophets” having intimate communication with God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 105:9-15</a>) Additionally, they gave predictive blessings to their sons.

The prophet’s position as spokesman for God is emphasized by Jehovah’s assignment of Aaron as a “prophet” or “mouth” to Moses, while Moses ‘served as God to Aaron.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ex. 4:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 7:1, 2</a>) Moses foretold many events that saw early fulfillment, such as the ten plagues. However, he served even more impressively as prophet or spokesman for God in the delivering of the Law covenant at Sinai and in instructing the nation in God’s will. Though the Law covenant was of immense immediate value to the Israelites as a moral code and guide, it, too, pointed forward to the future and ‘better things to come.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Gal. 3:23-25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Heb. 8:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 9:23, 24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/14/3" data-bid="15-4" class="b"> 10:1</a>) Moses’ intimate, often two-way, communication with God, and the greatly increased understanding of Jehovah’s will and purpose he was used to convey, made his prophetic position outstanding.

By Samuel’s time, “word from Jehovah had become rare . . . ; there was no vision being spread abroad.” From boyhood Samuel served as God’s spokesman, and the fulfillment of the divine messages caused all to recognize him as “one accredited for the position of prophet to Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Sam. 3:1-14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 18-21</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">With the establishment of the monarchy, an almost continuous line of prophets appears.

The Biblical record at times gives no means for determining just when they began to prophesy.) As may be noted, some were used to prophesy to the leaders and people of both kingdoms. Among exilic and postexilic prophets were Daniel, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The prophets played a vital role in maintaining true worship.

The land upon which you are lying, to you I am going to give it and to your seed. And your seed will certainly become like the dust particles of the earth, and you will certainly spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and by means of you and by means of your seed all the families of the ground will certainly bless themselves.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962442/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Gen. 28:13, 14</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[99]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Because of this divine promise everyone who wants to bless himself on earth, no matter of what family he is, will have to do so through a “seed” or descendant of this Jacob. Later Jehovah God changed Jacob’s name to Israel, so that in the Bible he is called by both names, now Jacob, now Israel. Like Abraham and Isaac, Jacob became a prophet of Jehovah. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962442/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 105:14, 15</a> plainly calls Jacob a prophet. After telling about the wanderings of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the Promised Land, it tells how Jehovah God protected them and says: “He did not allow any human to defraud them, but on their account he reproved kings, saying: ‘Do not you men touch my anointed ones, and to my prophets do nothing bad.’”</p><p id="p100" data-pid="100" class="qu">12.

But in no case does his office as prophet show up to better effect than when he gave words of farewell to his sons and grandsons. When, now, in 1712 B.C.E. he was on his deathbed, he called together his twelve sons to his sickroom for his last words to them, as he sat with his feet hanging down over the side of the bed. This was shortly after he had blessed his grandsons, Manasseh and Ephraim, who were the sons of Joseph, Jacob’s eleventh son. Joseph was then serving as prime minister of Egypt, the chief servant of Pharaoh the king of Egypt.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962442/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 48:1-22</a>.</p><p id="p101" data-pid="101" class="qu">13.

His poetry did not show itself in making the ends of lines or verses rhyme or sound alike. It consisted in making rhythmic lines give parallel thoughts or ideas, as, for instance, in speaking of himself in one clause as Jacob and then in the next clause as Israel, both names referring to the same person. So this prophetic poetry is something more than what is called blank verse, which is unrhymed verse in which the ends of the lines do not sound alike. Hebrew poetry expresses itself in lines that run alongside each other in the same direction of thought and that thus express like ideas but that really enlarge on the thought or idea or theme. As we go through Jacob’s poetic deathbed prophecy we shall be able to note this.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>DEATHBED PROPHECY</strong></p><p id="p102" data-pid="102" class="qu">14. Under what force did Jacob then speak, and what does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962442/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Genesis 49:1, 2</a> say to indicate this?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[102]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> The deathbed scene in Jacob’s home in Egypt in 1712 B.C.E. is described in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962442/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Genesis, chapter forty-nine</a>. God’s spirit of inspiration came upon Jacob on this occasion, and he spoke as a prophetic witness of Jehovah. Indicative of this, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962442/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Genesis 49:1, 2</a> tells us: “Later on Jacob called his sons and said:</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="si"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"></span>‘Gather yourselves together that I may tell you what will happen to you in the final part of the days. Assemble yourselves and listen, you sons of Jacob, yes, listen to Israel your father.’”</p><p id="p103" data-pid="103" class="qu">15. What features of Hebrew poetry do we note in Jacob’s opening words?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[103]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> Notice how (1) the expression “Assemble yourselves” parallels poetically the expression “Gather yourselves together”; (2) the expression “and listen” parallels the expression “that I may tell you”; <span id="page363" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="363" data-before-text="363"></span>(3) the expression “yes, listen to,” the expression “and listen”; and (4) the expression “Israel your father,” the expression “you sons of Jacob.” All through Jacob’s prophecy we shall notice this poetic parallelism of thoughts or of related expressions. All this serves to give extension to the thought and to enlarge the meaning as well as to make more sure of the thought meant.</p>

Discipline, which may be hard to take, yields righteousness if you are trained by it. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986806/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:5-7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986806/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 11</a>) This training can develop an inner strength like heat-tempered steel. As “Jehovah continued with Joseph and kept extending loving-kindness,” so he will give you strength beyond what is normal and richly reward your endurance.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986806/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Genesis 39:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986806/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 2 Corinthians 4:7</a>.</p>

A plague of gadflies would, therefore, have brought great suffering to the Egyptians and their livestock and, in certain cases, even death.</p>

This plague is transmitted chiefly through bites by fleas that have bitten dying or dead infected rats or other rodents. “A death-dealing confusion” occurred when the Ark was in Ekron, where “the men that did not die had been struck with piles.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013407/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Sam. 5:10-12</a>) Both pile and jerboa images are mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013407/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Samuel 6:4</a>, where the Philistine priests and diviners are quoted as saying, “every one of you and your axis lords have the same scourge.” But this may mean <span id="page1313" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1313" data-before-text="1313"></span>only that the entire nation, the axis lords and people alike, had suffered a common calamity, the, “same scourge,” not necessarily that the rodents and the piles were associated in one epidemic disease or plague.

Sure enough, this bread from heaven appeared in the early morning, “a fine, flaky substance” that looked somewhat like dew or frost. “What is it?” the Israelites asked the first time they saw it. “It is the bread that Jehovah has given you for food,” Moses explained.

This was when the millions of Israelites left Egypt to pass through the Sinai wilderness. How could this great crowd find sustenance in that bleak, unfriendly desert? Though Jehovah had been angered by their lack of faith, he “opened the very doors of heaven. And he kept raining upon them manna to eat, and the grain of heaven he gave to them.” “With bread from heaven he kept satisfying them” for 40 long years.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986125/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Romans 5:12</a>) Israel’s sacrifices provided a means to maintain a good relationship with God, but those sacrifices also emphasized the nation’s sinfulness. They were “at no time able to take sins away completely.” Further, those offerings foreshadowed Jesus’ “one sacrifice,” which provides for removing sins “perpetually.” From his exalted position in heaven, Jesus is now able to administer the merit of that sacrifice.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986125/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:1-4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986125/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 11-13</a>.</p>

<strong>Subjection to “Superior Authorities”—Why?</strong><br/><p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[77]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"><sup>27</sup></span> With a like thought the apostle Paul said to the high court in Athens, Greece: “The God that made the world and all the things in it, being, as this One is, Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in handmade temples, . . . he made out of one man every nation of men, to dwell upon the entire surface of the earth, and he decreed the appointed seasons and the set limits of the dwelling of men, for them to seek God, if they might grope for him and really find him, although, in fact, he is not far off from each one of us.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962842/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Acts 17:24,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962842/52/1" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> 26, 27</a>) How God decreed the appointed seasons for them to exist and the set limits of their dwelling can be seen from Bible history. <span id="page688" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="688" data-before-text="688"></span>When Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were wandering about in the Promised Land of Canaan, Jehovah permitted the pagan Canaanites to occupy the land and exercise their authority there; and Abraham, Isaac and Jacob had to recognize it. “They kept walking about from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people. He did not allow any human to defraud them, but on their account he reproved kings, saying: ‘Do not you men touch my anointed ones, and to my prophets do nothing bad.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962842/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Ps. 105:13-15</a>.</p><p id="p78" data-pid="78" class="qu">28, 29.

He marched them through the wilderness and past or through nations to the eastern shores of the Jordan River.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962842/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Gen. 15:13-21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962842/54/1" data-bid="55-2" class="b"> Ps. 105:26-45</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[78]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="29"><sup>29</sup></span> On this march to Canaanland God did not let his nation of Israel molest, overrun or uproot the nations of Edom (or Esau; Mount Seir), Moab and Ammon. Why not? “Because,” said Jehovah, “I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a holding.” “Do not molest Moab or engage in war with them, because I shall not give you any of his land as a holding, for to the sons of Lot I have given Ar as a holding. . . . I shall not give you any of the land of the sons of Ammon as a holding, for it is to the sons of Lot that I have given it as a holding.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962842/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Deut. 2:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962842/55/1" data-bid="56-2" class="b"> 9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962842/55/2" data-bid="56-3" class="b"> 19</a>.</p><p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="qu">30.

This was before the start of the Gentile Times in 607 B.C.E. Jehovah God himself had foretold those “appointed times of the nations,” and his Son Jesus Christ also mentioned them in his prophecy on the end of this worldly system of things.
