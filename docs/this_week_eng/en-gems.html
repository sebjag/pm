<strong>“Those Seeking Jehovah Will Lack Nothing Good”</strong><br/><h2 id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>“I WILL LACK NOTHING”</strong></h2>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"><strong>5-6.</strong><strong> How does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022240/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 23:1-6</a> help us understand what David meant when he said that God’s servants would “lack nothing good”?</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span> What did David mean when he said that Jehovah’s servants would “lack nothing good”? We can get an idea by considering the similar wording found in the 23rd Psalm. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022240/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 23:1-6</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> David introduces that psalm with the words: “Jehovah is my Shepherd. <strong><em>I will lack nothing.”</em></strong> In the rest of the psalm, David mentions things that are truly of lasting value​—the abundant spiritual blessings he enjoys by accepting Jehovah as his Shepherd. Jehovah leads him “in the paths of righteousness,” and He loyally supports David in good times and in bad times. David acknowledges that his life in Jehovah’s <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>“grassy pastures” will not be trouble free. At times, he may get discouraged, as if walking “in the valley of deep shadow,” and he will have enemies. But with Jehovah as his Shepherd, David will “fear no harm.”</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span> So here we have the answer to our question: In what way did David “lack nothing good”? Spiritually speaking, he had everything he needed. His happiness was not dependent on material things. David was satisfied with what Jehovah provided. What mattered most to him was the blessing and the protection of his God.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>7.</strong><strong> According to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022240/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Luke 21:20-24</a>, what challenging situation did the first-century Judean Christians face?</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><strong><sup>7</sup></strong></span> From David’s words we can see how important it is for us to have a proper view of material things. We can certainly enjoy whatever material possessions we have, but we should not make them the focus of our life. That was a vital truth that first-century Christians living in Judea came to understand. <strong>(Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022240/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>Luke 21:20-24</strong></a><strong>.)</strong> Jesus had warned them that the time would come when the city of Jerusalem would be “surrounded by encamped armies.” When that occurred, they needed to “begin fleeing to the mountains.” Their flight would lead to their salvation, but it would come at a high cost. Some years ago, <em>The Watchtower</em> put it this way: “They left fields and homes, not even gathering their possessions from their houses. Confident of the protection and support of Jehovah, they put his worship ahead of everything else that might seem important.”</p>

<strong>Hebrew, II</strong><br/><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">To exemplify the terseness of Hebrew poetic language observe <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001953/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">the first verse of Psalm 23</a> as found in the <em>New World Translation.</em> Those English words needed to translate each Hebrew word are separated with a diagonal stroke (/):</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sp"><em>Jehovah/</em> [<em>is</em>] <em>my Shepherd./</em></p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sz"><em>I shall lack/ nothing./</em></p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb">It can be seen that the English equivalent needs eight words to translate four Hebrew words. The “is” has been supplied to give sense to the English; in Hebrew, it is understood.</p>

<strong>Rod, Staff</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><strong><em>The staff of leadership, shepherding.</em></strong> The shepherd used his staff or crook in directing, defending, and helping his flock. Jehovah and his Son Jesus Christ provide similar shepherding for God’s flock of people. Jehovah often spoke of Israel, in covenant relationship with him, as his flock. David wrote: “Jehovah is my Shepherd. . . . He leads me in the tracks of righteousness for his name’s sake. Even though I walk in the valley of deep shadow, I fear nothing bad, for you are with <span id="page819" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="819" data-before-text="819"></span>me; your rod and your staff are the things that comfort me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003754/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Ps 23:1-4</a>) Micah prayed: “Shepherd your people with your staff, the flock of your inheritance.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003754/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Mic 7:14</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003754/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Joh 10:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003754/40/1" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> 14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003754/40/2" data-bid="41-3" class="b"> Heb 13:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003754/40/3" data-bid="41-4" class="b"> 1Pe 2:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003754/40/4" data-bid="41-5" class="b"> 5:4</a>.</p>

<strong>“Jehovah Is My Shepherd”</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>“Jehovah Is My Shepherd”</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">LOOK at the picture on this page. Can you sense the security of that lamb nestled in the bosom of its shepherd? In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011337/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 23</a>, the Bible uses the metaphor of a shepherd and his sheep to illustrate the tender care that Jehovah gives his worshippers. He wants us to feel the security that comes to those who, like the psalmist David, can say with confidence: “Jehovah is my Shepherd.”<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2011337/0">a</a>​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011337/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Verse 1</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The writer of this psalm, David, was a shepherd as a youth. He knew the needs of sheep and the responsibilities of a shepherd. David, who had experienced God’s care in his life, wrote what has been called “a psalm of assurance or trust.” The divine name, Jehovah, appears at the beginning and at the end of the psalm. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011337/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Verses 1</a>, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011337/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">6</a>) The words between describe three ways in which Jehovah cares for his people as a shepherd cares for his sheep.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011337/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 100:3</a>.</p>

<strong>Does Anyone Really Care?</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Another Bible passage that describes God’s loving care is the famous 23rd Psalm. The opening words liken God to a loving shepherd: “Jehovah is my Shepherd. I shall lack nothing.” A Middle Eastern shepherd cares for each of his sheep, even naming each one. Daily he calls each sheep to him and lovingly strokes it and looks for injuries. If he finds any, he applies oil or ointment to hasten the healing process. If the sheep is sick, the shepherd might have to force medicine down its throat and literally hold it up so that it will not lie down and die. Surely that is a fine word picture of how Jehovah cares for those who turn to him.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/745/0">11/1/2005, pp. 16-17</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Jehovah Is Our Shepherd</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> It is not surprising that the work of a shepherd came to mind when David was inspired to describe the care that Jehovah shows for his people. The 23rd Psalm, penned by David, begins with the words: “Jehovah is my Shepherd. I shall lack nothing.” Let us consider why this is a fitting statement. Then, with the help of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 23</a>, we will see in what ways Jehovah cares for his worshippers as a shepherd cares for his sheep.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:25</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>A Fitting Comparison</strong></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">4, 5. How does the Bible describe the traits of sheep?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Jehovah bears many titles in the Scriptures, but the designation “Shepherd” is among the most tender. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 80:1</a>) To understand better why Jehovah is fittingly called a Shepherd, it is helpful for us to know two things: first, the disposition of sheep and second, the duties and qualities of a good shepherd.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> The Bible often alludes to the traits of sheep, describing them as readily responding to a shepherd’s affection (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Samuel 12:3</a>), unaggressive (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isaiah 53:7</a>), and defenseless. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Micah 5:8</a>) One writer who raised sheep for a number of years noted: “Sheep do not ‘just take care of themselves’ as some might suppose. They require, more <span id="page17" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>than any other class of livestock, endless attention and meticulous care.” To survive, these helpless creatures need a caring shepherd.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ezekiel 34:5</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 6.

One Bible dictionary explains: “In early morning he led forth the flock from the fold, marching at its head to the spot where they were to be pastured. Here he watched them all day, taking care that none of the sheep strayed, and if any for a time eluded his watch and wandered away from the rest, seeking diligently till he found and brought it back. . . . At night he brought the flock home to the fold, counting them as they passed under the rod at the door to assure himself that none were missing. . . . Often he had to guard the fold through the dark hours from the attack of wild beasts, or the wily attempts of the prowling thief.”<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2005805/0">a</a></p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 7.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Genesis 33:13</a>) One Bible reference work states: “The birth of offspring in a flock often occurs far off on the mountain side. The shepherd solicitously guards the mother during her helpless moments and picks up the lamb and carries it to the fold. For the few days, until it is able to walk, he may carry it in his arms or in the loose folds of his coat.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:10, 11</a>) Clearly, a good shepherd needed a blend of strong and tender qualities.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 8. David cites what reasons for his confidence in Jehovah?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> “Jehovah is my Shepherd”​—is that not a fitting description of our heavenly Father? As we examine <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 23</a>, we will see how God cares for us with the strength and tenderness of a shepherd. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps 23 verse 1</a>, David expresses his confidence that God will make all necessary provisions for His sheep so that they will “lack nothing.” In the verses that follow, David cites three reasons for this confidence: Jehovah leads, protects, and feeds His sheep. Let us discuss these one at a time.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/746/0">7/1/1988, pp. 23-24</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>“Jehovah Is My Shepherd”</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> <em>“Jehovah is my Shepherd.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988487/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 23:1</a>) As an experienced shepherd, David knew how to lead, feed, and protect the sheep. For instance, he courageously protected his sheep from a lion on one occasion and a bear on another. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988487/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Samuel 17:34-36</a>) David’s sheep trusted their shepherd implicitly. But in relation to Jehovah, he himself was a sheep. Since David felt secure in God’s loving care, he could say: “Jehovah is my Shepherd.” Do you enjoy this feeling of security under the Great Shepherd, Jehovah God? He surely leads, feeds, and protects his sheeplike worshipers today. Moreover, as appointed elders in the congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses, faithful, loving undershepherds zealously care for the sheep.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988487/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:1-4</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 4.

Because of Jehovah’s loving care, do you not have a soothing feeling of calmness and confidence? Do you remember what happened to the Israelites when they wandered in the wilderness for 40 years? Why, God provided for all their basic needs! <span id="page24" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>It is the same today. Jehovah’s faithful servants lack nothing. Many can echo these inspired words of David: “A young man I used to be, I have also grown old, and yet I have not seen anyone righteous left entirely, nor his offspring looking for bread.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988487/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 37:25</a>) Today, an abundance of spiritual food is being provided through “the faithful and discreet slave.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988487/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 4:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988487/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 24:45-47</a>) In addition to several meetings a week, we have the Bible, the magazines <em>The Watchtower</em> and <em>Awake!,</em> and many other publications. Even in countries where the preaching work of Jehovah’s Witnesses is banned, supplies of spiritual food are received regularly. Jehovah’s sheep lack nothing!</p>

<strong>Do You Really Count With God?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">How do we know that David had a personal relationship with God?

For example, let us take <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983001/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 23</a> and, through its simply expressed words, try to perceive the implicit confidence David had in his Shepherd, Jehovah God.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sp">“Jehovah is my Shepherd.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sz">I shall lack nothing.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sp">In grassy pastures he makes me lie down;</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sz">By well-watered resting-places he conducts me.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sp">My soul he refreshes.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sz">He leads me in the tracks of righteousness for his name’s sake.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sp">Even though I walk in the valley of deep shadow,</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sz">I fear nothing bad,</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sp">For you are with me;</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sz">Your rod and your staff are the things that comfort me.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983001/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps 23 Verses 1-4</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Here, the depth of David’s relationship with God shines through with clarity. How does that psalm affect you? Do you recognize the bridge of trust between the defenseless “sheep” David and his protective Shepherd, Jehovah? Without a doubt, David was conscious of the fact that although man resembles “a mere exhalation,” he personally did count with <span id="page5" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>his God and Shepherd. Therefore, David could say with conviction: “Jehovah is my Shepherd. I shall lack nothing.” Now, how can you achieve the same confidence, the same trust?</p>

<strong>Maintaining Unity in Difficult Times</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> How often offenses are only of a small nature, and are solely due to thoughtlessness, a lack of tact or upbringing or a momentary excitement, and are without evil intent! Therefore, we should not be small-minded when it comes to forgiving one another, but, rather, be broad-minded <span id="page305" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="305" data-before-text="305"></span>and forget the offense. Thus the oncoming dark clouds in our personal relations will be quickly dispersed and the sun will shine again. No one of us is perfect. We all have our imperfections and we are all thankful if others forgive us. But it is a fact that we usually see the imperfections in the other fellow much quicker than in ourselves.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>AVOIDING DISUNITY IN DOCTRINAL MATTERS</strong></p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 8. (a) Why do Jehovah’s witnesses enjoy doctrinal unity? (b) What suggestions are given to help understand difficult points and to maintain unity?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Disunity may also come about over doctrinal matters. How can that be avoided? It is good in such moments to recall the text in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964363/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 6:45</a>, where it says: “They will all be taught by Jehovah.” Jehovah’s witnesses in all the world receive their teaching based upon the Bible. The Bible explanations are given out by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, representing the “faithful and discreet slave” as mentioned in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964363/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45</a>. This centralized and uniform teaching has very much contributed toward the unity among Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the earth. If, now, a member of a congregation meets difficulties in understanding or accepting a certain point, he has the possibility to discuss the matter with brothers who have a mature knowledge. If the point still cannot be understood, then it may be best to let the matter rest. Perhaps the Society will publish more about the matter at a later date, and then the understanding will be broadened. In prayer we can ask Jehovah for a better understanding of the matter. “So, if any one of you is lacking in wisdom, let him keep on asking God, for he gives generously to all and without reproaching; and it will be given him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964363/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Jas. 1:5</a>) It would be wrong, however, to try to put your own divergent opinion concerning a certain doctrinal matter across to as many in the congregation as possible. This does not work for the preservation of unity, but, rather, may sow discord and distrust. Usually these points of dispute are of a minor nature. But they can be made so big that they overshadow the big truth of God’s kingdom, and one may even stop preaching that good news.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 9. What viewpoint should we hold when something is not clearly understood as yet?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> The truth about Jehovah’s revealed purpose can be likened to a wonderful painting. This painting conveys to us the hope and prospect of living forever in a new order. But we may say that this painting has not yet received its last touch. We do not yet understand everything. And as time goes by we may understand some things better. Because we do not see all the details as yet, should this become a reason for us to lose our joy and try to find fault with the whole Word of God and his organization? No. Look at how much truth you have received through the Watch Tower Society, which Jehovah is using. Then you will be thankful. Look at how safely Jehovah has led his people by means of his organization. Then you will be confident. While we did not always have the same degree of understanding, we have not been starving or thirsting spiritually, nor have we been lacking His love. Thankfully we can therefore say, as David did: “Jehovah is my Shepherd. I shall lack nothing. In grassy pastures he makes me lie down; by well-watered resting places he conducts me. My soul he refreshes.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964363/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 23:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>UNITY UNDER PERSECUTION</strong></p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">10, 11.

By God’s strength, they endure it. They do not rebel against the political authority, they do not retaliate, because they are faithful Christians and not revolutionaries or counter-revolutionaries. They do not expect salvation from any political system, whatever it may be, including democracy, but exclusively from God’s kingdom.

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page216" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="216" data-before-text="216"></span><strong>“Shepherd My Little Sheep”</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">FOR thousands of years sheep have played a vital role in the lives of pastoral people. In Bible times they were a common sight, and their characteristics were well known to the people of that time as well as the responsibilities that rested upon the shoulders of shepherds. It is understandable, then, why this meek animal is mentioned over 700 times in the Bible and is frequently used there in a symbolic manner. Jesus Christ used them this way when he told Peter: “Shepherd my little sheep.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 21:16</a>) He was referring to Christians whose care he was placing in the hands of overseers like Peter.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Unlike most domestic animals, sheep are timid and unable to defend themselves. This fact requires them to depend entirely upon their shepherd for protection from predatory animals. So too Christians trust in the Good Shepherd, Jesus Christ, and the Great Shepherd, Jehovah God. In Bible times when sheep were led back to their sheepfold in the evening, they had no reason to fear wild animals that might be lurking in the dark shadows of rocky valleys. Their shepherd was with them and ready to protect them with his sturdy staff and other weapons even at the cost of his life.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">David, who was well acquainted with sheep because of having been a shepherd himself, beautifully expressed this trust when he wrote in the twenty-third Psalm: “Even though I walk in the valley of deep shadow, I fear nothing bad, for you are with me; your rod and your staff are the things that comfort me.” Like a trusting sheep, David looked to Jehovah God as his Shepherd for protection, guidance and the provision of his needs. “Jehovah is my Shepherd. I shall lack nothing.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 23:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Although sheep can exist longer without water than most domestic animals, they should be within easy reach of it. Depending upon how hot the weather is, they will drink from one to four quarts of water every day. In Bible times shepherds would bring their sheep to water around noon, when the sun had become very hot. There in the shaded watering place the sheep were permitted to drink their fill and to rest on patches of green grass, contentedly chewing their cuds. Alluding to this, David wrote: “In grassy pastures he makes me lie down; by well-watered resting places he conducts me. My soul he refreshes.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 23:2, 3</a>) So too is the Christian refreshed by the waters of truth that his spiritual shepherds see that he receives.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>FEEDING HABITS</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">It is the custom of sheep to start feeding early in the morning and then to lie down during midday in a shaded place to regurgitate the food they have eaten that it might be thoroughly chewed. Similarly the Christian who is conscious of his spiritual <span id="page217" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="217" data-before-text="217"></span>need begins each day by feeding upon Scriptural truths. During the day he will bring back to mind what he has read that he might meditate upon it.</p>

<strong>International Praise to the One God</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[79]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> But a dead Jesus would not serve to vindicate himself as a Son of God faithful to the death nor to vindicate Jehovah God as universal Sovereign Lord with all power and dominion. Having this in mind, Jehovah in the Psalms foretold Jesus’ resurrection from the dead. The dead Jesus was buried in a nearby tomb in a rock and thus his soul, which he had poured out in death, went to Sheol or mankind’s common grave. But Jesus died with full hope of a resurrection, his hope being voiced in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 16:8-11</a>: “I have placed Jehovah in front of me constantly. Because [he] is at my right hand I shall not be made to totter. Therefore my heart does rejoice and my glory is inclined to be joyful. Also, <span id="page631" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="631" data-before-text="631"></span>my own flesh will reside in security. For you will not leave my soul in Sheol. You will not allow your man of loving-kindness to see the pit. You will cause me to know the path of life. Rejoicing to the full is with your face; there is pleasantness at your right hand forever.” That this and other prophecies of the Psalms might be carried out, Jehovah God brushed aside the Devil’s preventive efforts and raised Jesus from the dead, delivering him from Sheol on the third day. God rewarded him with a spirit body in place of the sacrificed human body, that he might know again the path of life and know pleasantness at God’s right hand forever.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Acts 2:22-31</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>THE CONGREGATION AND THE KINGDOM COVENANT</strong></p><p id="p80" data-pid="80" class="qu">20.

His work was to make known the name and the sovereignty of the one true God; it was to be the foremost witness of Jehovah, it was to gather about him a congregation of disciples, spiritual brothers, who should carry forward and finish on earth the work of Kingdom witnessing that he had begun. That was part of Jehovah’s will for Jesus, as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Psalm 40:8-10</a> foretold: “To do your will, O my God, I have delighted, and your law is within my inward parts.

Your righteousness I have not covered over within my heart. Your faithfulness and your salvation I have declared. I have not hidden your loving-kindness and your trueness in the big congregation.” True to this prophecy that was written about him in the roll of God’s Bible Jesus proceeded to gather twelve apostles and other disciples round about him. To this “little flock” he was Jehovah’s Right Shepherd. But he himself was the “Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world,” and so, like the psalmist David, he could say to God his Father: “Jehovah is my Shepherd. I shall lack nothing. In grassy pastures he makes me lie down; by well-watered resting places he conducts me.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ps. 23:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p81" data-pid="81" class="qu">21.

To this day such political rulers have not cared to assume duties like those of a shepherd. This has been true from as far back as the Pharaohs of Egypt of the eighteenth century before our Common Era (1728 B.C.E.).

It is an occupation that calls for tenderness and compassion such as worldly rulers are not disposed to display toward the masses who “must be kept under.” Also, shepherding is too peaceful an occupation for rulers who are inclined to show belligerency and militancy with the idea of keeping other rulers in their place.

<strong>Jehovah Is Our Shepherd</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>“He Leads Me”</strong></p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 9. What peaceful scene does David describe, and how would sheep come to be in such a setting?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> First, Jehovah <em>leads</em> his people. David writes: “In grassy pastures he makes me lie down; by well-watered resting-places he conducts me. My soul he refreshes. He leads me in the tracks of righteousness for his name’s sake.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 23:2, 3</a>) A flock lying down peacefully in the midst of abundance​—David here paints a scene of contentment, refreshment, and security. The Hebrew word rendered “pastures” can mean “pleasant place.” Likely, on their own, the sheep would not find a refreshing spot to lie down in peace. Their shepherd must lead them to such a “pleasant place.”</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">10. How does God show his confidence in us?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> How does Jehovah lead us today? One way he does so is by example. His Word urges us to “become imitators of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:1</a>) The context of those words mentions compassion, forgiveness, and love. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 5:2</a>) Certainly, Jehovah sets the finest example in displaying such warm qualities. Is he being unrealistic in asking us to imitate him? No. That inspired counsel is actually a marvelous expression of his confidence in us. In what way? We are made in God’s image, meaning that we are endowed with moral qualities <span id="page18" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>and the capacity for spirituality. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Genesis 1:26</a>) Hence, Jehovah knows that despite our imperfections, we have within us the potential for cultivating the same qualities that he exemplifies. Just think​—our loving God is confident that we can be like him. If we follow his example, he will lead us, as it were, to a pleasant ‘resting-place.’ In the midst of this violent world, we will “dwell in security,” experiencing the peace that comes from knowing that we have God’s approval.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 4:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 29:11</a>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">11. In leading his sheep, what does Jehovah consider, and how is this reflected in what he asks of us?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> In leading us, Jehovah is tender and patient. A shepherd considers the limitations of his sheep, so he leads “according to the pace of the livestock.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Genesis 33:14</a>) Jehovah likewise leads “according to the pace of” his sheep. He considers our abilities and circumstances. In effect, he adjusts the pace, never asking more than we can give. What he does ask is that we be whole-souled. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Colossians 3:23</a>) But what if you are older and cannot do what you used to? Or what if you have a serious illness that limits you? Therein lies the beauty of the requirement that we be whole-souled. No two souls are exactly alike. Serving whole-souled means using all your strength and energy to the fullest extent possible <em>for you</em> in God’s service. Despite the frailties that may affect our pace, Jehovah values our wholehearted worship.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Mark 12:29, 30</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">12. What example from the Mosaic Law illustrates that Jehovah leads “according to the pace of” his sheep?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> To illustrate that Jehovah leads “according to the pace of” his sheep, consider what is said about certain guilt offerings in the Mosaic Law. Jehovah wanted fine offerings that were prompted by grateful hearts. At the same time, the offerings were graded according to the offerer’s ability. The Law said: “If . . . he cannot afford enough for a sheep, then he must bring . . . two turtledoves or two young pigeons.” And if he could not afford even two pigeons? Then he could bring some “fine flour.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Leviticus 5:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 11</a>) This shows that God did not demand what was beyond the offerer’s reach. Since God does not change, we can find comfort in knowing that he never asks more than we can give; rather, he is pleased to accept what is within our reach. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Malachi 3:6</a>) What a pleasure it is to be led by such an understanding Shepherd!</p>

Therefore, a vital part of a shepherd’s job is to provide water for his flock. Sometimes shepherds water their flocks from a well, pouring the water into troughs so that the sheep can drink. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002688/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 29:1-3</a>) Particularly in the rainy season, however, the area around small streams and rivers provides peaceful, “well-watered resting-places.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002688/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 23:2</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A good shepherd has to know where to find both water and suitable pasturage for his flock. His intimate knowledge of an area guarantees the survival of his sheep. David, who spent many years herding sheep in the Judean hills, compared God’s spiritual guidance to that of a shepherd who leads his sheep to good pastures and to life-giving water. “He leads me beside quiet waters,” said David according to one rendition.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002688/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 23:1-3</a>, <em>New International Version.</em></p>

<strong>“Jehovah Is My Shepherd”</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> <em>“In grassy pastures he makes me lie down.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988487/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 23:2</a>) There were large grassy pastures around many cities in ancient Israel. As a loving shepherd then led his sheep to fine, safe pasture grounds, so Jehovah cares for his sheep today. Says the psalmist: “We are the people of his pasturage.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988487/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 79:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988487/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 95:7</a>) Literal sheep do well when they are contented and are able to rest in the heat of the day. Jehovah’s sheep today are peaceful and relaxed because they have confidence in mature shepherds​—trained overseers in congregations and circuits. As a result, the spiritual flocks are increasing. Many people previously treated badly by the false shepherds of Babylon the Great are now very happy and contented as Jehovah’s sheep.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 6. How does Jehovah ‘conduct us by well-watered resting-places’?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> <em>“By well-watered resting-places he conducts me.”</em> In Israel a shepherd had to guide his flock to a pool or a stream for water. But water was often hard to find in the dry season. Today, Jehovah ‘conducts us by well-watered resting-places’ by providing the waters of truth in great abundance. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988487/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ezekiel 34:13, 14</a>.) And the prophet Isaiah gives this rousing invitation: “Hey there, all you thirsty ones! Come to the water.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988487/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:1</a>) By taking in these spiritual waters, the sheep gain protection from the fiery judgments to come upon those “who do not know God and those who do not obey the good news.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988487/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Thessalonians 1:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988487/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Revelation 7:16, 17</a>.</p>

He is the Shepherd of his flock.

They tell of heavenly sons rejoicing before Jehovah, “shouting in applause,” being “overjoyed” and “happy.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966322/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 38:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966322/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Rev. 19:7-9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966322/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Prov. 8:30</a>) And on earth ‘the sheep of his pasturing, earthling men,’ are also called “happy.” “Happy is the people whose God is Jehovah!” exclaimed the psalmist. “Happy is the one who has the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in Jehovah his God, the Maker of heaven and earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966322/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezek. 34:31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966322/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Ps. 144:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966322/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 146:5, 6</a>) Yes, there is genuine happiness in this despondent twentieth century, but it is with those who belong to the flock of the happy God Jehovah.

He realizes that, without the exhilaration that happiness brings, life itself becomes a tedious grind, a bore for many, a lonely wandering to journey’s end. So to assure his flock of an exciting, meaningful life, Jehovah as the Overseer of his flock has made elaborate arrangements for their continued happiness.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> First he has provided a never-ending supply of food and drink for his flock. For it takes good food and good drink to keep the sheep of God happy. As the shepherd psalmist stated: “In grassy pastures he makes me lie down; by well-watered resting places he conducts me. My soul he refreshes.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966322/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 23:2, 3</a>) This food and drink Jehovah has supplied in the form of his written Word the Holy Bible. Therefore, a diligent study of this Word is vital to the flock of God, not only because it leads to spiritual health and happiness, but more so because it leads to life everlasting. Little wonder that Jesus Christ the Son of God told the Jewish people of his day: “Happy are those hearing the word of God <span id="page265" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="265" data-before-text="265"></span>and keeping it!” “Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need.” For “man must live, not on bread alone, but on every utterance coming forth through Jehovah’s mouth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966322/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 11:28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966322/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Matt. 5:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966322/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 4:4</a>) To enjoy a happy life the sheep of God must continuously draw from this divine storehouse.</p>

<strong>Maintaining Unity in Difficult Times</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> How often offenses are only of a small nature, and are solely due to thoughtlessness, a lack of tact or upbringing or a momentary excitement, and are without evil intent! Therefore, we should not be small-minded when it comes to forgiving one another, but, rather, be broad-minded <span id="page305" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="305" data-before-text="305"></span>and forget the offense. Thus the oncoming dark clouds in our personal relations will be quickly dispersed and the sun will shine again. No one of us is perfect. We all have our imperfections and we are all thankful if others forgive us. But it is a fact that we usually see the imperfections in the other fellow much quicker than in ourselves.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>AVOIDING DISUNITY IN DOCTRINAL MATTERS</strong></p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 8. (a) Why do Jehovah’s witnesses enjoy doctrinal unity? (b) What suggestions are given to help understand difficult points and to maintain unity?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Disunity may also come about over doctrinal matters. How can that be avoided? It is good in such moments to recall the text in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964363/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 6:45</a>, where it says: “They will all be taught by Jehovah.” Jehovah’s witnesses in all the world receive their teaching based upon the Bible. The Bible explanations are given out by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, representing the “faithful and discreet slave” as mentioned in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964363/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45</a>. This centralized and uniform teaching has very much contributed toward the unity among Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the earth. If, now, a member of a congregation meets difficulties in understanding or accepting a certain point, he has the possibility to discuss the matter with brothers who have a mature knowledge. If the point still cannot be understood, then it may be best to let the matter rest. Perhaps the Society will publish more about the matter at a later date, and then the understanding will be broadened. In prayer we can ask Jehovah for a better understanding of the matter. “So, if any one of you is lacking in wisdom, let him keep on asking God, for he gives generously to all and without reproaching; and it will be given him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964363/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Jas. 1:5</a>) It would be wrong, however, to try to put your own divergent opinion concerning a certain doctrinal matter across to as many in the congregation as possible. This does not work for the preservation of unity, but, rather, may sow discord and distrust. Usually these points of dispute are of a minor nature. But they can be made so big that they overshadow the big truth of God’s kingdom, and one may even stop preaching that good news.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 9. What viewpoint should we hold when something is not clearly understood as yet?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> The truth about Jehovah’s revealed purpose can be likened to a wonderful painting. This painting conveys to us the hope and prospect of living forever in a new order. But we may say that this painting has not yet received its last touch. We do not yet understand everything. And as time goes by we may understand some things better. Because we do not see all the details as yet, should this become a reason for us to lose our joy and try to find fault with the whole Word of God and his organization? No. Look at how much truth you have received through the Watch Tower Society, which Jehovah is using. Then you will be thankful. Look at how safely Jehovah has led his people by means of his organization. Then you will be confident. While we did not always have the same degree of understanding, we have not been starving or thirsting spiritually, nor have we been lacking His love. Thankfully we can therefore say, as David did: “Jehovah is my Shepherd. I shall lack nothing. In grassy pastures he makes me lie down; by well-watered resting places he conducts me. My soul he refreshes.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964363/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 23:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>UNITY UNDER PERSECUTION</strong></p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">10, 11.

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page216" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="216" data-before-text="216"></span><strong>“Shepherd My Little Sheep”</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">FOR thousands of years sheep have played a vital role in the lives of pastoral people. In Bible times they were a common sight, and their characteristics were well known to the people of that time as well as the responsibilities that rested upon the shoulders of shepherds. It is understandable, then, why this meek animal is mentioned over 700 times in the Bible and is frequently used there in a symbolic manner. Jesus Christ used them this way when he told Peter: “Shepherd my little sheep.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 21:16</a>) He was referring to Christians whose care he was placing in the hands of overseers like Peter.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Unlike most domestic animals, sheep are timid and unable to defend themselves. This fact requires them to depend entirely upon their shepherd for protection from predatory animals. So too Christians trust in the Good Shepherd, Jesus Christ, and the Great Shepherd, Jehovah God. In Bible times when sheep were led back to their sheepfold in the evening, they had no reason to fear wild animals that might be lurking in the dark shadows of rocky valleys. Their shepherd was with them and ready to protect them with his sturdy staff and other weapons even at the cost of his life.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">David, who was well acquainted with sheep because of having been a shepherd himself, beautifully expressed this trust when he wrote in the twenty-third Psalm: “Even though I walk in the valley of deep shadow, I fear nothing bad, for you are with me; your rod and your staff are the things that comfort me.” Like a trusting sheep, David looked to Jehovah God as his Shepherd for protection, guidance and the provision of his needs. “Jehovah is my Shepherd. I shall lack nothing.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 23:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Although sheep can exist longer without water than most domestic animals, they should be within easy reach of it. Depending upon how hot the weather is, they will drink from one to four quarts of water every day. In Bible times shepherds would bring their sheep to water around noon, when the sun had become very hot. There in the shaded watering place the sheep were permitted to drink their fill and to rest on patches of green grass, contentedly chewing their cuds. Alluding to this, David wrote: “In grassy pastures he makes me lie down; by well-watered resting places he conducts me. My soul he refreshes.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 23:2, 3</a>) So too is the Christian refreshed by the waters of truth that his spiritual shepherds see that he receives.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>FEEDING HABITS</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">It is the custom of sheep to start feeding early in the morning and then to lie down during midday in a shaded place to regurgitate the food they have eaten that it might be thoroughly chewed. Similarly the Christian who is conscious of his spiritual <span id="page217" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="217" data-before-text="217"></span>need begins each day by feeding upon Scriptural truths. During the day he will bring back to mind what he has read that he might meditate upon it.</p>

<strong>Walking in the Name of Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[27]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> To gain the full blessing of this knowledge <span id="page527" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="527" data-before-text="527"></span>we must approach the source or find the channel through which the waters of truth are flowing. We cannot stay to ourselves and think it will come to us. No one in a desert is so foolish as to wait for water to come to him, but he anxiously searches for the nearest oasis, knowing it means life. Neither should we think Jehovah is going to change his way to accommodate us or to agree with the faith of our parents; rather we must seek out our Creator and his will for us. So when all around us we see Christendom’s dry pastures and notice the lack of real Bible knowledge among her people, we can appreciate the necessity of going where we can enjoy the refreshing river of water of life, which flows out from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the channel he directs. We find it is Jehovah’s Word that guides us in the way he would have us go. As <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959643/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 23:2</a> says: “By well-watered resting places he conducts me.” When Jehovah himself conducts us in his way, should we turn him down? We would never think of rejecting an invitation from God. Yet that is what it amounts to if we turn down the invitation of our brothers to attend the meetings scheduled at the Kingdom Hall. This is a place of rest from old-world problems where the waters of truth are freely shared, a place of refreshment for our souls.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="qu"> 6. How is Jehovah’s way seen to be a way of association now and in the future?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[28]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Perhaps you say you cannot attend meetings because it takes too much effort to get there. Assembling together with those of true faith is a part of doing things Jehovah’s way. In the new world we will assemble together at Jehovah’s direction. If we cannot be bothered now, we should not expect to be among those whose seed and name remain to enjoy those post-Armageddon assembly blessings. “‘And it will certainly occur that from new moon to new moon and from sabbath to sabbath all flesh will come in to bow down before me,’ Jehovah has said.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959643/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isa. 66:23</a>) Then all will be united in pure worship, no longer divided by sectarianism, for all flesh will be united in honoring Jehovah. If we hope to be among the men of faith who will assemble then, we must show it by assembling regularly with the congregation of Jehovah’s people now where his spirit is poured out to bless his servants as they consider his Word and their relationship to him. Since it can be seen that Jehovah’s way is a way of association, the reader is warmly invited to join regularly with Jehovah’s witnesses at the local Kingdom Hall in Bible study.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="qu"> 7. Why is the worldly attitude of never discussing religion improper?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Having appreciation for our association with the New World society and the understanding of the truth with which we have been blessed, we should be anxious to share it with others. Then our love for Jehovah will be reflected in our love for our neighbors as we encourage them to learn the truth. Do not take the old-world attitude when it comes to talking about religion and clam up or refuse to discuss it. These are matters that pertain to heavenly wisdom and life. Jesus himself was outspoken when it came to religion and the Scriptures, and all sincere people should have the same keen interest in such things whether they agree at first or not. The words, “Come, now, you people, and let us set matters straight between us,” have timely application for those desiring to learn more of Jehovah’s way. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959643/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isa. 1:18</a>) If we are ashamed to speak of Jehovah, he will be ashamed of us. If we are just lukewarm, we shall be cast off. Instead, we should show a sincere desire to follow Jehovah’s way actively by learning it, talking about it freely and with boldness, and becoming a doer of the word.</p>

<strong>International Praise to the One God</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[79]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> But a dead Jesus would not serve to vindicate himself as a Son of God faithful to the death nor to vindicate Jehovah God as universal Sovereign Lord with all power and dominion. Having this in mind, Jehovah in the Psalms foretold Jesus’ resurrection from the dead. The dead Jesus was buried in a nearby tomb in a rock and thus his soul, which he had poured out in death, went to Sheol or mankind’s common grave. But Jesus died with full hope of a resurrection, his hope being voiced in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 16:8-11</a>: “I have placed Jehovah in front of me constantly. Because [he] is at my right hand I shall not be made to totter. Therefore my heart does rejoice and my glory is inclined to be joyful. Also, <span id="page631" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="631" data-before-text="631"></span>my own flesh will reside in security. For you will not leave my soul in Sheol. You will not allow your man of loving-kindness to see the pit. You will cause me to know the path of life. Rejoicing to the full is with your face; there is pleasantness at your right hand forever.” That this and other prophecies of the Psalms might be carried out, Jehovah God brushed aside the Devil’s preventive efforts and raised Jesus from the dead, delivering him from Sheol on the third day. God rewarded him with a spirit body in place of the sacrificed human body, that he might know again the path of life and know pleasantness at God’s right hand forever.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Acts 2:22-31</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>THE CONGREGATION AND THE KINGDOM COVENANT</strong></p><p id="p80" data-pid="80" class="qu">20.

His work was to make known the name and the sovereignty of the one true God; it was to be the foremost witness of Jehovah, it was to gather about him a congregation of disciples, spiritual brothers, who should carry forward and finish on earth the work of Kingdom witnessing that he had begun. That was part of Jehovah’s will for Jesus, as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Psalm 40:8-10</a> foretold: “To do your will, O my God, I have delighted, and your law is within my inward parts.

Your righteousness I have not covered over within my heart. Your faithfulness and your salvation I have declared. I have not hidden your loving-kindness and your trueness in the big congregation.” True to this prophecy that was written about him in the roll of God’s Bible Jesus proceeded to gather twelve apostles and other disciples round about him. To this “little flock” he was Jehovah’s Right Shepherd. But he himself was the “Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world,” and so, like the psalmist David, he could say to God his Father: “Jehovah is my Shepherd. I shall lack nothing. In grassy pastures he makes me lie down; by well-watered resting places he conducts me.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ps. 23:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p81" data-pid="81" class="qu">21.

<strong>Will You Get to Live on Earth Forever?</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Before talking to others it is best to talk to ourselves, to soliloquize. This will impress the truths on our own mind for the guidance of our tongue. Such meditation and self-preparation was done by Christ Jesus, the Greater David: “Of the glorious splendor of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works, I will meditate,” or, “soliloquise.” During Jesus’ forty-day fast and isolation in the wilderness after his baptism he meditated, trying to take in the full meaning of the things that the opened heavens had bared to his view. This meditation fortified him for what was ahead. The Bible shows that from time to time Jesus sought solitude for meditation and prayer: “He went up into the mountain by himself,” and, “He continued in retirement in the deserts and praying.” But it was difficult for Jesus to get the solitude he needed for meditation and prayer: “He went out and proceeded to a lonely place. But the crowds began hunting about for him and came out as far as he was,” and, “Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he rose up and went outside and left for a lonely place,” but “those with him hunted him down and found him.” To avoid city crowds “he continued outside in lonely places. Yet they kept coming to him <span id="page469" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="469" data-before-text="469"></span>from all sides.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 145:5</a>, <em>RS; RoPss;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 14:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Luke 5:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 4:42;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/8/3" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> Mark 1:35, 36,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/8/4" data-bid="9-5" class="b"> 45</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu"> 7.

In many places in the world simplicity of living has been replaced by a life of complexity, with waking hours crammed with both important and trivial matters. Moreover, people today are developing an aversion to thinking. They fear being alone with their own thoughts. If other people are not around, they fill the void with television, movies, light reading matter, or if they go to the beach or park the portable radio goes too so they will not have to be with their own thoughts. Their thinking must be channeled for them, ready-made by propagandists. This suits Satan’s purpose. He deluges the mass mind with anything and everything but God’s truth. To keep minds from doing godly thinking Satan keeps them busy with thoughts that are either trivial or ungodly. It is tailor-made thinking, and the tailor of it is the Devil. Minds work, but in the way that a horse is led. Independent thinking is difficult, unpopular and even suspect. Thought conformity is the order of our day. To seek solitude for meditation is frowned upon as antisocial and neurotic.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rev. 16:13, 14</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 8. What conditions are necessary for the best meditation?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> As Jehovah’s servants we must obey his command to meditate. The rush of events sometimes sweeps us along like a chip on the river, with no chance to guide or control our own course unless we put up a struggle against the current and work our way into a side eddy or calm pool for pause and reflection. We are like sparrows in a tornado, whirled in circles, round and round the daily cycles with no chance for repose, unless we can fight our way into the calm eye of the windstorm for regular periods of meditation on spiritual matters. To meditate we must have peace and quiet, must shut out sounds that assault the ear and blind ourselves to sights that distract the eye. The organs of sense must be soothed so they will not be occupying the mind with their messages, thus freeing the mind to think of other things, new things, different things, freeing it to probe within itself instead of being barraged from without. If a room is full more persons cannot enter. If the mind is occupied new thoughts cannot come. We must make room to receive when we meditate. We must open the arms of the mind to new thoughts, and do this by clearing our mind of the everyday thoughts and concerns, by shutting out the daily jumble of complex modern living. It takes time and solitude to thus empty and free the mind of the daily whirling turmoil, but if we do this the mind will graze its way through the green pastures of God’s Word and will be soothed by the restful waters of truth. Meditation will bring you many fresh, delectable, spiritual tidbits; doing it regularly will spiritually revive, renew and replenish you. Then you can say of Jehovah: “He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters; he restores my soul.” Or, “He gives me new life.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 23:2, 3</a>, <em>RS; AT</em>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 9. In what ways is meditation compared to a well of water?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> If a well is full some water must be dipped out before more can filter in. If it is dipped out rapidly with no time allowed for refilling the well will go dry. If you never take water out it will become stagnant. If trash is thrown into the well there is less room for water. There is only so much space and the water level is constant. So it is with the mind. It can be a well of wisdom, full of Jehovah’s waters of truth that bring life: “The mouth of a righteous <span id="page470" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="470" data-before-text="470"></span>man is a well of life.” Words from the mouth, like water from the well’s opening, can refresh and enliven people. “The words of a man’s mouth are deep waters; the fountain of wisdom is a bubbling brook.” If our words are to be a bubbling brook of wisdom instead of a babbling brook of trivialities, we must meditate. We must empty our mind of old thoughts to make room for new ones, then we must give time for the new ones to filter in by meditation. If we do not keep our thoughts moving, changing, they become stagnant and stale. If we let all the worldly trash and satanic propaganda fill our mind there will be no room for godly thinking. So it is with the mind as with the well: if we are always dipping out the well goes dry, if we never dip out it becomes stale. There is a time for dipping out, there is a time for seeping in. There is a time to speak and a time to refrain, a time to meditate and a time to communicate, a time to think and a time to tell what you have thought. To give we must first get. We must take in before we can give out. We must fill before we can empty, and must empty before we can fill again. It is a process of both getting and giving, not just one or the other. Keep the waters of truth running into your mind, through your mind, out of your mouth. Then it will be “a well of living water.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Prov. 10:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 18:4</a>, <em>AT;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. 26:19</a>, <em>NW,</em> mar.</p>

A track is a narrow footpath or trail. These “tracks” are determined by Jehovah’s standard of righteousness.

Since Jehovah is “the abiding place of righteousness,” his worshippers are happy to look to him to determine the morally upright path that they should follow.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011128/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jer. 50:7</a>.</p>

<strong>Jehovah Is Our Shepherd</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>“He Leads Me”</strong></p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 9. What peaceful scene does David describe, and how would sheep come to be in such a setting?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> First, Jehovah <em>leads</em> his people. David writes: “In grassy pastures he makes me lie down; by well-watered resting-places he conducts me. My soul he refreshes. He leads me in the tracks of righteousness for his name’s sake.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 23:2, 3</a>) A flock lying down peacefully in the midst of abundance​—David here paints a scene of contentment, refreshment, and security. The Hebrew word rendered “pastures” can mean “pleasant place.” Likely, on their own, the sheep would not find a refreshing spot to lie down in peace. Their shepherd must lead them to such a “pleasant place.”</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">10. How does God show his confidence in us?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> How does Jehovah lead us today? One way he does so is by example. His Word urges us to “become imitators of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:1</a>) The context of those words mentions compassion, forgiveness, and love. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 5:2</a>) Certainly, Jehovah sets the finest example in displaying such warm qualities. Is he being unrealistic in asking us to imitate him? No. That inspired counsel is actually a marvelous expression of his confidence in us. In what way? We are made in God’s image, meaning that we are endowed with moral qualities <span id="page18" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>and the capacity for spirituality. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Genesis 1:26</a>) Hence, Jehovah knows that despite our imperfections, we have within us the potential for cultivating the same qualities that he exemplifies. Just think​—our loving God is confident that we can be like him. If we follow his example, he will lead us, as it were, to a pleasant ‘resting-place.’ In the midst of this violent world, we will “dwell in security,” experiencing the peace that comes from knowing that we have God’s approval.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 4:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 29:11</a>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">11. In leading his sheep, what does Jehovah consider, and how is this reflected in what he asks of us?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> In leading us, Jehovah is tender and patient. A shepherd considers the limitations of his sheep, so he leads “according to the pace of the livestock.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Genesis 33:14</a>) Jehovah likewise leads “according to the pace of” his sheep. He considers our abilities and circumstances. In effect, he adjusts the pace, never asking more than we can give. What he does ask is that we be whole-souled. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Colossians 3:23</a>) But what if you are older and cannot do what you used to? Or what if you have a serious illness that limits you? Therein lies the beauty of the requirement that we be whole-souled. No two souls are exactly alike. Serving whole-souled means using all your strength and energy to the fullest extent possible <em>for you</em> in God’s service. Despite the frailties that may affect our pace, Jehovah values our wholehearted worship.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Mark 12:29, 30</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">12.

Jehovah wanted fine offerings that were prompted by grateful hearts. At the same time, the offerings were graded according to the offerer’s ability. The Law said: “If . . . he cannot afford enough for a sheep, then he must bring . . . two turtledoves or two young pigeons.” And if he could not afford even two pigeons? Then he could bring some “fine flour.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Leviticus 5:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 11</a>) This shows that God did not demand what was beyond the offerer’s reach. Since God does not change, we can find comfort in knowing that he never asks more than we can give; rather, he is pleased to accept what is within our reach. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Malachi 3:6</a>) What a pleasure it is to be led by such an understanding Shepherd!</p>

Hence, it is good for Christians to make it a practice to read a portion of the Bible every day. Do you do this? Some find it helpful to memorize certain texts, such as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988487/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Exodus 34:6, 7</a> or <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988487/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:5, 6</a>. Why is this beneficial? Well, if a crisis should occur and you do not have a Bible handy, comforting Scriptural thoughts can immediately strengthen you.

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page216" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="216" data-before-text="216"></span><strong>“Shepherd My Little Sheep”</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">FOR thousands of years sheep have played a vital role in the lives of pastoral people. In Bible times they were a common sight, and their characteristics were well known to the people of that time as well as the responsibilities that rested upon the shoulders of shepherds. It is understandable, then, why this meek animal is mentioned over 700 times in the Bible and is frequently used there in a symbolic manner. Jesus Christ used them this way when he told Peter: “Shepherd my little sheep.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 21:16</a>) He was referring to Christians whose care he was placing in the hands of overseers like Peter.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Unlike most domestic animals, sheep are timid and unable to defend themselves. This fact requires them to depend entirely upon their shepherd for protection from predatory animals. So too Christians trust in the Good Shepherd, Jesus Christ, and the Great Shepherd, Jehovah God. In Bible times when sheep were led back to their sheepfold in the evening, they had no reason to fear wild animals that might be lurking in the dark shadows of rocky valleys. Their shepherd was with them and ready to protect them with his sturdy staff and other weapons even at the cost of his life.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">David, who was well acquainted with sheep because of having been a shepherd himself, beautifully expressed this trust when he wrote in the twenty-third Psalm: “Even though I walk in the valley of deep shadow, I fear nothing bad, for you are with me; your rod and your staff are the things that comfort me.” Like a trusting sheep, David looked to Jehovah God as his Shepherd for protection, guidance and the provision of his needs. “Jehovah is my Shepherd. I shall lack nothing.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 23:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Although sheep can exist longer without water than most domestic animals, they should be within easy reach of it. Depending upon how hot the weather is, they will drink from one to four quarts of water every day. In Bible times shepherds would bring their sheep to water around noon, when the sun had become very hot. There in the shaded watering place the sheep were permitted to drink their fill and to rest on patches of green grass, contentedly chewing their cuds. Alluding to this, David wrote: “In grassy pastures he makes me lie down; by well-watered resting places he conducts me. My soul he refreshes.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 23:2, 3</a>) So too is the Christian refreshed by the waters of truth that his spiritual shepherds see that he receives.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>FEEDING HABITS</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">It is the custom of sheep to start feeding early in the morning and then to lie down during midday in a shaded place to regurgitate the food they have eaten that it might be thoroughly chewed. Similarly the Christian who is conscious of his spiritual <span id="page217" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="217" data-before-text="217"></span>need begins each day by feeding upon Scriptural truths. During the day he will bring back to mind what he has read that he might meditate upon it.</p>

<strong>Will You Get to Live on Earth Forever?</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Before talking to others it is best to talk to ourselves, to soliloquize. This will impress the truths on our own mind for the guidance of our tongue. Such meditation and self-preparation was done by Christ Jesus, the Greater David: “Of the glorious splendor of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works, I will meditate,” or, “soliloquise.” During Jesus’ forty-day fast and isolation in the wilderness after his baptism he meditated, trying to take in the full meaning of the things that the opened heavens had bared to his view. This meditation fortified him for what was ahead. The Bible shows that from time to time Jesus sought solitude for meditation and prayer: “He went up into the mountain by himself,” and, “He continued in retirement in the deserts and praying.” But it was difficult for Jesus to get the solitude he needed for meditation and prayer: “He went out and proceeded to a lonely place. But the crowds began hunting about for him and came out as far as he was,” and, “Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he rose up and went outside and left for a lonely place,” but “those with him hunted him down and found him.” To avoid city crowds “he continued outside in lonely places. Yet they kept coming to him <span id="page469" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="469" data-before-text="469"></span>from all sides.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 145:5</a>, <em>RS; RoPss;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 14:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Luke 5:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 4:42;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/8/3" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> Mark 1:35, 36,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/8/4" data-bid="9-5" class="b"> 45</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu"> 7.

In many places in the world simplicity of living has been replaced by a life of complexity, with waking hours crammed with both important and trivial matters. Moreover, people today are developing an aversion to thinking. They fear being alone with their own thoughts. If other people are not around, they fill the void with television, movies, light reading matter, or if they go to the beach or park the portable radio goes too so they will not have to be with their own thoughts. Their thinking must be channeled for them, ready-made by propagandists. This suits Satan’s purpose. He deluges the mass mind with anything and everything but God’s truth. To keep minds from doing godly thinking Satan keeps them busy with thoughts that are either trivial or ungodly. It is tailor-made thinking, and the tailor of it is the Devil. Minds work, but in the way that a horse is led. Independent thinking is difficult, unpopular and even suspect. Thought conformity is the order of our day. To seek solitude for meditation is frowned upon as antisocial and neurotic.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rev. 16:13, 14</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 8. What conditions are necessary for the best meditation?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> As Jehovah’s servants we must obey his command to meditate. The rush of events sometimes sweeps us along like a chip on the river, with no chance to guide or control our own course unless we put up a struggle against the current and work our way into a side eddy or calm pool for pause and reflection. We are like sparrows in a tornado, whirled in circles, round and round the daily cycles with no chance for repose, unless we can fight our way into the calm eye of the windstorm for regular periods of meditation on spiritual matters. To meditate we must have peace and quiet, must shut out sounds that assault the ear and blind ourselves to sights that distract the eye. The organs of sense must be soothed so they will not be occupying the mind with their messages, thus freeing the mind to think of other things, new things, different things, freeing it to probe within itself instead of being barraged from without. If a room is full more persons cannot enter. If the mind is occupied new thoughts cannot come. We must make room to receive when we meditate. We must open the arms of the mind to new thoughts, and do this by clearing our mind of the everyday thoughts and concerns, by shutting out the daily jumble of complex modern living. It takes time and solitude to thus empty and free the mind of the daily whirling turmoil, but if we do this the mind will graze its way through the green pastures of God’s Word and will be soothed by the restful waters of truth. Meditation will bring you many fresh, delectable, spiritual tidbits; doing it regularly will spiritually revive, renew and replenish you. Then you can say of Jehovah: “He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters; he restores my soul.” Or, “He gives me new life.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 23:2, 3</a>, <em>RS; AT</em>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 9. In what ways is meditation compared to a well of water?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> If a well is full some water must be dipped out before more can filter in. If it is dipped out rapidly with no time allowed for refilling the well will go dry. If you never take water out it will become stagnant. If trash is thrown into the well there is less room for water. There is only so much space and the water level is constant. So it is with the mind. It can be a well of wisdom, full of Jehovah’s waters of truth that bring life: “The mouth of a righteous <span id="page470" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="470" data-before-text="470"></span>man is a well of life.” Words from the mouth, like water from the well’s opening, can refresh and enliven people. “The words of a man’s mouth are deep waters; the fountain of wisdom is a bubbling brook.” If our words are to be a bubbling brook of wisdom instead of a babbling brook of trivialities, we must meditate. We must empty our mind of old thoughts to make room for new ones, then we must give time for the new ones to filter in by meditation. If we do not keep our thoughts moving, changing, they become stagnant and stale. If we let all the worldly trash and satanic propaganda fill our mind there will be no room for godly thinking. So it is with the mind as with the well: if we are always dipping out the well goes dry, if we never dip out it becomes stale. There is a time for dipping out, there is a time for seeping in. There is a time to speak and a time to refrain, a time to meditate and a time to communicate, a time to think and a time to tell what you have thought. To give we must first get. We must take in before we can give out. We must fill before we can empty, and must empty before we can fill again. It is a process of both getting and giving, not just one or the other. Keep the waters of truth running into your mind, through your mind, out of your mouth. Then it will be “a well of living water.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Prov. 10:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 18:4</a>, <em>AT;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. 26:19</a>, <em>NW,</em> mar.</p>

David had been through many dark valleys​—times when his very life was in danger. But he did not allow fear to dominate him, for he sensed that God​—with His “rod” and “staff” at the ready—​was with him. This awareness of protection comforted David and no doubt drew him closer to Jehovah.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2005805/1">b</a></p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">14.

Jehovah can “nudge” us, perhaps by means of a fellow worshipper, to apply Bible-based counsel that may make a big difference in our situation. In addition, Jehovah can give us the strength to endure. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Philippians 4:13</a>) By means of his holy spirit, he can equip us with “power beyond what is normal.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>) God’s spirit can enable us to endure any test that Satan might bring upon us.

Our Shepherd is with us, helping us in ways that we may not fully perceive at first. Consider the experience of a Christian elder who was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. “I must admit that at first I found myself wondering if Jehovah was angry at me or even if he loved me. But I was determined not to pull away from Jehovah. Instead, I voiced my concerns to him. And Jehovah helped me, often comforting me through my brothers and sisters. Many shared helpful insights based on their own experience of coping with serious illness. Their balanced comments reminded me that there was nothing unusual about what I was going through. Practical assistance, including some touching offers of kindness, reassured me that Jehovah was not displeased with me. Of course, I must continue to battle my illness, and I do not know what the outcome will be. But I am convinced that Jehovah is with me and that he will continue to help me through this trial.”</p>

A valley, or ravine, where beasts of prey lurk in the shadows is a dangerous place for sheep. David passed through many perilous valleys in his life, with death staring him in the face. But since God was leading him, he was confident and did not give way to unrestrained fear. We should have similar confidence in Jehovah. This reference to “deep shadow” may also remind us of Isaiah’s prophecy: “Those dwelling in the land of deep shadow, light itself has shone upon them.” Matthew referred to this prophecy and applied it to Jesus Christ, saying: “The people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and as for those sitting in a region of deathly shadow, light rose upon them.” How? By the great preaching campaign that Jesus conducted.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988487/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Isaiah 9:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988487/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> Matthew 4:13-16</a>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">12.

Danger brings us closer to our loving Father, Jehovah. We then enjoy a more intimate relationship with him. By means of prayer and supplication, we can call upon him for protection, and thus overcome our fears.​—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988487/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Zephaniah 3:12</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">14.

Both the rod and the staff can be used for defense and to represent or indicate authority. Certainly, these implements would be very useful in beating off such predators as wolves and snakes. A shepherd’s crook could also be used to nudge sheep in the right direction or even to draw back a sheep straying too close to a spot where it might fall and get hurt. Today, Jehovah provides faithful shepherds, elders in congregations, who defend the flock from such spiritual predators as apostates. Or the elders may have to counsel those who become lax in meeting attendance or deviate from Christian conduct.</p>

Wild beasts might be lurking in a dark valley or ravine. Or there might be bandits lying in wait. There might also be a number of deep pits. Without the attention and care of a shepherd, a sheep would, therefore, be in grave danger. Similarly, David came into dangerous situations. But because of his trust in Jehovah, the Great Shepherd, David felt secure.</p>

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page216" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="216" data-before-text="216"></span><strong>“Shepherd My Little Sheep”</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">FOR thousands of years sheep have played a vital role in the lives of pastoral people. In Bible times they were a common sight, and their characteristics were well known to the people of that time as well as the responsibilities that rested upon the shoulders of shepherds. It is understandable, then, why this meek animal is mentioned over 700 times in the Bible and is frequently used there in a symbolic manner. Jesus Christ used them this way when he told Peter: “Shepherd my little sheep.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 21:16</a>) He was referring to Christians whose care he was placing in the hands of overseers like Peter.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Unlike most domestic animals, sheep are timid and unable to defend themselves. This fact requires them to depend entirely upon their shepherd for protection from predatory animals. So too Christians trust in the Good Shepherd, Jesus Christ, and the Great Shepherd, Jehovah God. In Bible times when sheep were led back to their sheepfold in the evening, they had no reason to fear wild animals that might be lurking in the dark shadows of rocky valleys. Their shepherd was with them and ready to protect them with his sturdy staff and other weapons even at the cost of his life.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">David, who was well acquainted with sheep because of having been a shepherd himself, beautifully expressed this trust when he wrote in the twenty-third Psalm: “Even though I walk in the valley of deep shadow, I fear nothing bad, for you are with me; your rod and your staff are the things that comfort me.” Like a trusting sheep, David looked to Jehovah God as his Shepherd for protection, guidance and the provision of his needs. “Jehovah is my Shepherd. I shall lack nothing.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 23:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Although sheep can exist longer without water than most domestic animals, they should be within easy reach of it. Depending upon how hot the weather is, they will drink from one to four quarts of water every day. In Bible times shepherds would bring their sheep to water around noon, when the sun had become very hot. There in the shaded watering place the sheep were permitted to drink their fill and to rest on patches of green grass, contentedly chewing their cuds. Alluding to this, David wrote: “In grassy pastures he makes me lie down; by well-watered resting places he conducts me. My soul he refreshes.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 23:2, 3</a>) So too is the Christian refreshed by the waters of truth that his spiritual shepherds see that he receives.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>FEEDING HABITS</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">It is the custom of sheep to start feeding early in the morning and then to lie down during midday in a shaded place to regurgitate the food they have eaten that it might be thoroughly chewed. Similarly the Christian who is conscious of his spiritual <span id="page217" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="217" data-before-text="217"></span>need begins each day by feeding upon Scriptural truths. During the day he will bring back to mind what he has read that he might meditate upon it.</p>

Although American by birth, we spoke Spanish and had no financial obligations. Since we knew that the ‘fishing for men’ was good in Ecuador, we planned to put down our nets in those productive waters.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101998249/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 4:19</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">After a few exciting days at the Ecuador branch office of the Watch Tower Society, we went to the bus station in Guayaquil, eager to travel to Machala—one of the cities where there was a particular need. While waiting for the bus, however, my husband, Fred, suddenly did not feel well, so we decided to delay our journey. I went to a phone booth to make arrangements to return to the branch while Fred sat down with our luggage. When I returned a few minutes later, my husband had disappeared!</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">I never saw Fred alive again. Right there in the bus station, during my brief absence, he had suffered massive heart failure. As I frantically looked for him, a bus station official came up and told me that Fred had been taken to the hospital. When I got to the hospital, I learned that he had already died.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Suddenly, I found myself alone in a strange country, with no home and no husband to lean on. I say “lean on” because Fred had always taken the lead and organized things for both of us. I don’t have a strong personality and was happy for him to do that. But now I had to make the decisions, organize my life and, at the same time, overcome my grief. It was a devastating feeling—as if I had been plunged into a “valley of deep shadow.” Would I ever learn to cope on my own?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>Learning the Truth and Simplifying Our Lives</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Both Fred and I had already been married and divorced when we first met each other. A good friendship blossomed into a close relationship, and we decided to get married. We were nominal churchgoers in Seattle, Washington, U.S.A. But religion was not very important in our lives until Jamie, a delightful young pioneer (full-time evangelizer), called at our door. She was so pleasant that I accepted her offer to study the Bible with me.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">As Fred also showed interest, Jamie’s parents took over the study, and a year later, in 1968, both of us were baptized. From the start, we were keen to put the interests of <span id="page22" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>God’s Kingdom first in our lives. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101998249/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 6:33</a>) The couple who studied with us, Lorne and Rudi Knust, certainly set the example in this regard. Not long after our baptism, they moved to a town on the East Coast of the United States to serve where the need was greater. This sowed a seed in our hearts.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">We had another reason for thinking about a move. Fred was manager of a large department store. His work was very absorbing, and he realized that a move elsewhere would enable him to simplify his life and give more attention to the truth and to our two children. I also had a daughter from my first marriage, who was now married, and both she and her husband had also accepted the truth, so our decision to leave Seattle was difficult. Still, they understood our motives and supported our decision.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Thus it was that in 1973 we moved to Spain, a country where, at that time, there was an enormous need for preachers of the good news and brothers to take the lead. Fred had calculated that if we lived frugally, our savings would be sufficient to pay our expenses in Spain, and we could devote most of our time to the ministry. And that is what we did. Before long, Fred was serving as an elder, and by 1983 we were both pioneers.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">For 20 years we served in Spain, learning to speak the language and enjoying many fine experiences. Often Fred and I preached together and studied with married couples, several of whom are now baptized Witnesses. After some years in Spain, our two younger children, Heidi and Mike, also took up the pioneer service. Although we had little materially, this was the happiest time of my life. Our lives were simple. We could spend a lot of time together as a family, and like the widow’s oil in the Bible account, our carefully administered savings never ran out.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101998249/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Kings 17:14-16</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>Changing Countries Once Again</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">By 1992 we once again began thinking about a move. Our children had grown up, and the need in Spain was less than before. We knew a missionary who had served in Ecuador, and he told us about the pressing need for pioneers and elders in that country. Were we too old to think about starting again in a new country? We did not think so, since both of us had good health and loved the preaching work. So we got in touch with the Ecuador branch and began to make our plans. In fact, my daughter Heidi and her husband, Juan Manuel, who were serving in the north of Spain, were also keen to join us.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Finally, by February 1993, we had arranged all our affairs and had arrived in our new country. We were both thrilled with the prospect of pioneering in Ecuador, where so many people were eager to study the Bible. After a warm welcome at the branch, we planned to visit several cities that were recommended as places where there was a particular need. But then my husband died.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>In “the Valley of Deep Shadow”</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">At first I felt shock, then sheer disbelief. Fred had hardly ever been ill before. What should I do? Where should I go? I just could not think.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">During those worst moments of my life, I was blessed with the support of compassionate spiritual brothers and sisters, most of whom hardly even knew me. The brothers at the branch were very kind and took care of everything, including the funeral arrangements. I particularly remember the love shown to me by Brother and Sister Bonno. They made sure that I was never on my own, and Edith Bonno even slept at the foot of my bed for several nights so that I would not feel alone. In fact, the whole Bethel family showed such love and consideration that it was as if they had wrapped me up in a warm, protective blanket of love.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><span id="page23" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>Within a few days, my three children were with me as well, and their support was invaluable. Still, although I had many loving people surrounding me during the day, getting through the long nights was more difficult. That was when Jehovah sustained me. Whenever terrible loneliness swept over me, I turned to him in prayer, and he comforted me.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">After the funeral the question arose, What should I do with my life? I wanted to stay in Ecuador because that had been our joint decision, but I did not feel I could do it alone. So Heidi and Juan Manuel, who had been planning to move to Ecuador in the near future, adjusted their plans so that they could come right away and we could all serve together.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Within a month, we found a house in Loja, one of the cities the branch had recommended. I was soon busy organizing things, getting settled in a new home, and starting to preach in a new country. All that activity alleviated my grief somewhat. Moreover, I could cry with my daughter, who had been very close to Fred, and that helped me release my feelings.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">After a couple of months, however, when I had settled into my new routine, the realization of my terrible loss became more acute. I found that I could not think about the happy times Fred and I had shared, since it upset me so much. I shut out the past and lived from one day to the next, unable to think much about the future. But I did try to fill each day with something meaningful, especially my preaching activity. That is what kept me going.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">I have always loved preaching and teaching the Bible, and in Ecuador the people were so receptive that this work was a delight. One of the first times I went out in the house-to-house work there, I met a young married woman who said: “Yes, I would like to learn about the Bible!” She was the first Bible study I started in Ecuador. That kind of experience absorbed my attention and prevented me from thinking too much about my own sorrow. Jehovah richly blessed my field service. It seemed that almost every time I went out preaching the good news, I had a fine experience.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Without doubt, continuing to serve as a pioneer was a blessing. It gave me an obligation to live up to and provided something positive to do every day. Within a short time, I was conducting six Bible studies.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">To illustrate the satisfaction that I receive from my ministry, let me mention a middle-aged lady who has recently shown real appreciation for Bible teachings. When I show her a scripture, she first wants to understand it thoroughly, and then she is willing to put its counsel into practice. Although she lived an immoral life in the past, when recently propositioned by a man who wanted her to live with him, she staunchly rejected his proposal. She told me how happy she was to stand firm for Scriptural standards, since she now enjoys a peace of mind she never knew before. Such studies warm my heart and make me feel useful.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="ss"><span id="page24" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span><strong>Keeping My Joy</strong></p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">While the disciple-making work brings me much joy, my grief did not quickly disappear. In my case, sadness is something that comes and goes. My daughter and son-in-law have given me wonderful support, but sometimes when I see them sharing special moments together, I feel my loss more keenly. I miss my husband very much, not only because we were so close but also because I depended on him for so many things. There are times when not being able to talk to him, to ask him for advice, or to share a field-service experience with him brings a sadness and emptiness that is by no means easy to deal with.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">What helps me on such occasions? I pray earnestly to Jehovah and ask him to help me to think about something else, something positive. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101998249/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Philippians 4:6-8</a>) And he really does help me. After some years, I am able to talk about some of the good times Fred and I enjoyed together. So, evidently the healing process is slowly having its effect. Like the psalmist David, I feel that I have walked in a “valley of deep shadow.” But Jehovah was there to comfort me, and faithful brothers kindly guided me in the right direction.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="ss"><strong>Lessons I Have Learned</strong></p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">With Fred having always taken the lead, I never thought that I would ever be able to go ahead and do things on my own. But with the help of Jehovah, my family, and the brothers, I have managed. In some ways I am stronger than before. I turn to Jehovah more often than I did, and I am learning to make decisions by myself.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">I am so glad that Fred and I had those 20 years in Spain, serving together where the need was greater. In this system of things, we never know what will happen from one day to another, so I think it is very important to do the best we can for Jehovah and for our family while we have the opportunity. Those years greatly enriched our lives and our marriage, and I am convinced that they prepared me to cope with my loss. Since pioneering had already become a way of life before Fred’s death, it gave me a sense of purpose when I was struggling to come to terms with the new reality.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">When Fred died, it seemed at first as if my life had ended also. But, of course, this was not the case. I had work to do in Jehovah’s service, and I had people to help. In view of the fact that so many around me still needed the truth, how could I quit? Helping others was good for me, as Jesus said it would be. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101998249/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>) My experiences in the field ministry gave me things to look forward to, things to plan for.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">A few days ago, a familiar feeling of loneliness again swept over me. But when I left the house to go on a Bible study, I immediately felt my spirits lifting. Two hours later I returned home satisfied and upbuilt. As the psalmist said, we may sometimes ‘sow seed with tears,’ but then Jehovah blesses our efforts, and we ‘reap with a joyful cry.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101998249/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 126:5, 6</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">Recently, because of high blood pressure, I have had to readjust my schedule a little, and I am now a regular auxiliary pioneer.

<strong>Jehovah Has Tender Affection for You</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[74]"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> <strong><em>“I fear no harm, for you are with me.”</em></strong> David’s life was often in danger, and he had many powerful enemies. However, Jehovah’s love made him feel safe and protected. David could feel that Jehovah was with him in every situation, and that reassured him. Thus, he could sing: “[Jehovah] rescued me from all my fears.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2024246/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ps. 34:4</a>) David’s fears were real, but Jehovah’s love was stronger than his fears.</p>

A pioneer named Susi describes how she and her husband felt when their son took his own life: “Sudden tragedy is traumatic and can leave one feeling vulnerable and helpless. But Jehovah’s tender affection has made us feel safe and protected.” Rachel, mentioned earlier, recalls: “One night when my heart ached terribly and I was very worried and scared, I groaned out loud to Jehovah. Right then I felt that he soothed my heart and calmed me down, as a mother does for her baby, and I fell asleep. I will never forget that moment.” An elder named Tasos spent four years in prison for refusing to join the army. How did he experience Jehovah’s love and care? He says: “Jehovah took care of all my needs and more. This strengthened my confidence that I can fully trust in him. Also, through his spirit, Jehovah gave me joy despite being in a depressing environment. This assured me that the closer I work with him, the more I will benefit from his goodness. So I began serving him as a regular pioneer while in prison.”</p>

Though similarly faced with the threat of various calamities, David was secure in the knowledge that Jehovah was his Shepherd. Therefore, he could declare: “Even though I walk in the valley of deep shadow, I fear nothing bad.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014434/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 23:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014434/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 4</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“The pronouncement of the valley of the vision” evidently relates to ancient Jerusalem.

David writes: “You arrange before me a table in front of those showing hostility to me. With oil you have greased my head; my cup is well filled.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalm 23:5</a>) In this verse, David describes his Shepherd as a generous host who provides food and drink in abundance. The two illustrations​—a caring shepherd and a generous host—​are not at odds. After all, a good shepherd must know where to find rich pasture grounds and sufficient drinking water so that his flock will “lack nothing.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 23:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">18.

There is no question about that! Just think of the quality, quantity, and variety of spiritual food that we now enjoy. Through the faithful and discreet slave class, Jehovah has provided us with helpful publications and rich programs at meetings, assemblies, and conventions​—all of which fill our spiritual needs. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45-47</a>) There is certainly no shortage of spiritual food. “The faithful and discreet slave” has produced millions of Bibles and Bible study aids, and such publications are now available in 413 languages. Jehovah has provided this spiritual food in great variety​—from “milk,” basic Bible teachings, to “solid food,” deeper spiritual information. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Hebrews 5:11-14</a>) As a result, when we face problems or decisions, we can usually find just what we need. Where would we be without such spiritual food? Our Shepherd is truly a most generous provider!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Isaiah 25:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005805/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 65:13</a>.</p>

As a very generous host, Jehovah provides an abundance of spiritual food through the anointed “slave” class. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988487/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45</a>) Although we live in a hostile world, we are well fed. <em>The Watchtower</em> is published in over a hundred languages so that people living in such diverse places as South Africa, Greenland, the Solomon Islands, and India can be fed spiritually. Besides, the approximately 55,000 congregations worldwide have well-trained public speakers and teachers and fine meeting places, including hundreds of new Kingdom Halls. Over 3,000,000 home Bible studies are being conducted to help sheeplike ones. In contrast, those in Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion, go hungry.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988487/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:13</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">16.

At that time, a sinful woman washed his feet with her tears and greased them with special perfumed oil.

Though overdrinking is not meant, these words suggest a cup of fine wine. This beverage has curative properties, as is shown by Paul’s advice to Timothy: “Do not drink water any longer, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent cases of sickness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988487/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">1 Timothy 5:23</a>) In a spiritual sense, wine also makes our hearts rejoice.

<strong>“Shepherd My Little Sheep”</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The sheepfold was used in an illustration given by Jesus to teach an important truth that involved symbolic sheep. He said: “Most truly I say to you, He that does not enter into the sheepfold through the door but climbs up some other place, that one is a thief and a plunderer. But he that enters through the door is shepherd of the sheep. All those that have come instead of me are thieves and plunderers.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 10:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 8</a>) Counterfeit messiahs have never been interested in the welfare of God’s people, who are pictured here as <span id="page218" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="218" data-before-text="218"></span>sheep. But, like robbers, they have sought to destroy God’s flock.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The thief that succeeded in climbing over the wall of the sheepfold undetected would quickly cut the throats of as many sheep as he could and then hoist their carcasses over the wall to his accomplices. “The thief does not come unless it is to steal and slay and destroy.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 10:10</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Jesus came to bring life to the world of mankind, not to rob and destroy. As a shepherd shows loving concern for his sheep, so Jesus Christ showed loving concern for the people, the sheep of God’s pasturage. He proved himself to be the right kind of shepherd. “I have come that they might have life and might have it in abundance. I am the right shepherd; the right shepherd surrenders his soul in behalf of the sheep.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 10:10, 11</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Jesus likened himself to the door of the sheepfold when he said: “I am the door; whoever enters through me will be saved and he will go in and out and find pasturage.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 10:9</a>) What Jesus was illustrating here was the fact that he is mankind’s Mediator with God. By virtue of the ransom sacrifice that purchased mankind, all people must approach God through him. “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 14:6</a>) As a shepherd leads his sheep into the protective confines of the sheepfold as well as takes them out to pasture, so Jesus Christ cares for those who, by their faith, prove to be his Father’s sheep.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>CHARACTERISTICS</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">A physical characteristic that is peculiar to the breed of sheep that is popular in the Near East is an enormously fat tail. The tail becomes a deposit of fat that the animal can draw upon when food is scarce. It is a large, loose mass of fat upon the rump and about the root of the tail. Sometimes a tail will weigh as much as thirty-five pounds. When it becomes so large and heavy that it is liable to be injured, the shepherd will support it on a small cart that the sheep pulls as it moves about. The fat is considered a delicacy in the Near East and is frequently used in making pastry. This deposit of fat might be likened to the strength, zeal and devotion of Christians that they draw upon to help them maintain integrity to God.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">That this breed of sheep appears to have been the type used in Bible times for sacrifices is indicated by Scriptural references to the fatty tail. “You must take from the ram the fat and the fat tail.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ex. 29:22</a>) “From the communion sacrifice he must present its fat as an offering made by fire to Jehovah. The entire fatty tail near the backbone is what he will remove.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Lev. 3:9</a>) As the fat of these meek sheep was offered in sacrifice, so Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, offered his strength, zeal and devotion as God’s self-sacrificing Son. This was a sweet smell of appeasement to Jehovah God.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Sheep have the characteristic of flocking together and being willing to follow a leader. Because of this instinct a shepherd that sees a sheep off by itself knows that it is either sick, injured or lost. He will go after it and bring it back to the flock, where he will give what help he can for its sickness. If the sheep has been injured, the shepherd in Palestine will rub the injury with olive oil, as David mentioned: “With oil you have greased my head.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 23:5</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Symbolic sheep must also flock together and be willing to follow the leading of the Good Shepherd and their appointed overseers. In fact, they are commanded not to forsake the gathering of themselves together. If one fails to do this, the undershepherds of the congregation know that <span id="page219" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="219" data-before-text="219"></span>he is spiritually sick and needs help. If his feelings have been injured, the soothing oil of God’s Word, when applied with loving-kindness, can often heal his injury.</p>

<strong>The Prayer of Faith During Sickness</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[26]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> The context makes it clear that James is here talking, not of physical, but of spiritual sickness. He first mentions suffering evil. That refers to “suffering evil for the good news according to the power of God”. It means enduring some hardships for serving as a Christian witness of God and keeping one’s integrity toward God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951322/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Tim. 1:8</a>, <em>NW</em>) So, if one is suffering thus, let him carry on prayer so as to be helped to continue faithful, advises James. But, James, what if anyone is in good spirits? “Let him sing psalms.” Doing so, he edifies himself and those hearing him. But what if anyone is not in good spirits? In other words, what if one is sick spiritually? The fact that James contrasts being sick with being in good spirits plainly indicates he is dealing with spiritual and not physical sickness. The course of treatment he now recommends also argues it is spiritual sickness. The older men of the congregation, who are full-grown in the faith and <span id="page269" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="269" data-before-text="269"></span>full of wisdom from above and acquainted with God’s instructions, are the proper ones for the spiritually sick one to call in. If he were ailing physically, he would call in a doctor, if he could afford it, or would resort to some medicinal remedy.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="qu"> 3. Why were the older brothers to pray over the sick?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[27]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> What are the older men of the congregation to do with the one sick spiritually? They are to pray over him, so that he can hear what they pray and can show he agrees, with his “Amen!” He has fallen into such a spiritual state that he cannot properly pray on his own accord any more. Not able to ask in faith and with an unwavering mind, he has no confidence in his own prayer. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951322/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jas. 1:6, 7</a>) Something has brought on this spiritual illness. The older men must ascertain what this is. Paul, too, refers to this kind of sickness and tells one cause, the improper celebration of the Lord’s evening meal or Memorial supper. “For he that eats and drinks eats and drinks judgment against himself if he does not discern the body. That is why many among you are weak and sickly and quite a few are sleeping in death. But if we would discern what we ourselves are, we would not be judged.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951322/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:29-31</a>, <em>NW</em>) Those in this condition were not keeping unity with the Christian congregation, the body of Christ. So Paul as an older brother wrote them for their help and spiritual cure.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="qu"> 4. In what way is it that they rub the sick with oil?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[28]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> The older men of the congregation are not merely to pray with the spiritually sick. They must also rub him with oil in the name of Jehovah. Not literal oil, like the so-called “extreme unction” of Catholics, or like that described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951322/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Mark 6:13</a>. The “oil” here is the soothing word of instruction from the Holy Scriptures and it restores the spiritually sick one to unity with the Christian congregation which is in God’s favor. As it is written: “Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! It is like the precious oil upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron’s beard; that came down upon the skirt of his garments.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951322/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 133:1, 2</a>, <em>AS</em>) Speaking of oil to symbolize refreshment and soothing, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951322/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 23:5</a> (<em>Mo</em>) says: “Thou hast poured oil upon my head, my cup is brimming over.” The healthful effect of God’s message is described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951322/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:30</a> in this way: “Good tidings make the bones fat.” (<em>AS</em>) And the correction which leads to spiritual health is described as soothing and curative by the psalmist when he says: “Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness; and let him reprove me, it shall be as oil upon the head; let not my head refuse it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951322/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 141:5</a>, <em>AS</em>) And that it denotes a means of healing is shown when the good Samaritan poured oil along with wine into the wounds of the man waylaid by robbers. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951322/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 10:34</a>) So the older men of the congregation are to rub the spiritually sick one with oil in the sense of stimulating him with the soothing, healing, comforting, corrective Word of God.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="qu"> 5. How do they do this “in the name of Jehovah”? And with what effect?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> In the name of Jehovah they are to do this. That is to say, in faithfulness to Jehovah God and according to his purpose, so as to aid the spiritually ill one to recover and have a part anew in vindicating God’s name and proving the Devil a false god and liar. Those older men must <span id="page270" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="270" data-before-text="270"></span>pray in faith, believing that God’s Word is right and has power to help the sick one to see the error of his way and to recognize the right way. Such a united prayer of faith, together with the invigorating application of God’s Word, will make the spiritually indisposed person well. It will build up his confidence in God’s promise and in the rightness of God’s Word and way, and will restore him to that way. Thus “Jehovah will raise him up”, giving him strength to go in the way of truth and righteousness, and lifting him up out of his despondency and a feeling of being abandoned by God. His spiritual illness may have been due to getting into the bad habit of neglecting to meet with God’s people or due to failing to feed regularly on God’s Word and active service. Or he may have committed some serious sins for which he has been put out of favorable relationship with God and his organization. But now if he responds to the prayer offered unitedly by older men of faith and to their healthful stimulation of reproof, correction and exhortation from God’s Word, and turns around and resumes the right way, what sins he has committed will then be forgiven him. This forgiveness is not on the basis of any self-righteousness in him, but is on the basis of Jesus’ righteous sacrifice for sins.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951322/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 John 1:7 to 2:2</a>.</p>

Since the psalmist had a gracious host in mind, ‘dwelling in Jehovah’s house’ meant having a good relationship with God as His guest. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988487/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Psalm 15:1-5</a>) Today, that house can be identified with Jehovah’s holy temple, his arrangement for pure worship. King Solomon was privileged to construct the first material temple, richly ornamented with gold and built to honor Jehovah. What a great privilege it was to serve there! Although such a temple no longer exists, God has a holy organization to honor him and promote pure worship. As one means of doing this, Jehovah’s organization has established Bethel Homes in scores of countries. “Bethel” means “House of God,” and thousands of dedicated people serve in these theocratic centers. Some of these men and women have served in this way “to the length of days,” having spent most of their lives in Bethel service. Millions of others, not members of <span id="page28" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>a Bethel family, are similarly determined to serve Jehovah forever.</p>

<strong>Hebrew, II</strong><br/><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb"><strong><em>Primary forms of parallelism.</em></strong> The most important formal element in Hebrew poetry is parallelism, or rhythm that is achieved not by rhyme (as in English) but by logical thought; it has been termed “sense rhythm.” Consider the two lines of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001953/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Psalm 24:1</a>:</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sp"><em>To Jehovah belong the earth and that which fills it,</em></p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="sz"><em>The productive land and those dwelling in it.</em></p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="sb">The lines here quoted are said to be in <em>synonymous</em> parallelism, that is, the second line repeats a portion of the previous line, but in different words.

<strong>Hebrew Poetry</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Parallelism’s most common form is called <em>synonymous</em> parallelism in which the second line repeats the thought in a portion of the first line, but in different words. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101973090/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 24:1</a> is an example:</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sl">“To Jehovah belong the earth and that which fills it,</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sp">The productive land and those dwelling in it.”</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sn">The phrase “To Jehovah belong” is essential to both lines. However, the terms “the earth” and “the productive land” are poetic synonyms, as are “that which fills it” and “those dwelling in it.”</p>

<strong>When All Nations Collide, Head On, with God</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[81]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Let us set matters straight in our minds. When Jehovah God put man upon the earth in human perfection, he did not make him the owner of the earth, but made man only a dweller and worker upon it. God did not let go of his ownership of Paradise and of every other part of the earth. As earth’s Creator he owned it, and he remains its Creator always. Over two thousand nine hundred years after man’s creation, the psalmist David of Bethlehem wrote and sang: “To Jehovah belong the earth and that which fills it, the productive land and those dwelling in it. For upon the seas he himself has solidly fixed it, and upon the rivers he keeps it firmly established.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971761/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 24:1, 2</a>) That is something that all nations of today choose to ignore and brush aside. How like their first parents! When Adam and Eve ignored God’s ownership of the paradise of pleasure and expressly ate of fruit that he commanded them not to eat, they failed in their test of subjection and obedience to him. That was sin against God on their part. Instead of continuing to walk with God their Creator, they chose self-sovereignty, and collided with him on the issue of sovereignty.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971761/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gen. 3:1-14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971761/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Rom. 5:12</a>.</p>

<strong>The Good News That Unites Mankind</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> Another facet of life wherein unity is produced by those heeding the advice of the good news of God’s Word is the neutrality of Christians. Jesus Christ very plainly said of his followers: “They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971363/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">John 17:14</a>) The Bible clearly shows that “to Jehovah belong the earth and that which fills it, the productive land and those dwelling in it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971363/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 24:1</a>) Thus to Jehovah there are no such things as national boundaries for lands on this globe. The present divisions of this <span id="page308" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="308" data-before-text="308"></span>earth into various types of governments are not the work of Jehovah. He does not respect one national group above another, favor one against the other, support one to the exclusion of another. These divisions are the work of the “god of this system of things,” Satan the Devil, who offered Jesus all the kingdoms of the world if he would do but one act of worship before Satan. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971363/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971363/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Matt. 4:8, 9</a>) The good news of God’s Word shows that Jehovah “made out of one man every nation of men, to dwell upon the entire surface of the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971363/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Acts 17:26</a>) Thus God calls for those who want to serve him in unity to be neutral as to the affairs of this system of things. For such unity to prevail no matter where an individual lives, regardless of his national heritage, language, color or line of descent, that individual must be at unity with God’s people in all parts of the earth. Again, it does not depend on how an imperfect human interprets the law of God. It depends on what the Almighty First Cause, Jehovah God, decrees for man in order to have unity and the blessing of that First Cause.</p>

Was divine wisdom manifest in establishing it? Yes, indeed! Research has shown that the earth is made up of the same chemical elements that are needed to sustain human life. But vegetation must first convert these elements into forms that can be assimilated by the body. Some of these elements may amount to no more than one hundredth of one percent of the human body, but they are necessary for life. Cooperating in making them available are thousands of millions of living organisms in the soil, of countless different designs, each working to convert dead leaves, grass and other waste matter back to usable form or to loosen up the soil so that air and water can get in. Who can honestly deny that great wisdom is evident in this arrangement to sustain life?​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971042/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 24:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971042/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 89:11</a>.</p>

He owns the earth and everything on it. Creatures living on the earth have ownership rights or rights of possession with relation to one another, and these must be respected. But it must be remembered that God is the real owner and in relation to him no creatures have ownership right.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964562/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 24:1</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A nation also has to recognize this fact and use the land unselfishly for its people. Whether it promotes the worship of the true God and holds to his principles or it defiles the land, ruining it, determines whether the nation can continue living on it or not. Nations that are atheistic or nations that are influenced by the false religious doctrines stemming from ancient Babylon, which defame the Creator and Owner of the earth, cannot exist long on the earth. While nations are permitted, by God’s allowance, to occupy the earth, yet none of them has really been granted land as his representative.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">However, there was once a nation that was given a land grant by God. Not a grant of ownership, but a grant of land to be held in trust, with accountability to him for its continuance. It was the only nation ever having a divinely ordained body of laws. In these times when new nations are forming and governments are undergoing sweeping changes, a study of this nation and its outcome will help us, wherever we may live on earth, to know the course we must take if we desire to live on the land in security, freedom and happiness.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">God had bought this people, which he considered as his firstborn son, Israel, from the furnace of slavery in Egypt. He was also their King. Under Moses he brought them to Mount Horeb to organize a nation. He proclaimed by means of an angel the matchless Ten Commandments. Not to the non-Jewish nations of the world, but only to the delivered nation of Israel could Jehovah give the following first two commandments of the Ten: “I am Jehovah your God, who have brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slaves. You must not have any other gods against my face.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“You must not make for yourself a carved image or a form like anything that is in the heavens above or that is on the earth underneath or that is in the waters under the earth.

<strong>Why Jehovah Empties the Earth</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> But man, like the angels, was specially privileged. He was given intelligence, the power of speech, and the godly qualities of justice, love, wisdom and power. He was equipped to care for the earth and the animal life on it, to see that everything fully reflected Jehovah’s glory, and with his tongue he could add his verbal praise to swell the chorus ascending heavenward from earth. Could not God reasonably expect man’s praise and gratitude, in view of all he did for man? Is it not natural to show gratitude? Are not men considered rude if they fail to acknowledge courtesies or small favors from others? A normally kind person is unhappy if he is denied opportunity to show appreciation to his benefactors. To give expression to good impulses is pleasant; to smother such expression is a torment and a frustration. And <span id="page462" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="462" data-before-text="462"></span>how much more so is it when you have received, not just a minor courtesy or favor, but an earthly home and life itself! So Jehovah does not repress us but invites through the psalmist our expressions of praise: “Let everything that hath breath praise Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957564/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 150:6</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu"> 7.

What if they ruined the grasslands and stripped off the forests so that unimpeded erosion carried off the good topsoil and left dustbowls and deserts? These mountains and valleys would no longer reflect Jehovah’s praiseworthy creative powers. And if they slaughtered the animals and birds for selfish gain or merely for sport, these living creatures would vanish and no longer reflect Jehovah’s creative wisdom. Worse, if they wage war, follow scorched-earth policies and soak the soil with human blood, will mankind be a praise to Jehovah their Creator? Would not such activities impair earth’s ability to reflect the invisible, praiseworthy qualities of Jehovah? Would it not be like a man smearing mud on a mirror? Furthermore, would it not be like vandals coming into your church building, desecrating it and disrupting the religious services? If they so abused your invitation to come for worship, you would rightly put them out. By the same logic, should not Jehovah remove from the earth any who damage and desecrate it and spoil it for proper use by those who appreciate it and its Creator? Jehovah will remove such polluters of the earth; they shall not prevent the realization of his expressed purpose regarding the earth as a planet populated by his praisers: “I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957564/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isa. 46:11</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>WHY ISRAEL WAS TO DRIVE OUT THE CANAANITES</strong></p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 8.

It does not disturb them that their ancestors drove previous peoples from the land they now occupy, or that remnants of these previous peoples may now be herded onto barren reservations and left to starve. But it upsets them to think that God backed up the ousting of the Canaanites when Israel entered the land. Their ancestors did not own the earth, but they drove others from it. However, Jehovah owns the earth and everyone on it; yet they criticize him for doing as he sees fit with his own: “The earth is Jehovah’s, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.” Moreover, their blasphemy of God is born of their ignorance of his Word, they being blind to the reason for God’s command to oust the Canaanites from the land.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957564/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 24:1</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 9.

Was he showing race prejudice against them, discriminating against them because of nationality? Was it a case of special favoritism, removing them just to give the land to his chosen nation of Israel? To say yes is to say you are ignorant of the facts of the case. Israel was told why God would dispossess the Canaanites: “Do not say in your heart when Jehovah your God pushes them away from before you this, ‘It was for my own righteousness that Jehovah has brought me in to take possession of this land,’ whereas it is for the wickedness of these nations that Jehovah is driving them away from before you.” Here are some of their wickednesses that Israel was warned to <span id="page463" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="463" data-before-text="463"></span>avoid: “When you are entered into the land that Jehovah your God is giving you, you must not learn to do according to the detestable things of those nations.

Its enslaving control over this earth and its inhabitants will be smashed and forever removed. All who continue in willful slavery to it will be destroyed with it. For this reason it is that NOW the Jubilee trumpet must be sounded by giving the witness to God’s kingdom, the government of everlasting life in a free new world. By the power of the truth concerning God’s kingdom the people of good will who hear the Jubilee trumpet must make their break for liberty from Satan’s world of slavery. They must flee to God’s kingdom as the rightful government of all mankind, the one and only answer to the prayer Jesus taught us, “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified. Let your kingdom come. Let your will come to pass, as in heaven, also upon earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951560/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Matt. 6:9, 10</a>, <em>NW</em>) He also assured us, “You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” He said, too, that God’s Word in the Holy Bible is the truth.

God did not let go of his ownership of Paradise and of every other part of the earth. As earth’s Creator he owned it, and he remains its Creator always. Over two thousand nine hundred years after man’s creation, the psalmist David of Bethlehem wrote and sang: “To Jehovah belong the earth and that which fills it, the productive land and those dwelling in it. For upon the seas he himself has solidly fixed it, and upon the rivers he keeps it firmly established.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971041/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 24:1, 2</a>) That is something that all nations of today choose to ignore and brush aside. How like their first parents! When Adam and Eve ignored God’s ownership of the paradise of pleasure and expressly ate of fruit that he commanded them not to eat, they failed in their test of subjection and obedience to him. That was sin against God on their part. Instead of continuing to walk with God their Creator, they chose self-sovereignty, and collided with him on the issue of sovereignty.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971041/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 3:1-14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971041/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Romans 5:12</a>.</p>

<strong>Why Be Baptized?</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Strangely there is another reason somewhat different in nature from the three mentioned above as to why some do not take the step of baptism. There is a certain spirit of independence that is present in their mind. They do not wish to be restricted in their freedom, not realizing that actually they are putting themselves into bondage to their own reasoning and to this world. And sometimes, to justify delay on their part, little points of objection are raised which in themselves are insignificant, but are magnified out of proportion so that the overall issue and God’s true worship are placed in the background. Pride, a strong ego, the spirit of this world and a growing tendency today <span id="page332" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="332" data-before-text="332"></span>to figure everything out for oneself and to believe only what one can see cause the spirit of independence to take root and resist the natural desire of man to get to know Jehovah and to render sacred service to him in a dedicated relationship. Do not let an independent spirit of this world hold you back. On the other hand, “if the Son sets you free, you will be actually free.” Further, “for such freedom Christ set us free. Therefore stand fast, and do not let yourselves be confined again in a yoke of slavery.” Let your love for Jehovah cause you to give yourself to him in obedient service.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962403/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 8:36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962403/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Gal. 5:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962403/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 2 Pet. 2:19-21</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>REBAPTISM NECESSARY?</strong></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">11, 12.

They may have been baptized at an early age or while they were very immature in the truth, or after baptism they became inactive in the ministry for a time. At the baptism ceremony a talk on baptism is given to make clear what is involved in the matter of dedication and baptism. If one later has some doubts about the validity of his dedication, he should ask himself whether he understood that water baptism symbolized a dedication to do Jehovah’s will and whether he had actually made a dedication to do Jehovah’s will prior to baptism, even though his knowledge of the truth was limited at that time and he may have been gaining accurate knowledge by a Bible study for only a short time. Were the questions at the end of the ceremony answered in the affirmative and with a basic understanding of the significance thereof?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Naturally all should have grown in appreciation of their dedication since symbolizing it by water immersion. Certainly we did not appreciate it fully when we made it, or as fully as we do now. But this does not necessarily mean that we should be rebaptized, even though our immaturity might have later caused a temporary lapse in fulfilling our ministerial responsibilities. But if one submitted to baptism mainly because of emotional factors and without proper understanding, or in order to please one’s parents or others, and if this baptism did not symbolize a prior dedication to do Jehovah’s will, it would be proper to be baptized again. Dedication must come before baptism and not afterward.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">13. Before coming to Jehovah in dedication what must first take place so that we will be acceptable to him?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> Certain personal circumstances existing at the time of baptism would necessitate rebaptism. The psalmist David, in a song of praise to Jehovah, stated: “Who may ascend into the mountain of Jehovah, and who may rise up in his holy place? Anyone innocent in his hands and clean in heart, who has not carried My soul to sheer worthlessness, nor taken an oath deceitfully. He will carry away blessing from Jehovah and righteousness from his God of salvation.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962403/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 24:3-5</a>) Dedication is a bilateral arrangement. Jehovah is the superior and we are the inferiors. Jehovah makes the terms of dedication; we comply with them. He requires that we first repent, turn from our former unclean practices and present ourselves as clean before him.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">14, 15. (a) What circumstances would render a professed dedication and baptism invalid? (b) If the baptizer finds it necessary to be rebaptized, does this render the dedication and baptism of those he baptized invalid?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> We could not imagine Jehovah accepting <span id="page333" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="333" data-before-text="333"></span>the dedication of anyone living in an immoral situation or doing at the time of baptism things that would result in his being cut off from Jehovah’s favor by disfellowshiping, if he were already in the Christian congregation. In ordinary business a contract is not valid unless it is signed and sealed properly by all parties concerned. On this principle it would be necessary for a formerly unfit person to be baptized again even though after his former baptism he discontinued these wrongs and made advancement in the truth and service of Jehovah. The first baptism could not symbolize a dedication made under proper circumstances that Jehovah could accept. He should now make a firm resolve to do Jehovah’s will and thus dedicate his life to Jehovah’s service and then submit to baptism at the earliest opportunity. If an unclean situation developed sometime after dedication and baptism, this would not make the dedication invalid. The individual, however, would be subject to appropriate discipline by the organization.</p>

Therefore learn God’s way now for pure worship, attend all the arranged meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses so you can study God’s holy Word with the aid of the Bible textbooks, appreciate the truth and escape this evil world.

On one occasion Jehovah stated he would not go: “For I shall not go up in the midst of you, because you are a stiff-necked people.” When the people got to hear this evil word they began to mourn, and while Moses was seeking Jehovah he said: “See, you are saying to me, ‘Lead this people up,’ but you yourself have not let me know whom you will send with me. . . .’ So he [Jehovah] said: ‘My own person will go along and I shall certainly give you rest.’ At this he said to him: ‘If your own person is not going along, do not lead us up from here.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956848/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ex. 33:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956848/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 12-15</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">17.

Every one of God’s people must now reverence and fear Jehovah to remain in his holy presence. There must be only pure worship offered, for any idolatry will be obnoxious to him and to his people. All must cleanse themselves from all impurity. “Who shall ascend into the hill of Jehovah? And who shall stand in his holy place? He <span id="page701" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="701" data-before-text="701"></span>that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto falsehood, and hath not sworn deceitfully.

You will neither worship here nor will you remain with Jehovah’s beloved ones unless you do have clean hands and pure hearts. Therefore learn God’s way now for pure worship, attend all the arranged meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses so you can study God’s holy Word with the aid of the Bible textbooks, appreciate the truth and escape this evil world. Then as you read, run, run speedily to your neighbor and tell him. Go to those in your district and tell them.

<strong>Goodness</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Here goodness is seen to be a quality that involves mercy, loving-kindness, and truth but does not condone or cooperate in any way with badness. On this basis David could pray to Jehovah to forgive his sins ‘for the sake of Jehovah’s goodness.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps 25:7</a>) Jehovah’s goodness, as well as his love, was involved in the giving of his Son as a sacrifice for sins. By this he provided a means for helping those who would want that which is truly good, and at the same time he condemned badness and laid the basis for fully satisfying justice and righteousness.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001742/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ro 3:23-26</a>.</p>

<strong>A God of Loving-Kindness</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Later David took the lead in the fight Israel waged against the Canaanites to drive them out of the land that had been promised to Israel’s forefather Abraham. <span id="page138" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="138" data-before-text="138"></span>This action was a prophetic pattern of how Jehovah in our time will cleanse the earth of rebels against his sovereignty and give the inheritance to those loving and serving him, “those observing his covenant and his reminders.” However, there is no Scriptural indication that Jehovah in these days fights for one nation or another. To the contrary, Isaiah foretold that his people would beat their swords into plowshares and learn war no more. David was denied the honor of erecting the temple to Jehovah’s worship because he had been a man of war. Yet David had carried out Jehovah’s will for his time and so Jehovah promised that the kingship would not leave his line of descent. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967162/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 13:36</a>) Concerning this, Isaiah prophetically declared: “Incline your ear and come to me. Listen, and your soul will keep alive, and I shall readily conclude with you people an indefinitely lasting covenant respecting the loving-kindnesses to David that are faithful.” No wonder David declared: “As for me, in your loving-kindness I have trusted; let my heart be joyful in your salvation. I will sing to Jehovah, for he has dealt rewardingly with me.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967162/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isa. 55:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967162/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Ps. 13:5, 6</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 7. How did Paul connect God’s loving-kindness to David with Jesus’ time?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> The apostle Paul tied in the covenant with David with the events in Jesus’ day, explaining: “And so we are declaring to you the good news about the promise made to the forefathers, that God has entirely fulfilled it to us their children in that he resurrected Jesus; even as it is written in the second psalm, ‘You are my son, I have become your Father this day.’ And that fact that he resurrected him from the dead destined no more to return to corruption, he has stated in this way, ‘I will give you people the loving-kindnesses to David that are faithful.’” So the promise to David was fulfilled and Jesus as the heir of David and Jehovah’s only-begotten Son was raised up to become King of Jehovah’s new order of things at the appointed time.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967162/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 13:32-34</a>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 8. What are some evidences that Jehovah is a God of loving-kindness?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> From the very beginning a growing chain of events showed Jehovah’s kindness and loving concern for mankind. Jehovah’s purpose that righteous men live on earth in paradisaic conditions would not be thwarted. When Jehovah formed the earth as a beautiful home for men, he did not provide just the stark necessities, but covered the terrain with fruit-bearing trees and flowering shrubs for their pleasure and delight. In the midst of the garden he planted the tree of life, looking forward to the time when the first couple would prove their faithfulness and expand the boundaries of the paradise garden to the ends of the earth. Even after their rebellion and the execution of sentence against them, Jehovah in prophecy showed his undeserved kindness as he foretold the future redemption of those putting their faith in him.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 9. What need did David recognize, and how was this prospect provided?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> How would this restoration to paradisaic conditions come about? Jehovah had promised Abraham: “By means of your seed all nations of the earth will certainly bless themselves.” This seed of Abraham would prove to be a blessing by providing the means for redemption. David had expressed the need for this when he prayed: “The sins of my youth and my revolts O do not remember. According to your loving-kindness do you yourself remember me, for the sake of your goodness, O Jehovah. For your name’s sake, O Jehovah, you must even forgive my error, for it is considerable.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967162/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 22:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967162/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Ps. 25:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967162/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 11</a>) David saw that something more than animal sacrifices was needed to provide a satisfactory atonement, and he trusted in <span id="page139" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="139" data-before-text="139"></span>Jehovah’s loving-kindness to provide it. Jehovah’s covenant with David was another step forward in the outworking of Jehovah’s purpose. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967162/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Sam. 7:16</a>) How was that? As Paul said, regarding Jesus: “From all the things from which you could not be declared guiltless by means of the law of Moses, everyone who believes is declared guiltless by means of this One.” What a prospect for blessing all nations this opened up, thanks to Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, even the forgiveness of sins and errors such as David mentioned!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967162/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 13:38, 39</a>.</p>

<strong>Recovery Still Possible</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> It can truly be said that there is much in God’s Word that makes a strong appeal, both by direct word and by prophetic dramas and parables, expressed in very moving terms, as we shall see. These appeals abundantly confirm in unmistakable language the Creator’s own description of what his name stands for, as when he declared to Moses: “Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and truth, preserving loving-kindness for thousands, pardoning error and transgression and sin, but [when necessary] by no means will he give exemption from punishment.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ex. 34:6, 7</a>) These appeals are set forth in the Bible, not only to enlighten and guide those striving to serve God acceptably, but <span id="page465" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="465" data-before-text="465"></span>also to catch the attention of those who have fallen by the way, but who are not beyond hope of recovery.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">16, 17. (a) How does God’s Word apply individually, and why is this important? (b) What prayer is appropriate, and what difficulty might this involve?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> In this connection there is another aspect worth remembering. Though the Scriptures often deal with God’s people collectively, as a nation, or prophetically portray certain classes or groups, yet they always have their appeal to the individual reader. It is important to appreciate this, for though, as in Malachi’s day, adverse judgment is pronounced against a <em>people</em> persisting in its evil ways, yet that does not prevent an <em>individual</em> from coming to his senses and turning his heart to God. This must be backed up by the individual’s also turning his feet into the right way, the “path of life.” Such a one might well pray, as did David: “The sins of my youth and my revolts O do not remember. . . . For your name’s sake, O Jehovah, you must even forgive my error, for it is considerable. Who, now, is the man fearful of Jehovah? He will instruct him in the way that he will choose.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ps. 16:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 25:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/28/2" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> 11, 12</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> You may feel that it is not easy to pray under such circumstances, wondering if your prayer will be heard after you have gone so far in the wrong way.

He mentioned various circumstances under which prayer might be made “toward this place” (the temple), and asked that Jehovah would hear and answer such prayers. Solomon included the prayers of individuals, and he even mentioned the “foreigner,” so that, when he “actually comes and prays toward this house, may you yourself listen from the heavens . . . and you must do according to all that for which the foreigner calls to you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">1 Ki. 6:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 8:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/29/2" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> 22,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/29/3" data-bid="30-4" class="b"> 30,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/29/4" data-bid="30-5" class="b"> 38,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/29/5" data-bid="30-6" class="b"> 41-43</a>.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">19.

He prayed that, if “they indeed come to their senses<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965563/0">a</a> . . . and they indeed return to you with all their heart,” and they pray in the direction of “the house that I have built to your name; you must also hear . . . their prayer and their request for favor, and you must execute judgment for them.” This would lead to the opening of the way for their return to their own land. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 Ki. 8:46-53</a>) How well this confirms the course of action that is possible for one who has wandered far off in a self-indulgent course and who feels abandoned’ If, in his distress, he faces up to his bad situation and comes to appreciate his need, then, without fail, he should call on Jehovah.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">20.

The Israelites could not turn to <em>any</em> temple. Of course not. There was just the one built to Jehovah’s name at his chosen city, Jerusalem. For complying with this requirement, what assurance was given that such prayers would be heard? Notice what Jehovah said to Solomon: “I have heard your prayer and your request for favor . . . I have sanctified this house that you have <span id="page466" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="466" data-before-text="466"></span>built by putting my name there to time indefinite; and my eyes and my heart will certainly prove to be there always.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">1 Ki. 9:3</a>.</p>

There mankind and marriage had their start. If we could but turn back the pages of time and view that paradise home of the first man and woman, Adam and Eve, what a marvelous sight we would behold! There they were together, man and wife, in a tranquil, pleasant garden, with its streams, its trees, its luxuriant foliage—those things required to make life possible and delightful. In the skies above, graceful birds winged their way. And on land, animals of many kinds were found—none harmful, none a threat to man. In earth’s waters, aquatic creatures moved about. But best of all, Adam and Eve were there together and they could bring forth their kind to populate the earth and spread their paradise home in joyful companionship. United, perfect man and woman could “be fruitful and become many and fill the earth and subdue it,” in keeping with the blessing of their heavenly Father, Jehovah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965682/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 1:26-28</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 2.

Yet Christians, with the Word of God in hand and heart, are able to surmount these, for the psalmist David declared: “Good and upright is Jehovah. That is why he instructs sinners in the way. He will cause the meek ones to walk in his judicial decision, and he will teach the meek ones his way. All the paths of Jehovah are loving-kindness and trueness for those observing his covenant and his reminders.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965682/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 25:8-10</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>FILLING YOUR ROLE IN MARRIAGE</strong></p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 3.

The reminders of Jehovah, recorded in his Word, make clear their status and responsibilities. To husbands, the apostle Paul wrote: “You husbands, keep on loving your wives and do not be bitterly angry with them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965682/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Col. 3:19</a>) Many men lord it over their wives, subjecting them to unkind words and deeds. Not so the real Christian husband. Neither would a male Christian place the female on a pedestal, according her undue admiration and honor. Nor would the Christian woman expect that. She herself wisely complies with the apostle’s inspired words: “You wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as it is becoming in the Lord.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965682/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Col. 3:18</a>) When men and women, united in wedlock, show regard for Jehovah’s reminders, problems are fewer and happiness is attainable.</p>

<strong>Profiting from Jonah’s Experience</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">We also have reason to believe that Jonah was meek and teachable. Meek persons have a mild temper and are willing to be taught, even as we read: “He [Jehovah] will teach the meek ones his way.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975881/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 25:9</a>) Jonah did not get bitter but repented. He showed he could take such strong discipline as God gave him. This is clear from the prayer he offered while in the fish’s belly, which prayer also indicates that Jonah was familiar with the book of Psalms. Among other things he prayed: “When my soul fainted away within me, Jehovah was the One whom I remembered. Then my prayer came in to you, into your holy temple. . . . As for me, with the voice of thanksgiving I will sacrifice to you. What I have vowed, I will pay. Salvation belongs to Jehovah.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975881/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Jonah 2:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975881/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975881/12/2" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> Ps. 50:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975881/12/3" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> 3:8</a>.</p>

<strong>Building a Firm Foundation in Christ</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Like Jehovah’s faithful witnesses of old (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964324/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Hebrews 11</a>), those today in God’s service follow closely Jehovah’s leadings and have been greatly blessed. Those keeping pace with God’s organization have gone forward from one new method of service to another, recognizing that each change has been an advancement and each method of work designed to accomplish a particular purpose. The blessing on such faithful efforts is evidence of God’s favor and approval. And those who have been active through this “time of the end” have been receiving the full benefits of that blessing and of the advanced preaching method now enjoyed. What has enabled them to move forward from one feature of activity to another? Seeking to know the mind of God through his Word, they have been led on by God’s holy spirit to see the work God is doing and to recognize God’s purpose in their service. This has enabled them to <span id="page279" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="279" data-before-text="279"></span>build surely and squarely on the foundation of Christ Jesus. Now Jehovah’s people are receiving one of the most intensified training programs ever given to God’s servants. As a result, hundreds of thousands of qualified ministers confidently approach the doors of the people. They preach brief, enlightening sermons from God’s Word, efficiently flipping the pages of the Bible from text to text to establish firmly the truth of the message they carry. What a faith-building work it is that has been accomplished! And how faith-building it is to God’s people to see such an expanding army daily carrying the offensive of true worship to the rescue of those bound in slavery to the false standards of this present system of things.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">12.

The <em>Kingdom Ministry</em> is provided by way of service instructions. Service centers have been established throughout the congregations’ territory, not only for Bible study, but to assist all in the neighborhood to share in active field service. The training program has been instituted to assist new ministers in preparing to carry out their Christian responsibility of preaching to others. Sermons have been prepared for use at the door. Reports of activity are presented in the <em>Yearbook.</em> Regular visits of specially trained servants are arranged to assist those in the congregations in their individual ministry. How grateful we can be to Jehovah through the Society for supplying us so many helpful ways of building a strong Christian faith, founded in our Leader and Commander, Jesus Christ! But are you really building on this foundation? Do you “keep watching” how you are building on it?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>BUILDING THROUGH ASSOCIATION AND PRAYER</strong></p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">14. How does right association provide strong building material, and why need not new ones feel left out of following Paul’s counsel at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964324/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:24</a>?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Evidences continue to mount that by far the majority of those associating with Jehovah’s witnesses take their ministry seriously. This is because they recognize that God is with his people on whom he has put his name and they want to share in God’s purpose for them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964324/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isa. 2:2, 3</a>) This third source of strong building material, right association, is everyone’s need. But as we need the right kind of association, so we should make ourselves the right kind to be associated with, in order that we may give the fullest benefit to others, especially to new ones. To “consider one another to incite to love and fine <span id="page280" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="280" data-before-text="280"></span>works” means that those giving such aid and encouragement must themselves be strong, able and equipped to give of themselves. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964324/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Heb. 10:24</a>) New ones need not be discouraged by this admonition of the apostle though, nor should they feel they are thereby eliminated from such counsel. You can and must give of what you have. It may be a little at first, but as you help to fortify others, you too are being fortified and are building on a firm foundation. Your advancement will be “manifest to all persons.” This exchange of encouragement by all in association provides mutual benefit for all.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964324/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964324/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Rom. 1:12</a>.</p>

To the contrary, Isaiah foretold that his people would beat their swords into plowshares and learn war no more. David was denied the honor of erecting the temple to Jehovah’s worship because he had been a man of war. Yet David had carried out Jehovah’s will for his time and so Jehovah promised that the kingship would not leave his line of descent.

Jehovah’s purpose that righteous men live on earth in paradisaic conditions would not be thwarted. When Jehovah formed the earth as a beautiful home for men, he did not provide just the stark necessities, but covered the terrain with fruit-bearing trees and flowering shrubs for their pleasure and delight. In the midst of the garden he planted the tree of life, looking forward to the time when the first couple would prove their faithfulness and expand the boundaries of the paradise garden to the ends of the earth. Even after their rebellion and the execution of sentence against them, Jehovah in prophecy showed his undeserved kindness as he foretold the future redemption of those putting their faith in him.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 9. What need did David recognize, and how was this prospect provided?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> How would this restoration to paradisaic conditions come about? Jehovah had promised Abraham: “By means of your seed all nations of the earth will certainly bless themselves.” This seed of Abraham would prove to be a blessing by providing the means for redemption. David had expressed the need for this when he prayed: “The sins of my youth and my revolts O do not remember. According to your loving-kindness do you yourself remember me, for the sake of your goodness, O Jehovah. For your name’s sake, O Jehovah, you must even forgive my error, for it is considerable.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967162/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 22:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967162/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Ps. 25:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967162/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 11</a>) David saw that something more than animal sacrifices was needed to provide a satisfactory atonement, and he trusted in <span id="page139" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="139" data-before-text="139"></span>Jehovah’s loving-kindness to provide it.

As Paul said, regarding Jesus: “From all the things from which you could not be declared guiltless by means of the law of Moses, everyone who believes is declared guiltless by means of this One.” What a prospect for blessing all nations this opened up, thanks to Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, even the forgiveness of sins and errors such as David mentioned!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967162/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 13:38, 39</a>.</p>

<strong>Recovery Still Possible</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> It can truly be said that there is much in God’s Word that makes a strong appeal, both by direct word and by prophetic dramas and parables, expressed in very moving terms, as we shall see. These appeals abundantly confirm in unmistakable language the Creator’s own description of what his name stands for, as when he declared to Moses: “Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and truth, preserving loving-kindness for thousands, pardoning error and transgression and sin, but [when necessary] by no means will he give exemption from punishment.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ex. 34:6, 7</a>) These appeals are set forth in the Bible, not only to enlighten and guide those striving to serve God acceptably, but <span id="page465" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="465" data-before-text="465"></span>also to catch the attention of those who have fallen by the way, but who are not beyond hope of recovery.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">16, 17.

Though the Scriptures often deal with God’s people collectively, as a nation, or prophetically portray certain classes or groups, yet they always have their appeal to the individual reader. It is important to appreciate this, for though, as in Malachi’s day, adverse judgment is pronounced against a <em>people</em> persisting in its evil ways, yet that does not prevent an <em>individual</em> from coming to his senses and turning his heart to God. This must be backed up by the individual’s also turning his feet into the right way, the “path of life.” Such a one might well pray, as did David: “The sins of my youth and my revolts O do not remember. . . . For your name’s sake, O Jehovah, you must even forgive my error, for it is considerable. Who, now, is the man fearful of Jehovah? He will instruct him in the way that he will choose.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ps. 16:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 25:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/28/2" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> 11, 12</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> You may feel that it is not easy to pray under such circumstances, wondering if your prayer will be heard after you have gone so far in the wrong way.

At the inauguration of the temple, how did Solomon pray to Jehovah?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> On completion of the temple and after the Ark, representing Jehovah’s presence, had been placed in the Most Holy of the temple, then King Solomon voiced a prayer of inauguration. He mentioned various circumstances under which prayer might be made “toward this place” (the temple), and asked that Jehovah would hear and answer such prayers. Solomon included the prayers of individuals, and he even mentioned the “foreigner,” so that, when he “actually comes and prays toward this house, may you yourself listen from the heavens . . . and you must do according to all that for which the foreigner calls to you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">1 Ki. 6:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 8:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/29/2" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> 22,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/29/3" data-bid="30-4" class="b"> 30,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/29/4" data-bid="30-5" class="b"> 38,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/29/5" data-bid="30-6" class="b"> 41-43</a>.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">19.

He prayed that, if “they indeed come to their senses<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965563/0">a</a> . . . and they indeed return to you with all their heart,” and they pray in the direction of “the house that I have built to your name; you must also hear . . . their prayer and their request for favor, and you must execute judgment for them.” This would lead to the opening of the way for their return to their own land. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 Ki. 8:46-53</a>) How well this confirms the course of action that is possible for one who has wandered far off in a self-indulgent course and who feels abandoned’ If, in his distress, he faces up to his bad situation and comes to appreciate his need, then, without fail, he should call on Jehovah.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">20.

The Israelites could not turn to <em>any</em> temple. Of course not. There was just the one built to Jehovah’s name at his chosen city, Jerusalem. For complying with this requirement, what assurance was given that such prayers would be heard? Notice what Jehovah said to Solomon: “I have heard your prayer and your request for favor . . . I have sanctified this house that you have <span id="page466" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="466" data-before-text="466"></span>built by putting my name there to time indefinite; and my eyes and my heart will certainly prove to be there always.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">1 Ki. 9:3</a>.</p>

<strong>Repentance That Counts with God</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Also involved in the teaching of repentance is the fact that man is a sinner, and <span id="page398" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="398" data-before-text="398"></span>not only that, but that there are extenuating circumstances that he can plead that justify God’s extending to him the mercy of forgiveness. As King David pleaded when overtaken in a grievous sin: “Look! with error I was brought forth with birth pains, and in sin my mother conceived me.” Were there no extenuating circumstances, no true repentance could be possible and then neither could nor would God forgive. Thus we read: “For if we practice sin willfully after having received the accurate knowledge of the truth, there is no longer any sacrifice for sins left, but there is a certain fearful expectation of judgment.” That is why repentance was not possible for Adam nor for Judas.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 51:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Heb. 10:26, 27</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Scriptural repentance further requires that there be some provision by which or some basis upon which God can uphold the majesty of his law and yet take cognizance of repentance, for he is not given to change. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mal. 3:6</a>) Were his forgiveness to be indiscriminate, all fear and respect for him and his laws would disappear. This provision the Bible shows to be the sacrifice of God’s only-begotten Son: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and it is as a free gift that they are being declared righteous by his undeserved kindness through the release by the ransom paid by Christ Jesus. . . . that he might be righteous even when declaring righteous the man that has faith in Jesus.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rom. 3:23-26</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">And finally, the provision for repentance that counts with God involves the issue, Who is supreme? Jehovah God or Satan the Devil? Scriptural testimony, such as that at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job, chapters one and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> two</a>, shows that one of the chief ways in which this issue will be determined is on the basis of man’s keeping integrity. To enable lovers of righteousness to keep integrity—and thereby prove the Devil a liar when he boasted that he could turn all men away from God—provision needed to be made for their repentance and forgiveness. That God’s servants appreciated the relationship between forgiveness and the honor of His name the Scriptures repeatedly show: “For your name’s sake, O Jehovah, you must even forgive my error, for it is considerable.” “Help us, O God of our salvation, for the sake of the glory of your name, and deliver us and cover over our sins on account of your name.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 25:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 79:9</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>WHAT IT MEANS TO REPENT</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">For many centuries Jehovah God overlooked the sins of ignorance of the nations, but beginning with the conversion of Cornelius and in a special way in our day “he is telling mankind that they should all everywhere repent. Because he has set a day in which he purposes to judge the inhabited earth in righteousness by” Jesus Christ. Particularly pertinent to our day are also the words of the apostle Peter: “Jehovah is not slow respecting his promise, as some people consider slowness, but he is patient with you because he does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 17:30, 31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2 Pet. 3:9</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">For us to approach God and win his good pleasure by sincere repentance we must “believe that he is and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.” More than that, we must also take in knowledge of his righteous requirements, which are summed up in this way: “What doth Jehovah require of thee, but to do justly, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with thy God?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Heb. 11:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Mic. 6:8</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">As we come to know God and his righteous requirements we must become ‘conscious of our spiritual need,’ acutely aware of our sinful, undone condition and feel <span id="page399" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="399" data-before-text="399"></span>truly sorry about our sins. We must feel deeply, as did the tax collector going up to the temple to pray, who, “standing at a distance was not willing even to raise his eyes heavenward, but kept beating his chest, saying: ‘O God, be gracious to me a sinner.’” Like sincere repentance was also expressed by Ezra, on behalf of the erring returned exiles, and by the apostle Peter after he had denied Jesus.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 18:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Ezra 9:3-15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Matt. 26:75</a>.</p>

The Israelites could not turn to <em>any</em> temple. Of course not. There was just the one built to Jehovah’s name at his chosen city, Jerusalem. For complying with this requirement, what assurance was given that such prayers would be heard? Notice what Jehovah said to Solomon: “I have heard your prayer and your request for favor . . .

Why? He hopes that the more you learn about his personality, his ways, and his purpose, the more you will want to be his friend. Can you really be God’s friend? (Read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021208/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 25:14</a>.) What can you do to become his friend? The Bible answers those questions and reveals why friendship with Jehovah is the most important relationship you can have.</p><h3 class="du-color--gold-700 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p4" data-pid="4"><strong>1.

Jehovah is inviting you to become his friend. Some may find it difficult to imagine being friends with anyone they cannot see, let alone with God himself. Yet, in his Word, the Bible, Jehovah reveals everything we need to know about his personality in order for us to draw close to him. When we read God’s message to us in the Bible, our friendship with Jehovah grows even though we have never seen him.</p><h3 class="du-color--gold-700 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Why is Jehovah the best Friend you can have?</strong></h3><p id="p7" data-pid="7">No one loves you more than Jehovah does.

<strong>Do You Really Appreciate Your Blessings?</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>“Intimacy With Jehovah”</strong></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The psalmist sang: “The intimacy with Jehovah belongs to those fearful of him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011126/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 25:14</a>) What a privilege it is for imperfect humans to have a close personal relationship with Jehovah! However, what if we become so preoccupied with the everyday affairs of life that we end up spending less time praying? Think of what will then happen to our good relationship with Jehovah. As our Friend, Jehovah expects us to trust <span id="page19" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>in him and pour out our heart to him in prayer, expressing to him our fears, desires, and anxieties. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011126/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Prov. 3:5, 6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011126/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Phil. 4:6, 7</a>) So should we not give consideration to the quality of our prayers?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">When a young Witness named Paul thought about his prayers, he realized that he needed to make some improvements.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2011126/0">a</a> He said, “I had fallen into the habit of using the same expressions repeatedly when I prayed to Jehovah.” As Paul did research on the subject in the <em>Watch Tower Publications Index,</em> he learned that there are about 180 prayers recorded in the Bible. In these, Jehovah’s servants of the past expressed their innermost feelings. Paul stated: “By meditating on such Scriptural examples, I learned to be specific in my prayers. This has helped me to open my heart to Jehovah. Now it is a delight to draw close to him in prayer.”</p>

Though we will have to wait until the promised new world for all pain and suffering to vanish, Jehovah is doing something marvelous for his people right now. David wrote: “The intimacy with Jehovah belongs to those fearful of him, also his covenant, to cause them to know it.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005565/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Psalm 25:14</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> “Intimacy with Jehovah.” Why, the very idea seems beyond comprehension for imperfect humans! Yet, Jehovah invites those who fear him to be guests in his tent. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005565/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Psalm 15:1-5</a>) And what does Jehovah do for his guests? He causes them to know his covenant, according to David. Jehovah confides in them, revealing his “confidential matter” to the prophets, so that they could know what his purposes are and what they must do to live in harmony with them.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005565/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Amos 3:7</a>.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">18.

In fact, he urges us to do just that. “Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you,” says the Bible. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005565/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">James 4:8</a>) Jehovah wants us to have a close relationship with him. Actually, he has already taken steps to make such a relationship possible. The ransom sacrifice of Jesus has opened the door for us so that we can have a friendship with Almighty God. The Bible states: “As for us, we love, because he first loved us.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005565/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">1 John 4:19</a>.</p>

Of such inhibiting fear, the apostle John wrote: “Perfect love throws fear outside, because fear exercises a restraint.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978087/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 John 4:18</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">20.

<strong>Spiritual Discernment—an Evidence of Christian Maturity</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[24]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Maturity is not something that, once attained, stays with us without further effort on our part. The Christian organization is constantly on the advance. The light of truth shining upon it and through it gets steadily brighter. This is especially true now in this day when Jehovah has come to his temple, for “when there are judgments from [him] for the earth, righteousness is what the inhabitants of the productive land will certainly learn.” Not only is there an advancement <span id="page465" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="465" data-before-text="465"></span>in knowledge and understanding, but, since this is the day for the preaching of “this good news of the kingdom,” Jehovah is training his witnesses as never before to accomplish this work in the most effective manner possible. Constantly, by means of his theocratic organization, he provides new methods and equipment for this work. To keep up with the advancing maturity of the organization in spiritual understanding and ministerial ability means a constant ‘pressing on to maturity.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959563/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Malachi chapter 3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959563/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Isa. 26:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959563/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Matt. 24:14</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="qu"> 7.

How only can we continue to make progress?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[25]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> The need is for each one of Jehovah’s witnesses to discern his relationship to the advancement being made by the organization. It may be that one has been long associated with the truth, having been active many years in the ministry. Such steadfastness is well-pleasing to Jehovah. But there is a need at the same time to discern that one is keeping pace with the New World society. If you are in the happy position of having had many years in Jehovah’s service, then you will be anxious about the effectiveness of your ministry. Does it produce fruit? Does it help new ones by teaching them and making disciples out of them? As mentioned previously, one of the basic essentials of maturity and spiritual discernment is humility. To be able to discern accurately how we are making progress we need to take an honest, humble look at ourselves. If we are not making the desired progress, then we should not be too proud to seek help, or resent it when one of the overseers comes to us offering assistance. We must discern our needs if we are to continue to make progress.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959563/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Phil. 3:16</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="qu"> 8. (a) Where does spiritual discernment begin? (b) What relationship or association is most important for the Christian?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[26]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> The evidence of this growth in Christian maturity is in the discernment one shows of each step to be taken, of each decision to be made. It begins right with dedication. The one considering dedication must understand first that his dedication is being made, not to some man, nor to please some person, be it husband or wife, mother or father. It is not a dedication to an organization, not even to the New World society. It is a dedication to the Supreme Personage in the universe, Jehovah God, with the determination to do <em>his</em> will and please <em>him,</em> just as Jesus expressed it: “I am come . . . to do your will, O God.” The dedicated one appreciates, then, that the most cherished association or relationship is that which he now enters into with Jehovah. That is a holy, precious and “intimate” relationship into which Jehovah invites his creatures by means of his undeserved kindness through Jesus Christ, a relationship not to be lightly broken.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959563/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 10:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959563/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Ps. 25:14</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="qu"> 9. Why is dedication to a work a mistake, and what can having an unbalanced view of the ministry lead to?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[27]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> One who dedicates himself just to do a certain work, such as preaching, makes a mistake. When the going gets rough he easily becomes discouraged. If he sees only the physical association with the organization and its members as the most important thing to be guarded he is lacking in spiritual discernment. Work in preaching the good news, and physical association with the New World society, are not enough in themselves and do not guarantee salvation. There is no salvation on the basis of works alone. To have this view of things would place one in the same danger as those under the Mosaic law who sought to “establish their own [righteousness].” It can lead to becoming “egotistical, stirring up competition with one another, envying one another” over having a good record of preaching service.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959563/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rom. 10:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959563/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Gal. 5:26</a>.</p>

<strong>Will Being God’s Friend Help Me?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">One youth was asked what she thanked Jehovah God for the most. Her reply: “That we can come to know him and be his intimate friends.” Yes, it is possible to enter into the finest friendship in the universe! The psalmist wrote: “The intimacy with Jehovah belongs to those fearful of him.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101995845/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 25:14</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><em>“Intimacy</em> with Jehovah”​—what a precious opportunity! The original Hebrew word conveys the idea of open, confidential speech with someone who is a special friend. Thus, it is a close relationship based on love, a privileged intimacy resulting from mutual trust. As a friend of God, you sense that your true worth as a person is valued by this one who genuinely understands you. But what are the benefits of this friendship?</p>

<strong>Prayer in Sports—Does God Listen?</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The psalmist David said: “The intimacy with Jehovah belongs to those fearful of him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101990325/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 25:14</a>) In the original Hebrew, the root of “intimacy” (<em>sohd</em>) means “to make tight.” Hence, this verse conveys the idea of being granted admission into the inner circle of Jehovah or into a covenant of friendship with him. Only those worshipers who show proper respect are admitted. Thus, our intimate friendship with God causes us to fear breaching that relationship by doing anything that would displease him, such as treating prayer as a good-​luck charm to ensure a sports victory.</p>
