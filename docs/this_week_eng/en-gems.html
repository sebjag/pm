<strong>Chronology</strong><br/><p id="p109" data-pid="109" class="sb">Another date that can be used as a pivotal point is the year 539 B.C.E., supported by various historical sources as the year for the overthrow of Babylon by Cyrus the Persian. (Secular sources for Cyrus’ reign include Diodorus, Africanus, Eusebius, and Ptolemy, as well as the Babylonian tablets.) During Cyrus’ first year his decree releasing the Jews from exile was given. And, as considered in the article on <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/15">CYRUS</a>, it is very probable that the decree was made by the winter of 538 B.C.E. or toward the spring of 537 B.C.E. This would permit the Jews time to make necessary preparations, effect the four-month journey to Jerusalem, and still arrive there by the seventh month (Tishri, <span id="page459" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="459" data-before-text="459"></span>or about October 1) of 537 B.C.E.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Ezr 1:1-11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/36/1" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 2:64-70;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/36/2" data-bid="37-3" class="b"> 3:1</a>.</p>

<strong>Cyrus</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><strong>Cyrus’ Decree for the Return of the Exiles.</strong> By his decreeing the end of the Jewish exile, Cyrus fulfilled his commission as Jehovah’s ‘anointed shepherd’ for Israel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001102/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2Ch 36:22, 23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001102/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Ezr 1:1-4</a>) The proclamation was made “in the first year of Cyrus the king of Persia,” meaning his first year as ruler toward conquered Babylon. The Bible record at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001102/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Daniel 9:1</a> refers to “the first year of Darius,” and this may have intervened between the fall of Babylon and “the first year of Cyrus” over Babylon. If it did, this would mean that the writer was perhaps viewing Cyrus’ first year as having begun late in the year 538 B.C.E. However, if Darius’ rule over Babylon were to be viewed as that of a viceroy, so that his reign ran concurrent with that of Cyrus, Babylonian custom would place Cyrus’ first <em>regnal</em> year as running from Nisan of 538 to Nisan of 537 B.C.E.</p>

<strong>Ezra, Book of</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>Writer.</strong> Ezra, as a priest, scholar, skilled copyist, and man who had “prepared his heart . . . to teach in Israel regulation and justice” and to correct the things wanting in the worship of Jehovah that was carried on among the repatriated Israelites, was eminently qualified to write the book bearing his name. The royal power granted to him by the king of Persia would give him added reason and authority to do the research necessary, and it would be logical for such a man to write a record of this important segment of his nation’s history. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001476/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezr 7:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001476/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001476/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 25, 26</a>) The book is honest, therefore, in its use of the first person for the writer from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001476/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">chapter 7, verse 27, through chapter 9</a>. Most scholars are in agreement that the book of Ezra carries on the history at the point where the Chronicles leave off, as a comparison of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001476/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 36:22, 23</a> with <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001476/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezra 1:1-3</a> will show. This again points to Ezra as the writer. Jewish tradition likewise assigns the writership to Ezra.</p>

<strong>Ancient Cuneiform and the Bible</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">One famous cuneiform inscription found in 1879, the Cyrus Cylinder, records that after taking Babylon in 539 B.C.E., Cyrus applied his policy of returning captives to their homelands. Among those to benefit were the Jews. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008924/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezra 1:1-4</a>) Many 19th-century scholars had questioned the authenticity of the decree quoted in the Bible. However, cuneiform documents from the Persian period, including the Cyrus Cylinder, provide convincing evidence that the Bible record is accurate.</p>

Well, Jehovah spoke of himself as “the One saying of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd, and all that I delight in he will completely carry out’; even in my saying of Jerusalem, ‘She will be rebuilt,’ and of the temple, ‘You will have your foundation laid.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972921/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isa. 44:27, 28</a>) King Cyrus did completely carry out the thing in which Jehovah delighted, though this was contrary to what the national god of Persia delighted to have done. In the year 537 B.C.E., the seventieth year of the desolation of Jerusalem and its temple, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus to decree that the temple should be rebuilt at Jerusalem. To that end Cyrus decreed that the exiles in Babylon who would volunteer for this temple work should be released from Babylon and go back to “the mountain of the house of Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972921/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Chron. 36:20-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972921/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Ezra 1:1-4</a>) By the end of that seventieth year of Jerusalem’s desolation a faithful remnant of temple-work volunteers were back in the land of Judah, bringing to an end its desolation.

<strong>Determining the Year by Fact and Bible</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> How long are “seven times”, the times of the nations? The mathematics are supplied for us in another prophecy unrelated to this one which uses the term “times” or “periods of time”. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952322/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Revelation 12:6</a> (<em>NW</em>) there is mentioned 1,260 days and then in the 14th <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952322/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Re 12 verse 14</a> this very same period is referred to as 3 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> “times”. So if 3 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> “times” is 1,260 days, then 7 “times” (twice 3 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> “times”) must be twice 1,260, or 2,520 days. Early in their wilderness trek the Israelites repudiated the sovereign wisdom of their God by wanting to return to Egypt on having believed the faith-lacking reports of the ten unfaithful spies. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952322/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Num. 14:1-4</a>) For this lack of faith by the people in God’s sovereign leadership, Jehovah sentenced the nation to forty years of wandering in the wilderness with no sovereign control of land. “For every day spent in spying out the land, you shall spend a year being punished for your evil-doing, forty years for forty days; that will teach you <span id="page271" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="271" data-before-text="271"></span>what it is to have me against you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952322/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Num. 14:34</a>, <em>Mo.</em></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> So according to this rule established in the wilderness the Jewish nation, who time and again showed they did not appreciate Jehovah’s sovereign control, would have to bear God’s adverse judgment at the hands of their Gentile overlords for a period of seven “times”, or 2,520 year-days. These 2,520 years ran from the desolating of Jerusalem and the land in the summer and fall of 607 B.C. up to the summer and fall of 1914, when they expired. From 607 B.C. to 1 B.C. is 606 years. From 1 B.C. to A.D. 1 is only one year, because the ancients had not discovered the zero which according to modern mathematics would have made it two years. The use of the zero is only of comparatively recent mathematical origin. From A.D. 1 to A.D. 1914 is 1,913 years.

Concerning the first error, Russell and others considered 1 B.C. to A.D. 1 as being two years whereas in fact this is only one year because, as has been said above, there is no “zero” year in the B.C.-A.D. system for counting years. “The Christian era began, not with no year, but with a 1st year.”—<em>The Westminster Dictionary of the Bible,</em> p. 102.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> The second error had to do with not beginning the count of the 2,520 years at the right point in view of historic facts and circumstances. Almost all early Bible chronology ties in with secular history at the year 539 B.C., in which year the fall of Babylon to Darius and Cyrus of the Medes and the Persians occurred. In late years several cuneiform tablets have been discovered pertaining to the fall of Babylon which peg both Biblical and secular historic dates. The one tablet known as the “Nabunaid Chronicle” gives the date for the fall of Babylon which specialists have ascertained as being October 12-13, 539 B.C., Julian Calendar, or October 6-7, 539 B.C., according to our present Gregorian Calendar.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1952322/1">b</a> This tablet also says that Cyrus made his triumphant entry into Babylon 16 days after its fall to his army. Thus his <em>accession year</em> commenced in October, 539 B.C. However, in another cuneiform tablet called “Strassmaier, <em>Cyrus</em> No. 11” Cyrus’ first <em>regnal year</em> is mentioned and was determined to have begun March 17-18, 538 B.C., and to have concluded March 4-5, 537 B.C.<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1952322/2">c</a> It was in this first <em>regnal year</em> of Cyrus that he issued his decree to permit the Jews to return to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple.

As mentioned, if we were to count from 605 B.C.E., the 70 years would reach down to 535 B.C.E. However, the inspired Bible writer Ezra reported that the 70 years ran until “the first year of Cyrus the king of Persia,” who issued a decree allowing the Jews to return to their homeland.

<strong>Cyrus</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">By this victory Cyrus brought to an end the domination of Mesopotamia and the Near East by Semitic rulers and produced the first dominant world power of Aryan origin. The Cyrus Cylinder, a cuneiform document historians consider to have been written for publication in Babylon, is strongly religious <span id="page410" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="410" data-before-text="410"></span>and in it Cyrus is represented as ascribing the credit for his victory to Marduk the chief god of Babylon, saying: “He [Marduk] scanned and looked (through) all the countries, searching for a righteous ruler willing to lead him (in the annual procession). (Then) he pronounced the name of Cyrus, king of Anshan, declared him (literally: pronounced [his] name) to be(come) the ruler of all the world. . . . Marduk, the great lord, a protector of his people/worshipers, beheld with pleasure his good deeds and his upright mind (and therefore) ordered him to march against his city Babylon. He made him set out on the road to Babylon going at his side like a real friend. His widespread troops—their number, like that of the water of a river, could not be established—strolled along, their weapons packed away. Without any battle, he made him enter his town Babylon, sparing Babylon any calamity.”—<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts</em> by James B. Pritchard, 1955, p. 315.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Despite this pagan interpretation of events, the Bible shows that, on making his proclamation authorizing the exiled Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple there, Cyrus acknowledged: “All the kingdoms of the earth Jehovah the God of the heavens has given me, and he himself has commissioned me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ezra 1:1, 2</a>) This, of course, does not mean that Cyrus became a Jewish convert but simply that he knew the Biblical facts regarding his victory. In view of the high administrative position in which Daniel was placed, both before and after the fall of Babylon (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Dan. 5:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 6:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 28</a>), it would be most unusual if Cyrus were not to be informed of the prophecies that Jehovah’s prophets had recorded and spoken, including Isaiah’s prophecy containing Cyrus’ very name. As regards the Cyrus Cylinder, quoted above, it is acknowledged that others aside from the king may have had a hand in the preparation of this cuneiform document. The book <em>Biblical Archaeology</em> by G. Ernest Wright (p. 200) speaks of “the king, or the bureau which framed the document” (compare the similar case with Darius at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Daniel 6:6-9</a>), while Dr. Emil G. Kraeling (<em>Rand McNally Bible Atlas,</em> p. 328) calls the Cyrus Cylinder “a propaganda document composed by the Babylonian priests.” It may, indeed, have been drawn up under the influence of the Babylonian clergy (see Pritchard’s <em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts,</em> p. 315, ftn. 1), thereby serving their purpose of explaining away the utter failure of Marduk (also known as Bel) and the other Babylonian gods to save the city, going even to the extent of attributing to Marduk the very things that Jehovah had done.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isaiah 46:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 47:11-15</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>CYRUS’ DECREE FOR THE RETURN OF THE JEWISH EXILES</strong></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">By his decreeing the end of the Jewish exile, Cyrus fulfilled his commission as Jehovah’s ‘anointed shepherd’ for Israel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Chron. 36:22, 23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Ezra 1:1-4</a>) The proclamation was made “in the first year of Cyrus the king of Persia,” meaning his first year as ruler toward conquered Babylon. The Bible record at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Daniel 9:1</a> refers to “the first year of Darius” and this appears to have intervened between the fall of Babylon and “the first year of Cyrus” over Babylon. This would mean that Cyrus’ first year may not have begun until late in the year 538 B.C.E. Even if Darius’ rule over Babylon were to be viewed as that of a viceroy, so that his reign ran concurrent with that of Cyrus, Babylonian custom would still place Cyrus’ first <em>regnal</em> year as running from Nisan of 538 to Nisan of 537 B.C.E.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">In view of the Bible record, Cyrus’ decree freeing the Jews to return to Jerusalem likely was made late in the year 538 or early in 537 B.C.E. This would allow time for the Jewish exiles to prepare to move out of Babylon and make the long trek to Judah and Jerusalem (a trip that could take about four months according to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ezra 7:9</a>) and yet be settled “in their cities” in Judah by the “seventh month” (Tishri) of the year 537 B.C.E.

He restored the precious temple utensils that Nebuchadnezzar had carried off to Babylon, gave royal permission for them to import cedar timbers from Lebanon, and authorized the outlay of funds from the king’s house to cover construction expenses. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ezra 1:7-11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 3:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/18/2" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> 6:3-5</a>) According to the Cyrus Cylinder, the Persian ruler followed a generally humane and tolerant policy toward the conquered peoples of his domain. The inscription quotes him as saying: “I returned to [certain previously named] sacred cities on the other side of the Tigris, the sanctuaries of which have been ruins for a long time, the images which (used) to live therein and established for them permanent sanctuaries. I (also) gathered all their (former) inhabitants and returned (to them) their habitations.”—<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts</em> by James B. Pritchard, 1955, p. 316.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Aside from the royal proclamation quoted in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ezra 1:1-4</a>, the Biblical record speaks of another document by Cyrus, a “memorandum,” which was filed away in the house of the records at Ecbatana in Media and discovered there during the reign of Darius the Persian.

It was never intended for publication but solely for the eye of the proper official, following which it was filed away in governmental archives.”—<em>Biblical Archaeology,</em> p. 200.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>DEATH, SUCCESSOR, AND PROPHETIC SIGNIFICANCE</strong></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Cyrus is believed to have fallen in battle about 530 B.C.E., though the accounts are somewhat obscure. Prior to his death, his son Cambyses evidently became coregent with him, succeeding to the Persian throne as sole ruler when his father died.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">The prophecies concerning the sudden fall of symbolical “Babylon the Great” as set forth in the book of Revelation parallel in major respects the description of Cyrus’ conquest of the literal city of Babylon. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Revelation 16:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 18:7, 8</a> with <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Isaiah 44:27, 28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 47:8, 9</a>.)

The royal power granted to him by the king of Persia would give him added reason and authority to do the research necessary, and it would be logical for such a man to write a record of this important segment of <span id="page558" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="558" data-before-text="558"></span>his nation’s history. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011434/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezra 7:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011434/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011434/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 25, 26</a>) The book is honest, therefore, in its use of the first person for the writer from chapter 7, verse 27, through chapter 9. Most scholars are in agreement that the book of Ezra carries on the history at the point where the Chronicles leave off, as a comparison of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011434/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 36:22, 23 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011434/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Ezra 1:1-3</a> will show. This again points to Ezra as the writer. Jewish tradition likewise assigns the writership to Ezra.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>AUTHENTICITY</strong></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The book of Ezra is included in the Hebrew canon. Originally it was combined with Nehemiah to form one scroll. The Talmud follows this tradition, but since the sixteenth century, printed Hebrew Bibles mark a division, although they count the two books as one in the total number of the books of the Hebrew Scriptures. The <em>Douay Version</em> uses the designations First and Second Esdras, following the Greek form of spelling. It notes, however, that the second book is also known as Nehemiah. There is an apocryphal book in Greek called <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011434/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezra III</a>. This is composed of passages from Second Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah and certain popular legends; also there is the book falsely called <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011434/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezra IV</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The greater portion of Ezra was written in Hebrew. But a sizable portion is in Aramaic, since Ezra copied from the public records and official documents. These include the copies of letters sent to the Persian kings by officials “beyond the [Euphrates] River” and the royal replies and decrees imposing commands on these officials. Also, Ezra supplied a brief connecting history linking these documents. Aramaic was the diplomatic language and that used in international commerce of Ezra’s day. The Aramaic portions are found in chapters 4 to 7. Some of Ezra’s information was copied from Jewish archives, and this part is, of course, in Hebrew. These facts also strengthen the argument for the authenticity of Ezra’s account.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011434/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezra 7:23-26</a> records that the Persian government approved the law of Moses as applicable to the Jews and that the Persians thus had a hand in restoring true worship. Archaeology confirms this. Papyrus documents have been found on the island of Elephantine in Egypt, dating from the fifth century B.C.E. On one of them Darius II gives instructions for the observance of the Passover by the Jewish colony on the island. Ezra’s references to the Persian kings put them in their accurate order. Today the majority of scholars accept the accuracy of the book, <em>The Westminster Dictionary of the Bible</em> frankly saying that “there is no doubt about the reliability of the historical contents.” The record in the book is, therefore, dependable, and Ezra was a real character of history.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>TIME AND SETTING</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The book of Ezra was written about 460 B.C.E., along with the books of Chronicles. Ezra begins by relating the decree of Cyrus for the restoration of the Jews from Babylon. It was in the first year of Cyrus that this Persian king issued a restoration proclamation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011434/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezra 1:1</a>) Judah and Jerusalem had been left desolate of inhabitants, in the autumn of 607 B.C.E., when those left by Nebuchadnezzar moved to Egypt. The seventieth year of Jerusalem’s desolation, the last enforced sabbath on the land, would end in the autumn of 537 B.C.E. Cyrus’ decree must have been issued late in 538 B.C.E. or early in 537 for two reasons. The desolation had to last until the seventieth year ended, and the released Israelites would not be expected to travel in the winter rainy season, as would have been the case if the decree had been made a few months earlier. Likely it was issued in the early spring of 537 B.C.E. in order to give the Jews a chance to travel during the dry season and arrive in Jerusalem and to set up the altar on the first day of the seventh month (Tishri) of the year 537 B.C.E., September 28/29 according to the Gregorian Calendar.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011434/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezra 3:2-6</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">After describing the Passover and the festival of unfermented cakes that were held after the temple was completed in 515 B.C.E., Ezra passes over the subsequent period of time until the seventh year of the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, 468 B.C.E., when Ezra personally comes into the picture. Ezra uses the first person from chapter 7, verse 27, to chapter 9 but changes to the third person in chapter 10, putting himself in the background to concentrate on the activities of princes, the priests and Levites and the rest of those who had been repatriated, especially dealing with correcting the situation of the ones who had married foreign wives.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>OUTLINE OF CONTENTS</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><strong>I.</strong> Cyrus’ decree for Jews’ return (late 538 or early spring of 537 B.C.E.)

<strong>Jerusalem</strong><br/><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb">Following the apostate Ahaz, his son, faithful King Hezekiah, did cleansing and repair work in the temple area and arranged a great Passover celebration that drew worshipers to Jerusalem from all over the land, the northern kingdom included. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">2 Chron. 29:1-5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/53/1" data-bid="54-2" class="b"> 18, 19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/53/2" data-bid="54-3" class="b"> 30:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/53/3" data-bid="54-4" class="b"> 10-26</a>) This stimulus for true worship, however, was soon followed by attack from pagan quarters, mockers of the true God whose name rested on Jerusalem. In 732 B.C.E., eight years after Assyria’s conquest of the northern kingdom of Israel, Assyrian King Sennacherib made a scythelike sweep through Palestine, diverting some troops to threaten Jerusalem.

At any rate, the city’s strength lay not in its defensive systems and supplies, but in the protective power of Jehovah God, who said: “And I shall certainly defend this city to save it for my own sake and for the sake of David my servant.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">2 Ki. 19:32-34</a>) The miraculous destruction of 185,000 Assyrian troops sent Sennacherib scurrying back to Assyria. <span id="page912" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="912" data-before-text="912"></span>(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/58/0" data-bid="59-1" class="b">2 Ki. 19:35, 36</a>) When the campaign account was recorded in the Assyrian annals, it boasted of Sennacherib’s shutting Hezekiah up inside Jerusalem like a ‘bird in a cage,’ but made no claim of capturing the city.—See SENNACHERIB.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">The reign of Manasseh (716-661 B.C.E.) brought further wall construction along the Kidron Valley.

The Greek historians make no mention of Alexander’s entry into Jerusalem. Yet the city did come under Greek dominion and it is reasonable to assume that it was not completely bypassed by Alexander. Josephus, in the first century C.E., records the Jewish tradition that, upon approaching Jerusalem, Alexander was met by the Jewish high priest and was shown the divinely inspired prophecies recorded by Daniel foretelling the lightning conquests by Greece.

In 198 B.C.E. Antiochus the Great, ruling in Syria, after taking the fortified city of Sidon, captured Jerusalem, and Judah became a dominion of the Seleucid Empire. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/86/0" data-bid="87-1" class="b">Daniel 11:16</a>.) Jerusalem lay under Syrian rule for thirty years. Then, in the year 168 B.C.E., Syrian King Antiochus IV (Epiphanes), in his attempt to Hellenize completely the Jews, rededicated Jerusalem’s temple to Zeus (Jupiter) and profaned the altar by an unclean sacrifice. (1 Maccabees 1:57, 62; 2 Maccabees 6:1, 2, 5) This led to the Maccabean (or Hasmonean) revolt. After a three-year struggle, Judas Maccabaeus gained control of the city and temple and rededicated Jehovah’s altar to true worship on the anniversary of its profanation, Chislev 25, 165 B.C.E.—1 Maccabees 4:52-54; 2 Maccabees 10:5; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/87/0" data-bid="88-1" class="b">John 10:22</a>.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="sb">The war against the Seleucid rulers had not ended. The Jews appealed to Rome for help and thus a new power came on the Jerusalem scene in 161 B.C.E. (1 Maccabees 8:17, 18) Now Jerusalem began to come under the influence of the expanding Roman Empire.

<strong>Cyrus</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Despite this pagan interpretation of events, the Bible shows that, on making his proclamation authorizing the exiled Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple there, Cyrus acknowledged: “All the kingdoms of the earth Jehovah the God of the heavens has given me, and he himself has commissioned me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001102/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ezr 1:1, 2</a>) This, of course, does not mean that Cyrus became a Jewish convert but simply that he knew the Biblical facts regarding his victory. In view of the high administrative position in which Daniel was placed, both before and after the fall of Babylon (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001102/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Da 5:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001102/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 6:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001102/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 28</a>), it would be most unusual if Cyrus were not informed of the prophecies that Jehovah’s prophets had recorded and spoken, including Isaiah’s prophecy containing Cyrus’ very name. As regards the Cyrus Cylinder, already quoted, it is acknowledged that others aside from the king may have had a hand in the preparation of this cuneiform document. The book <em>Biblical Archaeology</em> by G. Ernest Wright (1962, p. 203) speaks of “the king, or the bureau which framed the document” (compare the similar case with Darius at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001102/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Da 6:6-9</a>), while Dr. Emil G. Kraeling (<em>Rand McNally Bible Atlas,</em> 1966, p. 328) calls the Cyrus Cylinder “a propaganda document composed by the Babylonian priests.” It may, indeed, have been drawn up under the influence of the Babylonian clergy (<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts,</em> p. 315, ftn. 1), thereby serving their purpose of explaining away the utter failure of Marduk (also known as Bel) and the other Babylonian gods to save the city, going even to the extent of attributing to Marduk the very things that Jehovah had done.​—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001102/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Isa 46:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001102/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 47:11-15</a>.</p>

How did the Persian government, as an “authority,” serve as “God’s minister” for the Jewish remnant and their temple?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Prior to the Christian era, King Cyrus of Persia was a minister of Jehovah for the good of the Jews captive in Babylon. As God’s minister, Cyrus let the faithful remnant of Jews return to Jerusalem to build the temple and reestablish Jehovah’s worship there. In his decree of liberation Cyrus said concerning Jehovah God: “He himself has commissioned me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962881/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Chron. 36:22, 23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962881/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ezra 1:1-4</a>) To this extent Cyrus was “God’s minister,” not, of course, that Cyrus was now a converted Jew. Twelve years later the returned Jews had to force an investigation of the official government records to relieve themselves of the obstruction of their temple work by their enemies round about. The investigation turned out favorably, the Persian government told the obstructors to stop, and so in four years’ time God’s people completed his temple.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962881/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezra 5:17 to 6:15</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 6.

He also sent a letter of instructions that granted freedom from taxation to the priests and other direct servants at the temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962881/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezra 7:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962881/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962881/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 8:25-30</a>) Also, in the days of Queen Esther, the Persian king her husband was God’s servant in executing Haman, the Jews’ enemy. He also arranged for the Jews to fight for their lives under Queen Esther and her cousin Mordecai as the new Persian prime minister, and to kill those who tried to use Haman’s bad law to destroy God’s people.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962881/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Esther 7:5 to 9:17</a>.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 7, 8. (a) Is it only in fulfilling Bible prophecy or enacting a prophetic type that a worldly authority serves as “God’s minister” to Christians?

The Christians as well as all other subjects or citizens benefit from the proper functioning of the worldly “authority.” Who was it that delivered the apostle Paul from the Jewish mob at the temple in Jerusalem? The Roman guard of the worldly authority. Who was it that transported Paul secretly from Jerusalem down to Caesarea to thwart a Jewish plot to kill him?

Who was it that provided for Paul not to be killed with other prisoners on the ship before it was wrecked? Who was it that provided for Paul to have “his own hired house” in which to be held as a prisoner in Rome while awaiting trial before Caesar Nero?

<strong>Cyrus</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">By this victory Cyrus brought to an end the domination of Mesopotamia and the Near East by Semitic rulers and produced the first dominant world power of Aryan origin. The Cyrus Cylinder, a cuneiform document historians consider to have been written for publication in Babylon, is strongly religious <span id="page410" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="410" data-before-text="410"></span>and in it Cyrus is represented as ascribing the credit for his victory to Marduk the chief god of Babylon, saying: “He [Marduk] scanned and looked (through) all the countries, searching for a righteous ruler willing to lead him (in the annual procession). (Then) he pronounced the name of Cyrus, king of Anshan, declared him (literally: pronounced [his] name) to be(come) the ruler of all the world. . . . Marduk, the great lord, a protector of his people/worshipers, beheld with pleasure his good deeds and his upright mind (and therefore) ordered him to march against his city Babylon. He made him set out on the road to Babylon going at his side like a real friend. His widespread troops—their number, like that of the water of a river, could not be established—strolled along, their weapons packed away. Without any battle, he made him enter his town Babylon, sparing Babylon any calamity.”—<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts</em> by James B. Pritchard, 1955, p. 315.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Despite this pagan interpretation of events, the Bible shows that, on making his proclamation authorizing the exiled Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple there, Cyrus acknowledged: “All the kingdoms of the earth Jehovah the God of the heavens has given me, and he himself has commissioned me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ezra 1:1, 2</a>) This, of course, does not mean that Cyrus became a Jewish convert but simply that he knew the Biblical facts regarding his victory. In view of the high administrative position in which Daniel was placed, both before and after the fall of Babylon (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Dan. 5:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 6:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 28</a>), it would be most unusual if Cyrus were not to be informed of the prophecies that Jehovah’s prophets had recorded and spoken, including Isaiah’s prophecy containing Cyrus’ very name. As regards the Cyrus Cylinder, quoted above, it is acknowledged that others aside from the king may have had a hand in the preparation of this cuneiform document. The book <em>Biblical Archaeology</em> by G. Ernest Wright (p. 200) speaks of “the king, or the bureau which framed the document” (compare the similar case with Darius at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Daniel 6:6-9</a>), while Dr. Emil G. Kraeling (<em>Rand McNally Bible Atlas,</em> p. 328) calls the Cyrus Cylinder “a propaganda document composed by the Babylonian priests.” It may, indeed, have been drawn up under the influence of the Babylonian clergy (see Pritchard’s <em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts,</em> p. 315, ftn. 1), thereby serving their purpose of explaining away the utter failure of Marduk (also known as Bel) and the other Babylonian gods to save the city, going even to the extent of attributing to Marduk the very things that Jehovah had done.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isaiah 46:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 47:11-15</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>CYRUS’ DECREE FOR THE RETURN OF THE JEWISH EXILES</strong></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">By his decreeing the end of the Jewish exile, Cyrus fulfilled his commission as Jehovah’s ‘anointed shepherd’ for Israel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Chron. 36:22, 23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Ezra 1:1-4</a>) The proclamation was made “in the first year of Cyrus the king of Persia,” meaning his first year as ruler toward conquered Babylon. The Bible record at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Daniel 9:1</a> refers to “the first year of Darius” and this appears to have intervened between the fall of Babylon and “the first year of Cyrus” over Babylon. This would mean that Cyrus’ first year may not have begun until late in the year 538 B.C.E. Even if Darius’ rule over Babylon were to be viewed as that of a viceroy, so that his reign ran concurrent with that of Cyrus, Babylonian custom would still place Cyrus’ first <em>regnal</em> year as running from Nisan of 538 to Nisan of 537 B.C.E.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">In view of the Bible record, Cyrus’ decree freeing the Jews to return to Jerusalem likely was made late in the year 538 or early in 537 B.C.E. This would allow time for the Jewish exiles to prepare to move out of Babylon and make the long trek to Judah and Jerusalem (a trip that could take about four months according to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ezra 7:9</a>) and yet be settled “in their cities” in Judah by the “seventh month” (Tishri) of the year 537 B.C.E. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ezra 3:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 6</a>) This marked the end of the prophesied seventy years of Judah’s desolation that began in the same month of Tishri of 607 B.C.E.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Ki. 25:22-26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 36:20, 21</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Cyrus’ cooperation with the Jews was in notable contrast with their treatment by earlier pagan rulers. He restored the precious temple utensils that Nebuchadnezzar had carried off to Babylon, gave royal permission for them to import cedar timbers from Lebanon, and authorized the outlay of funds from the king’s house to cover construction expenses. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ezra 1:7-11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 3:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/18/2" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> 6:3-5</a>) According to the Cyrus Cylinder, the Persian ruler followed a generally humane and tolerant policy toward the conquered peoples of his domain. The inscription quotes him as saying: “I returned to [certain previously named] sacred cities on the other side of the Tigris, the sanctuaries of which have been ruins for a long time, the images which (used) to live therein and established for them permanent sanctuaries. I (also) gathered all their (former) inhabitants and returned (to them) their habitations.”—<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts</em> by James B. Pritchard, 1955, p. 316.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Aside from the royal proclamation quoted in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ezra 1:1-4</a>, the Biblical record speaks of another document by Cyrus, a “memorandum,” which was filed away in the house of the records at Ecbatana in Media and discovered there during the reign of Darius the Persian. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ezra 5:13-17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 6:1-5</a>) Concerning this second document, Professor Wright says, “[it] is explicitly entitled a <em>dikrona,</em> an official Aramaic term for a memorandum which recorded an oral decision of the king or other official and which initiated administrative action. It was never intended for publication but solely for the eye of the proper official, following which it was filed away in governmental archives.”—<em>Biblical Archaeology,</em> p. 200.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>DEATH, SUCCESSOR, AND PROPHETIC SIGNIFICANCE</strong></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Cyrus is believed to have fallen in battle about 530 B.C.E., though the accounts are somewhat obscure. Prior to his death, his son Cambyses evidently became coregent with him, succeeding to the Persian throne as sole ruler when his father died.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">The prophecies concerning the sudden fall of symbolical “Babylon the Great” as set forth in the book of Revelation parallel in major respects the description of Cyrus’ conquest of the literal city of Babylon. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Revelation 16:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 18:7, 8</a> with <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Isaiah 44:27, 28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 47:8, 9</a>.) The king at the head of the mighty military forces described immediately after the account of symbolic Babylon’s fall, however, is no earthly king but the heavenly “Word of God,” Jehovah’s true anointed Shepherd, Christ Jesus.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Rev. 19:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 11-16</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Part 4—Medo-Persia—The Fourth Great World Power in Bible History</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Did this happen? Yes. The priest, scholar, and scribe Ezra reports that Cyrus decreed that Jehovah’s worshipers could “go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and rebuild the house of Jehovah the God of Israel​—he is the true God—​which was in Jerusalem.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988208/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezra 1:3</a>) <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988208/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezra 2:64, 65</a> takes note of almost 50,000 persons who made the journey back to Jerusalem, carrying the temple treasures with them. In 537 B.C.E. the land again began to be inhabited​—just 70 years after Jerusalem had fallen.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988208/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jeremiah 25:11, 12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988208/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 29:10</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Archaeology has confirmed that such a decree was in harmony with Cyrus’ policy. On a clay cylinder found in the ruins of Babylon, Cyrus says: “I returned to (these) sacred cities . . . the sanctuaries of which have been ruins for a long time, the images which (used) to live therein and established for them permanent sanctuaries. I (also) gathered all their (former) inhabitants and returned (to them) their habitations.”</p>

<strong>Shedding Forth Light Amidst Earth’s Gloom</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> This gathering work is beautifully described in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985166/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Isaiah chapter 60, verses 3 through 10</a>. There Jehovah speaks of “kings” who appear in connection with Zion’s “shining forth” and who minister to that wifely organization. When God’s people of ancient times returned from Babylonian captivity, King Darius the Mede and King Cyrus of Persia took the lead in making provision for the restoration of Jehovah’s worship at Jerusalem. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985166/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Daniel 5:30, 31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985166/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 9:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985166/24/2" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> Ezra 1:1-3</a>) In this, they aptly pictured the Almighty King, Jehovah, and his associate King, Jesus, who have directed the restoration of true worship among Jehovah’s people of modern times.

That deliverance was for a purpose. Jehovah God wanted his true worship reestablished in Jerusalem and his temple rebuilt. In fact, the decree issued by Cyrus and recorded by Ezra specifically mentioned the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the temple: “Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God prove to be with him. So let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and rebuild the house of Jehovah the God of Israel​—he is the true God—​which was in Jerusalem.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972363/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ezra 1:3</a>) So faithful Jews were to leave old Babylon, return to Jerusalem, <span id="page301" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="301" data-before-text="301"></span>and there rebuild Jehovah’s temple and the city and begin reading Jehovah’s law to the people.

They were to learn all the requirements of true worship and then obey them.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">15, 16.

Certainly not. All of this involved effort​—hard work. It meant a long trek through semidesert land, leaving behind the comforts of a nice home in Babylon and perhaps a good job there. It meant that they were to enter a broken-down city and build houses for themselves, houses that certainly would not be as comfortable as those they had enjoyed in the more modern city of Babylon. Food might be scarce, and of little variety. Life would not be so easy. It really meant rough going for those Jews who were putting true worship first.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> On the other hand, some Jews may have loved old Babylon too much, not appreciating the real purpose of Jehovah’s deliverance. They may have liked their good jobs and their comfortable homes in the great city of Babylon. Some may have liked these things too much to leave them behind and return to Jerusalem. Perhaps they were too settled in their ways in old Babylon to consider a move. Besides that, they may have made good friends with some of the Babylonians for business reasons. Or perhaps they had good businesses which took much of their time and they did not want to give these up to return to Jerusalem and start all over, so to speak. Yes, it may have been a bleak prospect indeed for some of those Jews who held material possessions in higher esteem than the privilege of seeing true worship restored in Jerusalem.</p>

<strong>Do Not Miss the Purpose of Jehovah’s Deliverance</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> It is good for us to recall the deliverance of natural Israel from Babylon of old. That deliverance was for a purpose. Jehovah God wanted his true worship reestablished in Jerusalem and his temple rebuilt. In fact, the decree issued by Cyrus and recorded by Ezra specifically mentioned the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the temple: “Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God prove to be with him. So let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and rebuild the house of Jehovah the God of Israel​—he is the true God—​which was in Jerusalem.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972363/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ezra 1:3</a>) So faithful Jews were to leave old Babylon, return to Jerusalem, <span id="page301" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="301" data-before-text="301"></span>and there rebuild Jehovah’s temple and the city and begin reading Jehovah’s law to the people. They were to start offering the sacrifices to Jehovah again as commanded in his law. They were to learn all the requirements of true worship and then obey them.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">15, 16. (a) Was it an easy thing for the remnant of Jews to return to Jerusalem and Judah? Explain. (b) What may have prevented many Jews from returning to Jerusalem?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> Was this an easy assignment for those faithful Israelites? Certainly not. All of this involved effort​—hard work. It meant a long trek through semidesert land, leaving behind the comforts of a nice home in Babylon and perhaps a good job there. It meant that they were to enter a broken-down city and build houses for themselves, houses that certainly would not be as comfortable as those they had enjoyed in the more modern city of Babylon. Food might be scarce, and of little variety. Life would not be so easy. It really meant rough going for those Jews who were putting true worship first.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> On the other hand, some Jews may have loved old Babylon too much, not appreciating the real purpose of Jehovah’s deliverance. They may have liked their good jobs and their comfortable homes in the great city of Babylon. Some may have liked these things too much to leave them behind and return to Jerusalem. Perhaps they were too settled in their ways in old Babylon to consider a move. Besides that, they may have made good friends with some of the Babylonians for business reasons. Or perhaps they had good businesses which took much of their time and they did not want to give these up to return to Jerusalem and start all over, so to speak. Yes, it may have been a bleak prospect indeed for some of those Jews who held material possessions in higher esteem than the privilege of seeing true worship restored in Jerusalem.</p>

<strong>What Does God Have in Mind?</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">With this the Israelites can see that God is going to deliver them from Babylon. He calls himself their Repurchaser. Knowing this in advance, Jehovah shows that his heart’s wish is that the Israelites avoid captivity and deportation from their homeland by paying attention to his commandments. Then, instead of having calamity come upon them from Babylon, they can have peace and prosperity as full, deep and plentiful as a river. Their deeds of righteousness can be as innumerable as the sea’s waves. Jehovah had promised their forefather Abraham to make his seed as numberless as the grains of sand on the seashore. How great his love for them and how good his purpose toward them! He appeals to their love as the One really interested in them, teaching them how to benefit themselves, lovingly leading them <span id="page507" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="507" data-before-text="507"></span>in the way to walk. O if only they would listen! He does not desire their cutting off or annihilation from before him. But he foreknows that they are rebellious and will not follow his teaching and leading and will have to be disciplined. Even so, Jehovah is so kindhearted to them that he cannot forsake them utterly. His next words will prove to be a light of hope during their captivity:</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="si">“Go forth, you people, out of Babylon! Run away from the Chaldeans. Tell forth even with the sound of a joyful cry, cause this to be heard. Make it to go forth to the extremity of the earth. Say: ‘Jehovah has repurchased his servant Jacob. And they did not get thirsty when he was making them walk even through devastated places. Water out of the rock he caused to flow forth for them, and he proceeded to split a rock that the water might stream forth.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965605/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isa. 48:20, 21</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Therefore, these descendants of his beloved servant Jacob he does not leave in complete despair. Of course, Babylon is not going to open her prison voluntarily to let the Israelites run away, and it is not Jehovah’s will for them to make a jailbreak to try to get out of Babylon before she falls. Through his prophet <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965605/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jeremiah (25:11-14</a>) he later will tell them that they cannot go back to their homeland before it has lain desolate seventy years. So they will have to wait upon Jehovah through Cyrus, whom he has loved as their liberator.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The fact that he foretells this will result in exalting his name, for when Babylon actually fell the news of her fall was published throughout all the Medo-Persian Empire, and the Israelites were able to tell others about it and to explain why Babylon fell and thus not let the people give all the credit to a man for her downfall. Thus, besides his Word he had witnesses to his acts and purposes, just as he has in the earth today. His love for those who took advantage of the release was shown by the fact that he took them back through a devastated territory, yet he cared for them, bringing them water out of a rockmass and seeing that they were able to get back to Jerusalem safely. Jehovah’s kindness to his people was indeed unmatchable. But he could not be at peace with those among them who broke his commandments, and particularly not with wicked Babylon.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965605/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa. 48:22</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">When the fall of Babylon did come, some Israelites did not take the trip to Jerusalem; but these were not necessarily counted wicked, for example, the aged Daniel. If it was not agreeable for some to leave Babylon, they could act on the suggestion in Cyrus’ decree and contribute gold, silver, goods and domestic animals to those actually returning and could also send along a voluntary offering for the house of the true God, which was in Jerusalem.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965605/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ezra 1:2-4</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>WHY HE ALLOWED SUFFERING TO HIS PEOPLE</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Jerusalem represented God’s name, but in Isaiah’s day they were proving themselves rebellious. By the time of Jerusalem’s fall to Babylon in 607 B.C.E., their wickedness, God knew, would increase to the point that Jehovah’s patience with them would run out and they would have to have discipline administered to them. He warns:</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="si">“Rouse yourself, rouse yourself, rise up, O Jerusalem, you who have drunk at the hand of Jehovah his cup of rage. The goblet, the cup causing reeling, you have drunk, you have drained out. There was none of all the sons that she brought to birth conducting her, and there was none of all the sons that she brought up taking hold of her hand. Those two things were befalling you. Who will sympathize with you? Despoiling and breakdown, and hunger and sword! Who will comfort you? Your own sons have swooned away. They have lain down at the head of all the streets like the wild sheep in the net, as those who are full of the rage of Jehovah, the rebuke of your God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965605/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Isa. 51:17-20</a>.</p>

<strong>Exiles Return From Babylon</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">IN 607 B.C.E. the once-prosperous land of Judah was made “a desolate waste, without an inhabitant,” as Jewish captives were led away to exile in Babylon and a remnant fled to Egypt. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002907/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jer 9:11</a>) The God of loving-kindness, though, would not leave his people in exile forever. He foretold that they would “have to serve the king of Babylon seventy years,” after which he would deliver a faithful remnant. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002907/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jer 25:11, 12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002907/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 29:10-14</a>) And not even the seemingly impregnable world power of Babylon could thwart God’s stated purpose. The return of the Jewish exiles demonstrates the unerring accuracy with which Jehovah’s prophecies are fulfilled.</p>

First of all, the 1,000-mile <strong>[1,600 km]</strong> journey to Jerusalem took four or five months. Moreover, settling in a land that had remained desolate for 70 years and doing the rebuilding work there would require much physical stamina. Therefore, unfavorable circumstances, such as physical ailments, advanced age, and family obligations, undoubtedly prevented some from returning.</p>

Ezra tells us: “Then the heads of the fathers of Judah and of Benjamin and the priests and the Levites rose up, even everyone whose spirit the true God had roused, to go up and rebuild the house of Jehovah, which was in Jerusalem.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972363/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ezra 1:5</a>) Yes, Jehovah was with those faithful ones who appreciated his deliverance from Babylon and his undeserved kindness. With Jehovah’s help, they were able to restore true worship in Jerusalem, and this was a wonderful privilege for them. Indeed, they rejoiced at seeing true worship reestablished. The record says: “As for all the people, they shouted with a loud shout in praising Jehovah over the laying of the foundation of the house of Jehovah. And many of the priests and the Levites and the heads of the paternal houses, the old men that had seen the former house, were weeping with a loud voice at the laying of the foundation of this house before their eyes, while many others were raising the voice in shouting for joy.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972363/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ezra 3:11, 12</a>) On the other hand, those who loved their homes in Babylon and their good jobs there more than the restoration of true worship lost out on this wonderful privilege of restoring true worship in Jerusalem.</p>

<strong>Appreciating Jehovah’s Deliverance</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Christians must have faith not only that God exists, but also that he will provide the necessary things for those who wisely put Kingdom interests first in their lives. We know that Jehovah will do this because Jesus said He would. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972364/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matthew chapter 6</a> Jesus spoke of how God takes good care of the vegetation and the birds, and then he said: “Will he not much rather clothe you, you with little faith?” So Jesus’ counsel was “never be anxious and say, ‘What are we to eat?’ or, ‘What are we to drink?’ or, ‘What are we to put on?’ For all these are the things the nations are eagerly pursuing. For your heavenly Father knows you need all these things. Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972364/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matt. 6:30-33</a>) Do not forget this promise of Jehovah. Exhibit your faith; rely on Jehovah. He never fails his people. He provides the necessary things we need as we put Kingdom interests first. Jehovah blessed his faithful servants of old with the things they needed. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972364/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Mal. 3:10</a>) The Israelites who were delivered from Babylon and returned to Jerusalem in 537 B.C.E. did not suffer, but Jehovah saw to it they had sufficient food, clothing and shelter. Ezra tells us: “As for all those round about them, they strengthened their hands with utensils of silver, with gold, with goods and with domestic animals and with choice things, besides all that which was voluntarily <span id="page306" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="306" data-before-text="306"></span>offered.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972364/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ezra 1:6</a>) Jehovah promises to provide the needed things for his servants today IF we put true worship and Kingdom interests <em>first</em> in our lives. So show appreciation for Jehovah’s deliverance by putting faith in him, relying on him for your material needs as you put Kingdom interests first.</p>

How can they be obtained and retained?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">IN ALL parts of the earth people are on the run, yes, setting their hearts on the treasures or material things of this life. They count happiness in dollars, new cars and houses. Success and security are measured by wealth. And yet never has the world of mankind been so unhappy and felt so insecure. Religion is held out as the path to peace and security, and many zealously take hold of what is considered a respectable religion, only to be frustrated in their quest for that which is soul-satisfying and durable. Why is this? Is it because most people are seeking after the wrong kind of treasure? What is the really worthwhile treasure that brings peace, security and, above all, the blessing and favor of the God of the universe? In order that we may set our hearts on that which is really worthwhile and leads to life, it will be very beneficial to examine the record of a people who were in covenant relationship with the Most High God. Let us, then, examine our present course in the light of that record.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>ANCIENT EXAMPLE</strong></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Jewish nation went into captivity in the year 607 B.C.E. and for seventy years served under the heavy yoke of Babylon. Now the time had come for them to be released from their bondage, to leave the land of captivity to return to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple for Jehovah’s worship. Was that an easy thing for them to do? No, it required faith in Jehovah to leave the land of exile. Most of the Israelites at that time had been born in Babylon and had fulfilled Jehovah’s command as recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963641/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jeremiah 29:5-7</a>:”Build houses and inhabit them, and plant gardens and eat their fruitage. Take wives and become father to sons and to daughters; . . . seek the peace of the city to which I have caused you to go into exile.” To many it was the only home they knew, the only security they had in a material sense. So the question was, Would they heed the call to go to Jerusalem in the interests of Jehovah’s worship? Would they leave their homes, friends and material possessions to travel hundreds of miles to a land that many of them did not know and had never seen, to build a temple for the worship of the true God, Jehovah?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Many of them did. They were encouraged, and this no doubt fired their zeal and helped them make their decision. Even King Cyrus of Persia urged them on, and the people of the land encouraged them too. “As for all those round about them, they strengthened their hands with utensils of silver, with gold, with goods and with domestic animals . . . Also, King Cyrus himself brought forth the utensils of the house of Jehovah . . . [and] proceeded to . . . number them out to Sheshbazzar the chieftain of Judah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963641/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezra 1:6-8</a>) So with silver and gold and words of encouragement they set off on the long and dangerous journey. They had bright hopes, things looked good, and before them was an open path to worship Jehovah God at his temple in Jerusalem. Such a privilege <span id="page518" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="518" data-before-text="518"></span>and honor was indeed a worthwhile treasure and one that could bring lasting benefits to those seeking it.</p>

<strong>Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadrezzar</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><span id="page1213" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1213" data-before-text="1213"></span><strong>BUILDING PROJECTS</strong></p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Besides attaining numerous military victories and expanding the Babylonian Empire in fulfillment of prophecy (compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013128/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Jeremiah chaps. 47-49</a>), Nebuchadnezzar engaged in considerable building activity. To satisfy the homesick longings of his Median queen, Nebuchadnezzar reportedly built the Hanging Gardens, rated as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Many of the extant cuneiform inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar tell of his building projects, including his erection of temples, palaces and walls. An excerpt from one of these inscriptions reads:</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">“Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, the restorer of Esagila and Ezida, son of Nabopolassar am I. As a protection to Esagila, that no powerful enemy and destroyer might take Babylon, that the line of battle might not approach lmgur-Bel, the wall of Babylon, that which no former king had done [I did]; at the enclosure of Babylon I made an enclosure of a strong wall on the east side. I dug a moat, I reached the level of the water. I then saw that the wall which my father had prepared was too small in its construction. I built with bitumen and brick a mighty wall which, like a mountain, could not be moved and connected it with the wall of my father; I laid its foundations on the breast of the under-world; its top I raised up like a mountain. Along this wall to strengthen it I constructed a third and as the base of a protecting wall I laid a foundation of bricks and built it on the breast of the under-world and laid its foundation. The fortifications of Esagila and Babylon I strengthened and established the name of my reign forever.”—<em>Archaeology and the Bible,</em> by George A. Barton, pp. 478, 479.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>HIS INSANITY</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The foregoing harmonizes with Nebuchadnezzar’s boast made just before he lost his sanity: “Is not this Babylon the Great, that I myself have built for the royal house with the strength of my might and for the dignity of my majesty?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013128/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Dan. 4:30</a>) But when, in fulfillment of his divinely sent dream about the chopped-down tree, his reasoning powers were restored, Nebuchadnezzar had to acknowledge that Jehovah is able to humiliate those walking in pride.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013128/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Dan. chap. 4</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>VERY RELIGIOUS</strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The indications are that Nebuchadnezzar was extremely religious, building and beautifying the temples of numerous Babylonian deities. Particularly was he devoted to the worship of Marduk, the chief god of Babylon. To him Nebuchadnezzar gave credit for his military victories. Trophies of war, including the sacred vessels of Jehovah’s temple, appear to have been deposited in the temple of Marduk (Merodach). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013128/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ezra 1:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013128/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 5:14</a>) Says an inscription of Nebuchadnezzar: “For thy glory, O exalted MERODACH a house have I made. . . . May it receive within itself the abundant tribute of the Kings of nations and of all peoples!”</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">The image of gold set up by Nebuchadnezzar in the plain of Dura was perhaps dedicated to Marduk and designed to promote religious unity in the empire. Enraged over the refusal of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego to worship this image even after being given a second opportunity, Nebuchadnezzar commanded that they be thrown into a fiery furnace heated seven times hotter than usual. However, when these three Hebrews were delivered by Jehovah’s angel, Nebuchadnezzar was forced to say that “there does not exist another god that is able to deliver like this one.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013128/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Dan. chap. 3</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Nebuchadnezzar also appears to have relied heavily on divination in planning his military moves. Ezekiel’s prophecy, for example, depicts the king of Babylon as employing divination in deciding whether to go against Rabbah of Ammon or against Jerusalem.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013128/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ezek. 21:18-23</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Cyrus</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Cyrus’ cooperation with the Jews was in notable contrast with their treatment by earlier pagan rulers. He restored the precious temple utensils that Nebuchadnezzar II had carried off to Babylon, gave royal permission for them to import cedar timbers from Lebanon, and authorized the outlay of funds from the king’s house to cover construction expenses. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001102/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ezr 1:7-11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001102/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 3:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001102/19/2" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 6:3-5</a>) According to the Cyrus Cylinder (PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 332), the Persian ruler followed a generally humane and tolerant policy toward the conquered peoples of his domain. The inscription quotes him as saying: “I returned to [certain previously named] sacred cities on the other side of the Tigris, the sanctuaries of which have been ruins for a long time, the images which (used) to live therein and established for them permanent sanctuaries. I (also) gathered all their (former) inhabitants and returned (to them) their habitations.”​—<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts,</em> p. 316.</p>

Apparently this official directed any serious complaints concerning the districts under his jurisdiction to the king and then waited for royal authorization to act.

The sopherim or scribes went even farther by replacing the divine name in the written text with <em>ʼAdho·nayʹ</em> 134 times. Later, the Masoretes, who copied the text with great care from the fifth to the ninth centuries of our Common Era, noted in the Masorah (their notes on the text) where the sopherim had made such changes. Hence, these 134 changes are known. (For a list see the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures,</em> 1961 edition, page 1453.) Taking this into account, there remain 298 places where <em>ʼAdho·nayʹ</em> did originally appear in the text.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The title <em>ʼAdho·nayʹ</em> is used mostly by the prophets, and much more frequently by Ezekiel than any other. Nearly every time he combines it with the divine name to form <em>ʼAdho·nayʹ Y<sup>e</sup>ho·wihʹ,</em> “Lord Jehovah.” Another combination title, appearing sixteen times, is <em>ʹAdho·nayʹ Y<sup>e</sup>ho·wihʹ ts<sup>e</sup>va·ʼohthʹ,</em> “Sovereign Lord, Jehovah of armies,” and all but two of its occurrences (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010111/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 69:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010111/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Amos 9:5</a>) are in Isaiah and Jeremiah. The title is used to reveal Jehovah as the One with the power and determination to avenge his oppressed people, but also to punish their unfaithfulness.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"></p>

Atad may have been a person, but the name itself appears to designate a thorny locale. The funeral party included Pharaoh’s servants and the older men of Egypt, and when the Canaanites saw the mourning rites, they exclaimed: “This is a heavy mourning for the Egyptians!” Hence, the place was called Abel-mizraim, meaning “mourning of the Egyptians.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010450/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 50:7-13</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Various translations (for example, <em>AS, AT, RS</em>) use “beyond the Jordan” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010450/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 50:10, 11</a>, and some conclude that the threshing floor of Atad was situated E of the Jordan River. This would mean that the procession took, not a direct, but a circuitous route, around the Dead Sea, which it could have done in order to avoid contact with the Philistines. However, the Hebrew word <em>ʽeʹver,</em> translated “beyond,” can refer to a region either E or W of the Jordan. From Moses’ viewpoint in the land of Moab at the time of the completion (and possible final editing) of the Pentateuch, “beyond the Jordan” could mean W of the river. Yet, all difficulties are overcome by <em>NW,</em> which accurately renders the Hebrew text “in the region of the Jordan” in these verses.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"></p>

He stimulated their spirit, that is, their impelling mental inclination. Even from the heavens, God could do this by using his holy spirit, his active force. Thus, all who rose “to go up and rebuild the house of Jehovah” were helped “by [God’s] spirit.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Zechariah 4:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/15/2" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> Haggai 1:14</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>A Modern-Day Parallel</strong></p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">10, 11.

After the Return from Exile, these [foreigners] were no longer regarded as <em>slaves</em> of the Temple, but as <em>ministrants</em> in it, enjoying a status similar to that of those other bodies, which officiated in the Temple.”​—See the box “A Changed Status.”</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">17.

The latter groups were Israelites, who were chosen by Jehovah himself and not to be supplanted by non-Israelites. Yet, the Biblical indications are that in the face of a reduced number of Levites, the Nethinim were given more to do in God’s service. They were assigned living quarters close to the temple. In Nehemiah’s day they worked with priests in repairing walls near the temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Nehemiah 3:22-26</a>) And the king of Persia decreed that the Nethinim be exempt from taxes, just as the Levites were exempt because of their temple service. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ezra 7:24</a>) This indicates how closely these “given ones” (Levites and Nethinim) were then linked in spiritual matters and how the Nethinim’s assignments increased in accord with the need, though <span id="page16" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>they never were counted as being Levites. When Ezra later collected exiles to return, no Levites were initially among them. So he intensified efforts to collect some. That resulted in 38 Levites and 220 Nethinim returning to serve as “ministers for the house of our God.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ezra 8:15-20</a>.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">18.

The Bible gives few details about them. Some were “the sons of Sophereth.” Ezra adds a definite article to that name, making it <em>Has·so·pheʹreth,</em> possibly meaning “the scribe.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ezra 2:55;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Nehemiah 7:57</a>) They thus may have been a staff of scribes or copyists, possibly temple/​administrative scribes.

The latter groups were Israelites, who were chosen by Jehovah himself and not to be supplanted by non-Israelites. Yet, the Biblical indications are that in the face of a reduced number of Levites, the Nethinim were given more to do in God’s service. They were assigned living quarters close to the temple. In Nehemiah’s day they worked with priests in repairing walls near the temple.

After the Return from Exile, these [foreigners] were no longer regarded as <em>slaves</em> of the Temple, but as <em>ministrants</em> in it, enjoying a status similar to that of those other bodies, which officiated in the Temple.”​—See the box “A Changed Status.”</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">17.

The latter groups were Israelites, who were chosen by Jehovah himself and not to be supplanted by non-Israelites. Yet, the Biblical indications are that in the face of a reduced number of Levites, the Nethinim were given more to do in God’s service. They were assigned living quarters close to the temple. In Nehemiah’s day they worked with priests in repairing walls near the temple.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ezra 7:24</a>) This indicates how closely these “given ones” (Levites and Nethinim) were then linked in spiritual matters and how the Nethinim’s assignments increased in accord with the need, though <span id="page16" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>they never were counted as being Levites. When Ezra later collected exiles to return, no Levites were initially among them. So he intensified efforts to collect some.

<strong>Will Greedy Ones Perish?</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The spiritual Israelites, however, are not the only ones today who are experiencing God’s blessing. Back in the sixth century B.C.E. natural Israelites were not the only ones who returned from Babylonian exile. Among those returning were such non-Israelites as the Nethinim temple slaves. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972883/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ezra 2:58</a>) Similarly, since the year 1935 C.E. a constantly increasing “great crowd” of sheeplike persons have forsaken “Babylon the Great” and are now enjoying Jehovah’s favor along with the restored remnant on the symbolic “soil” of spiritual Israel. Because of having taken up the pure, undefiled worship of Jehovah, they, along with the anointed remnant, will be spared when greedy Christendom and the rest of “Babylon the Great” are destroyed.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204404/53/0">6/15/1966, pp. 375-376</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Harvest, a Time of Happiness</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">In 1931 the anointed remnant embraced the Scriptural name Jehovah’s witnesses. That year a related work was brought to view, a “marking” work. An understanding of the prophecy of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966444/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ezekiel, chapter 9</a>, revealed that there were many others who were sighing over the disgusting things taking place in Christendom among the imitation Christians and that the spiritual <span id="page376" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="376" data-before-text="376"></span>brothers of Christ should mark them in their foreheads, to identify them as worshipers of Jehovah and subjects of his king Jesus Christ. In other words, there was a great educational work now open to view. However, in 1935 it was disclosed that the “great crowd” described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966444/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9-17</a> were an earthly class of God-fearing people who would be delivered from Babylon the Great.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">This brought great happiness and joy to the preachers of the Kingdom and opened up an opportunity for happiness for a numberless “great crowd” throughout the earth. The final part of the harvest has meant the gathering of hundreds of thousands more. These are the “other sheep” the shepherd Jesus Christ foretold at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966444/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">John 10:16</a>, “not of this fold,” the “little flock” of Kingdom heirs, but those who would have the prospect of enjoying everlasting life on earth in happiness. At the present time we see an overwhelming majority of the preachers of the good news of the Kingdom to be these “other sheep,” for at the celebration of the Lord’s evening meal world wide on April 16, 1965, the number of the remnant partaking of the emblems, the bread and wine, had decreased to 11,550, whereas the total number of sheeplike persons regularly preaching the Kingdom good news had increased to 1,034,268.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966444/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Matt. 25:31-40</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">There can be no doubt that the harvesting work is reaching its climax. Soon the earth will be reaped of all the sons of the Kingdom, the anointed Kingdom heirs, as well as the great crowd of “other sheep,” who will get out of Babylon the Great and be safely led by the Shepherd-King through the destructive end of this system of things and on into the new order of things of “new heavens and a new earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966444/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:13</a>) These the great Farmer and Cultivator, Jehovah God, loves. He uses them to serve him in his temple alongside the “certain first fruits” of his, the anointed spiritual brothers of Christ. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966444/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Jas. 1:18</a>) In ancient times these of the “great crowd” were foreshadowed by the non-Jewish Nethinim and men slaves and girl slaves and male and female singers and the “sons of the servants of Solomon” who accompanied the Jewish remnant that left Babylon and returned to the Promised Land in 537 B.C.E after Cyrus published his decree of release.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966444/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Ezra 1:1-6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966444/35/1" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> 2:43-58,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966444/35/2" data-bid="36-3" class="b"> 64-70</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">What a harvest Jehovah God is accomplishing in his tremendous field, the world! With infallible accuracy the enthroned king Jesus Christ and the reapers, the angels, will gather in all the wheat. What blessing and happiness it is for those who assist in the harvest by preaching the Kingdom good news here on the earth, right in the field of God! What happiness for those now being gathered as they assist in the work with the prospects in mind of enjoying perfect life and everlasting happiness in the new order of things! But above all, the Great Owner of the field and Master of the harvest has the greatest happiness of all in the accomplishment of his purpose and in bestowing everlasting life on those who hear the good news and prove themselves the right kind to be harvested into his storehouse of everlasting blessing.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">But with every harvest there is a threshing and a treading. The Revelation describes this for us also and gives a preview of what is to happen after the fruitage of the harvest has all been gathered. We will look for this preview in later issues of <em>The Watchtower.</em></p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Urim and Thummim</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>Use Ceased in 607 B.C.E.</strong> According to Jewish tradition, use of the Urim and the Thummim ceased when Jerusalem was desolated and her temple destroyed in 607 B.C.E. by the Babylonian armies under King Nebuchadnezzar. (Babylonian Talmud, <em>Sotah</em> 48<em>b</em>) This view is supported by what we read regarding these objects in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah. There, certain men who were claimants to priestly descent, but who could not find their names in the public register, were told that they could not eat from the most holy things provided for the priesthood until a priest stood up with Urim and Thummim. But there is no record of their use at that time, and thereafter the Bible makes no further reference to these sacred objects.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004524/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ezr 2:61-63;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004524/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Ne 7:63-65</a>.</p>

<strong>Jerusalem</strong><br/><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">In “the first year” (evidently as ruler over Babylon) of Cyrus the Persian (538 B.C.E.) the royal decree went forth freeing the exiled Jews to “go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and rebuild the house of Jehovah the God of Israel.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/73/0" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Ezr 1:1-4</a>) The people who made the long trip to Jerusalem, carrying temple treasures with them, included 42,360 Israelites, besides slaves and professional singers.

More exiles returned with priest-scribe Ezra in 468 B.C.E., bringing additional things “to beautify the house of Jehovah, which is in Jerusalem” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/75/0" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Ezr 7:27</a>), this by authorization of King Artaxerxes (Longimanus).

They have carried with them, not the Babylonish religious practices and traditions and doctrines of demons, but the pure utensils of Jehovah’s worship, pictured by the sacred utensils that the Babylonians stole from Jehovah’s temple in 607 B.C. when Jerusalem was destroyed. They have left Great Babylon, not wildly and in confusion like the radical elements of this world, but in theocratic orderliness, under divine guidance. Jehovah their God has gone before them! Although the enemy has dogged their rear, Jehovah God has been a rear guard to them. That is why today they are <em>out</em> of Great Babylon! They are <em>here,</em> serving as free messengers of liberation, here in 1964!</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">26.

Because they have fearlessly preached the good news of God’s kingdom of liberation, “all the ends of the earth” have seen the salvation of God in behalf of Zion and the remnant of her spiritual children. Just as, away back in 537 B.C., there were upward of 7,537 slaves and professional singers that got out of the midst of Babylon with the Israelite remnant, so there is something similar today. A “great multitude” of persons located in “all the ends of the earth” have observed Jehovah’s salvation of the faithful remnant of spiritual Israelites, and in adoration they have turned to the worship of this glorious God of liberation. They have followed the remnant of spiritual Israelites out of Great Babylon and purified themselves from all her defilements and courageously dedicated themselves to the pure, holy worship of Jehovah God.

<strong>Nehemiah, Book of</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Reliable historical evidence and the fulfillment of Bible prophecy (see ARTAXERXES No. 3) point to 455 B.C.E. as the year in which Nisan of the twentieth year of Artaxerxes’ reign fell. Accordingly, the Chislev preceding Nisan of that twentieth year would <span id="page1217" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1217" data-before-text="1217"></span>fall in 456 B.C.E. and the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes’ reign (the last date mentioned in Nehemiah [13:6]) would include part of 443 B.C.E. Therefore, the book of Nehemiah covers a period from Chislev of 456 B.C.E. until sometime after 443 B.C.E.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">It was in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes’ reign that Nehemiah left Jerusalem. Upon his return, he found that the Jews were not supporting the priests and Levites, the sabbath law was being violated, many had married foreign women, and the offspring of the mixed marriages did not even know how to speak the language of the Jews.

The accounts harmonize in giving 42,360 as the total number of returned exiles, apart from slaves and singers. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013141/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ezra 2:64;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013141/33/1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> Neh. 7:66</a>) However, there are differences between the numbers given for each family or house, and in both listings the individual figures yield a total of far less than 42,360. Many scholars would attribute these variations to scribal errors. While this aspect cannot be completely ignored, there are other possible explanations for the differences.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">It may be that Ezra and Nehemiah based their listings on different sources. For example, Ezra could have used a document listing those who enrolled to return to their homeland, whereas Nehemiah might have copied from a record listing those who actually did return. Since there were priests who were unable to establish their genealogy (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013141/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ezra 2:61-63;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013141/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> Neh. 7:63-65</a>), it is not unreasonable to conclude that many of the other Israelites faced the same problem. Consequently, the 42,360 persons could be the combined total of the number from each family plus many others who were unable to establish their ancestry. Later, however, some may have been able to establish their correct genealogy. This could explain how a fluctuation in numbers might still give the same total.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>OUTLINE OF CONTENTS</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><strong>I.</strong> Nehemiah’s reaction to report concerning conditions at Jerusalem (1:1-11)</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="s6"><strong>A.</strong> Visit to Shushan of Nehemiah’s brother Hanani and other Jews; their answer to Nehemiah’s inquiry about the Jews in the jurisdictional district of Judah (1:1-3)</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="s6"><strong>B.</strong> Nehemiah is moved to mourn, fast and pray (1:4-11)</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><strong>II.</strong> Nehemiah’s request to go to Jerusalem; his subsequent restoration of Jerusalem’s wall attended by opposition (2:1–4:23)</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="s6"><strong>A.</strong> Nehemiah granted royal authorization to go to Judah; his departure with chiefs of the military force and horsemen (2:1-10)</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="s6"><strong>B.</strong> Restoration of wall of Jerusalem in the face of opposition (2:11–4:23)</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="s7"><strong>1.</strong> Nehemiah inspects wall at night (2:11-20)</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="s7"><strong>2.</strong> Those sharing in making repairs on various sections of the wall (3:1-32)</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="s7"><strong>3.</strong> Opposition intensifies; Nehemiah arms workmen to counter enemy threat (4:1-23)</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"><strong>III.</strong> Nehemiah urges wealthy Jews to make restoration for wrongly having charged fellow Israelites interest on loans; his unselfishness as governor (5:1-19)</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb"><strong>IV.</strong> Enemies unsuccessful in plots against Nehemiah, but, even after wall is rebuilt in fifty-two days, Tobiah continues to threaten him (6:1-19)</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"><strong>V.</strong> Events immediately following completion of wall (7:1–12:47)</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="s6"><strong>A.</strong> Nehemiah makes appointments of gatekeepers, places Hanani and Hananiah in command of Jerusalem and gives instructions on opening and closing gates of sparsely populated city (7:1-4)</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="s6"><strong>B.</strong> Finds book of genealogical enrollment (7:5-73)</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="s6"><strong>C.</strong> People assembled at public square near Water Gate hear reading of Law and explanations (8:1-15)</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="s6"><strong>D.</strong> Festival of booths follows (8:16-18)</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="s6"><strong>E.</strong> On Tishri (Ethanim) 24, about two days after festival of booths, another assembly is held (9:1–10:39)</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="s7"><strong>1.</strong> During assembly Israelites make confession of sins and hear review of God’s dealings from the time he chose Abram (9:1-37)</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="s7"><strong>2.</strong> A trustworthy arrangement is contracted and attested by seal; people obligate themselves to refrain from marriage alliances with foreigners, to keep the sabbaths and to support temple services (9:38–10:39)</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="s6"><strong>F.</strong> One out of every ten is designated by lot to dwell in Jerusalem; listing of those dwelling in Jerusalem and other places; genealogical information about priests and Levites (11:1–12:26)</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="s6"><strong>G.</strong> Events associated with the inauguration of Jerusalem’s wall (12:27-47)</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb"><strong>VI.</strong> Activities following Nehemiah’s return to Jerusalem after his being away for some time (13:1-31)</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="s6"><strong>A.</strong> Law read to people; they respond by separating themselves from mixed company (13:1-3)</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="s6"><strong>B.</strong> Nehemiah has dining halls in temple courtyards cleansed, sees to it that material support is given to the Levites and the temple; enforces sabbath observance, chastises those involved in mixed marriages; purifies and gives assignments to priests and Levites (13:4-31)</p>

The very next month, on Sunday night, April 13, many thousands of these dedicated Bible Students gratefully gathered together in their congregations around the world to celebrate the Lord’s Supper, that being the anniversary of Jesus’ instituting of this memorial of his death.

Great Babylon has fallen! That is why the anointed remnant of Zion’s seed began turning away from her since the year 1919 and the full number of them have now been gathered. They do not want to touch the unclean thing or be in the midst of it anymore. They want to keep religiously clean, in order to practice pure, undefiled, acceptable worship in the sight of Jehovah their God. They have carried with them, not the Babylonish religious practices and traditions and doctrines of demons, but the pure utensils of Jehovah’s worship, pictured by the sacred utensils that the Babylonians stole from Jehovah’s temple in 607 B.C. when Jerusalem was destroyed. They have left Great Babylon, not wildly and in confusion like the radical elements of this world, but in theocratic orderliness, under divine guidance. Jehovah their God has gone before them! Although the enemy has dogged their rear, Jehovah God has been a rear guard to them. That is why today they are <em>out</em> of Great Babylon!

A “great multitude” of persons located in “all the ends of the earth” have observed Jehovah’s salvation of the faithful remnant of spiritual Israelites, and in adoration they have turned to the worship of this glorious God of liberation. They have followed the remnant of spiritual Israelites out of Great Babylon and purified themselves from all her defilements and courageously dedicated themselves to the pure, holy worship of Jehovah God.

Assisted by sympathetic Israelites who could not then conveniently leave Babylon, 42,360 Israelites responded to Jehovah’s outpoured spirit and became alive to the opportunity to repeople the hills, mountains and valleys of the soil of Israel, rebuild Jerusalem and its temple and restore Jehovah’s worship there, to the glory of his name internationally. More than 7,500 non-Israelite slaves and professional singers accepted the privilege to go with them for the united service of Jehovah.

<strong>Hebrew Weights and Money</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Every Bible reader is acquainted with David, and most of us have some idea of the picture David and Goliath must have presented as they faced each other on the battlefield. Goliath was insulted as he saw the lad David coming out with a simple sling in his hand. There in front of young David stood a giant, “his height being six cubits and a span,” or nine feet nine inches. “And there was a helmet of copper on his head, and he was clad with a coat of mail, of overlapping scales, and the weight of the coat of mail was five thousand shekels of copper. And there were greaves of copper above his feet and a javelin of copper between his shoulders. And the wooden shaft of his spear was like the beam of loom workers, and the blade of his spear was six hundred shekels of iron.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Sam. 17:4-7</a>, <em>NW</em>) His coat <span id="page652" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="652" data-before-text="652"></span>of mail alone weighed over 157 pounds and just the head of his spear came to almost 19 pounds. But this metal-clad monstrosity did not cause David to turn back in dismay. Fully confident that Jehovah was with him David went through with his assignment and came off victorious.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">It is often observed in these Bible accounts, especially in the Law of Moses, that weights, or payment of money, were to be figured according to the shekel of the sanctuary. What was that shekel of the sanctuary, as it is so often called? McClintock and Strong’s <em>Cyclopædia</em> views the matter this way: “The Weight of the Sanctuary, or Weight of the Temple (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Exodus 30:13,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 24</a>), was probably the standard weight, preserved in some apartment of the Temple, and not a different weight from the common shekel; for though Moses appoints that all things valued by their price in silver should be rated by the weight of the sanctuary, he makes no difference between this shekel of twenty oboli, or twenty gerahs, and the common shekel.” (Volume 10, pages 900, 901) In other words, the expression may indicate nothing other than that the weight should be accurate, following the standard weights kept by the priests in the temple.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Since the practice was to weigh silver to determine its value, counting money was rare, and then it was probably done only to get an estimate of value. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Ki. 12:10</a>) When coins came into use, of course, it was different. But in Israel this was not until after their exile in Babylon.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>COINS</strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">The Lydians in Asia Minor were probably the first to issue coins, doing so toward the end of the eighth century B.C. History shows that staters, made of an alloy of gold and silver called electron, were struck at Lydia about that time. It was along in the sixth century B.C. that the practice reached Persia, where a thick gold coin, the daric, featuring the king kneeling and holding a javelin, was issued. The Jews became acquainted with these coins through Persia, no doubt taking some back to Jerusalem with them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ezra 1:4</a>) The post-captivity books of Ezra, Chronicles and Nehemiah make reference to them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ezra 2:69;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 29:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/20/2" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> Neh. 7:70-72</a>) Later Grecian and Roman currency circulated in Palestine, and at times even the Jews coined money.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">By Jesus’ day a strange complexity of coins was in use around Jerusalem. When Jews traveled to the temple from foreign lands they brought their own money with them. The Greeks had brought in their talent (smaller than the Hebrew talent) and mina, and the drachma and stater or tetradrachma coins; now the Romans used the denarius, quadrans and assarion. But this money was not accepted for contributions in the temple. Whether the poll tax or a freewill offering, it had to be presented in the native coin.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Thus arose the need for money-changers. They set up stalls for business in the city and at the time of the passover they actually moved into the temple area, setting up their tables in the Court of Gentiles. They made about three cents profit on just a single half shekel change. Their dishonesty and selfishness were entirely out of harmony with the true worship that should have been practiced there. Twice during his earthly ministry Jesus overturned their tables, spilling their money and denouncing their commercializing of the worship there.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">John 2:14-16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Matt. 21:12, 13</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">On one occasion as Jesus, using an illustration, spoke to his disciples he said: “The kingdom of the heavens is like a man, a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard. When he had agreed with the workers for <span id="page653" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="653" data-before-text="653"></span>a denarius a day, he sent them forth into his vineyard.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matt. 20:1, 2</a>, <em>NW</em>) This statement of one denarius, or about 17 cents, as an acceptable day’s wage at that time sheds much light on <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Revelation 6:6</a>, which says: “And I heard a voice as if in the midst of the four living creatures say: ‘A quart of wheat for a day’s wage [denarius, rendered penny in the <em>King James Version</em> and shilling in the <em>American Standard Version</em>], and three quarts of barley for a day’s wage; and do not harm the olive oil and the wine.’” (<em>NW</em>) That denarius represented a day’s wage—a great deal of money for a single quart of wheat. The text speaks of real famine, just as Jesus foretold at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matthew 24:7</a>.</p>

<strong>Harvest, a Time of Happiness</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">In 1931 the anointed remnant embraced the Scriptural name Jehovah’s witnesses. That year a related work was brought to view, a “marking” work. An understanding of the prophecy of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966444/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ezekiel, chapter 9</a>, revealed that there were many others who were sighing over the disgusting things taking place in Christendom among the imitation Christians and that the spiritual <span id="page376" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="376" data-before-text="376"></span>brothers of Christ should mark them in their foreheads, to identify them as worshipers of Jehovah and subjects of his king Jesus Christ. In other words, there was a great educational work now open to view. However, in 1935 it was disclosed that the “great crowd” described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966444/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9-17</a> were an earthly class of God-fearing people who would be delivered from Babylon the Great.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">This brought great happiness and joy to the preachers of the Kingdom and opened up an opportunity for happiness for a numberless “great crowd” throughout the earth. The final part of the harvest has meant the gathering of hundreds of thousands more. These are the “other sheep” the shepherd Jesus Christ foretold at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966444/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">John 10:16</a>, “not of this fold,” the “little flock” of Kingdom heirs, but those who would have the prospect of enjoying everlasting life on earth in happiness. At the present time we see an overwhelming majority of the preachers of the good news of the Kingdom to be these “other sheep,” for at the celebration of the Lord’s evening meal world wide on April 16, 1965, the number of the remnant partaking of the emblems, the bread and wine, had decreased to 11,550, whereas the total number of sheeplike persons regularly preaching the Kingdom good news had increased to 1,034,268.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966444/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Matt. 25:31-40</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">There can be no doubt that the harvesting work is reaching its climax. Soon the earth will be reaped of all the sons of the Kingdom, the anointed Kingdom heirs, as well as the great crowd of “other sheep,” who will get out of Babylon the Great and be safely led by the Shepherd-King through the destructive end of this system of things and on into the new order of things of “new heavens and a new earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966444/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:13</a>) These the great Farmer and Cultivator, Jehovah God, loves. He uses them to serve him in his temple alongside the “certain first fruits” of his, the anointed spiritual brothers of Christ. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966444/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Jas. 1:18</a>) In ancient times these of the “great crowd” were foreshadowed by the non-Jewish Nethinim and men slaves and girl slaves and male and female singers and the “sons of the servants of Solomon” who accompanied the Jewish remnant that left Babylon and returned to the Promised Land in 537 B.C.E after Cyrus published his decree of release.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966444/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Ezra 1:1-6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966444/35/1" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> 2:43-58,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966444/35/2" data-bid="36-3" class="b"> 64-70</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">What a harvest Jehovah God is accomplishing in his tremendous field, the world! With infallible accuracy the enthroned king Jesus Christ and the reapers, the angels, will gather in all the wheat. What blessing and happiness it is for those who assist in the harvest by preaching the Kingdom good news here on the earth, right in the field of God! What happiness for those now being gathered as they assist in the work with the prospects in mind of enjoying perfect life and everlasting happiness in the new order of things! But above all, the Great Owner of the field and Master of the harvest has the greatest happiness of all in the accomplishment of his purpose and in bestowing everlasting life on those who hear the good news and prove themselves the right kind to be harvested into his storehouse of everlasting blessing.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">But with every harvest there is a threshing and a treading. The Revelation describes this for us also and gives a preview of what is to happen after the fruitage of the harvest has all been gathered. We will look for this preview in later issues of <em>The Watchtower.</em></p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"></p>

When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Jehovah, then the priests in official clothing, with the trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph, with the cymbals, stood up to praise Jehovah according to the direction of David the king of Israel. . . . And many of the priests and the Levites and the heads of the paternal houses, the old men that had seen the former house [built by Solomon], were weeping with a loud voice at the laying of the foundation of this house before their eyes, while many others were raising the voice in shouting for joy.” This confusion of sounds was heard far away.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ezra 3:8-13</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">But this work was not done without difficulty. Only clean, dedicated hands could have a share in rebuilding Jehovah’s house, so the people of the lands round about were denied a share in the work. They began to interfere with the building. They used every possible means to “frustrate their counsel all the days of Cyrus the king of Persia down till the reign of Darius the king of Persia.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ezra 4:1-5</a>) Finally they procured an edict from the king of Persia ordering the Jews to stop building. “It was then that the work on the house of God, which was in Jerusalem, stopped; and it continued stopped until the second year of the reign of Darius the king of Persia.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ezra 4:6-24</a>) This is, of course, not Darius the Mede, but King Darius I the Persian, who began ruling the empire in 522 B.C.E.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">In our next two issues we shall see that the enemies of God could not really thwart the rebuilding of the temple and of Jerusalem itself, also accurately timed by Jehovah. But the foregoing is sufficient to prove that the date 537 B.C.E. is a very important one. To Jehovah’s mind and likewise to the faithful remnant of Jews who returned from Babylon, it was important at that time. It is important to Bible students, for by means of it they can determine the length of time that man has been on the earth, the time of the flood of Noah’s day, of the making of the Abrahamic covenant, of the Exodus from Egypt, of the forty years’ wandering of Israel in the wilderness and of numerous other vitally important Bible events. It is important <em>to every one of us,</em> for by it we can corroborate the evidence of the physical facts taking place showing the end of the “seven times,” “the appointed times of the nations” and the establishment of God’s kingdom under Christ, in the heavens, in 1914 C.E.</p>

<strong>Were the Ten Tribes Lost?</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Secondly, the Scriptures leave no doubt that both Israel and Judah were involved <span id="page487" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="487" data-before-text="487"></span>in the return from Babylonian captivity. Perhaps not many of the ten-tribe kingdom returned, but not many of the two-tribe kingdom did either, that is, comparatively speaking. Thus we read: “For though thy people, Israel, be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them shall return.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956601/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 10:22</a>, <em>AS</em>) It would seem therefore that the some 55,000 that returned to Palestine were only a small part of the number of Israelites living in Babylon at the time Cyrus issued his liberation decree.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">That the return from Babylon was understood to be a representative return of all the twelve tribes is apparent from a number of facts. For example, we find far more references to Israel than to Judah in the postexilic books of Ezra and Nehemiah. We should not find any references to Israel if the Anglo-Israelite theory were correct. Then again, we repeatedly find the expression “all Israel” applied to the returned exiles, in just the same style that Nehemiah speaks of King Solomon’s being made king over “all Israel.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956601/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezra 2:70;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956601/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Neh. 13:26</a>) And that the returned exiles considered themselves as one, as representatives of all the twelve tribes, is further seen by their presentation at the temple’s inauguration “as a sin offering for all Israel twelve male goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956601/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezra 6:17</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">This uniting of the two kingdoms was foretold in prophecies that had a miniature fulfillment at that time: “Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them with it, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand. . . . I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all; and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all.” Then also the prophecy was true that “Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956601/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezek. 37:19,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956601/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956601/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Isa. 11:13</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">And thirdly, the fallacy of the Anglo-Israelite theory is further demonstrated by the Christian Greek Scriptures, in which the Jews are referred to as Israel some seventy-five times. Jesus repeatedly stated that he was sent to the “lost sheep of the house of Israel,” not just to the lost sheep of the house of Judah, but to all twelve tribes. There is also record of a prophetess Anna, “of Asher’s tribe,” serving at the temple. And when Jesus was impaled on the torture stake we find the terms “King of the Jews” and “King of Israel” used interchangeably.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956601/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 10:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956601/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Luke 2:36</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956601/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 27:37,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956601/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 42</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Consider: if only those of the two tribes had returned to Palestine, why would Peter on the day of Pentecost say: “Therefore let all the house of Israel know for a certainty that God” made this Jesus Lord and Christ? And if ten of the twelve tribes had gone to the British Isles and were lost, why would James, under inspiration, address his letter to the twelve tribes? Note also Paul’s words: “Our twelve tribes are hoping to attain to the fulfillment of this [resurrection] promise by intensely rendering him sacred service night and day.” How could Paul make such a statement if ten of the twelve tribes were lost and no longer trying to serve God?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956601/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 2:36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956601/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 26:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956601/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Jas. 1:1</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="ss"><strong>PROMISES TO SPIRITUAL ISRAEL</strong></p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">An Anglo-Israelite writes: “Every Briton is born to a great inheritance, and therefore a great responsibility.” But God’s Word shows that ties of flesh are no grounds for boasting: “There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor freeman” in the Christian congregation.

<strong>Chronology</strong><br/><p id="p109" data-pid="109" class="sb">Another date that can be used as a pivotal point is the year 539 B.C.E., supported by various historical sources as the year for the overthrow of Babylon by Cyrus the Persian. (Secular sources for Cyrus’ reign include Diodorus, Africanus, Eusebius, and Ptolemy, as well as the Babylonian tablets.) During Cyrus’ first year his decree releasing the Jews from exile was given. And, as considered in the article on <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/15">CYRUS</a>, it is very probable that the decree was made by the winter of 538 B.C.E. or toward the spring of 537 B.C.E. This would permit the Jews time to make necessary preparations, effect the four-month journey to Jerusalem, and still arrive there by the seventh month (Tishri, <span id="page459" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="459" data-before-text="459"></span>or about October 1) of 537 B.C.E.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Ezr 1:1-11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/36/1" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 2:64-70;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/36/2" data-bid="37-3" class="b"> 3:1</a>.</p>

<strong>Chronology</strong><br/><p id="p241" data-pid="241" class="sb">Jerusalem came under final siege in Zedekiah’s 9th year (609 B.C.E.), and the city fell in his 11th year (607 B.C.E.), corresponding to Nebuchadnezzar’s 19th year of actual rule (counting from his accession year in 625 B.C.E.). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/78/0" data-bid="79-1" class="b">2Ki 25:1-8</a>) In the fifth month of that year (the month of Ab, corresponding to parts of July and August) the city was set afire, the walls were pulled down, and the majority of the people were led off into exile. However, “some of the lowly people of the land” were allowed to remain, and these did so until the assassination of Gedaliah, Nebuchadnezzar’s appointee, whereupon they fled into Egypt, finally leaving Judah completely desolate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/79/0" data-bid="80-1" class="b">2Ki 25:9-12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/79/1" data-bid="80-2" class="b"> 22-26</a>) This was in the seventh month, Ethanim (or Tishri, corresponding to parts of September and October). Hence the count of the 70 years of desolation must have begun about October 1, 607 B.C.E., ending in 537 B.C.E. By the seventh month of this latter year the first repatriated Jews arrived back in Judah, 70 years from the start of the full desolation of the land.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/80/0" data-bid="81-1" class="b">2Ch 36:21-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/80/1" data-bid="81-2" class="b"> Ezr 3:1</a>.</p>

<strong>Cyrus</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">In view of the Bible record, Cyrus’ decree freeing the Jews to return to Jerusalem likely was made late in the year 538 or early in 537 B.C.E. This would allow time for the Jewish exiles to prepare to move out of Babylon and make the long trek to Judah and Jerusalem (a trip that could take about four months according to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001102/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ezr 7:9</a>) and yet be settled “in their cities” in Judah by “the seventh month” (Tishri) of the year 537 B.C.E.

<strong>A Pivotal Date in History</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The Jews, of course, left Babylon as quickly as possible after Cyrus’ decree, for, by reason of their knowledge of Jehovah’s prophecies by Jeremiah and Isaiah, they had prepared in advance for departure.

No. Why not? The exiled Jews had to take advantage of the decree and leave Babylon and go back to their homeland and reoccupy it in order to end this desolation. For various reasons, such as old age, some Jews were not able to go back; but many others had become well established in highly materialistic Babylonia, and they preferred to remain in comfort rather than to exert themselves and suffer the hardships of traveling across a forbidding terrain to a land absolutely desolate. But the remnant of faithful Jews that returned were eager to obey Jehovah’s command. They were zealous for true worship at the place where he had put his name. They wanted to get away from unclean Babylon in order to be clean to bear Jehovah’s sacred vessels of worship back to the site of his holy temple.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isa. 52:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Jer. 50:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 51:6</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Cyrus appointed Sheshbazzar as governor of the returning Jews and entrusted him with the delivering of the sacred utensils.

<strong>The Comely Feet of the Messengers</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> In 537 B.C. the literal city of Zion or Jerusalem lay in the ruins to which the Babylonian army had reduced her. But the city was represented by her surviving citizens and other Israelites over whom she had ruled up till 607 B.C. So the above-quoted words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964083/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 52:1, 2</a> applied to such children of hers and foretold what they would do at God’s command. Those words did not apply to Zion or Jerusalem <em>before</em> ancient Babylon fell in 539 B.C. to Cyrus the Persian. The captive Israelites or Jews were not commanded to make a break for freedom and liberate themselves <em>before</em> Babylon fell. They were to wait until <em>after</em> Babylon fell and until after Babylon’s conqueror, Cyrus the Great, published his decree of liberation, freeing the captive Jews at Babylon to go back to their home country and rebuild the temple at Jerusalem for Jehovah’s worship. First <span id="page80" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="80" data-before-text="80"></span><em>then</em> were they authorized to get out of Babylon; and their desolated homeland would be well-rested-up to receive them back.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 5, 6.

Its seventieth year of sabbath-keeping began in the early autumn of 538 B.C., about the time of the Jewish Day of Atonement. Cyrus’ decree of liberation was published in the first year of his reign. Babylon fell before him in 539 B.C., and Bible chronologers figure that his first regnal year began in the spring of the year following, on Nisan 1, 538 B.C., which would be six months before the seventieth year of sabbath-keeping of the land of Judah began. If Cyrus had issued his decree <em>early</em> in 538 B.C. as his first regnal year, the exiled Jews could have made the journey back to their land before its seventieth year of sabbath-keeping began, which would have been contrary to Jehovah’s prophecy. Or they might have had to journey through the rainy winter months of the year, which would be from October through March. This would not be too good.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> By the calculation above, Cyrus’ first regnal year would end on March 5 of 537 B.C., or toward the end of the rainy season. Doubtless he considerately issued his decree near the end of the rainy season, shortly before March 5 of 537 B.C., and in that way the exiled Israelites could make arrangements to travel in the convenient dry season from April through September. They evidently made the four-month-long journey from Babylon during the dry months, for by October they were back and settled in their beloved homeland, before the first day of their seventh lunar month.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964083/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezra 3:1</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 7.

She put on her strength and donned herself in beautiful garments, especially those of holiness, to become a holy city with Jehovah’s temple of worship. She no longer sat on the ground in slavery, but took her seat among cities that were authorized to exist. Jerusalem became what Jesus Christ called her, “the city of the great King.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964083/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 5:35</a>) She became a symbol of heavenly Zion, the Jerusalem above.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 8.

But on earth the spiritual “remnant of her seed” had to pass through the first world war. Because of not then properly understanding a Christian’s strict neutrality toward political conflicts of earth and not understanding the matter of relative subjection to the earthly “higher powers,” the remnant was brought into bondage to Great Babylon. In July of 1917, by means of the Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, the remnant published what was called “the seventh volume of the Studies in the Scriptures,” namely, the book entitled “The Finished Mystery.” This contained an explanation of the Bible books of Revelation and of Ezekiel, and it had much to say against Babylon the Great. Thousands engaged in distributing this book down into the year 1918. This did not please Great Babylon, <span id="page81" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="81" data-before-text="81"></span>and she had this Seventh Volume banned, not only in Canada, but also, by March, 1918, in the United States of America.</p>

<strong>Determining the Year by Fact and Bible</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> How long are “seven times”, the times of the nations? The mathematics are supplied for us in another prophecy unrelated to this one which uses the term “times” or “periods of time”. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952322/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Revelation 12:6</a> (<em>NW</em>) there is mentioned 1,260 days and then in the 14th <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952322/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Re 12 verse 14</a> this very same period is referred to as 3 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> “times”. So if 3 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> “times” is 1,260 days, then 7 “times” (twice 3 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> “times”) must be twice 1,260, or 2,520 days. Early in their wilderness trek the Israelites repudiated the sovereign wisdom of their God by wanting to return to Egypt on having believed the faith-lacking reports of the ten unfaithful spies. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952322/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Num. 14:1-4</a>) For this lack of faith by the people in God’s sovereign leadership, Jehovah sentenced the nation to forty years of wandering in the wilderness with no sovereign control of land. “For every day spent in spying out the land, you shall spend a year being punished for your evil-doing, forty years for forty days; that will teach you <span id="page271" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="271" data-before-text="271"></span>what it is to have me against you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952322/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Num. 14:34</a>, <em>Mo.</em></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> So according to this rule established in the wilderness the Jewish nation, who time and again showed they did not appreciate Jehovah’s sovereign control, would have to bear God’s adverse judgment at the hands of their Gentile overlords for a period of seven “times”, or 2,520 year-days. These 2,520 years ran from the desolating of Jerusalem and the land in the summer and fall of 607 B.C. up to the summer and fall of 1914, when they expired. From 607 B.C. to 1 B.C. is 606 years. From 1 B.C. to A.D. 1 is only one year, because the ancients had not discovered the zero which according to modern mathematics would have made it two years. The use of the zero is only of comparatively recent mathematical origin. From A.D. 1 to A.D. 1914 is 1,913 years. Therefore adding 606 years plus 1 year plus 1,913 years we get a total of 2,520 years.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">21-23.

Russell in 1877 used the date 606 B.C. for the fall of Jerusalem whereas <em>The Watchtower</em> of late years has been using 607 B.C. This is because, in the light of modern scholarship, two slight errors were discovered to have been made which cancel each other out and make for the same result, namely, 1914. Concerning the first error, Russell and others considered 1 B.C. to A.D. 1 as being two years whereas in fact this is only one year because, as has been said above, there is no “zero” year in the B.C.-A.D. system for counting years. “The Christian era began, not with no year, but with a 1st year.”—<em>The Westminster Dictionary of the Bible,</em> p. 102.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> The second error had to do with not beginning the count of the 2,520 years at the right point in view of historic facts and circumstances. Almost all early Bible chronology ties in with secular history at the year 539 B.C., in which year the fall of Babylon to Darius and Cyrus of the Medes and the Persians occurred. In late years several cuneiform tablets have been discovered pertaining to the fall of Babylon which peg both Biblical and secular historic dates. The one tablet known as the “Nabunaid Chronicle” gives the date for the fall of Babylon which specialists have ascertained as being October 12-13, 539 B.C., Julian Calendar, or October 6-7, 539 B.C., according to our present Gregorian Calendar.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1952322/1">b</a> This tablet also says that Cyrus made his triumphant entry into Babylon 16 days after its fall to his army. Thus his <em>accession year</em> commenced in October, 539 B.C. However, in another cuneiform tablet called “Strassmaier, <em>Cyrus</em> No. 11” Cyrus’ first <em>regnal year</em> is mentioned and was determined to have begun March 17-18, 538 B.C., and to have concluded March 4-5, 537 B.C.<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1952322/2">c</a> It was in this first <em>regnal year</em> of Cyrus that he issued his decree to permit the Jews to return to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple.

An ancestor of Jesus Christ, namely, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, was the governor of the province, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak the son of Seraiah was the high priest of the national religion. Shortly after the returned exiles got settled in the land and tried to fulfill the real purpose of their return, they ran into difficulties with their pagan neighbors on their borders. Their major project came to a standstill and was finally banned by the central Persian government. The prosperity of the province of Judah ceased. The highest hopes of the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem, with which they had left Babylon, were disappointed. Time wore on for about seventeen years of this. Then the Main One involved in this situation, which appeared to be a cursed one, decided that there had been enough of this. That One was the Great Theocrat, the invisible God Ruler of the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.</p>

<strong>When Did Babylon Desolate Jerusalem?</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">When the Israelites were able to return to Judah and Jerusalem, that desolation ended. There is general agreement that Babylon fell to Cyrus on October 5/6, 539 B.C.E. From the Scriptural record at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101972329/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 36:21-23 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101972329/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Ezra 3:1-3</a>, which tells of Cyrus’ decree liberating the Jews and their return to their homeland, the indications are that the Jews arrived back in their homeland around the early part of October of 537 B.C.E., ending the seventy years of desolation. Jerusalem must, therefore, have been destroyed seventy years earlier, in 607 B.C.E.</p>

<strong>Cyrus</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">By this victory Cyrus brought to an end the domination of Mesopotamia and the Near East by Semitic rulers and produced the first dominant world power of Aryan origin. The Cyrus Cylinder, a cuneiform document historians consider to have been written for publication in Babylon, is strongly religious <span id="page410" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="410" data-before-text="410"></span>and in it Cyrus is represented as ascribing the credit for his victory to Marduk the chief god of Babylon, saying: “He [Marduk] scanned and looked (through) all the countries, searching for a righteous ruler willing to lead him (in the annual procession). (Then) he pronounced the name of Cyrus, king of Anshan, declared him (literally: pronounced [his] name) to be(come) the ruler of all the world. . . . Marduk, the great lord, a protector of his people/worshipers, beheld with pleasure his good deeds and his upright mind (and therefore) ordered him to march against his city Babylon. He made him set out on the road to Babylon going at his side like a real friend. His widespread troops—their number, like that of the water of a river, could not be established—strolled along, their weapons packed away. Without any battle, he made him enter his town Babylon, sparing Babylon any calamity.”—<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts</em> by James B. Pritchard, 1955, p. 315.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Despite this pagan interpretation of events, the Bible shows that, on making his proclamation authorizing the exiled Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple there, Cyrus acknowledged: “All the kingdoms of the earth Jehovah the God of the heavens has given me, and he himself has commissioned me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ezra 1:1, 2</a>) This, of course, does not mean that Cyrus became a Jewish convert but simply that he knew the Biblical facts regarding his victory. In view of the high administrative position in which Daniel was placed, both before and after the fall of Babylon (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Dan. 5:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 6:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 28</a>), it would be most unusual if Cyrus were not to be informed of the prophecies that Jehovah’s prophets had recorded and spoken, including Isaiah’s prophecy containing Cyrus’ very name. As regards the Cyrus Cylinder, quoted above, it is acknowledged that others aside from the king may have had a hand in the preparation of this cuneiform document. The book <em>Biblical Archaeology</em> by G. Ernest Wright (p. 200) speaks of “the king, or the bureau which framed the document” (compare the similar case with Darius at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Daniel 6:6-9</a>), while Dr. Emil G. Kraeling (<em>Rand McNally Bible Atlas,</em> p. 328) calls the Cyrus Cylinder “a propaganda document composed by the Babylonian priests.” It may, indeed, have been drawn up under the influence of the Babylonian clergy (see Pritchard’s <em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts,</em> p. 315, ftn. 1), thereby serving their purpose of explaining away the utter failure of Marduk (also known as Bel) and the other Babylonian gods to save the city, going even to the extent of attributing to Marduk the very things that Jehovah had done.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isaiah 46:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 47:11-15</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>CYRUS’ DECREE FOR THE RETURN OF THE JEWISH EXILES</strong></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">By his decreeing the end of the Jewish exile, Cyrus fulfilled his commission as Jehovah’s ‘anointed shepherd’ for Israel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Chron. 36:22, 23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Ezra 1:1-4</a>) The proclamation was made “in the first year of Cyrus the king of Persia,” meaning his first year as ruler toward conquered Babylon. The Bible record at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Daniel 9:1</a> refers to “the first year of Darius” and this appears to have intervened between the fall of Babylon and “the first year of Cyrus” over Babylon. This would mean that Cyrus’ first year may not have begun until late in the year 538 B.C.E. Even if Darius’ rule over Babylon were to be viewed as that of a viceroy, so that his reign ran concurrent with that of Cyrus, Babylonian custom would still place Cyrus’ first <em>regnal</em> year as running from Nisan of 538 to Nisan of 537 B.C.E.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">In view of the Bible record, Cyrus’ decree freeing the Jews to return to Jerusalem likely was made late in the year 538 or early in 537 B.C.E. This would allow time for the Jewish exiles to prepare to move out of Babylon and make the long trek to Judah and Jerusalem (a trip that could take about four months according to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ezra 7:9</a>) and yet be settled “in their cities” in Judah by the “seventh month” (Tishri) of the year 537 B.C.E. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ezra 3:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 6</a>) This marked the end of the prophesied seventy years of Judah’s desolation that began in the same month of Tishri of 607 B.C.E.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Ki. 25:22-26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 36:20, 21</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Cyrus’ cooperation with the Jews was in notable contrast with their treatment by earlier pagan rulers. He restored the precious temple utensils that Nebuchadnezzar had carried off to Babylon, gave royal permission for them to import cedar timbers from Lebanon, and authorized the outlay of funds from the king’s house to cover construction expenses. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ezra 1:7-11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 3:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/18/2" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> 6:3-5</a>) According to the Cyrus Cylinder, the Persian ruler followed a generally humane and tolerant policy toward the conquered peoples of his domain. The inscription quotes him as saying: “I returned to [certain previously named] sacred cities on the other side of the Tigris, the sanctuaries of which have been ruins for a long time, the images which (used) to live therein and established for them permanent sanctuaries. I (also) gathered all their (former) inhabitants and returned (to them) their habitations.”—<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts</em> by James B. Pritchard, 1955, p. 316.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Aside from the royal proclamation quoted in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ezra 1:1-4</a>, the Biblical record speaks of another document by Cyrus, a “memorandum,” which was filed away in the house of the records at Ecbatana in Media and discovered there during the reign of Darius the Persian. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ezra 5:13-17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 6:1-5</a>) Concerning this second document, Professor Wright says, “[it] is explicitly entitled a <em>dikrona,</em> an official Aramaic term for a memorandum which recorded an oral decision of the king or other official and which initiated administrative action. It was never intended for publication but solely for the eye of the proper official, following which it was filed away in governmental archives.”—<em>Biblical Archaeology,</em> p. 200.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>DEATH, SUCCESSOR, AND PROPHETIC SIGNIFICANCE</strong></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Cyrus is believed to have fallen in battle about 530 B.C.E., though the accounts are somewhat obscure. Prior to his death, his son Cambyses evidently became coregent with him, succeeding to the Persian throne as sole ruler when his father died.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">The prophecies concerning the sudden fall of symbolical “Babylon the Great” as set forth in the book of Revelation parallel in major respects the description of Cyrus’ conquest of the literal city of Babylon. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Revelation 16:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 18:7, 8</a> with <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Isaiah 44:27, 28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 47:8, 9</a>.) The king at the head of the mighty military forces described immediately after the account of symbolic Babylon’s fall, however, is no earthly king but the heavenly “Word of God,” Jehovah’s true anointed Shepherd, Christ Jesus.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Rev. 19:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 11-16</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb"></p>

An ancestor of Jesus Christ, namely, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, was the governor of the province, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak the son of Seraiah was the high priest of the national religion. Shortly after the returned exiles got settled in the land and tried to fulfill the real purpose of their return, they ran into difficulties with their pagan neighbors on their borders. Their major project came to a standstill and was finally banned by the central Persian government. The prosperity of the province of Judah ceased. The highest hopes of the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem, with which they had left Babylon, were disappointed. Time wore on for about seventeen years of this. Then the Main One involved in this situation, which appeared to be a cursed one, decided that there had been enough of this. That One was the Great Theocrat, the invisible God Ruler of the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.</p>

This is shown by a historical fact: At the end of the seventy years of desolation of Jerusalem and of Judah these repurchased exiles built an altar to Jehovah on the same location as that of the former temple altar, and later laid the foundation for building a new temple.

So they established the altar firmly upon its own site, for fright came upon them because of the peoples of the lands, and they began offering up burnt sacrifices to Jehovah upon it, the burnt sacrifices of the morning and of the evening.

The very next month, on Sunday night, April 13, many thousands of these dedicated Bible Students gratefully gathered together in their congregations around the world to celebrate the Lord’s Supper, that being the anniversary of Jesus’ instituting of this memorial of his death.

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Pedaiah was the fleshly father of Zerubbabel. This is indicated by <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966248/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 3:17-19</a>, which states: “And the sons of Jeconiah [Jehoiachin] as prisoner [in Babylon] were Shealtiel his son and Malchiram and Pedaiah . . . And the sons of Pedaiah were Zerubbabel and Shimei.” <span id="page224" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="224" data-before-text="224"></span>However, Zerubbabel is called the son of Shealtiel elsewhere in the Bible, as at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966248/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ezra 3:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966248/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 8</a> and in the genealogies of Jesus Christ at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966248/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 1:12 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966248/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Luke 3:27</a>. Why is this so?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">According to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966248/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">First Chronicles, chapter three</a>, Pedaiah was Zerubbabel’s father, whereas Shealtiel was his uncle, his father’s brother. Yet, for some reason that is not disclosed in the Bible, Zerubbabel was <em>reckoned</em> as the son of Shealtiel. Evidently Zerubbabel was considered to be his legal son and heir. It is, of course, possible that Shealtiel died childless and that his brother, Pedaiah, complied with the law of levirate marriage, marrying his brother’s widow. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966248/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Deut. 25:5-10</a>) The first son of such a union would be viewed as Shealtiel’s legal heir. On the other hand, perhaps, because of Pedaiah’s death, Shealtiel came to have custody of Zerubbabel, raising him as his son. However, the Scriptures themselves are silent on the matter.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Regardless of the undisclosed circumstances, the Bible shows that Zerubbabel was literally the son of Pedaiah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966248/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Chron. 3:19</a>) But, since the Scriptures also call him the son of Shealtiel, it was fittingly stated on page 160 of the book <em>“Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules!:</em> “In fact, Jehoiachin had sons at Babylon, Shealtiel, Malchiram, Pedaiah, Shenazzar, Jekamiah, Hoshama and Nedabiah. Of these sons Shealtiel was <em>reckoned</em> as the father of Zerubbabel, who became governor of Judah under Persia and who rebuilt the temple at restored Jerusalem.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"></p>

He providentially preserved one of the royal line through whom the promised Shiloh could come. It was Jehoiachin, a nephew of Zedekiah, who had been taken into captivity in 617 B.C.E. Jehoiachin had sons at Babylon, Shealtiel, Malchiram, Pedaiah, Shenazzar, Jekamiah, Hoshama and Nedabiah. Of these sons, Shealtiel was <em>reckoned</em> as the father of Zerubbabel, who became governor of Judah under Persia and who rebuilt the temple at restored Jerusalem.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964886/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Chron. 3:15-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964886/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Ezra 3:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964886/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964886/4/3" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> Matt. 1:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964886/4/4" data-bid="5-5" class="b"> Luke 3:27</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Likewise, when the high priest Seraiah was put to death Jehovah saw to it that his son Jehozadak was spared and taken into exile to Babylon.

He lived to the ripe old age of 120 years in an era when seventy or eighty was the normal span of life, and at the time of his death “his eye had not grown dim, and his vital strength had not fled.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963806/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Deut. 34:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963806/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ps. 90:10</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Well did he deserve the epitaph: “There has never yet risen up a prophet in Israel like Moses, whom Jehovah knew face to face, as respects all the signs and the miracles that Jehovah sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh and all his servants and all his land, and as regards all the strong hand and all the great awesomeness that Moses exercised before the eyes of all Israel.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963806/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Deut. 34:10-12</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>EIGHTY YEARS OF PREPARATION</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">About a century ago there began a challenging of the authenticity of the writings of Moses, but modern Palestinian archaeologists have made the theories of these “higher critics” look so foolish that there is no need to take time and space to refute them.

<strong>Ezra, Book of</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>Time and Setting.</strong> The book of Ezra was written about 460 B.C.E., along with the books of Chronicles. Ezra begins by relating the decree of Cyrus for the restoration of the Jews from Babylon. It was in the first year of Cyrus that this Persian king issued a restoration proclamation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001476/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ezr 1:1</a>) Judah and Jerusalem had been left desolate of inhabitants, in the autumn of 607 B.C.E., when those left by Nebuchadnezzar moved to Egypt. The 70th year of Jerusalem’s desolation, the last enforced sabbath on the land, would end in the autumn of 537 B.C.E. Cyrus’ decree must have been issued late in 538 B.C.E. or early in 537 for two reasons. The desolation had to last until the 70th year ended, and the released Israelites would not be expected to travel in the winter rainy season, as would have been the case if the decree had been made a few months earlier. Likely it was issued in the early spring of 537 B.C.E. in order to give the Jews a chance to travel during the dry season, arrive in Jerusalem, and set up the altar on the first day of the seventh month (Tishri) of the year 537 B.C.E., September 29 according to the Gregorian calendar.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001476/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ezr 3:2-6</a>.</p>

(Tishri, corresponding to September/October), the faithful returnees offered their first sacrifice.

<strong>A Pivotal Date in History</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">When the Jews returned to Judah there was no one in the land to keep them out, for God had by his power preserved the land unoccupied in order that it might enjoy the sabbath years of complete rest as it deserved, with no one on it to cultivate it. Every year of its lying desolate was the equivalent of a sabbath year according to Jehovah’s law through Moses. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Lev. 25:1-12</a>) How was this an exactly accurate fulfillment of the seventy-years time prophecy? Well, it was in the seventh month of the year of Jerusalem’s destruction that the land of Judah was left completely desolate by the flight of the poor Jews who had not been deported by Nebuchadnezzar. In the seventh month they fled, taking the prophet Jeremiah with them down to Egypt. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Ki. 25:22-26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Jer. 41:1 to 43:8</a>) That was also the very month in which sabbath years and Jubilee years began, namely, “in the seventh month on the tenth of the month; on the day of atonement.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Lev. 25:9, 10</a>) The statement at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ezra 3:1</a>: “When the seventh <span id="page569" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="569" data-before-text="569"></span>month [Tishri] arrived the sons of Israel were in their cities,” gives official corroboration of the exact fulfillment of this prophecy.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>WHEN JERUSALEM’S DESOLATION BEGAN</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Bible students are concerned with the time of the desolation of Judah and Jerusalem. With this pivotal date established, it is easy to go back seventy years from the seventh month of the year 537 to the seventh month of 607 B.C.E. as the time of the desolation of Jerusalem and Judah. In 607 B.C.E., the month of Tishri began on September 22/23, the day for the observance of the festival of the new moon. It was in that month of 607 B.C.E. that the “seven times,” or, “the times of the Gentiles,” “the appointed times of the nations,” began. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Dan. 4:16,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 23,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/16/2" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 25,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/16/3" data-bid="17-4" class="b"> 32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/16/4" data-bid="17-5" class="b"> Luke 21:24</a>, <em>AV; NW</em>) This was two months after Jerusalem had been destroyed and its temple plundered, wrecked and burned down, after which its two principal priests were killed.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Ki. 25:5-21</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">If we follow the accurate timekeeping of Jehovah God as recorded in his Word, we see that the desolation of Judah ran from 607 to 537 B.C.E. and will thereby avoid making the mistake of the chronologers of Christendom who ignore the prophecy of the seventy years’ desolation and date Jerusalem’s destruction as occurring in 587 B.C.E. They limit the desolation of Jerusalem and the land of Judah to merely fifty years, accepting the unreliable calculations of pagan historians rather than the infallible Word of God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Chron. 36:19-23</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Eleven years before Jerusalem was destroyed and the land of Judah was desolated, Jeremiah saw the returning remnant in a vision as a basket of “good figs.” The zealous repatriates were like these figs, because they went back to reestablish the pure worship of Jehovah in the place where he had put his name. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Jeremiah 24:1-7</a> Jehovah says: “I shall certainly cause them to return to this land. And I will build them up, and I shall not tear down; and I will plant them, and I shall not uproot. And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am Jehovah; and they must become my people, and I myself shall become their God, for they will return to me with all their heart.”</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>TRUE WORSHIP REINSTITUTED</strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">As foretold 200 years beforehand, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Isaiah 44:28</a>, Cyrus had, in effect, shepherded Jehovah’s sheep back to their proper fold in the land of Judah. Jehovah here also foretold the laying of the temple foundation. In the seventh month, just after their arrival, it was too early to have the foundation laid, but this did not delay the resumption of Jehovah’s worship. They were surrounded by bitter enemy nations, but they went ahead first with building an acceptable altar, as we read:</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="si">“And Jeshua the son of Jehozadak and his brothers the priests and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his brothers proceeded to rise up and build the altar of the God of Israel, to offer up burnt sacrifices upon it, according to what is written in the law of Moses the man of the true God. So they established the altar firmly upon its own site, for fright came upon them because of the peoples of the lands, and they began offering up burnt sacrifices to Jehovah upon it, the burnt sacrifices of the morning and of the evening.

<strong>Why Many Now Living Have Opportunity Never to Die</strong><br/><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">Secular historians are in agreement that Babylon fell to Cyrus the Persian in the year 539 B.C.E. This date is substantiated by all available historical records of ancient times. The Bible reveals that in his first year of rule, Cyrus issued a decree permitting the exiled Israelites to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple. There being first the brief rule of Darius the Mede over Babylon, Cyrus’ first year of rule toward Babylon evidently extended from 538 to 537 B.C.E.

Well, Jehovah spoke of himself as “the One saying of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd, and all that I delight in he will completely carry out’; even in my saying of Jerusalem, ‘She will be rebuilt,’ and of the temple, ‘You will have your foundation laid.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972921/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isa. 44:27, 28</a>) King Cyrus did completely carry out the thing in which Jehovah delighted, though this was contrary to what the national god of Persia delighted to have done. In the year 537 B.C.E., the seventieth year of the desolation of Jerusalem and its temple, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus to decree that the temple should be rebuilt at Jerusalem. To that end Cyrus decreed that the exiles in Babylon who would volunteer for this temple work should be released from Babylon and go back to “the mountain of the house of Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972921/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Chron. 36:20-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972921/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Ezra 1:1-4</a>) By the end of that seventieth year of Jerusalem’s desolation a faithful remnant of temple-work volunteers were back in the land of Judah, bringing to an end its desolation.

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Pedaiah was the fleshly father of Zerubbabel.

And the sons of Pedaiah were Zerubbabel and Shimei.” <span id="page224" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="224" data-before-text="224"></span>However, Zerubbabel is called the son of Shealtiel elsewhere in the Bible, as at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966248/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ezra 3:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966248/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 8</a> and in the genealogies of Jesus Christ at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966248/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 1:12 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966248/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Luke 3:27</a>. Why is this so?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">According to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966248/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">First Chronicles, chapter three</a>, Pedaiah was Zerubbabel’s father, whereas Shealtiel was his uncle, his father’s brother. Yet, for some reason that is not disclosed in the Bible, Zerubbabel was <em>reckoned</em> as the son of Shealtiel. Evidently Zerubbabel was considered to be his legal son and heir. It is, of course, possible that Shealtiel died childless and that his brother, Pedaiah, complied with the law of levirate marriage, marrying his brother’s widow. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966248/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Deut. 25:5-10</a>) The first son of such a union would be viewed as Shealtiel’s legal heir. On the other hand, perhaps, because of Pedaiah’s death, Shealtiel came to have custody of Zerubbabel, raising him as his son. However, the Scriptures themselves are silent on the matter.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Regardless of the undisclosed circumstances, the Bible shows that Zerubbabel was literally the son of Pedaiah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966248/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Chron. 3:19</a>) But, since the Scriptures also call him the son of Shealtiel, it was fittingly stated on page 160 of the book <em>“Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules!:</em> “In fact, Jehoiachin had sons at Babylon, Shealtiel, Malchiram, Pedaiah, Shenazzar, Jekamiah, Hoshama and Nedabiah. Of these sons Shealtiel was <em>reckoned</em> as the father of Zerubbabel, who became governor of Judah under Persia and who rebuilt the temple at restored Jerusalem.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"></p>

When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Jehovah, then the priests in official clothing, with the trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph, with the cymbals, stood up to praise Jehovah according to the direction of David the king of Israel. . . . And many of the priests and the Levites and the heads of the paternal houses, the old men that had seen the former house [built by Solomon], were weeping with a loud voice at the laying of the foundation of this house before their eyes, while many others were raising the voice in shouting for joy.” This confusion of sounds was heard far away.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ezra 3:8-13</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">But this work was not done without difficulty.

They used every possible means to “frustrate their counsel all the days of Cyrus the king of Persia down till the reign of Darius the king of Persia.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ezra 4:1-5</a>) Finally they procured an edict from the king of Persia ordering the Jews to stop building. “It was then that the work on the house of God, which was in Jerusalem, stopped; and it continued stopped until the second year of the reign of Darius the king of Persia.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ezra 4:6-24</a>) This is, of course, not Darius the Mede, but King Darius I the Persian, who began ruling the empire in 522 B.C.E.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">In our next two issues we shall see that the enemies of God could not really thwart the rebuilding of the temple and of Jerusalem itself, also accurately timed by Jehovah. But the foregoing is sufficient to prove that the date 537 B.C.E. is a very important one. To Jehovah’s mind and likewise to the faithful remnant of Jews who returned from Babylon, it was important at that time. It is important to Bible students, for by means of it they can determine the length of time that man has been on the earth, the time of the flood of Noah’s day, of the making of the Abrahamic covenant, of the Exodus from Egypt, of the forty years’ wandering of Israel in the wilderness and of numerous other vitally important Bible events. It is important <em>to every one of us,</em> for by it we can corroborate the evidence of the physical facts taking place showing the end of the “seven times,” “the appointed times of the nations” and the establishment of God’s kingdom under Christ, in the heavens, in 1914 C.E.</p>

Those repatriated Jews were saying that it was not the time for them to build the temple of Jehovah, and so “this house” of divine worship was lying “waste,” with just a foundation laid back in 536 B.C.E., but with no superstructure thereon. At the same time they themselves were living in their well-roofed houses with a ceiling and with their walls nicely paneled with fine woods. What a marked contrast there was between their private homes for fleshly comforts and the sacred house of Jehovah for the spiritual interests of the whole nation! Was this not an unbalanced state of affairs? Did this not betray that they were putting more emphasis on material things, comforts of their <span id="page34" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="34" data-before-text="34"></span>own flesh, than on their spiritual needs and their obligations to the Great Theocrat, Jehovah?
