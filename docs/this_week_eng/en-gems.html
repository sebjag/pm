<strong>Should There Be Faultfinding with God?</strong><br/><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Jehovah has spoken. Those words about God’s wonders in nature brought Job into the proper state of mind, to see that the creature is nothing in comparison with the Creator, that in the face of God’s grandeur, Job’s “declaring his own soul righteous rather than God” was not the thing to do. Since Jehovah has evinced so much power and wisdom in his visible creation and since there is also so much that surpasses man’s comprehension, God is entitled to implicit trust. Whatever God does, whether immediately understood by man or not, the only proper feeling for man is that God does what is right. It would be the height of presumption to question any part of God’s doings at the bar of human judgment. Who, then, will do any contending of a faultfinder with the Almighty? <span id="page488" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="488" data-before-text="488"></span>Certainly not Job. “Job went on to answer Jehovah and say: ‘Look! I have become of little account. What shall I reply to you? My hand I have put over my mouth. Once have I spoken, and I will not answer; and twice, and I will add nothing.’” Job’s remorse was not wordy; nothing to smack of self-righteousness. It was simply: “I have become of little account.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 40:3-5</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Jehovah’s further words show the wisdom of Job’s expression:</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">“And Jehovah went on to answer Job out of the windstorm and say: ‘Gird up your loins, please, like an able-bodied man; I shall question you, and you inform me. Really, will you invalidate my justice? Will you pronounce me wicked in order that you may be in the right? Or do you have an arm like that of the true God, and with a voice like his can you make it thunder? Deck yourself, please, with superiority and highness; and with dignity and splendor may you clothe yourself. Let flow the furious outbursts of your anger, and see every one haughty and bring him low. See every one haughty, humble him, and tread down the wicked right where they are. Hide them together in the dust, bind their very faces in the hidden place, and I, even I, shall commend you, because your right hand can save you.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 40:6-14</a>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Will any man question God’s right to be Universal Sovereign? Has any man an “arm like God” to abase the proud and wicked and hide them in the dust of the earth, as God will do at the war of Armageddon? If so, then says Jehovah, “I, even I, shall commend you, because your right hand can save you.” It is not man but Jehovah’s arm and right hand that will deliver righteous men from the wicked. Armageddon is God’s battle for the vindication of his sovereignty. No creatures on earth will need to fight in that war for God. So if man cannot do God’s work, what right has any man to say God does not do it well? He can never have the right to impugn God’s actions.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">We must be careful not to charge God with injustice or to be found faultfinding with the divine way. “We are not stronger than he is, are we?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:22</a>) Let us remember the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isaiah 45:9</a>: “Woe to the one that has contended with his Former, as an earthenware fragment with the other earthenware fragments of the ground! Should the clay say to its former: ‘What do you make?’”</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">Let us realize our proper place, as Job did. Under the influence of the new knowledge that Job had gained, he realized the impotence of man and the greatness of God. Like Job, Christians need to get the true size of themselves, they need to see how insignificant their justification is compared with the vindication of Jehovah’s name and sovereignty. Let there be no faultfinding with God. Let our words be: “To my Fashioner I shall ascribe righteousness.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962601/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Job 36:3</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb"></p>

Why? What does he teach? How does he teach? What conditions must we meet if we are to be taught by Jehovah?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">We should seek to be taught by Jehovah because he is God, the greatest Teacher of all and the original One. No one ever taught him: “How unsearchable his judgments are and past tracing out his ways are! For ‘who has come to know Jehovah’s mind, or who has become his counselor?’” No one! “Jehovah himself gives wisdom; out of his mouth there are knowledge and discernment.” He is the omniscient One, the all-knowing One, “the One telling from the beginning the finale.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 11:33, 34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Prov. 2:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Isa. 46:10</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Rightly Elihu exclaimed: “Who is an instructor like him?” For he is “the One teaching us more than the beasts of the earth, and he makes us wiser than even the flying creatures of the heavens.” Most fittingly he is termed “your Grand Instructor.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 36:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 35:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Isa. 30:20</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">To be taught by Jehovah means to have insight and enjoy peace; it means knowing how to benefit ourselves truly by being made to walk in the right ways: “I shall make you have insight and instruct you in the way you should go.” “All your sons will be persons taught by Jehovah, and the peace of your sons will be abundant.” “I, Jehovah, am your God, the One teaching you to benefit yourself, the One causing you to tread in the way in which you should walk.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 32:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Isa. 54:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 48:17</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>WHAT JEHOVAH TEACHES</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">What does Jehovah teach those who are willing to be taught by him? First of all: “I am Jehovah. That is my name.” Also that “Jehovah is in truth God. He is the living God and the King to time indefinite.” Jehovah further teaches us what his purposes are. His transcendent purpose regarding himself is to vindicate his name by clearing it of reproach, so “that people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the <span id="page341" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="341" data-before-text="341"></span>earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 42:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Jer. 10:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Ps. 83:18</a>.</p>

It also presents him to us as the great Teacher of the children of his organization: “And all thy children shall be taught of Jehovah; and great shall be the peace of thy children.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954166/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 54:13</a>, <em>AS.</em><a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1954166/0">a</a></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">No one ever counseled Jehovah or gave him knowledge, for he himself is the original source of all wisdom and knowledge. As Elihu well asked, “Who is a teacher like him?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954166/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 36:22</a>, <em>RS;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954166/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rom. 11:33-35</a>) Certainly no one! Exclusive education belongs to him; he has all the qualities of the best teacher: he possesses all knowledge; he has the interest of his pupils at heart; he is extremely patient; truly his ability to teach is second to none.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">He placed in the lower animals their innate or instinctive wisdom; he taught Adam what to do and what not to do. He revealed his will at the time of the rebellion; he taught Enoch, Noah and Abraham. For some 1,500 years he made known his will to his people Israel by means of prophets and the Levitical priesthood from Moses down to the coming of Christ.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">With the arrival of his Son Christ Jesus, Jehovah stepped up his teaching activity; for Christ Jesus, the very first of his pupils as well as the most willing and most skillful, was, above all else, a teacher; a fact recognized even by his religious opponents the clergy, for they repeatedly addressed him as “Teacher.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954166/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mark 12:19,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954166/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954166/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Luke 7:40</a>, <em>NW</em>) And he not only taught others the truth regarding his Father’s name and purposes, but he also trained them to serve as teachers and commissioned them to ‘go and make disciples, that is, learners and followers, of people of all nations, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954166/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 17:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954166/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Mark 3:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954166/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Matt. 28:19, 20</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">While on earth Jesus quoted Isaiah’s prophecy about Jehovah as teaching the children of his organization and applied it to the teaching work God was doing then and there. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954166/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 6:45</a>) However, from the context of that prophecy as well as from related scriptures, it appears that Isaiah’s words have an even more pertinent application to the present time, when Zion has brought forth her children and when the birth of God’s nation has taken place. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954166/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isa. 54:1-17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954166/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 66:7-9</a>) By what means does Jehovah teach today? By means of his Word, his spirit and his organization.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">So, if we would be taking teaching from Jehovah we must, first of all, qualify as his children by dedicating ourselves to the doing of his will. We must study his Word, which is the chief means by which he teaches us, doing so in meekness and proper fear. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954166/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 25:12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954166/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 14</a>) We must have the help of his holy spirit or active force, which comes to us through prayer, study of his Word, association with his people, and by applying God’s Word to our daily lives.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">And, finally, we must recognize his organization or earthly instrument, which he uses to throw light upon his Word. And what is that instrument? The group, organization, association or society that is devoted to upholding God’s Word and name, bringing forth the fruitage of “every kind of goodness and righteousness and truth.” And let us not forget the purpose of our taking teaching from Jehovah: to bring honor to his name and comfort to men of good will.</p>

Further, throughout eternity love will exist, for God himself is without beginning and without end.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964602/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 90:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964602/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Rev. 10:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964602/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Hab. 1:12</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 2. Why is it possible for Christians to show love? For how long will faithful Christians be able to display it?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> Man, created in God’s image, possesses the attribute of love. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964602/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 1:26</a>) Of course, not all men manifest this quality in their daily dealings. Christians, however, are led by God’s spirit. They do show love, “because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the holy spirit, which was given us.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964602/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rom. 5:5</a>) In fact, Christians have the prospect of everlasting life and so they will, if forever faithful to God, be able to display true love eternally. But the love they evince makes them stand out right now in this loveless old world, identifying them as Christ’s followers.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 3. (a) What quality identifies Christ’s disciples, and what evidence of it among early Christians did Tertullian give? (b) How have Jehovah’s witnesses committed themselves to showing brotherly love?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> “By this all will know that you are my disciples,” said Jesus, “if you have love among yourselves.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964602/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 13:35</a>) Love permeated the attitudes and dealings of early Christians. So true was this that among the pagans primitive Christians were particularly known for their brotherly love. In his <em>Apology,</em> Tertullian cites the words of such worldlings: “‘Look,’ they say, ‘how they love one another . . . and how they are ready to die for each other.’” This same brotherly love is evident among true followers of Christ today; it serves to identify them. Before all the world, amid its turmoil and lack of love, at the Divine Will International Assembly in 1958, Jehovah’s witnesses by the thousands endorsed a Resolution that declared in part: <span id="page490" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="490" data-before-text="490"></span>“Figuratively speaking, we have beaten our swords into plowshares and our spears into pruning shears and, although of so many nationalities, we will not lift up sword against one another because we are Christian brothers and members of the one family of God, neither will we learn to war against one another any more, but we will walk in God’s paths in peace, unity and brotherly love.” Their actions have been consistent with their firm resolve and have been in keeping with Paul’s admonition: “In brotherly love have tender affection for one another.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964602/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Rom. 12:10</a>) The love Jehovah’s witnesses have for one another identifies them as Christ’s followers. But how do they further compare with early Christians?</p>

<strong>A Lesson in Man’s Littleness</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">“The storm raged for some while, but at last it stopped; and we, who were pounded black and blue, scrambled as well as we could upon our horses. Pursuing the way to our lodging for the night, we showed our scratches and <span id="page168" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="168" data-before-text="168"></span>bruises to each other; but about a mile farther on we came upon a scene of devastation which surpassed what we had suffered, and defies description. All the trees were stripped of their leaves and shattered; the beasts in the field lay dead; many of the herdsmen had also been killed; we observed large quantities of hailstones which could not have been grasped with two hands.”—<em>Harvard Classics,</em> Vol. 31, pp. 352, 353.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">When God opens up his storehouses of snow and hail at Armageddon, his enemies will be in for a terrifying time, and there will be no way of escape. Who can fight against snow or hail?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong>RAIN, DEW, FROST AND ICE</strong></p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">More questions from the Almighty: “Where, now, is the way by which the light distributes itself, and the east wind scatters about upon the earth? Who has divided a channel for the flood and a way for the thunderous storm cloud, to make it rain upon the land where there is no man, upon the wilderness in which there is no earthling man, to satisfy storm-stricken and desolate places and to cause the growth of grass to sprout? Does there exist a father for the rain, or who gave birth to the dewdrops? Out of whose belly does the ice actually come forth, and as for the hoarfrost of heaven, who indeed brings it to birth? The very waters keep themselves hidden as by stone, and the surface of the watery deep makes itself compact.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 38:24-30</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Can any man take credit for the wonderful diffusion of light over the whole earth? Can he provide a channel for the “thunderous storm cloud”? The great Rainmaker is Jehovah, and even “the wilderness in which there is no earthling man” enjoys his blessing.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Have rain, ice and frost a human originator or father? Ice and frost are very common things so that this may tend to lessen the marvel of them. Yet consider for a moment the marvel of ice:</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">“During winter the water of lakes and seas becomes heavier as it cools. As its density increases the water sinks and displaces the lighter, warmer water, which rises to the surface. This cooling and mixing continues until the temperature reaches 4°C. Then, as the water cools still further the density change is reversed. The water becomes lighter as it cools towards freezing point. Instead of sinking, it lies in a layer on top of the warmer water beneath. Finally, as the water turns to ice, it becomes still lighter, and the ice floats on the surface like a protecting lid.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">“If the density of cooling water did not change in this unusual way surface water would continue to sink until freezing point was reached. Ice would form at the bottom of lakes and seas and would accumulate from season to season until the waters were entirely solid. In summer only the surface layers would melt and there would be no massive movements of ocean currents to modify the world’s weather. The tropics would become unbearably hot and the ‘temperate’ regions would freeze throughout the year.”—<em>The World of Water,</em> pp. 148, 149.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Yes, Jehovah makes ice so that “the very waters keep themselves hidden as by stone” and yet the large bodies of water do not freeze solid with adverse effects for the earth. Ice, frost, rain and dew are the Creator’s handiwork. Rain and dew invigorate and give life to the whole vegetable world. Frost, by expanding the water contained in the earth, pulverizes and renders the soil fertile.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Just a few of the many questions put to Job in Jehovah’s sublime speech have been considered. And yet what a lesson we have in man’s littleness contrasted with God’s greatness! Jehovah’s speech shows up man’s true size, just as a molehill finds its true dimensions beneath the shadow of a mountain. “Behold! God is more exalted than we can know.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 36:26</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Jehovah, God of Production</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> Some local facts may further sharpen your appreciation. We live in a huge “island universe” of billions of stars. Most of it we cannot see because of great dust clouds in space, but now it is known to be of wheellike shape, with spokes or spirals gyrating out from a hublike center. All of it that we see men call the Milky Way—one of the spirals, made up of millions of stars with our sun among them. Many though the stars may be, there is plenty of room; for our nearest star-neighbor is said to be twenty-five trillion miles away. Space distances are so great they are measured in light years. The distance light travels in a year (or six trillion miles) is the unit. Using this measure we gain some <span id="page722" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="722" data-before-text="722"></span>idea of the size of our home galaxy, for it takes light from a star located on the outer rim a hundred thousand years to reach the outer rim on the other side; no small distance. Yet such a tremendous creative work is dwarfed by the fact that, to other galaxies, billions of light years distant, it all appears as a single star. Little wonder that Jehovah inspired his prophet Isaiah to write: “‘To whom, then, would you liken me, that I should be equal,’ says the Holy One.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956885/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 40:25</a>, <em>AT.</em></p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 4.

Reflecting the stately majesty of their Creator, “the heavens are telling the glory of God, and the sky shows forth the work of his hands.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956885/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 19:1</a>, <em>AT</em>) There men see no conflict, no creative work getting out of place, all moving on and on according to the course set by Jehovah. Men of science think the universe is expanding. The Scriptures say that God continues to work, to do good. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956885/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 5:17</a>, <em>NW</em>) Dare we set limits to Jehovah’s range of activity, his power, his productive ability? “Behold, God is great, and we know him not; the number of his years is unsearchable.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956885/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 36:26</a>, <em>AS</em>) If we find his creation awe-inspiring, more so should God himself be to us, for the Creator is greater than any or all of his creations. “Lift up your eyes on high, and see! who created these? He who brought forth their host by number, and called them all by name; through the greatness of his might, and the strength of his power, not one is missing.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956885/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isa. 40:26</a>, <em>AT</em>) Yes, the so-called inanimate creation is in motion, a symphony in the skies, a product of the great Jehovah.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 5.

Jehovah’s masterpiece was his first creation, a spirit person like himself with his attributes of justice, love, power and wisdom. Of him it is written: “Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. . . . Before the earth was. . . .

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956885/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 1:1, 2</a>, <em>NW</em>) Also, he became Jehovah’s co-worker in the production of all creative work that followed. “By means of him all other things were created in the heavens and upon the earth, the things visible and the things invisible.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956885/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Col. 1:16</a>, <em>NW</em>) In time he created a host of spirit persons, angels; also a vast array of stars beautifully adorning the heavens—all brought forth according to the divine production program. These two, Jehovah and his Son, always have seen and are now seeing in harmony. Their relationship always was and now is one of joy and productivity. “Then I was by him, as a master workman; and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956885/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Prov. 8:30</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 6.

In fact, perfection marks all that our Creator ever does. With him nothing has to be done over. There are no “seconds” or rejects. When he creates, the result is a finished product upon which no improvement can be made. “As for The [true] God, perfect is his way.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956885/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Sam. 22:31</a>, <em>NW</em>) Of Jehovah Moses was inspired to write: “The Rock, perfect is his activity, for all his ways are justice.

<strong>Be Thankful for the Rain</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The Bible describes the water cycle, saying: “God . . . draws up the drops of water; they filter as rain for his mist, so that the clouds trickle, they drip upon mankind abundantly.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009004/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 36:26-28</a>) In the thousands of years since those scientifically accurate words were written, man has had a lot of time to try to understand the water cycle. “Currently,” states the 2003 textbook <em>Water Science and Engineering,</em> “the mechanism of raindrop formation is not known with certainty.”</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">What scientists do know is that raindrops are formed from microscopic particles that become the nuclei of tiny droplets in clouds. Each of these droplets must increase in size a million or more times to make a single drop of rain. It is a complex process that can take several hours. A science textbook, <em>Hydrology in Practice,</em> states: “There are several theories of how cloud droplets grow to become raindrops, and investigations into the details of several proposed methods continue to claim the attention of research workers.”</p>

<strong>‘Let Each One Watch How He Builds’</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">What is this fire which will make manifest the kind of building that each one has <span id="page427" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="427" data-before-text="427"></span>done?

But how could that be? Are we to understand that the gold, silver, precious stones, wood material, hay and stubble are to be taken literally? No? Then why view the fire as being literal? Logically, if all those substances were used to represent something else, then the fire also would represent something and would not refer to literal fire. It would picture something that exposed and destroyed the false hopes, false teachings and unchristian activities of those who were or professed to be Christians, God’s fellow workers, would it not?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">And what was that? The facts show that the instrument that God used to destroy this worthless combustible material was and is the truth. Yes, the truth of God’s Word is pictured not only as a sharp sword, as hail and as a hammer, but also as fire. “Is not my word like fire? saith Jehovah; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952523/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Isa. 28:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952523/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Jer. 23:29</a>, <em>AS;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952523/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12</a>) This fire appeared as lightning flashes from God’s temple; bright shining truths which burned up the wood, hay and stubble.

It was these very things that had attracted them to the truth, and so they could not let go of them. They were too proud to admit that they had made mistakes; they were too self-centered to let go of the flattering occupations of character development and creature worship; they were too fearful of what Satan’s world could do to them to take an unequivocal and bold stand for God’s kingdom. So they, together with their hay, wood and stubble, perished as far as Jehovah’s organization was concerned. If they had let go of these things they might have been saved.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952523/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:15</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The words of Paul which we have just considered not only are of prophetic interest to us, but announce a principle of Jehovah God which applies to all his creatures, not just to the remnant of the “body of Christ” which were on the earth at the time that the Lord came to his temple.

Storms blow out of the south, and cold comes from the north; the ice forms at his breath, and freezes the broad water hard; he loads a heavy cloud with hail, and from the clouds his lightning scatters, darting here and darting there, turning as he directs it, doing whatsoever he bids it over all his world.

In this way many beasts of earth yearly pass through the hard time of winter. Also consider that visible evidences indicate the approach of literal winter. The blue skies of summer give way to the gray bleak skies of late fall. Temperatures drop, winds swing round from the south and come out of the north, with a chill that touches the bones, bringing snow flurries with them. The sap of trees retreats underground, the stream of life slows, leaves fall, the days become very short. We reach the time on the calendar that shows it is the seasonal time for winter. From instinct the animals appreciate the meaning of these changes. Birds gather in flocks for southward flight. Some land and water animals and certain insects also migrate. Other insects store food, such as the honeybee that packs honey in hives during the favorable season of summer and retires within those shelters stocked with food to live out the winter. Many other animals prepare when they see the sign of winter’s approach, not by migrating or by storing up food in dens, but by changing their eating habits to store up fat in their own bodies and by thickening furry pelts to keep out the coming cold.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="qu"> 5.

Have you been regularly asking, “Where is Jehovah?” when you are making decisions and choosing your course? Some may feel that they have not been as conscientious as they should have been. If in some sense that might be true of you, do not be downhearted. Even the faithful patriarch Job struggled in this regard. When he was under pressure, he was wrapped up in himself. Elihu had to remind him of the common tendency of mankind: “No one has said, ‘Where is God my Grand Maker?’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102010149/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 35:10</a>) Elihu encouraged Job: “Show yourself attentive to the wonderful works of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102010149/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 37:14</a>) Job needed to observe the mighty works of Jehovah in the creation around him and in God’s dealings with humans. Through his own experience, Job came to understand Jehovah’s ways.

He was called the greatest of all the Orientals. You will recognize his name​—Job. An entire Bible book was written about him. Yet, one of Job’s contemporaries, a young man named Elihu, felt obliged to correct him. In effect, Elihu said that Job was giving excessive attention to himself and to those around him. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001280/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job chapter 37</a>, we find some other specific and wise advice that can be of real value to each of us.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001280/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 1:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001280/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 32:1–33:12</a>.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 4.

Then he spoke with insight and wisdom. He made many valuable points, <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>but note this key thought: “Do give ear to this, O Job; stand still and show yourself attentive to the wonderful works of God.”−<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001280/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 37:14</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>The One Who Did the Works</strong></p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 5.

Elihu wisely urged Job​—and us—​to be attentive to the wonderful works of Jehovah God. What do you think the phrase “the wonderful works of God” includes? Moreover, in view of concerns you may have about health, finances, the future, your family, workmates, and neighbors, why be attentive to God’s works? Unquestionably, the wonderful works of Jehovah God involve his wisdom and his authority over the physical creation all around us.

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page94" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="94" data-before-text="94"></span><strong>Instruction by Attention to God’s Works</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">TODAY man has a better understanding of the wonderful works of God’s material universe than ever before. By reason of his attention to them man has been instructed in many of the basic laws and principles governing both the inconceivably immense bodies in stellar space and the infinitesimally small ones residing in the tiny atom. Man has also greatly increased his understanding of the marvels residing in his own body. Truly he has reason to exclaim: “How many your works are, O Jehovah! All of them in wisdom you have made. The earth is full of your productions.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962089/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 104:24</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">All this attention to God’s works should have caused modern man to grow in appreciation of his Creator, but not so. Like Napoleon’s astronomer, Laplace, more often than not modern man sneers that God is not at all necessary to his hypothesis. Rarely indeed does he manifest the understanding of Elihu when he said to Job: “Do give ear to this, O Job; stand still and show yourself attentive to the wonderful works of God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962089/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 37:14</a>.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1962089/0">a</a></p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Those who are wise will let their instruction regarding God’s wonderful works increase their appreciation of him. They see in God’s wonderful works evidence, not only of his existence, but also of his basic qualities, his attributes of wisdom, power, righteousness or justice and love. And they find that implicit in this knowledge is the obligation to worship the grand Creator.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962089/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rom. 1:20</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Not that God’s wonderful works are to be viewed only in the so-called Book of Nature. Not by any means! God’s wonderful works include, among other things, his inspired Word, his organization, visible and invisible, and the great work of preaching the Kingdom.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">What abundant and wise instruction we can receive by giving attention to God’s wonderful Word! Are we so concerned to learn to know and to do God’s will that we daily give attention to this Source of instruction? Do we approach such instruction with a teachable mental attitude and a pure motive? Above everything else, it is by attention to this work of God, his Word, that we are instructed.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962089/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Tim. 2:15</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">And then there is God’s wonderful organization, visible and invisible. True, only with our eyes of faith can we see its invisible part. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962089/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Dan. 7:9, 10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962089/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 13, 14</a>) But we can see God’s visible organization with our natural sight, though not without the aid of God’s holy spirit. It consists of the remaining ones of the Christian congregation that had its beginning at Pentecost. Designated by Jesus “the faithful and discreet slave,” it is the nucleus of the New World society of the Christian witnesses of Jehovah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962089/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45-47</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Do we give the attention to this wonderful work of God that it really deserves? If we would understand God’s Word and serve him acceptably we must. That includes attention to its publications, such as its official journal, <em>The Watchtower,</em> the Bible-study aid <em>“Let Your Name Be Sanctified,”</em> and the monthly pamphlet <em>Kingdom Ministry.</em> It also means faithfully attending the various congregational meetings and assemblies and giving attention to what is being presented from the platform at these gatherings.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962089/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Heb. 2:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962089/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 10:23-25</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">What is the purpose of our being instructed in this way? Is it solely that we might gain salvation? No, that is not the sole reason, in fact, it is not even the primary reason. Above all, we want to be instructed so that we may have a part in another one of God’s wonderful works, the one he is having done at the present time, namely, preaching the good news of his kingdom. By faithfully sharing in that grand work we shall also be contributing our part toward the greatest of all of God’s works, the vindication of his name.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Yes, nothing is more important than the clearing of God’s name of reproach. If we fully appreciate that fact, we shall not be unduly concerned about what men think of us but shall remember that “trembling at men is what lays a snare, but he that is trusting in Jehovah will be protected.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962089/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Prov. 29:25</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">So let all Christians, especially during the month of February, be instructed by earnestly, humbly and regularly giving attention to God’s wonderful works, at the same time having a part in the work he is having done at the present time, preaching the good news of his kingdom. Doing so, they will have their joy made full and share in his greatest work of all, the eventual and complete vindication of Jehovah God’s name and universal sovereignty, to their own eternal salvation.</p>

In this Job pictured the modern-day witnesses of Jehovah, who in a time of testing A.D. 1918 hesitated for a brief season to witness boldly and uncompromisingly in vindication of Jehovah’s great name. In each case Jehovah gave correction.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">10. (a) Who was Jehovah’s channel for correcting Job, and why was he urgent in doing so?

Just as his name means “God is he,” so he was urgent in speaking for God’s vindication. “Look, please! I have to open my mouth; my tongue with my palate has to speak. My sayings are the uprightness of my heart, and knowledge is what my lips do utter sincerely.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961603/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 32:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961603/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 33:2, 3</a>) In prophetic fulfillment, Elihu pictures the governing body in Jehovah’s New World society on earth today. Through this zealous spokesman, Jehovah has brought correction and admonition to his witnesses on earth, building them up in right doctrine, cleansing them from sanctimonious religious practices and making clear their responsibility to proclaim his glorious kingdom by Christ.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961603/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 36:1-6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961603/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 11, 12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961603/17/2" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> Ps. 145:10-13</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">11.

As space-age problems and the threat of nuclear annihilation press in on humankind, God’s spokesman gives urgent counsel concerning Jehovah’s will for this time: “Remember that you should magnify his activity of which men have sung. Behold! God is more exalted than we can know.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961603/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Job 36:24,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961603/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 26</a>) It is the time to witness as never before in magnifying Jehovah’s name and works. From times of old, men of God have sung prophetically of Jehovah’s great day of vindication. That day is now here! Pay heed, then, to Elihu’s words to Job: “Do give ear to this. . . ; stand still and show yourself attentive to the wonderful works of God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961603/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Job 37:14</a>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">12.

They include, outstandingly, Jehovah’s “unusual work” of vindication, his extermination of the wicked at Armageddon, which has been decided upon for this generation.

It is the time to contemplate Jehovah’s awesome works, and to be “working hard and exerting ourselves, because we have rested our hope on a living God, who is a Savior of all kinds of men, especially of faithful ones.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961603/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:10</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">13.

<strong>Heaven</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><strong><em>The cloudy skies.</em></strong> Another term, the Hebrew <em>shaʹchaq,</em> is also used to refer to the “skies” or their clouds. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">De 33:26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Pr 3:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/25/2" data-bid="26-3" class="b"> Isa 45:8</a>) This word has the root meaning of something beaten fine or pulverized, as the “film of dust” (<em>shaʹchaq</em>) at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:15</a>. There is a definite appropriateness in this meaning, inasmuch as clouds form when warm air, rising from the earth, becomes cooled to what is known as the dewpoint, and the water vapor in it condenses into minute particles sometimes called water dust. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Job 36:27, 28</a>; see <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/2">CLOUD</a>.) Adding to the appropriateness, the visual effect of the blue dome of the sky is caused by the diffusion of the rays of the sun by gas molecules and other particles (including dust) composing the atmosphere. By God’s formation of such atmosphere, he has, in effect, ‘beaten out the skies hard like a molten mirror,’ giving a definite limit, or clear demarcation, to the atmospheric blue vault above man.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001949/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Job 37:18</a>.</p>

<strong>Sky</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Hebrew word <em>shaʹchaq</em> (sky) is also translated “film of dust,” “cloud,” “cloudy sky”; it is apparently from a root meaning “pound fine.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004157/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2Sa 22:43</a>) Jehovah speaks of himself as the one who “beat out the skies hard like a molten mirror.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004157/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 37:18</a>) The particles forming the atmosphere are indeed compressed under the pull of gravity, and their outer limits are within set boundaries, gravity preventing their escape from the earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004157/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ge 1:6-8</a>) They do reflect the sunlight in a manner comparable to a mirror. Because of this the sky looks bright, whereas without an atmosphere an observer on the earth would see only blackness in the sky, with the heavenly bodies glowing brilliantly on a black background, as is the case with the atmosphereless moon. Astronauts can observe the earth’s atmosphere from outer space as an illuminated, glowing halo.</p>

<strong>Do Science and the Bible Agree?</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">For instance, the Bible often uses poetic language that reflects the perceptions of people living thousands of years ago. When the book of Job speaks of Jehovah beating or forging the skies “hard like a molten mirror,” it well describes the skies as a metal mirror that gives off a bright reflection.

(See <em>Harper’s Bible Dictionary,</em> page 194; the Catholic translation called <em>The Jerusalem Bible,</em> footnote to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011420/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 1:6</a>; the Spanish Catholic translation <em>Nácar—Colunga,</em> page 11 of Seventh Edition.) Commenting on this attitude, <em>The International Standard Bible Encyclopaedia</em> (Vol. I, pp. 314, 315) states: “But this assumption is in reality based more upon the ideas prevalent in Europe during the Dark Ages than upon any actual statements in the O[ld] T[estament].”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">While it is true that the root word (<em>ra·qaʽʹ</em>), from which <em>ra·qiʹaʽ</em> is drawn, is regularly used in the sense of “beating out” something solid, whether by hand, or foot, or by any instrument (compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011420/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Exodus 39:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011420/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Ezekiel 6:11</a>), in some cases it is not sound reasoning to rule out a figurative use of the word. Thus at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011420/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 37:18</a> Elihu asks concerning God: “With him can you beat out [<em>tar·qiʹaʽ</em>] the skies hard like a molten mirror?” That the literal beating out of some solid celestial vault is not meant can be seen from the fact that the word “skies” here comes from a word (<em>shaʹhhaq</em>), meaning “film of dust” or “clouds” (compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011420/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 18:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011420/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Isaiah 40:15</a>), and, in view of the nebulous quality of that which is ‘beaten out,’ it is clear that the Bible writer is only <em>figuratively</em> comparing the skies to a metal mirror whose burnished face gives off a bright reflection.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011420/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Daniel 12:3</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">So, too, with the “expanse” produced on the second creative “day”, no solid substance is described as being beaten out but, rather, the creation of an open space or division between the waters covering the earth and other waters above the earth. It thus describes the formation of the atmospheric expanse surrounding the earth, and indicates that at one time there was no clear division or open space but that the entire globe was previously enveloped in water vapor. This also accords with scientific reasoning on the early stages of the planet’s formation and the view that at one time all earth’s water existed in the form of atmospheric vapor, due to the extreme heat of the earth’s surface at that point.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">That the Hebrew writers of the Bible did not conceive of the sky as originally formed of burnished metal is evident from the warning given through Moses to Israel that, in the event of their disobedience to God, “Your skies that are over your head must also <em>become</em> copper, and the earth that is beneath you iron,” thus metaphorically describing the effects of intense heat and severe drought upon the skies and land of Palestine.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011420/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Deut. 28:23, 24</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Similarly, it is obvious that the ancient Hebrews held no pagan concept as to the existence of literal “windows” in the arch of the sky through which earth’s rain descended. Very accurately and scientifically the writer of Job quotes Elihu in describing the process by which rain clouds are formed when he states, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011420/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 36:27, 28</a>: “For he draws up the drops of water; they filter as rain for his mist, so that the clouds [<em>sh<sup>e</sup>hha·qimʹ</em>] trickle, they drip upon mankind abundantly.” Likewise, the expression “floodgates [<em>ʼarub·bothʹ</em>] of the heavens” clearly manifests a figurative expression.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011420/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Genesis 7:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011420/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 2 Kings 7:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011420/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011420/9/3" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> Malachi 3:10</a>; see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011420/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011420/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Isaiah 5:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011420/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 45:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011420/10/3" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> Jeremiah 10:13</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">In Ezekiel’s vision of heavenly arrangements he describes “the likeness of an expanse like the sparkle of awesome ice” over the heads of the four living creatures.

(<em>The World Book Encyclopedia,</em> Vol. 1 [1966], pp. 153, 154) Air pressure at sea level runs about fifteen pounds per square inch (about 1.1 kilograms per square centimeter). It also exercises resistance so that most meteors hitting the immense jacket of air surrounding the earth are burned up by the friction created by the atmosphere. Thus the force implied in the Hebrew word <em>ra·qiʹaʽ</em> is certainly not out of harmony with the known facts.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">In the Psalms the “expanse,” along with the “heavens,” is said to tell of God’s works and praise.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011420/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 19:1</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"></p>

It was probably not until the first century C.E. that mirrors of glass were introduced. Since the ancient mirrors were generally made of molten metal, they had to be highly polished so as to have good reflecting surfaces. Pounded pumice stone might be used for this purpose, it being applied periodically thereafter with a sponge that usually hung from the mirror itself. Nevertheless, ancient metal mirrors did not have as fine a reflecting surface as do today’s glass mirrors. That is why the apostle Paul could write: “At Present we see in hazy outline by means of a metal mirror.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013007/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:12</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Most of the ancient mirrors discovered in Palestine date from after the Babylonian exile and down to Roman times.

<strong>Behemoth and Leviathan—Creative Marvels</strong><br/><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">God’s description of the very sea in turmoil need not limit his words to the oceangoing crocodile, since the Hebrew word <em>yam</em> may refer not only to a sea or a large body of water but sometimes to a large river. But the seagoing crocodile is the <span id="page94" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="94" data-before-text="94"></span>terror of warm seas, the giant of the family and the great traveler of the family. It makes vast excursions from one shore to another, and large ones are often seen from ships when out of sight of land. From the seagoing crocodile’s nonchalant motions, it appears that it is in no danger of tiring or ultimately drowning. On the other hand, sometimes this sea monster goes far inland as a river rover, lying in wait to devour some unwary animal.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">Because of its size, armor and offensive weapons at both ends, the crocodile is king of reptiles. The dangerous cobra? Just a tasty snack, an appetizer for the crocodile. It has no natural enemies in the wild state and knows no terror. After this description of leviathan, Job says to Jehovah:</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="si">“I have come to know that you are able to do all things, and there is no idea that is unattainable for you. ‘Who is this that is obscuring counsel without knowledge?’ Therefore I talked, but I was not understanding things too wonderful for me, which I do not know.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963087/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 42:2, 3</a>.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">Job declares God can do all things; he realizes now that whatever God does is wise, loving and just. He repeats the very question Jehovah had asked at the beginning of the series of questions about creative marvels; Job does this to admit the justice of the rebuke implied by it and to admit, ‘I was the man!’</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">Job had said some things he should not have uttered; but now he confesses he had argued his case without understanding. “I make a retraction,” he said, “and I do repent in dust and ashes.” As Job did, we should take this lesson to heart. Lest we find ourselves contending against God, we should think hard before we let the outward appearance of our circumstances induce us to believe or declare that God is directly responsible for our sufferings. Behold behemoth and leviathan! They and other creative marvels should impress us with God’s great wisdom and power, adding force to the inspired words: “As for the Almighty, we have not found him out; he is exalted in power, and justice and abundance of righteousness he will not belittle. Therefore let men fear him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963087/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 42:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963087/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 37:23, 24</a>.</p>
