When Eliphaz the Temanite first posed them to Job, Eliphaz no doubt believed that the answer was no. His associate, Bildad the Shuhite, even argued that a righteous standing before God is not possible for humans.​—<strong>Read</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017367/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Job 25:4</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></span> These false comforters claimed that our efforts to serve Jehovah loyally are of no benefit to him at all, that our value to God is no more than that of a moth, a maggot, or a worm. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017367/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 4:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017367/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 25:6</a>) At first glance, we might conclude that Eliphaz and Bildad displayed a humble attitude. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017367/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 22:29</a>) After all, from the top of a high mountain or from the window of an airplane, human activity may seem insignificant. However, is that how Jehovah views our contribution to the Kingdom work as he looks at our planet from his lofty perspective? <span id="page29" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>Jehovah made his feelings known when he reproved Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar for speaking falsehood but took delight in Job, referring to him as “my servant.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017367/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 42:7, 8</a>) Thus, a person can indeed “be of use to God.”</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204407/472/0">9/15/2005, p. 27</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Resist Wrong Thinking!</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><span id="page27" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span><strong>“Can an Able-Bodied Man Be of Use to God?”</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Closely related to the idea that God is too exacting is the view that he regards humans as useless. Eliphaz’ third speech contains the question: “Can an able-bodied man be of use to God himself, that anyone having insight should be of use toward him?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005687/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 22:2</a>) Eliphaz was implying that man is useless to God. In a similar vein, Bildad argued: “How can mortal man be in the right before God, or how can one born of a woman be clean?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005687/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 25:4</a>) According to that line of reasoning, how could Job, a mere mortal, ever presume to have a righteous standing before God?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Some people today are plagued with negative feelings about themselves. Such factors as family upbringing, exposure to the pressures of life, or being victims of racial or ethnic hatred may have contributed to this. But Satan and his demons also take delight in crushing a person. If they can influence an individual to feel that nothing he does is good enough for Almighty God, he is more vulnerable to despondency. In time, such a person could drift away, even draw away, from the living God.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005687/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Hebrews 2:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005687/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 3:12</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Advancing age and health problems put limitations on us. The share we have in Kingdom service may seem quite small in comparison with what we did when we were younger, healthier, and stronger. How important it is to recognize that Satan and his demons want us to feel that what we do is not good enough for God! We must resist such thinking.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204407/473/0">2/15/1995, pp. 27-28</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>A Lesson in How to Handle Problems</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">His three companions further disheartened Job by voicing personal ideas rather than godly wisdom. Eliphaz went so far as to say that ‘God has no faith in his servants’ and that it did not really matter to Jehovah whether Job was righteous or not. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995126/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 4:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995126/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 22:2, 3</a>) It is hard to imagine a more discouraging​—or more untruthful—​remark than that! Not surprisingly, Jehovah later rebuked Eliphaz and his companions for this blasphemy. “You men have not <span id="page28" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>spoken concerning me what is truthful,” he said. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995126/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 42:7</a>) But the most damaging assertion was yet to come.</p>

<strong>Championing Jehovah’s Godship in Spite of Babylonish Hostility</strong><br/><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[69]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Following another Babylonish practice of hiding the personal name of the Deity, the three false comforters do not use the divine name, <em>Jehovah,</em> once in any of their many speeches, whereas Job uses <span id="page527" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="527" data-before-text="527"></span>the name <em>Jehovah</em> five times. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Job 1:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/52/1" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> 12:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/52/2" data-bid="53-3" class="b"> 28:28</a>) In the account of Abraham their forefather the name <em>Jehovah</em> is used some seventy times from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Genesis chapters 12 to 24</a> inclusive. Then, too, Job is the only one to devotedly refer to Jehovah as the “Holy One.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Job 6:10</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="ss"><strong>A SPIRITISTIC EXPERIENCE</strong></p><p id="p70" data-pid="70" class="qu">19.

Such spirits or demons were unable to materialize like the faithful angels did in communicating with Abraham. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Gen. 18:1-8</a>) This meant that the demons had to resort indirectly to divination and oracles. “In inspirational or natural divination the agent is professedly under the immediate influence of some spirit or god who enables the diviner to see the future and to utter oracles embodying what he sees. . . . It can be proved that among the ancient Babylonians and Egyptians the view prevailed that not only oracles but also omens of all kinds are given to men by the gods and express the minds of these gods.”<a id="footnotesource13" data-fnid="13" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966643/12">a</a> Note that in Eliphaz’s first speech he appeals to one of his Babylonish-like, spiritistic experiences to support his argument. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Job 4:15-17</a>) Never did Abraham or Job have such demonistic experiences to deny the Godship of Jehovah who guided them directly.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="ss"><strong>MAN, THE MORTAL—RESURRECTION HOPE</strong></p><p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="qu">20.

He understood man to be a living soul. He rejected the Babylonish view that man has an immortal soul. Job believed that man is mortal and, when man dies, he is dead. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Job 7:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/57/1" data-bid="58-2" class="b"> 17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/57/2" data-bid="58-3" class="b"> 9:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/57/3" data-bid="58-4" class="b"> 10:4, 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/57/4" data-bid="58-5" class="b"> 13:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/57/5" data-bid="58-6" class="b"> 14:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/57/6" data-bid="58-7" class="b"> 28:13</a>) Job further shows that upon death man has expired.

<strong>[<em>w05</em> 9/15 27 ¶1-3]</strong> <br/><strong>Resist Wrong Thinking!</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Closely related to the idea that God is too exacting is the view that he regards humans as useless. Eliphaz’ third speech contains the question: “Can an able-bodied man be of use to God himself, that anyone having insight should be of use toward him?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005687/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 22:2</a>) Eliphaz was implying that man is useless to God. In a similar vein, Bildad argued: “How can mortal man be in the right before God, or how can one born of a woman be clean?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005687/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 25:4</a>) According to that line of reasoning, how could Job, a mere mortal, ever presume to have a righteous standing before God?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Some people today are plagued with negative feelings about themselves. Such factors as family upbringing, exposure to the pressures of life, or being victims of racial or ethnic hatred may have contributed to this. But Satan and his demons also take delight in crushing a person. If they can influence an individual to feel that nothing he does is good enough for Almighty God, he is more vulnerable to despondency. In time, such a person could drift away, even draw away, from the living God.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005687/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Hebrews 2:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005687/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 3:12</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Advancing age and health problems put limitations on us. The share we have in Kingdom service may seem quite small in comparison with what we did when we were younger, healthier, and stronger. How important it is to recognize that Satan and his demons want us to feel that what we do is not good enough for God! We must resist such thinking.</p>


<strong><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="so">Eliphaz charged that God does not care if we are righteous (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/202023413/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 22:3</a>; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/202023413/1/0"><em>w95</em> 2/15 27 ¶6</a>)</p></strong>

<strong>[<em>w95</em> 2/15 27 ¶6]</strong> <br/><strong>A Lesson in How to Handle Problems</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">His three companions further disheartened Job by voicing personal ideas rather than godly wisdom. Eliphaz went so far as to say that ‘God has no faith in his servants’ and that it did not really matter to Jehovah whether Job was righteous or not. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995126/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 4:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995126/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 22:2, 3</a>) It is hard to imagine a more discouraging​—or more untruthful—​remark than that! Not surprisingly, Jehovah later rebuked Eliphaz and his companions for this blasphemy. “You men have not <span id="page28" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>spoken concerning me what is truthful,” he said.

In fact, speaking of mankind in general, Satan said to Jehovah: “Everything that a man [not just Job but anyone] has he will give in behalf of his soul.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003283/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Job 2:4</a>) Do you see your role in this vital issue? As indicated at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003283/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Proverbs 27:11</a>, Jehovah is saying that there is something you can give to him​—a basis for him to make a reply to his taunter, Satan. Imagine​—the Universal Sovereign is calling upon you to share in addressing the greatest issue of all time. What an awesome responsibility and privilege is yours! Can you fulfill what Jehovah is asking of you? Job did. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003283/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Job 2:9, 10</a>) So did Jesus as well as countless others throughout history, including many youths. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003283/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Philippians 2:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003283/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Revelation 6:9</a>) You can do the same. Make no mistake about it, though, there is no neutral ground in this matter. By your course of action, you will <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>show that you support either Satan’s taunt or Jehovah’s reply. Which will you choose to uphold?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>Jehovah Cares for You!</strong></p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">11, 12. Does it make a difference to Jehovah whether you choose to serve him or not? Explain.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Does it really matter to Jehovah which choice you make? Have not enough people already remained faithful for him to give an adequate reply to Satan? True, the Devil asserted that no one serves Jehovah out of love, a charge that has already been proved false. Still, Jehovah wants you to take his side on the issue of sovereignty because he cares about you as an individual. Jesus said: “It is not a desirable thing with my Father who is in heaven for one of these little ones to perish.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003283/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matthew 18:14</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Clearly, Jehovah is interested in the course you choose. More than that, he is affected by it. The Bible makes clear that Jehovah has deep feelings that are stirred by the good or the bad actions of humans. For example, when the Israelites repeatedly rebelled, Jehovah was “pained.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003283/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Psalm 78:40, 41</a>) Before the Deluge of Noah’s day, when “the badness of man was abundant,” Jehovah “felt hurt at his heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003283/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Genesis 6:5, 6</a>) Think about what this means. If you adopted a wrong course, you could cause your Creator to feel pain. This does not mean that God is weak or is ruled by emotion. Rather, he loves you and cares about your welfare. On the other hand, when you do what is right, Jehovah’s heart rejoices. He is happy not only because he has a further reply to give to Satan but also because he can now become your Rewarder. And that is something he wants to become. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003283/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:6</a>) What a loving Father you have in Jehovah God!</p>

<strong>Resist Wrong Thinking!</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In all three speeches, Eliphaz presented the idea that God is so exacting that nothing his servants do is good enough for him. “Look! In his servants he has no faith,” Eliphaz told Job, “and his angels he charges with faultiness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005687/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 4:18</a>, footnote) Eliphaz later said of God: “In his holy ones he has no faith, and the heavens themselves are actually not clean in his eyes.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005687/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 15:15</a>) And he asked: “Does the Almighty have any delight in that you are righteous?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005687/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 22:3</a>) Bildad was in agreement with this viewpoint, for he stated: “There is even the moon, and it is not bright; and the stars themselves have not proved clean in [God’s] eyes.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005687/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 25:5</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">We must be on guard against being influenced by such thinking. It can lead us to feel that God requires too much of us. This view attacks our very relationship with Jehovah. Moreover, if we succumb to this type of reasoning, how would we respond when we are given needed discipline? Rather than humbly accepting the correction, our heart may become “enraged against Jehovah himself,” and we may harbor resentment toward him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005687/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Proverbs 19:3</a>) How spiritually disastrous that would be!</p>

Their “Judge” Rutherford was in jail when their founder “Pastor” Charles Taze Russell died in 1916,’ and that he was sent there because of sedition and obstructing the draft. However, everyone knows that the United States did not have any sedition or draft act in 1916.

<strong>Have the Endurance of Job Today</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">But did Job get discouraged and quit? Did he follow his wife’s counsel, “Curse God and die”? No, he did not. He endured. And not only did he endure these things, but he held on to his integrity in spite of eight speeches made by those supposed friends of his who turned out to be his enemies, hypocrites in fact. “A true companion is loving all the time, and is a brother that is born for when there is distress.” But these three turned on Job with questions such as this: “Is not your own badness too much already, and will there <span id="page420" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="420" data-before-text="420"></span>be no end to your errors?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 2:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Prov. 17:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Job 22:5</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The record goes on to show that Jehovah God rewarded Job for his endurance, even as James notes, and, though having lived some thirty-five centuries ago, Job stands as a good example for all lovers of righteousness today; especially when these find themselves beset with similar hardship. Loss of one’s material possessions, of loved ones, of health and of friends are still the common lot of man.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 42:10-17</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">What will enable you to endure these evils without becoming resentful, bitter or discouraged? Faith in God and in his promises. Job had such faith. In spite of all his suffering he “did not sin or ascribe anything improper to God.” He kept trusting God ‘even though God would slay him.’ Faith will enable you to endure, to continue “steadfast as seeing the One who is invisible.” Besides, has not God promised that in his due time, which is now very near, all suffering, all sorrow, pain and death will end? Having faith in such promises of God will give you hope, and hope will help you to endure.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 1:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 13:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Heb. 11:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/5/3" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> Rev. 21:4</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Prayer is another great aid to endurance. Job’s words show that his attitude was one of prayer; he pleaded with God, presenting his case to him. So, should adversity come your way, you may pray to have what is needful. Is it illness you have to endure? You may pray for wisdom to cope with your affliction and strength to endure it. Is your hardship persecution? Here also you may pray, not only for strength to endure, but for your persecutors, even as Jesus commanded: “Pray for those persecuting you,” and as he himself did when saying: “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 5:44;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Luke 23:34</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Another aid to your enduring is a knowledge and understanding of God’s purposes. Job did not know why God permitted him to suffer, but we today, by reason of having the account of Job and God’s light upon it, know why God permits the righteous to suffer, namely, to prove to the Devil as well as to all creation that he can have creatures that will remain faithful to him come what may. Job kept integrity without knowing about this reason. Certainly knowledge of it should help all lovers of righteousness to endure.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 1:7-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2:2-8</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">And, above all, love will help you to endure. Love for God will help you to put up with what he permits, not rebelling or even complaining about it. Love will cause you to trust God as Job trusted him, always obeying him, for “this is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments.” And love for your neighbor will also help you to endure, to put up with him, be that neighbor a member of your own family, a member of your congregation or a fellow worker at your place of employment. If you truly love your neighbor you will also want to be setting him a good example by enduring and helping him to endure. “Love is long-suffering and kind. . . . It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 John 5:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 13:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 7</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Yes, among the many things that will aid you to endure are faith, prayer, knowledge and understanding, and love. Endurance is the course of wisdom. There is peace, comfort and an inner joy from knowing that you are enduring, bearing up under adversity because it is the right thing to do. Such endurance assures you of future reward: “He that has endured to the end is the one that will be saved.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 24:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962520/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Rom. 5:3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"></p>

Evidently good things were not coming to Job. From the height of prosperity he had been plummeted into the depths of abject poverty. He had lost his vast properties, had been bereaved of his ten beautiful children, and had then fallen victim to a loathsome disease that covered him with ulcers from head to foot. His despairing wife had foolishly told him to curse God and die. Hearing of his unparalleled calamity, three acquaintances of Job, one of whom was this Eliphaz from the south, came to comfort him. After seven days of silent scrutiny of Job and then hearing him call down evil upon the day of his birth, the three would-be comforters proceeded to attack Job’s integrity toward God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969802/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 1:1 to 4:1</a>) It was during the course of the argument that followed that Eliphaz said to Job: “Acquaint yourself, please, with him, and keep peace; thereby good things will come to you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969802/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 22:21</a>, <em>NW; AT; AS.</em></p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu"> 2.

This twentieth-century world fails to recognize that men cannot have peace among themselves and enjoy prosperity until, first, they get acquainted with God and become familiar with his will and come into peaceful relationship with him in his way. But how can men of earth get acquainted with a God who is an invisible spirit Being? As one college student recently said: “How can I experience God?” This at a time when student unrest has spread around the earth.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu"> 3. (a) How can we acquaint ourselves with God?

It tells us of ancient men, Enoch and Noah, who were said to walk with God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969802/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 5:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969802/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 6:9</a>) Do you know that this God brought a whole nation into acquaintanceship with him, and that individual men of this nation had miraculous visions in which they saw God? Do you know that men of this nation ate and <span id="page650" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="650" data-before-text="650"></span>drank with God on earth? The writer of the book of Job and of the first five books of the Holy Bible tells us of a divine contract with this nation of which he was the mediator between God and man. This man was the prophet Moses. This contract or covenant was made at a mountain in the Sinai Peninsula, which is part of Arabia. It was in the spring of the year 1513 B.C.E., and God had brought the people of Moses there after having delivered them out of Egypt, by which he made his name Jehovah known to them as their forefathers had never appreciated it.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969802/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex. 6:3</a>.</p>

For Jesus says concerning persons who <span id="page25" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>saw the “pangs of distress” start in 1914 C.E.: “This generation will by no means pass away until all these things occur.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101975041/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matthew 24:34</a>) Included in “all these things” is the destruction of the corrupted society of today, as Jesus had just described it: “Then there will be great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning until now, no, nor will occur again. In fact, unless those days were cut short, no flesh would be saved; but on account of the chosen ones those days will be cut short.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101975041/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matthew 24:21, 22</a>) If the “great tribulation” were not cut short, mankind would, of itself, perish off the earth! But, happily, all those who love God may escape with their lives. “Jehovah is guarding all those loving him, but all the wicked ones he will annihilate.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101975041/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Psalm 145:20</a>) If you heed the Bible prophecy, you, too, can escape and keep on living.</p>

<strong>A Lesson in Man’s Littleness</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Those words should cause us to reflect: Was it any man who gave orders for the succession of night and day? The morning light is represented as laying hold of the ends of the earth and shaking the wicked out of it, as dust from a cloth.

But did Job or any man command all these beneficial and welcome changes? Does it depend on man’s care and management? Could any man supply the want of light if the sun’s beams should be withheld? Further, the vast ocean covers immense treasures and wonderful works of the Creator. Had Job walked about in the watery deep and taken inventory of its contents?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>SNOW AND HAIL</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Jehovah propounds more questions: “Where, now, is the way to where light resides? As for darkness, where, now, is its place, that you should take it to its boundary and that you should understand the roadways to its house? Have you come to know because at that time you were being born, and because in number your days are many? Have you entered into the storehouses of the snow, or do you see even the storehouses of the hail, which I have kept back for the time of distress, for the day of fight and war?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 38:19-23</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Has any man ever escorted either light or darkness back to its home or entered into the storehouses of snow and hail that God has kept back for “the time of distress”? Snow itself is a marvel—crystals in an endless variety of beautiful forms! With snow and hail God can fight as effectually, if he pleases, as with lightning or with the sword of an angel. Snow and hail will evidently be used against God’s enemies on “the day of fight and war,” the time of Armageddon. What man can escape hail from heaven if God directs it? “Hailstones” are mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezekiel 38:22</a> in reference to the means God will use to destroy the wicked hordes of humans under satanic leadership. At the battle of Gibeon in ancient times Jehovah used hailstones against his enemies: “There were more who died from the hailstones than those whom the sons of Israel killed with the sword.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Josh. 10:11</a>) A description of a hailstorm gives us an idea of what God can do on “the day of fight and war.” In his <em>Autobiography</em> (Book II, 50) the Italian sculptor Benvenuto Cellini related this experience:</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">“We were one day distant from Lyons . . . when the heavens began to thunder with sharp rattling claps. . . . After the thunder the heavens made a noise so great and horrible that I thought the last day had come; so I reined in for a moment, while a shower of hail began to fall without a drop of water. At first the hail was somewhat larger than pellets from a popgun, and when these struck me, they hurt considerably. Little by little it increased in size, until the stones might be compared to balls from a crossbow. My horse became restive with fright; so I wheeled round, and returned at a gallop to where I found my comrades taking refuge in a fir-wood. The hail now grew to the size of big lemons. . . . There fell a stone so huge that it smashed the thick branches of the pine under which I had retired for safety. Another of the hailstones hit my horse upon the head, and almost stunned him; one struck me also, but not directly, else it would have killed me. . . .</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">“The storm raged for some while, but at last it stopped; and we, who were pounded black and blue, scrambled as well as we could upon our horses. Pursuing the way to our lodging for the night, we showed our scratches and <span id="page168" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="168" data-before-text="168"></span>bruises to each other; but about a mile farther on we came upon a scene of devastation which surpassed what we had suffered, and defies description. All the trees were stripped of their leaves and shattered; the beasts in the field lay dead; many of the herdsmen had also been killed; we observed large quantities of hailstones which could not have been grasped with two hands.”—<em>Harvard Classics,</em> Vol. 31, pp. 352, 353.</p>

Had Job walked about in the watery deep and taken inventory of its contents?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>SNOW AND HAIL</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Jehovah propounds more questions: “Where, now, is the way to where light resides? As for darkness, where, now, is its place, that you should take it to its boundary and that you should understand the roadways to its house? Have you come to know because at that time you were being born, and because in number your days are many? Have you entered into the storehouses of the snow, or do you see even the storehouses of the hail, which I have kept back for the time of distress, for the day of fight and war?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 38:19-23</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Has any man ever escorted either light or darkness back to its home or entered into the storehouses of snow and hail that God has kept back for “the time of distress”? Snow itself is a marvel—crystals in an endless variety of beautiful forms! With snow and hail God can fight as effectually, if he pleases, as with lightning or with the sword of an angel. Snow and hail will evidently be used against God’s enemies on “the day of fight and war,” the time of Armageddon. What man can escape hail from heaven if God directs it? “Hailstones” are mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezekiel 38:22</a> in reference to the means God will use to destroy the wicked hordes of humans under satanic leadership. At the battle of Gibeon in ancient times Jehovah used hailstones against his enemies: “There were more who died from the hailstones than those whom the sons of Israel killed with the sword.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962201/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Josh. 10:11</a>) A description of a hailstorm gives us an idea of what God can do on “the day of fight and war.” In his <em>Autobiography</em> (Book II, 50) the Italian sculptor Benvenuto Cellini related this experience:</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">“We were one day distant from Lyons . . . when the heavens began to thunder with sharp rattling claps. . . . After the thunder the heavens made a noise so great and horrible that I thought the last day had come; so I reined in for a moment, while a shower of hail began to fall without a drop of water. At first the hail was somewhat larger than pellets from a popgun, and when these struck me, they hurt considerably. Little by little it increased in size, until the stones might be compared to balls from a crossbow. My horse became restive with fright; so I wheeled round, and returned at a gallop to where I found my comrades taking refuge in a fir-wood. The hail now grew to the size of big lemons. . . . There fell a stone so huge that it smashed the thick branches of the pine under which I had retired for safety. Another of the hailstones hit my horse upon the head, and almost stunned him; one struck me also, but not directly, else it would have killed me. . . .</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">“The storm raged for some while, but at last it stopped; and we, who were pounded black and blue, scrambled as well as we could upon our horses. Pursuing the way to our lodging for the night, we showed our scratches and <span id="page168" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="168" data-before-text="168"></span>bruises to each other; but about a mile farther on we came upon a scene of devastation which surpassed what we had suffered, and defies description. All the trees were stripped of their leaves and shattered; the beasts in the field lay dead; many of the herdsmen had also been killed; we observed large quantities of hailstones which could not have been grasped with two hands.”—<em>Harvard Classics,</em> Vol. 31, pp. 352, 353.</p>

For not always will the poor one be forgotten, nor will the hope of the meek ones ever perish. Do arise, O Jehovah! Let not mortal man prove superior in strength. Let the nations be judged before your face. Do put fear into them, O Jehovah, that the nations may know that they are but mortal men.”</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">13.

No; even though their carcasses may have been buried along with human corpses or though images of animals may have been put in the sepulchers of believers in the immortality of animal souls as well as of human souls.
