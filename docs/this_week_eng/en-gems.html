<strong>Separated to Be Joyful Praisers Worldwide</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“Praise Jah, you people!

(b) What question is it appropriate to ask?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>JEHOVAH GOD is the Grand Creator of heaven and earth, our Universal Sovereign for all eternity. He is fully worthy of our enthusiastic praise. This is why <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997485/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 113:1-3</a> commands us: “Praise Jah, you people! Offer praise, O you servants of Jehovah, praise the name of Jehovah. May Jehovah’s name become blessed from now on and to time indefinite. From the rising of the sun until its setting Jehovah’s name is to be praised.”</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> As God’s Witnesses, we rejoice to do this. How thrilling it is that Jehovah God will soon cause this joyful song of praise that we are singing today to fill the whole earth! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997485/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 22:27</a>) Is your voice being heard in this great worldwide choir?

(b) In what ways are we set apart?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> Our praising Jehovah unitedly surely makes us distinctive, unique. We speak and teach in agreement and use the same methods to declare ‘the abundance of Jehovah’s goodness.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997485/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 145:7</a>) Yes, as Jehovah’s dedicated people, we are set apart for the service of our God, Jehovah. God told his ancient dedicated people, Israel, to keep separate from the nations around them and be unsullied by the practices of those nations. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997485/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Exodus 34:12-16</a>) He gave his people laws to help them do this. Likewise today, Jehovah has given us his Holy Word, the Bible. Its instruction shows us how we can keep separate from this world. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997485/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 6:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997485/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 2 Timothy 3:16, 17</a>) We are not set apart by isolation in monasteries and convents, as are the monks and nuns of Babylon the Great. Following Jesus Christ’s example, we are <em>public</em> praisers of Jehovah.</p>

It opens with the command: “Praise Jah, you people! Offer praise, O you servants of Jehovah, praise the name of Jehovah.

How is Jehovah being praised ‘from sunrise to sunset’?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> The song of praise will go forth until Jehovah causes it to fill the earth. “From the rising of the sun until its setting Jehovah’s name is to be praised.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992843/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 113:3</a>) This means more than daily worship by some earthly creatures. The sun rises in the east and sets in the west, covering all the earth. Everywhere the sun shines, Jehovah’s name will soon be praised by all people freed from bondage to false religion and Satan’s organization. In fact, this song that will never end is now sung by anointed Witnesses of Jehovah and those who will be earthly children of his King, Jesus Christ. What a privilege they have as singers of Jehovah’s praises!</p>

Not to heathendom whose people worship millions of gods of their own making, and who, for the most part, never even heard of the great name of the true God Jehovah. The “godless” Communists who dominate a great portion of the earth’s surface bitterly hate and fight against the name of Jehovah and are against his Word of truth, the Holy Bible. The same is true of millions of Moslems throughout the earth. Well, what about Christendom with her nearly 920,000,000 members? Alas! Christendom is a dominant part of the United Nations and as such is very much a part of “the present wicked system of things” of which Satan the Devil is god. She therefore constitutes herself “an enemy of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gal. 1:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 4:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Jas. 4:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> Eph. 2:2</a>) Furthermore, like Judaism, Christendom deliberately tries to hide Jehovah’s holy name from the people by never mentioning it in her pulpits and by removing it from her popular translations of the Bible. As a result there are millions of people in <span id="page336" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="336" data-before-text="336"></span>Christendom who have never heard of the holy name <em>Jehovah.</em></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 5.

More than thirty years ago they were given a name that was based on Jehovah’s Word, namely, <em>Jehovah’s witnesses.</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isa. 43:10</a>) These are, not Jews according to the flesh, but, rather, spiritual Judeans (meaning, ‘praisers of Jehovah’), spiritual Israelites composed of many nationalities who have been brought out of captivity to Babylon the Great.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rom. 2:28, 29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 9:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Eph. 2:11-18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/6/3" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> Heb. 8:7-13</a>.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 7.

Simon Peter related how God “for the first time turned his attention to the [non-Jewish] nations to take out of them <em>a people for his name.</em> And with this the words of the Prophets agree, just as it is written, ‘After these things I shall return and rebuild the booth of David that is fallen down . . . in order that those who remain of the men may earnestly seek Jehovah, together with people of all the nations, <em>people who are called by my name,</em> says Jehovah.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 15:14-17</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>THE PRIVILEGES OF THE PRAISERS</strong></p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 9.

<strong>Sundial</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the Scriptures there is no direct reference to sundials. The Hebrew word <em>ma·ʽalahʹ,</em> translated “dial” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014161/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Kings 20:11 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014161/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Isaiah 38:8</a>, in the <em>Authorized Version,</em> literally means “steps” (<em>NW</em>) or “degrees,” as is indicated in the <em>Authorized Version</em> marginal readings on these verses. This word is also <span id="page1560" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1560" data-before-text="1560"></span>used in the superscriptions of the fifteen ‘Songs of the Ascents,’ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014161/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalms 120-134</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In the scriptures mentioned, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014161/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Kings 20:8-11 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014161/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Isaiah 38:4-8</a>, the account is related of the portent God gave sick King Hezekiah in answer to Isaiah’s prayer. It consisted of causing a shadow that had gradually fallen to reverse its direction and go back up ten steps. This could refer to the steps or degrees of a dial for measuring time, and it is not impossible that Hezekiah’s father possessed such a sundial, even obtaining it from Babylon. However, the Jewish historian Josephus in discussing the account speaks of these steps of Ahaz as being “in his house,” apparently indicating that they formed part of a stairway. There may have been a column placed alongside the stairs to receive the sun’s rays and cause a shadow to extend gradually along the steps and serve as a measurement of time.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The miracle performed evidently involved the relationship between earth and sun, and, if so, it was therefore similar to the miracle recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014161/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Joshua 10:12-14</a>.

<strong>Humility</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><strong>A Quality of God.</strong> Jehovah God himself includes humility among his qualities. This is not because there is any inferiority on his part or any submission to others. Rather, he shows humility in exercising mercy and great compassion upon lowly sinners. That he deals with sinners at all and has provided his Son as a sacrifice for mankind’s sins is an expression of his humility. Jehovah God has permitted evil for some 6,000 years and let mankind be brought forth, even though their father Adam had sinned. Through undeserved kindness, mercy was thereby shown to Adam’s offspring, giving them opportunity for everlasting life. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002102/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ro 8:20, 21</a>) All of this displays, along with other fine qualities of God, his humility.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">King David saw and appreciated this quality in God’s undeserved kindness to him. After Jehovah had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, he sang: “You will give me your shield of salvation, and it is your humility that makes me great.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002102/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2Sa 22:36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002102/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Ps 18:35</a>) Though in his great dignity he sits in his exalted place in the highest heavens, it can nevertheless be said of Jehovah: “Who is like Jehovah our God, him who is making his dwelling on high? He is condescending to look on heaven and earth, raising up the lowly one from the very dust; he exalts the poor one from the ashpit itself, to make him sit with nobles, with the nobles of his people.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002102/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps 113:5-8</a>.</p>

<strong>A God of Matchless Humility</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">INFERIOR to none and in submission to no one, Jehovah God is indeed the Supreme Sovereign.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976241/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 40:13</a>) He is the supreme standard of all that is good, just and loving. His power is unchallengeable. The position he occupies is unaffected by what any creature may do or fail to do.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">There is nothing that we imperfect humans can give to Jehovah God that would profit him. The young man Elihu reminded Job: “If you sin, what injury do you do to God? Even if your offenses are many, how do you hurt him? If you are righteous, what do you give him, or what does he receive from your hand? Your wickedness can affect only a man like yourself; and your justice only a fellow human being.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976241/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 35:6-8</a>, <em>The New American Bible.</em></p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Despite the fact that sinful humans cannot affect his position, Jehovah God, in his great humility, is willing to deal with them. The inspired psalmist wrote: “Who is like Jehovah our God, him who is making his dwelling on high? He is condescending to look on heaven and earth, raising up the lowly one from the very dust; he exalts the poor one from the ashpit itself, to make him sit with nobles.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976241/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 113:5-8</a>.</p>

<strong>Humility</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><strong>A Quality of God.</strong> Jehovah God himself includes humility among his qualities. This is not because there is any inferiority on his part or any submission to others. Rather, he shows humility in exercising mercy and great compassion upon lowly sinners. That he deals with sinners at all and has provided his Son as a sacrifice for mankind’s sins is an expression of his humility. Jehovah God has permitted evil for some 6,000 years and let mankind be brought forth, even though their father Adam had sinned. Through undeserved kindness, mercy was thereby shown to Adam’s offspring, giving them opportunity for everlasting life. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002102/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ro 8:20, 21</a>) All of this displays, along with other fine qualities of God, his humility.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">King David saw and appreciated this quality in God’s undeserved kindness to him. After Jehovah had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, he sang: “You will give me your shield of salvation, and it is your humility that makes me great.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002102/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2Sa 22:36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002102/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Ps 18:35</a>) Though in his great dignity he sits in his exalted place in the highest heavens, it can nevertheless be said of Jehovah: “Who is like Jehovah our God, him who is making his dwelling on high? He is condescending to look on heaven and earth, raising up the lowly one from the very dust; he exalts the poor one from the ashpit itself, to make him sit with nobles, with the nobles of his people.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002102/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps 113:5-8</a>.</p>

<strong>A Lesson About Pride and Humility</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Yes, David was determined to keep on serving Jehovah with humility. This attitude helps us to understand why Jehovah called David “a man agreeable to my heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006448/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 13:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006448/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Samuel 13:14</a>) In fact, David was following the finest example of humility​—that of Jehovah God himself. Interestingly, the expression David used when he said to Michal, “I will become low” is from a Hebrew root verb that is also used to describe God’s own view of mankind. Although Jehovah is the greatest Personage in the universe, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006448/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 113:6, 7</a> describes him as “condescending [coming down from one’s rank or dignity in dealing with an inferior] to look on heaven and earth, raising up the lowly one from the very dust; he exalts the poor one from the ashpit itself.”</p>

<strong>Cultivate Genuine Humility</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> No one else in the universe has humbled himself to the same extent as the Sovereign Lord in order to help sinful humans. The psalmist could write: “Jehovah has become high above all the nations; his glory is above the heavens. Who is like Jehovah our God, him who is making his dwelling on high? He is condescending to look on heaven and earth, raising up the lowly one from the very dust; he exalts the poor one from the ashpit itself.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005766/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 113:4-7</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Note the word “condescending.” When referring to humans, that word can have a bad connotation, ‘to assume an air of superiority to one inferior or less fortunate.’ Such a haughty attitude could never describe Jehovah God, who is pure and holy and thus devoid of “haughtiness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005766/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Mark 7:22, 23</a>) But “condescend” can also carry the sense of coming down to the level of one socially lower or descending from one’s rank or dignity in dealings with an inferior. Thus, some Bibles render <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005766/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 113:6</a> as saying that God humbles himself.

<strong>What Jehovah’s Humility Means for Us</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When the Scriptures speak of Jehovah as being humble, they do not mean that he is limited in any way or that he is subject to others. Instead, this beautiful quality indicates that he has deep compassion for humans who sincerely strive to gain his approval and extends mercy to them. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004806/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 113:6, 7</a>, we read: “[Jehovah] is condescending to look on heaven and earth, raising up the lowly one from the very dust.” His “condescending” means that “he bends down to see” or that “he is humbling Himself to look.” (<em>Today’s English Version; Young’s Literal Translation of the Holy Bible</em>) So from the heavens Jehovah himself ‘bent down,’ or ‘humbled himself,’ in order to pay attention to David, an imperfect but humble man who desired to serve God. Therefore, David reassures us: “Jehovah is high, and yet the humble one he sees.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004806/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 138:6</a>) The merciful, patient, and compassionate way in which Jehovah dealt with David should encourage all who seek to do God’s will.</p>

<strong>A God of Matchless Humility</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Despite the fact that sinful humans cannot affect his position, Jehovah God, in his great humility, is willing to deal with them.

<strong>“Wisdom Is with the Modest Ones”</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The Hebrew word here rendered “modest” is also found at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962326/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Micah 6:8</a>, where it usually is translated “humbly.” But says the Soncino Bible of the expression “walk humbly”: “One is reluctant to question a phrase which has sunk so deeply into the religious consciousness of mankind; yet it is doubtful whether <em>humbly</em> is an adequate translation of the Hebrew. In the Bible the root <em>tsana</em> is found only here and in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962326/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Prov. xi. 2</a> (elsewhere <em>anaw</em> is used to express humility). The lexicon turns to Rabbinic Hebrew for elucidation of its meaning, and there the word signifies ‘modesty,’ . . . ” But is it “modesty” in the sense of decency or chastity, as the Rabbinic Hebrew <span id="page282" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="282" data-before-text="282"></span>goes on to say? No, for the context of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962326/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Micah 6:8</a> makes it very evident that here, as at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962326/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 11:2</a>, what is stressed is not modesty in the sense of chasteness and propriety, but modesty in the sense of an awareness of one’s limitations, of one’s relationship with his Maker. And so correctly, and perhaps uniquely, the <em>New World Translation</em> reads: “He has told you, O earthling man, what is good. And what is Jehovah asking back from you but to exercise justice and to love kindness and to be modest in walking with your God?”</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>MODESTY AND HUMILITY</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Modesty and humility are closely related, but they are not the same. The opposite of humility is pride; the opposite of modesty is presuming too much, vanity and conceit. “Humility” comes from the root <em>humus,</em> meaning earth, and has the thought of lowliness. “Modesty” comes from the root <em>modestus,</em> meaning moderate.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Modesty may be said to be an aspect of humility, which is the more basic quality. A humble person who has good sense, who is wise, who uses a sound mind, will also be modest. A humble person will not resent suggestions or criticism, but a modest person is more likely to ask, Wherein can I improve? Have you anything to offer?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Since modesty means being aware of one’s limitations, it is a quality of persons who are finite. All creatures have their limitations, and therefore modesty is becoming to them. But the Creator, being infinite, has no limitations, and so nowhere do we read in his Word of his being modest, but we do read of his humility: “Your own humility will make me great.” “Who is like Jehovah our God, him who is making his dwelling on high? He is condescending to look on heaven and earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962326/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 18:35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962326/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 113:5, 6</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Does this mean that God is immodest? Not at all. It merely means that modesty is a virtue that has no application to him.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Modesty being an aspect of humility that involves sound thinking, we find it implicit in Paul’s counsel to the Romans: “I tell everyone there among you not to think more of himself than it is necessary to think; but to think so as to have a sound mind.” Yes, just as it is necessary to love ourselves and yet not to love ourselves too much, it is necessary for us to think something of ourselves but not too much.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962326/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rom. 12:3</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Helping us to appreciate the distinction between modesty and humility is the Scriptural record which shows that, while God’s faithful servants were ever humble, at times they erred as to being modest. For one thing, they may have erred because of not being aware of their weaknesses. The apostle Peter was certainly a humble man, yet he repeatedly thought to improve on what his perfect Master said and did. His lack of modesty he especially betrayed when he said: “Even if all the others are stumbled, yet I will not be.” He was humble, but erred as to modesty, because he was not aware of his own limitations.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962326/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Mark 14:29</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">At times great pressure may cause a humble servant of God to err in this respect. Moses, though the meekest man in all the earth, on one occasion, when sorely tried, presumed too much: “Hear, now, you rebels! Is it from this crag that we shall bring out water for you?” God took this error on Moses’ part seriously: “Because you did not . . . sanctify me before the eyes of the sons of Israel,” but immodestly took the credit to yourself, “you will not bring this congregation into” the Promised Land.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962326/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Num. 20:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962326/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 12</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>GOD FAVORS MODEST ONES</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Why is it said that “wisdom is with the modest ones”? First of all, because Jehovah God can best use those who are modest, <span id="page283" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="283" data-before-text="283"></span>who are not self-confident, who are aware of their own limitations.

Then where is their humility?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Even a retiring person with strong feelings of inferiority may not be humble, though he may seem to be so to those about him. His lowly feelings may be due to fear of what others may think.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">But why endeavor to be humble when it does not come easy, when so few persons are truly humble? Because of what God’s Word, the Bible, has to say about it: “God opposes the haughty ones, but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones.” Can we afford to be opposed by God? “We are not stronger than he is, are we?” Do we not need his favor, his undeserved kindness? We certainly do!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962920/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962920/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 10:22</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Since cultivating humility is to our interest, what will help us to be humble? Love. Yes, humility goes with love, so much so, in fact, that humility might be said to be love’s complement.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">No one less than the Creator, Jehovah God himself, demonstrates this principle for us. His Word tells us, “God is love.” Does that mean that God is also humble? It most certainly does. Compared with Him, men are as but grasshoppers and entire nations as but the fine dust on a pair of balances or as a drop of water that falls from a bucket. Being so highly exalted, so far above this earth and its inhabitants, it takes humility on God’s part just to notice earth and man: “Who is like Jehovah our God, him who is making his dwelling on high? He is condescending [humbleth himself, AS] to look on heaven and earth, raising up the lowly one from the very dust.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962920/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 John 4:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962920/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Ps. 113:5-7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962920/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Isa. 40:15-23</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">What humility God showed in his dealings with the nation of Israel! How they tried him time and again by their rebellion, their blasphemies and their idolatries! Yet he kept pleading with them for their own good. It takes humility to plead, especially when you are able to resort to force and when what you are doing is solely for the other’s good. Yes, God pleaded with them: “I take delight, not in the death of the wicked one, but in that someone wicked turns back from his way and actually keeps living. Turn back, turn back from your bad ways, for why is it <span id="page740" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="740" data-before-text="740"></span>that you should die, O house of Israel?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962920/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezek. 33:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962920/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 36:15, 16</a>.</p>

But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad you must not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will positively die.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974726/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gen. 2:15-17</a>) Surely that man had no reason or excuse to forget to whom he belonged, when his very life depended on his obedience to his Creator and Owner. In a similar vein, when God gave all living creatures into Noah’s hand, we immediately read of the strict prohibition regarding the eating of blood and the shedding of man’s blood. Again this emphasizes who was the ultimate Owner of life as represented in the blood of all living creatures. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974726/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Gen. 9:3-6</a>) Turning to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974726/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 8</a>, we observe that, rather than any suggestion of the ownership of the earth being handed over to man, the entire theme reflects to the credit and praise of the One who possesses and controls all things: “O Jehovah our Lord [Master, Owner], how majestic your name is in all the earth!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974726/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps 8 Vss. 1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974726/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 9</a>) We observe a similar theme when we look at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974726/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 115</a>. Notice especially the opening words: “To us belongs nothing, O Jehovah, to us belongs nothing, but to your name give glory according to your loving-kindness, according to your trueness.” This stresses that Jehovah is not only the Owner in fact, but a good and worthy Owner. There could be none better.</p>

(a) Why is it here stated that Christianity is on the increase? (b) Where should the credit for such increase be given, and why?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[18]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>FALSE, imitation Christianity is a curse to mankind. True, genuine Christianity is a blessing to men of good will. Is true Christianity on the increase at this time? Yes, it is. This is a well-considered answer, based on events that are actually taking place, and it is true in spite of the fact that now is the most materialistic time of man’s history. Who is accomplishing the increase in true Christianity? The One accomplishing it, the One to whom all credit is given, is the true God himself, Jehovah. In some sectors of the earth orthodox church evangelism is prominent from time to time, but such “evangelism” has nothing to do with the God-given increase of true Christianity. It is true that in some sectors church membership and church attendance have increased; but that such increase is no part of the present expansion of true Christianity is demonstrated by the fact that in those same sectors devilish materialism also increases, and is accompanied by increasing crime, lawlessness and violation of every righteous commandment and principle of Christianity. So for the advance of the cause of clean worship, pure religion, true Christianity, no man and no organization of men can properly claim credit; but, on the contrary, “To us belongs nothing, O Jehovah, to us belongs nothing, but to your name give glory according to your loving-kindness, according to your trueness.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958088/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 115:1</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="qu"> 2.

Jehovah is accomplishing his purposes to the glory of his name and according to his own loving-kindness, and with such we must be in accord if we are to share in the blessings of Christianity’s increase now. The increase is also ‘according to his trueness.’ The truth of God’s Word, the Bible, is the precious gathering instrument, which he is using to bring about his increase earth-wide.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958088/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 115:1</a>, <em>margin.</em></p>

<strong>“This Is Our God”</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Almighty God is still interested in mankind, and recognizes those who worship <span id="page228" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="228" data-before-text="228"></span>him as his children. Therefore, it is only proper that a person should respond to this interest and seek to learn about God. Only if one does can he pray with meaning and understanding the way Jesus instructed in the famous model prayer: “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified. Let your kingdom come.” It is because we are grateful to know our Father’s identity that we humbly address him as did his prophet long ago: <em>“O Jehovah, you, are our Father.</em> We are the clay, and you are our Potter; and all of us are the work of your hand.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 6:9, 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Isa. 64:8</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Yes, God’s name is Jehovah, and we are glad to use his name, for we are proud of our Father. We desire, as did the Bible psalmist, “that people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.” This great God of ours is not a mystery whom it is impossible for us to understand. He is the same God to whom Jesus raised his eyes, looking heavenward, and made his petition: “Father, . . . glorify your son.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 83:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> John 17:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 6</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">On another occasion Jesus described his Father in these clear, simple terms: “Jehovah our God is one Jehovah.” So God is not an unexplainable trinity, consisting of several persons in one divine essence. He is Jesus’ God, the one whom Jesus worships. He is also our God and Father. We, too, can love and worship him, and, if we do, he will show mercy toward us. So in heartfelt appreciation we say: “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our tribulation.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Mark 12:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 1:3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>NOT A MAN OR AN IDOL</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">This Father of ours is not a man, nor was he ever a man on earth who was later deified. “I am God and not man,” he says. Jesus explained that “God is a Spirit.” Unlike men, God does not have a body of flesh and blood, but he is an invisible Personage.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Hos. 11:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> John 4:24</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Since he is a Spirit, Jehovah is not, at the same time, a lifeless image of wood or stone. “Our God is in the heavens,” the Bible psalmist explains. On the other hand, the gods of the nations “are silver and gold, the work of the hands of earthling man.” The psalmist then argues convincingly that these idols are utterly worthless, saying: “A mouth they have, but they cannot speak; eyes they have, but they cannot see; ears they have, but they cannot hear. A nose they have, but they cannot smell. Hands are theirs, but they cannot feel. Feet are theirs, but they cannot walk; they utter no sound with their throat. Those making them will become just like them.” How foolish to put one’s trust in such lifeless images!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 115:3-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Isa. 44:14-20</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">A prophet of God once showed the worthlessness of idols by comparing their powers with those of Jehovah. He asked: “Do there exist among the vain idols of the nations any that can pour down rain, or can even the heavens themselves give copious showers? Are you not the One, O Jehovah our God? And we hope in you, for you yourself have done all these things.” Yes, it is our God Jehovah who is able to act and accomplish things. He is the one who deserves your praise.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Jer. 14:22</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">So why not respond? “Shout in triumph to God, all you people of the earth. Make melody to the glory of his name. Render his praise glorious. Say to God: ‘How fear-inspiring your works are! . . . ’ Bless our God, O you peoples, and cause the voice of praise to him to be heard.” We welcome you to join in praising our God Jehovah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 66:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 8</a>.</p>

<strong>Worship That Leads to the Kingdom of God</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">This Holy Book, the Bible, clearly describes the type of worship that is pleasing to Almighty God. By rendering this worship <span id="page246" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="246" data-before-text="246"></span>you will come in line for the everlasting blessings that God provides by means of his kingdom. For a limited number of 144,000, these blessings will be enjoyed in heaven as rulers with Jesus Christ, while for the vast majority of obedient mankind they will be enjoyed as subjects of that heavenly kingdom on an earth restored to paradise conditions.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rev. 14:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Ps. 37:29,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 34</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">But in order to be led to this kingdom of God you must first of all recognize who the true God is. His own Book, the Bible, informs us: “You, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.” “God is a Spirit, and those worshiping him must worship with spirit and truth.” “I am Jehovah. That is my name; and to no one else shall I give my own glory, neither my praise to graven images.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 83:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> John 4:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Isa. 42:8</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Yes, the name of the true God, the Most High One over all the earth, is JEHOVAH. This great God Jehovah is no lifeless image, but is a mighty invisible Spirit Person, and he does not approve of images even as visual aids in our worship. Therefore, to worship him acceptably you must not bow before unintelligent images of wood, stone or metal, but, rather, you must live your life in harmony with the truth set forth in His Word, the Bible.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ex. 20:4, 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Lev. 26:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Isa. 44:14-20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/8/3" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> 46:5-7</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">If you will stop to reason on the matter, you will see how valueless material images are. Observe that they are powerless to walk about or give instruction. Take a supposedly holy image, throw it into a river or into a blazing fire. Is it able to swim about like a man, or does it leap out of the flames to save itself from being consumed? If this image cannot protect itself, how will it protect you when trouble arises?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Look at those images made by the hands of men. How lifeless they are! Note what the living God, Jehovah, says about them: “A mouth they have, but they cannot speak; eyes they have, but they cannot see; ears they have, but they cannot hear.

<strong>Worship That Leads to the Kingdom of God</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">This Holy Book, the Bible, clearly describes the type of worship that is pleasing to Almighty God. By rendering this worship <span id="page246" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="246" data-before-text="246"></span>you will come in line for the everlasting blessings that God provides by means of his kingdom. For a limited number of 144,000, these blessings will be enjoyed in heaven as rulers with Jesus Christ, while for the vast majority of obedient mankind they will be enjoyed as subjects of that heavenly kingdom on an earth restored to paradise conditions.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rev. 14:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Ps. 37:29,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 34</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">But in order to be led to this kingdom of God you must first of all recognize who the true God is. His own Book, the Bible, informs us: “You, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.” “God is a Spirit, and those worshiping him must worship with spirit and truth.” “I am Jehovah. That is my name; and to no one else shall I give my own glory, neither my praise to graven images.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 83:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> John 4:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Isa. 42:8</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Yes, the name of the true God, the Most High One over all the earth, is JEHOVAH. This great God Jehovah is no lifeless image, but is a mighty invisible Spirit Person, and he does not approve of images even as visual aids in our worship. Therefore, to worship him acceptably you must not bow before unintelligent images of wood, stone or metal, but, rather, you must live your life in harmony with the truth set forth in His Word, the Bible.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ex. 20:4, 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Lev. 26:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Isa. 44:14-20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/8/3" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> 46:5-7</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">If you will stop to reason on the matter, you will see how valueless material images are. Observe that they are powerless to walk about or give instruction. Take a supposedly holy image, throw it into a river or into a blazing fire. Is it able to swim about like a man, or does it leap out of the flames to save itself from being consumed? If this image cannot protect itself, how will it protect you when trouble arises?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Look at those images made by the hands of men. How lifeless they are! Note what the living God, Jehovah, says about them: “A mouth they have, but they cannot speak; eyes they have, but they cannot see; ears they have, but they cannot hear. A nose they have, but they cannot smell. Hands are theirs, but they cannot feel. Feet are theirs, but they cannot walk; they utter no sound with their throat.” Therefore, how possibly could they be the true God? They cannot be, and, for that reason, God says: “Those making them will become just like them, all those who are trusting in them.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 115:4-8</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>WHAT TRUE WORSHIP INCLUDES</strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Rather than including adoration to images, worship that leads to the kingdom of God must recognize Jesus the Messiah, the one Jehovah God sent to earth to open the way for us to gain eternal life and the one designated by God as king of his kingdom. The authoritative Bible says: “There is no salvation in anyone else, for there is not another name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must get saved.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 4:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Matt. 20:28</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Worship that leads to the kingdom of God not only includes recognizing the true God Jehovah and accepting his Son Jesus Christ, but also involves practicing right works. Just possessing the Word of God is not enough. You must live by what it says. The nation of Israel provides an example. They had the inspired Scriptures, but when the promised Messiah came in the person of Jesus, that nation’s religious leaders persecuted him and finally had him killed. Because of their failing to bring forth the fruits of righteousness, Jesus said to them: “This is why I say to you, The kingdom of God will be taken from you and be given to a nation producing its fruits.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964284/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 21:42, 43</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Take notice of why the worship of those Jews did not lead to the kingdom of God. It was because they did not produce the righteous fruits qualifying them to live in <span id="page247" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="247" data-before-text="247"></span>God’s kingdom. Yes, in order to gain the blessings of that Kingdom rule one must practice right works.</p>

<strong>The Hour of Test Is On!</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Finally, in a prophecy now being fulfilled, preceding the “great and fear-inspiring day of Jehovah,” we read: “And it must occur that everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will get away safe; for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will prove to be the escaped ones, just as Jehovah has said, and in among the survivors, whom Jehovah is calling.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970686/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Joel 2:31, 32</a>) What a fine, reassuring provision! But where will you find this Mount Zion and Jerusalem to which you can escape? This question brings up the subject of housebuilding. The psalmist said: “Unless Jehovah himself builds the house, it <span id="page570" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="570" data-before-text="570"></span>is to no avail that its builders have worked hard on it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970686/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ps. 127:1</a>) The converse of that is true. If Jehovah does build the house, acknowledging it as his, then those who work under the direction of the great Master Builder can be assured of certain success. Where and what is Jehovah’s house? Besides referring to a literal dwelling place, the word “house” is often used with regard to a family, or even a nation, such as the “house of Aaron” and the “house of Israel.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970686/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ps. 115:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970686/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> Lev. 10:6</a>) As a nation, Israel proved unfaithful, resulting in Jesus’ saying to them concerning their temple at Jerusalem: “Look! Your house is abandoned to you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970686/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Matt. 23:38</a>) However, Jesus had already commenced preparing for a different kind of house or temple, a spiritual house. During his ministry, he began to gather and prepare the building materials, that is, his disciples, who, at Pentecost of 33 C.E., were openly recognized by God as his spiritual house, or temple, “built up upon the foundation of the apostles and [Christian] prophets, while Christ Jesus himself is the foundation cornerstone.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970686/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Eph. 2:20-22</a>.

<strong>Fruitful Ministers Led by Active Force</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> As should be expected under the blessing of the God Jehovah, the increase that he brings is not merely in numbers. There is indeed an increase in numbers that is most gratifying, as has been previously referred to, but there is also an increase in activity on the part of the Christian congregation of the New World society, with improved effectiveness. But that is not all. Of equal importance is the third element of increase, which is that of maturity. All these increases are essential for each one of us, that is, the increase of numbers, in activity and in maturity. Especially concerning the latter, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958090/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Peter 1:13-16</a> states: “Hence brace up your minds for activity, keep completely balanced and set your hope upon the undeserved kindness that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. As obedient children, quit being fashioned according to the desires you formerly had in your ignorance, but, in accord with the holy one who called you, do you also become holy yourselves in all your conduct, because it is written: ‘You must be holy, because I am holy.’” This enjoins upon true Christians individual <span id="page90" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="90" data-before-text="90"></span>progress in spiritual maturity through the study of God’s Word, obedience to it, and application in the individual’s life of the principles contained in the Bible. That makes for a real Christian.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">17. In what way does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958090/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Psalm 115:14-18</a> show the nature of the organization to which persons of good will are gathered and the location of the gathering work?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> This should be expected in view of the fact that it is Jehovah who brings the increase, because he would not bring persons of good will and of honest heart to a corrupt and unclean worldly religion, belief, practice or organization. That he does bring an increase right here upon the earth is shown by the further verses of the psalm of praise: “Jehovah will give increase to you, to you and to your sons. You are the ones blessed by Jehovah, the Maker of heaven and earth. As regards the heavens, to Jehovah the heavens belong, but the earth he has given to the sons of men. The dead themselves do not praise Jah, nor do any going down into silence. But we ourselves will bless Jah from now on and to time indefinite. Praise Jah, you people!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958090/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 115:14-18</a>) It is to his New World society on earth now that Jehovah through Christ Jesus gathers persons of honest heart who love righteousness from every origin of men all over the earth; and he does so by means of their proclamation of the message of his Word, the Bible.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong>INCREASE IS ON JEHOVAH’S TERMS</strong></p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">18. (a) On what terms does one become a Christian? (b) To continue as such, what is necessary?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> From the foregoing scriptures it is seen that the response to the truth of the Bible by individuals results in their becoming worshipers of Jehovah God, and thus it is that the truth is the instrumentality of gathering and of increase. This really means that the increase is on the terms that Jehovah has set out in his Word. That is to say, in order for a person to become a Christian, to become an associate with the New World society and to come in line for Jehovah’s blessings of everlasting life in his new world of righteousness, it is necessary that the individual meet Jehovah’s terms, obey his commandments. Jehovah does not change his requirements or modify, weaken or lessen them to induce people to love and serve him. Orthodox religion does all manner of ungodly things to appeal to the masses, but not so Jehovah God, and not so his Word, the Bible. In view of the fact that it is our response to the truth or our conformity to the Bible that enables us to be Jehovah’s witnesses, or to be in the New World society in the first instance, it follows unquestionably that to continue and progress in this joyful, happy, blessed relationship to Jehovah God we must continue to obey his Word. This we must do respecting all the issues of life. We continue to serve Jehovah on his terms, not on ours.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">19. What test demonstrates our conformance to Jehovah’s terms for his worship?</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> There are any number of illustrations of this fact that are really obvious and that show how practical the Bible is in the lives of modern-day Christians. We might list issues that arise constantly in the lives of people who are not Christians and also in the lives of people who are Christians and who, being dedicated to serve and obey Jehovah God, are obligated to conform to his Word. When such issues arise, how do you decide them? Do you have the assistance in making your decision that a knowledge of God’s Word on the subject gives?</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">20. Comment on the various issues of life here listed.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> The ordinary issues of life arise daily, some of them every day with some people, and they must be met. For instance, there is the issue of honesty. What do you do when you have to determine whether you will be honest or dishonest? Issues of conduct and of morality arise all the time. <span id="page91" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="91" data-before-text="91"></span>Morality includes sexual morality, and it includes more. There are all manner of standards of morality; but there is only one proper standard, and that is the Bible’s requirement. How do you decide issues of morality? And of conduct? Then there are such issues as those involving stealing, lying, killing. Everybody is confronted with them at one time or another. True worship itself is a paramount issue. There is an issue involving blood and its ingestion. Issues of divorce, the raising of children, politics. Christians have issues of their ministry of preaching; dedication presents an issue to everyone as to whether or not the individual is going to devote himself or herself to Jehovah God in dedication. Without exception every individual on earth has to answer this question or face this issue.</p>

In further explanation of his purpose respecting our earth the Bible says, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961282/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 115:15, 16</a>: “You are the ones blessed by Jehovah, the Maker of heaven and earth. As regards the heavens, to Jehovah the heavens belong, but the earth he has given to the sons of men.”</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 7. What purpose of God was to be fulfilled by the perfect man and woman, and from whom do nations of different color today trace their descent?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> The earth was to be inhabited by one family, Adam’s or man’s family. All the nations of today, no matter of what color, are the descendants of the original man Adam through Noah. Correctly the Christian apostle Paul said: “The God that made the world and all the things in it, being, as this One is, Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in handmade temples, neither is he attended to by human hands as if he needed anything, because he himself gives to all persons life and breath and all things. And he made out of one man every nation of men, to dwell upon the entire surface of the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961282/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 17:24-26</a>) God said to the first man and woman: “Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth and subdue it, and have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and every living creature that is creeping upon the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961282/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Gen. 1:28</a>) This purpose of God was to be fulfilled by the perfect man and wife, beginning from the paradise garden of Eden.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 8. Are the expanding nations today working in harmony with God’s purpose for this earth, and how will his execution of judgment not defeat his own purpose?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Has this divine purpose yet been fulfilled? The nations of today think there has been a population explosion lately and that the earth is about filled with people almost to being uncomfortable. But just when the nations get the earth quite filled with people, they are pursuing a course calculated to wipe out the whole human race and empty the earth. Shortly there will be a tremendous reduction of earth’s population—when God executes judgment on the nations in this their judgment day, because this world or system of things must be destroyed; but God will not wipe out the whole human race altogether. God will save flesh that is not of this world, by shortening the days of the great tribulation.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 9. Why is God’s execution of judgment not to be against those of the “flesh” that will be saved?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> The flesh saved will be that of those like Noah, those who, like Noah, walk with God amid this world in which the badness of man is great, every inclination of man’s heart being bad all the time.

These are the ones taking part in the fulfillment of Christ’s prophecy: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations.” That kingdom is not of this doomed world. Jesus Christ said: “My kingdom is no part of this world.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961282/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">John 18:36</a>) Hence God’s judgment of destruction is not against the preachers of his New World kingdom.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">10.

<strong>Why Are We Here?</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The Bible states regarding God’s purpose: “As regards the heavens, to Jehovah the heavens belong, but the earth he has given to the sons of men.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102009443/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 115:16</a>) It would seem that the only adequate place in this universe for mankind to live is on the earth, which Jehovah made for this very purpose.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/1642/0">9/8/1992, pp. 13-14</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Space Exploration—What Does the Future Hold?</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>Will Man Ever Reach the Planets?</strong></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The famous American <em>Star Trek</em> films have whetted the appetite of millions for space travel. What are the future prospects for manned exploration of other planets? There are two perspectives to be taken into account​—the human and the divine. After all, the Bible says that Jehovah is “the Maker of heaven and earth. As regards the heavens, to Jehovah the heavens belong, but the earth he has given to the sons of men.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101992643/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 115:15, 16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101992643/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Genesis 1:1</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"><span id="page14" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>We have already seen that many scientists are optimistic about mankind’s ability to reach Mars and settle on it. Human curiosity and a yearning for knowledge will no doubt continue to impel men and women to expand the frontiers of discovery. One of the purposes of the Hubble Space Telescope, according to a NASA fact sheet, is to “search for other worlds, other galaxies and the very origins of the universe itself.” NASA also states: “The outlook for space activities in the 21st century is exciting and challenging. We can envision such important achievements as industries operating in orbit, Moon bases, and manned expeditions to Mars. Now that the space frontier has been crossed, there is no turning back.”</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">What can be said from a Biblical viewpoint? True, man was told by God to ‘multiply and fill the earth.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101992643/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 1:28</a>) At the same time, he was given intelligence and an insatiable desire to know more about his context, including the biosphere, the stratosphere, and beyond. That context includes our tiny solar system and the stars beyond. Thus, King David was inspired to write some three thousand years ago: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man that you keep him in mind, and the son of earthling man that you take care of him?”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101992643/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 8:3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">The Hubble telescope recently transmitted an image of the giant galaxy M87. It was described as a blob of light that consists of two trillion stars! Can you imagine that figure? How far away is M87? Fifty-​two million light-​years from earth​—“relatively close on the intergalactic distance scale!” Let’s face it, man and the earth are so infinitesimal compared to the unimaginable vastness of universal space! What Jehovah is doing and will do in all that endless space is beyond our present comprehension. Regardless of man’s ambitions for outer space, an issue has been raised on our planet that must first be settled by God’s intervention.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101992643/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Revelation 16:14-16</a>.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="ss"><strong>Issue to Be Settled</strong></p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">The issue is the choice between rule by God and rule by Satan. That is why Jehovah’s Witnesses are proclaiming worldwide that God must soon take action to cleanse the earth of wickedness, corruption, murder, violence, and war.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101992643/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mark 13:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101992643/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 2 Corinthians 4:4</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">Astronauts who have peered down upon our earth from hundreds of miles out in space have marveled at the beauty of this planetary jewel. Viewed from high up, the earth shows no political boundaries to divide and separate. It is just one beautiful, global home for the human family. Yet, here we have a world full of greed, envy, lies, exploitation, injustice, terror, fear, crime, and violence. What do mankind need to bring them to their senses?</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">The Bible shows that Jehovah God, earth’s Maker and Landlord, will soon take action against this planet’s unruly and unrulable tenants. Only the truly meek will be left to inherit the earth. Then only will we get to see what further purposes God has in mind for an obedient human family.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101992643/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 37:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101992643/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101992643/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Revelation 11:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101992643/7/3" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> 16:14-16</a>.</p>

<strong>Insight on the News</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>Life in Space?</strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn">● Scientists have long speculated that there may be millions of intelligent civilizations on other planets circling distant stars. Now some of them are not so certain. Back in 1966 Soviet astronomer Dr. Iosif S. Shklovsky coauthored a book entitled “Intelligent Life in the Universe.” But since then Dr. Shklovsky has apparently had second thoughts, and last year he wrote in a Soviet journal: “It looks as though our sun, that strange and solitary star surrounded by a family of planets, is most likely a rare exception in the stellar world.”</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">And more recently, the New York “Times” reported on a computer analysis of hypothetical stars and planets conducted by astronomer Michael H. Hart. “His conclusion is that, far from being common, civilized life must be exceedingly rare and the one we have on earth may even be unique,” observes the “Times.” Hart also pointed out that if our own earth were even 5 percent closer to the sun or 1 percent farther from it, temperature extremes hostile to life could develop. Additionally, Hart believes that the fact that no sign of extraterrestrial life has ever been discovered is significant.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">In the Bible, the Creator indicates that, at least now, the earth may be unique as a planet hosting living creatures. His Word says: “As regards the heavens, to Jehovah the heavens belong, but the earth he has given to the sons of men.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979646/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 115:16</a>.</p>

And it is given to us free! What more convincing evidence could we want as testimony to the existence of a Maker who is not only powerful and wise but also kind and generous? He has, in effect, said to all, ‘Help yourself,’ letting “his sun rise upon <em>wicked people and good</em> and [making] it rain upon <em>righteous people and unrighteous.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101977052/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 5:45</a>) Really, if it were not for man’s mismanagement and misuse of the earth’s potential and resources, people in all lands could find real pleasure in living on this beautiful planet.</p>

<strong>Settling the Issue of Ownership</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> The question arises, however, as to whether man received a considerable degree of ownership when he was created and given the commission: “Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth and subdue it, and have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and every living creature that is moving upon the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974726/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Gen. 1:28</a>) From this it might be argued that this was so. Did not man’s being created in God’s image include the ability to exercise ownership? Other scriptures might come to mind giving support to this. After the flood, regarding “every living creature,” God said to Noah: “Into your hand they are now given.” Then, too, we recall David’s words when he said to Jehovah: “You make him [mortal man] dominate over the works of your hands; everything you have put under his feet.” Again, the psalmist’s well-known expression will come to mind: “As regards the heavens, to Jehovah the heavens belong, but the earth he has given to the sons of men.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974726/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Gen. 9:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974726/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Ps. 8:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974726/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 115:16</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 6.

<strong>Man—Made for the Earth</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Chemical study of man’s body reveals that all its elements can be found in the soil around us. This is in harmony with the Bible’s statement that man was made “out of dust from the ground.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972360/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 2:7</a>) Interestingly, the Bible tells us that the first man was called Adam, a name that can be translated “earthling man.” God charged man with caring for the earth. In fact, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972360/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 115:15, 16</a> shows that the earth was “given” to man as his home.</p>

Anyone who steps outside the boundaries of those laws stands in disaster’s way. Thus while the lives of the three astronauts in the crippled Apollo XIII hung in the balance, they and helpers on earth struggled desperately to keep the spaceship within the framework of the Creator’s laws, for a safe return to earth. Actually, their underlying problem lay in that, in the first place, they had moved outside the Great Lawgiver’s stated purpose: “As regards the heavens, to Jehovah the heavens belong, but the earth [not outer space] he has given to the sons of men.” Dedicated Christians respect God’s physical <em>and</em> moral laws.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971682/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 115:16</a>.</p>

In the twenty-fifth year of the exile of his prophet Ezekiel, he set out the boundaries of the territory that his chosen people were to occupy. This He did by means of His angel after he had inspired Ezekiel to prophesy concerning the downfall of the devilish Gog of Magog. This closing part of the vision given to Ezekiel evidently hints at how Jehovah through his Messiah Jesus will locate the members of redeemed humankind all over the earth in His new order. The whole earth, in a Paradise state, is the assigned home of mankind, just as it is written under divine inspiration in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971022/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 115:16</a>: “As regards the heavens, to Jehovah the heavens belong, but the earth he has given to the sons of men.” He will locate individuals on earth where He, as earth’s Creator and Owner, chooses to place them.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="qu"> 2.

South of the administrative strip of land were the land portions of the remaining five tribes, running parallelwise from east to west, namely, first Benjamin, then Simeon, Issachar, Zebulun, and Gad at the bottom.

God’s stated purpose concerning his creating of our earth calls for the survival and preservation of mankind, the human family. Listen to his purpose as he speaks to us through the Bible writer Isaiah: “This is what Jehovah has said, the Creator of <span id="page238" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="238" data-before-text="238"></span>the heavens, He The true God, the Former of the earth and the Maker of it, He the One who firmly established it, who did not create it simply for nothing, who formed it even to be inhabited.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961282/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isa. 45:18</a>) Like a vast housing project built in a twentieth-century city, our earth was formed by Jehovah God to be inhabited by human creatures. In further explanation of his purpose respecting our earth the Bible says, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961282/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 115:15, 16</a>: “You are the ones blessed by Jehovah, the Maker of heaven and earth.

All the nations of today, no matter of what color, are the descendants of the original man Adam through Noah. Correctly the Christian apostle Paul said: “The God that made the world and all the things in it, being, as this One is, Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in handmade temples, neither is he attended to by human hands as if he needed anything, because he himself gives to all persons life and breath and all things.

The nations of today think there has been a population explosion lately and that the earth is about filled with people almost to being uncomfortable. But just when the nations get the earth quite filled with people, they are pursuing a course calculated to wipe out the whole human race and empty the earth. Shortly there will be a tremendous reduction of earth’s population—when God executes judgment on the nations in this their judgment day, because this world or system of things must be destroyed; but God will not wipe out the whole human race altogether. God will save flesh that is not of this world, by shortening the days of the great tribulation.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 9.

These are the ones taking part in the fulfillment of Christ’s prophecy: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations.” That kingdom is not of this doomed world.

Jehovah is his name. Jehovah existed for unnumbered millions of years before the creation of the universe or any creature in it. At that time Jehovah was complete; he did not have a feeling of loneliness even though he was alone. It pleased Jehovah to begin to create, or to build a universe and to make many creatures to live in it. Everything Jehovah did in connection with the creation of the universe has proved to be beneficial to others. The earth is an outstanding example of how creation has benefited others. The earth was made with a view to having creatures live upon it under righteous conditions and in happiness and freedom. Man became the highest form of living, visible creation, and all the things that were created were made to have great variety and to be pleasing and beneficial to man. The earth was made to be a comfortable, happy home for man, and it is evident that the great Creator gave consideration and thought to what would be of benefit to man and make his living on the earth pleasant.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961402/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 1:28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961402/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Ps. 115:15, 16</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[18]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> Unquestionably, the motive behind all this thoughtfulness on the part of Jehovah was love. Jehovah is love, the great personification of it, and it was the exercise of his love that caused Jehovah to provide so many good things for the benefit and enjoyment of his creatures. The exercise of true love is always upbuilding and beneficial. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961402/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 8:1</a> the apostle Paul shows that love builds up. If mankind on the earth, represented by Adam and Eve at the beginning, had shown love for the Creator and built up a proper respect and worship for the Creator and in their love had shown obedience to the Creator, all mankind today would be enjoying to the full the many blessings and benefits of the building work that Jehovah did in making the earth and everything he has built upon it. But a tearing-down process began with the rebellion of Satan and the disobedience of the first man and woman. All the human race thus fell under condemnation because of the sin of Adam and Eve. Here Jehovah stepped in to express his love and proceed with a rebuilding campaign. Jehovah conceived a new system of things and purposed the building of a new world.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961402/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 3:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961402/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Heb. 11:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961402/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 39, 40;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961402/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 2 Pet. 3:13</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="qu"> 3. (a) What provision did Jehovah make for building a harmonious world? (b) What kind of spiritual building work has followed the death of Christ?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[19]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> A strong building has a solid foundation, and in his new building program Jehovah <span id="page330" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="330" data-before-text="330"></span>provided for a strong foundation stone, Christ Jesus. The unbounded love of Jehovah is shown in the offering of his most precious possession, his only-begotten Son, Christ Jesus, as a sacrifice for man’s sins. With the removal of disability through the ransom sacrifice of Christ Jesus mankind realized benefits by Jehovah’s building work, for upon the foundation of Christ Jesus Jehovah began to build up a spiritual house made of living stones and designed to carry on a particular work in Jehovah’s purpose. Thus since the death and resurrection of Christ Jesus a great building campaign has been going on. The apostle Paul refers to this in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961402/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 3:9</a>, saying: “You people are God’s field under cultivation, God’s building.” So Jehovah builds a spiritual organization on the foundation of Christ Jesus and uses dedicated Christian men on earth as his fellow workers.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961402/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 3:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961402/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 2:4-10</a>.</p>

But is this possible? Yes, and this is the good news that Christ declared. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973401/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) Therefore, the purpose in one’s life should be to get to know God and Christ that one may live eternally. For “the gift God gives” is, not just a life of limited years, but “everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973401/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Rom. 6:23</a>) It is he reaching out for this gift that makes the Christian life as one of Jehovah’s witnesses so exciting, so meaningful, so satisfying even now.</p>

<strong>Using Life to Serve Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Just as those lepers were cleansed of their loathsome disease, so many today <span id="page329" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="329" data-before-text="329"></span>have been putting themselves in a position to be cleansed from the effects of inherited sin by accepting the provision for life from Jehovah; yet some, like nine of the cleansed lepers, fail to carry out the opportunity of using their lives to praise God. Others may be content to try leading a morally upright and good life, letting their course of action be a silent witness to their faith. But how much better to show real appreciation, “glorifying God with a loud voice”! Certainly the dead cannot praise Jehovah; so now is the time for those appreciating the opportunity to use their strength and vigor to serve Jehovah, rather than waiting until their life<em>-</em>force wanes to consider their obligation to the Creator.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964402/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 115:17, 18</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>WHAT DOES GOD REQUIRE?</strong></p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 5.

Besides leading a life in accord with the commandments, there were many things Jehovah expected of them, including three trips to national religious festivals each year and offering sacrifices at prescribed times for the forgiveness of their sins. Each father also had the obligation, under God’s law, to give personal religious instruction to his children in the morning, at noon and at night.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 6.

It states: “In the apostolical church no abstract distinction of clergy and laity, as to privilege or sanctity, was known; all believers were called to the prophetic, priestly and kingly offices in Christ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964402/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Pet. v,3</a>). The Jewish antithesis of clergy and laity was at first unknown among Christians; and it was ‘only as men fell back from the evangelical to the Jewish point of view’ that the idea of the general Christian priesthood of all believers gave place, more or less completely, to that of the special priesthood or clergy . . . As the Roman hierarchy was developed, the clergy came to be not merely a distinct order . . . but also to be recognized as the only priesthood, and the essential means of communication between man and God.”</p>

That is like saying that when a person is dying of an incurable disease it does not matter what remedy he tries or what doctor he goes to, just as long as he does something. Even though he dies, they imply that the important thing is that he tried and that he had faith in his doctor. But what counts is, Did he recover? The same is true with religion. The important thing is not that you have some kind of faith, but, Will you gain life? <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961085/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Romans 10:2</a> says: “For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God; but not according to accurate knowledge.” Isaiah spoke strongly against false worship, referring to the false guides as sleeping dogs, “shepherds that cannot understand.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961085/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isa. 56:10, 11</a>, <em>AS</em>) In this time of the end they still do not sound the warning. They try to patch up the ills of the world by praying for political efforts like the United Nations instead of telling their flocks that God’s kingdom is the only hope. Instead of being asleep ourselves, let us be on the watch and give the warning. You can do as Paul said: “For if you publicly declare that ‘word in your mouth’, that Jesus is Lord, and exercise faith in your heart that God raised him up from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one exercises faith for righteousness, but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation . . . For ‘everyone that calls upon the name of Jehovah will be saved’.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961085/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Rom. 10:9, 10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961085/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 13</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>DEDICATION BRINGS RESPONSIBILITY</strong></p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">13.

We will take the same step that Jesus did in dedicating our lives to Jehovah God and become active in the ministry, making public declaration of the Word. This should not be an emotional decision, but one based on accurate knowledge. It should be because of our love for God and our desire to serve our Creator. When we dedicate our lives to Jehovah God we are making a vow to serve him for life; so dedication brings responsibility just as knowledge does. It is true that not everyone is able to respond to the same extent to the privilege of serving God. Some have family responsibilities, others are not in good health, age slows some, but everyone who enjoys the gift of life can do something. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961085/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 115:17, 18</a>) Having this in mind, Jesus gave the illustration of the talents. The master gave his belongings to his servants to care for during his absence: one was given five talents, one was given two and the third slave was given one talent. They used what was entrusted to them wisely, except the third slave, who buried his talent so as not to lose it. Because of his negligence it was taken away from him and given to one of those who used his wisely.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961085/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Matt. 25:14-30</a>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">14.

While the Kingdom talents or belongings of the Master have been committed to the spiritual remnant, all servants of God have the opportunity of using the knowledge and service prospects they receive wisely. What do you do with your talents? Are you burying them, or are you using them and thereby receiving the joy that comes with Jehovah’s blessing? Jesus summarized this by showing that the really happy ones are the alert ones, the active ones, those who keep awake to their responsibilities. “For to everyone that has, more will be given and he will have abundance; <span id="page87" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="87" data-before-text="87"></span>but as for him that does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961085/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Matt. 25:29</a>) So let us use, increase and treasure our privileges of Kingdom service.</p>

<strong>Faith in God Rewarded by Preservation</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">How can anyone have the faith to stand firm under such an attack from all earth’s armies, trusting in something one cannot see? To help those looking to him, Jehovah caused the psalmist to write his own experience as a strengthening encouragement. God’s preservation of those trusting in him is plainly brought to our attention. The writer could have been speaking representatively for his whole nation, because not just he himself, but also his people, Jehovah God’s chosen people, were at that time threatened with death, with an extermination. He said:</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">“I do love, because Jehovah hears my voice, my entreaties. For he has inclined his ear to me, and throughout my days I shall call. The ropes of death encircled me and the distressing circumstances of Sheol themselves found me. Distress and grief I kept finding. But upon the name of Jehovah I proceeded to call: ‘Ah, Jehovah, do provide my soul with escape!’ Jehovah is gracious and righteous; and our God is One showing mercy. Jehovah is guarding the inexperienced ones. I was impoverished, and he proceeded to save even me.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975365/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 116:1-6</a>.</p>

And yet death seemed a sure thing for him. It was already as if death had its ropes tied fast and unbreakable around him, preventing all moves for escape. It was as if he were already in Sheol (the common grave of mankind), feeling the distressing circumstances of being squeezed in by the narrow walls of a burial pit. He was grieved and distressed at having his life cut short. He was inexperienced in the ways of the world and could not appeal to human aid. He felt impoverished of all earthly help. But wait! His case was not hopeless. There was the God whom he and his nation worshiped. This One could guard him from death and Sheol. He is gracious, he is righteous, he shows mercy, he can provide escape, he can save. His is the name upon which to call for salvation. In appreciation of such a God as this, the endangered psalmist lifted his voice to Him. He entreated him. And, O joy! <span id="page401" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="401" data-before-text="401"></span>Jehovah did incline his ear. He did hear the desperate voice, the soulful entreaties.

How could the psalmist refrain from bursting out with the exclamation, “I do love.” Just that!</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 7. Why will Jehovah answer the call of the “chosen ones” and the “great crowd” as they face near death, and why will they cry out, “I do love!”?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> When finally in our generation the uproar of the foretold “war of the great day of God the Almighty” dies down and peaceful quiet settles down at the battlefield of Har–Magedon, the surviving remnant of “chosen ones” and the “great crowd” of fellow survivors will look back and appreciate just what a salvation God the Almighty has wrought in their behalf. It was a near-death experience for them. Whose name could they call upon with assurance of being heard when there seemed to be no other eventuality but violent death​—except the name of Jehovah? Not in vain did they do so. For this was not the time for him to let them fall in death, to let them descend into the narrow confines of Sheol. Let the threatening enemies go down into destruction, indeed​—but not His worshipers who called upon his name in spite of the taunts and jeers of the enemy. Miraculous divine escape was provided! The ones inexperienced in the wicked ways of the world, the ones who, like Jesus, were not part of this world, were guarded. The gracious, righteous, merciful Jehovah did save them! How could these saved ones but look to Jehovah and say: “I do love”?</p>

When Jehovah resurrected Jesus, therefore, He was “loosing the pangs of death.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1987206/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 2:24</a>.</p>

The writer of that psalm could have been speaking representatively for his whole nation, because not just he himself but also his people, Jehovah’s chosen people, were threatened with death, with an extermination.

<strong>Taking Delight in Suffering</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Beyond any doubt, Jesus was keenly aware of what was ahead of him. It gave him a foretaste of that vivid prophetic word at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972203/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 116:3</a>: “The ropes of death encircled me and the distressing circumstances of Sheol themselves found me. Distress and grief I kept finding.” If only it could be avoided! But, no, as he said: “This is why I have come to this hour.” He was in full agreement with the entire process, every part of it. His opening and closing words clearly prove this, mentioning first his own glorification, then leading to the final glorifying of his Father’s name. And what a strength and comfort it must have been to hear immediately and audibly his Father’s confirmation on this, the main issue: “I both glorified it [my name] and will glorify it again.” From the beginning to the end of his ministry, Jesus was determined to pursue the course set out for him. At the start, he overcame John’s resistance to his ‘being baptized,’ and, when approaching the end, “he firmly set his face to go to Jerusalem.” In the same connections, he again had direct and wonderful evidence of his Father’s approval. He proved that his mental attitude was exactly as foretold in that same 116th Psalm: “My vows I shall pay to Jehovah, yes, in front of all his people.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972203/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 3:13-17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972203/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Luke 9:28-35,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972203/16/2" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 51;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972203/16/3" data-bid="17-4" class="b"> Ps. 116:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972203/16/4" data-bid="17-5" class="b"> 18</a>.</p>

So the prophet’s account of his experience says: “Then Jonah prayed to Jehovah his God from the inward parts of the fish and said: ‘Out of my distress I called out to Jehovah, and he proceeded to answer me. Out of the belly of Sheol I cried for help. You heard my voice. To the bottoms of the mountains I went down [inside the fish]. As for the earth, its bars [like those of a grave] were upon me for time indefinite. But out of the pit you proceeded to bring up my life, O Jehovah my God.”’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Jonah 2:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 6</a>) For three days Jonah was as if dead in the grave or Sheol or Haʹdes. The Lord Jesus Christ showed this when he referred to his own death and burial and said: “Just as Jonah was in the belly of the huge fish three days and three nights, so the Son of man will be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 12:40</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 9.

This same God, Jehovah, brought up his faithful prophet <span id="page46" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="46" data-before-text="46"></span>Jesus Christ out of the “heart of the earth” on the third day. Hence the deliverance of Jonah was a prophetic picture of the resurrection of the Son of God from the dead. After his resurrection the “keys of death and of Haʹdes” were given to Jesus Christ, that he might be God’s Agent in raising all the others who are in Haʹdes or Sheol and in the condition of death. No man can, by his own means and arrangements, escape death and Sheol or Haʹdes, the grave that is common to dead mankind in the dust of the earth.</p>

<strong>Torments of the Rich Man</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> But if Hades, Sheol, or hell is the common grave of mankind, where there is no sensation, knowledge or activity, how is it that the parable says of the rich man in Hades, “he existing in torments”? In the next verse he says it is due to a “blazing fire” <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951164/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Lu 16:24</a>. Does that not show there is fire and torment of conscious human souls in Hades, Sheol, or hell? Not at all. This is a parable, and Sheol or Hades is used to picture the condition of the “rich man” class while still here among us on earth. Hence this class can be pictured as being in Sheol or Hades or hell and at the same time <span id="page144" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="144" data-before-text="144"></span>existing in torments from a blazing fire. The rich man could not be pictured as in Gehenna, because then he could not be pictured talking, for Gehenna or the “lake of fire that burneth with brimstone” symbolizes “second death”, utter destruction from which there is no resurrection.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951164/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Rev. 19:20</a>, <em>AS;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951164/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Re 20:14</a>.

For this reason they could be pictured as dead and buried in Hades or the grave and yet be alive and able to look up and see afar off and also to experience torment. What they saw helped to contribute torment to them: “he saw Abraham afar off and Lazarus in the bosom position with him.” That means the “rich man” class saw they were not getting the blessing as Abraham’s natural seed. They saw the Greater Abraham, Jehovah God, far off from them and his favor going to the Jewish remnant and Gentiles who believed on Jesus and followed him. Far from being the promised seed of Abraham for a blessing to all the families and nations of the earth, they were a curse to them. Said Paul: “They are not pleasing God, but are against the interests of all men, as they try to hinder us from speaking to the nations that these might be saved, with the result that they always fill up the measure of their sins.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951164/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Thess. 2:15, 16</a>, <em>NW</em>) Both Paul and Barnabas said to them: “It was necessary for the word of God to be spoken first to you. Since you are thrusting it away from you and do not judge yourselves worthy of everlasting life, look! we turn to the nations. In fact, Jehovah has laid commandment upon us in these words, ‘I have appointed you as a light of nations, for you to be a salvation to the most distant part of the earth.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951164/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Acts 13:46, 47</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">10.

God rejected Ishmael as the seed and he was therefore cast off and sent away so as not to threaten Isaac’s life. So, although those in the “rich man” class might be Abraham’s natural descendants, they were cast off from God’s favor. So they persecute the Lazarus class in envy and revenge, as Ishmael did.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951164/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Gal. 4:22-30</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p>

In a way that was appropriate for Jehovah to act toward his faithful worshipers in their dire distress. In the “war of the great day of God the Almighty” he acts in full harmony with his precious promises recorded in his Holy Word for the benefit and security of his obedient servants. “Jehovah is guarding all those loving him, but all the wicked ones he will annihilate.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101973029/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 145:20</a>) In the desperate situation of the “chosen ones” and the “great crowd,” he acts in the way appropriate to their faith, obedience, loyalty and devotion to Him.

He rescues them from any cause for shedding tears. He rescues them from any stumbling that the enemies would like to cause, resulting in a fall into death.

<strong>Torments of the Rich Man</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> But if Hades, Sheol, or hell is the common grave of mankind, where there is no sensation, knowledge or activity, how is it that the parable says of the rich man in Hades, “he existing in torments”? In the next verse he says it is due to a “blazing fire” <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951164/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Lu 16:24</a>. Does that not show there is fire and torment of conscious human souls in Hades, Sheol, or hell? Not at all. This is a parable, and Sheol or Hades is used to picture the condition of the “rich man” class while still here among us on earth. Hence this class can be pictured as being in Sheol or Hades or hell and at the same time <span id="page144" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="144" data-before-text="144"></span>existing in torments from a blazing fire. The rich man could not be pictured as in Gehenna, because then he could not be pictured talking, for Gehenna or the “lake of fire that burneth with brimstone” symbolizes “second death”, utter destruction from which there is no resurrection.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951164/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Rev. 19:20</a>, <em>AS;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951164/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Re 20:14</a>.

What did this mean to him?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> The “rich man” class, although living in their religious realm, were dead to God and were as buried in Hades or hell as far as his active service is concerned. For this reason they could be pictured as dead and buried in Hades or the grave and yet be alive and able to look up and see afar off and also to experience torment. What they saw helped to contribute torment to them: “he saw Abraham afar off and Lazarus in the bosom position with him.” That means the “rich man” class saw they were not getting the blessing as Abraham’s natural seed. They saw the Greater Abraham, Jehovah God, far off from them and his favor going to the Jewish remnant and Gentiles who believed on Jesus and followed him. Far from being the promised seed of Abraham for a blessing to all the families and nations of the earth, they were a curse to them. Said Paul: “They are not pleasing God, but are against the interests of all men, as they try to hinder us from speaking to the nations that these might be saved, with the result that they always fill up the measure of their sins.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951164/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Thess. 2:15, 16</a>, <em>NW</em>) Both Paul and Barnabas said to them: “It was necessary for the word of God to be spoken first to you. Since you are thrusting it away from you and do not judge yourselves worthy of everlasting life, look! we turn to the nations. In fact, Jehovah has laid commandment upon us in these words, ‘I have appointed you as a light of nations, for you to be a salvation to the most distant part of the earth.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951164/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Acts 13:46, 47</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">10.

They have been adopted as sons of God to be associated with Jesus Christ, the true Seed of Abraham, and so they are feasting at the “table of Jehovah” on the Kingdom mysteries and truths and on the pure worship and service of God.

The Lazarus class are like Isaac, Abraham’s son by his beloved wife Sarah, the son who was made Abraham’s heir. As God said: “It is in Isaac that your seed shall be called.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951164/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Rom. 9:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951164/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Gal. 4:28</a>, <em>NW</em>) But the “rich man” class are like Ishmael, Abraham’s son by the slave girl Hagar. God rejected Ishmael as the seed and he was therefore cast off and sent away so as not to threaten Isaac’s life. So, although those in the “rich man” class might be Abraham’s natural descendants, they were cast off from God’s favor. So they persecute the Lazarus class in envy and revenge, as Ishmael did.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951164/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Gal. 4:22-30</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p>

But he called to the Almighty God and was spared from death and from Sheol or Haʹdes. It was as if he had been resurrected from the dead by the power of Jehovah God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 18:8-19</a>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 8.

So the prophet’s account of his experience says: “Then Jonah prayed to Jehovah his God from the inward parts of the fish and said: ‘Out of my distress I called out to Jehovah, and he proceeded to answer me. Out of the belly of Sheol I cried for help. You heard my voice. To the bottoms of the mountains I went down [inside the fish]. As for the earth, its bars [like those of a grave] were upon me for time indefinite. But out of the pit you proceeded to bring up my life, O Jehovah my God.”’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Jonah 2:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 6</a>) For three days Jonah was as if dead in the grave or Sheol or Haʹdes. The Lord Jesus Christ showed this when he referred to his own death and burial and said: “Just as Jonah was in the belly of the huge fish three days and three nights, so the Son of man will be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 12:40</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 9.

This same God, Jehovah, brought up his faithful prophet <span id="page46" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="46" data-before-text="46"></span>Jesus Christ out of the “heart of the earth” on the third day. Hence the deliverance of Jonah was a prophetic picture of the resurrection of the Son of God from the dead. After his resurrection the “keys of death and of Haʹdes” were given to Jesus Christ, that he might be God’s Agent in raising all the others who are in Haʹdes or Sheol and in the condition of death. No man can, by his own means and arrangements, escape death and Sheol or Haʹdes, the grave that is common to dead mankind in the dust of the earth.</p>

<strong>Accept Gratefully—Give Wholeheartedly</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>“What Shall I Repay to Jehovah?”</strong></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The psalmist wondered: “What shall I repay to Jehovah for all his benefits to me?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009528/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 116:12</a>) What benefits had he received? Jehovah had sustained him during a period of “distress and grief.” Moreover, Jehovah had “rescued [his] soul from death.” Now he wanted to “repay” Jehovah somehow. What could the psalmist do? He said: “My vows I shall pay to Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009528/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 116:3, 4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009528/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009528/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 10-14</a>) He resolved to keep all the solemn promises that he had made to Jehovah and to fulfill all his obligations to him.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">You can do the same. How? By following a life course that at all times conforms to God’s laws and principles. Hence, make sure that your worship of Jehovah remains the most important thing in your life and that you let God’s spirit guide you in everything you do. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009528/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Eccl. 12:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009528/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Gal. 5:16-18</a>) In reality, of course, you can never fully repay Jehovah for all he has done for you. Still, it does ‘make Jehovah’s heart rejoice’ to see that you are wholeheartedly giving of yourself in his service. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009528/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Prov. 27:11</a>) What a wonderful privilege it is to give Jehovah pleasure in this way!</p>

<strong>Standing at the Threshold of Greater Activity</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Talks by three members of the Gilead faculty followed. Karl Adams spoke first, on the subject “What Will You Repay to Jehovah?” His talk was based on the 116th Psalm, which Jesus may have sung on the night before his death. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998887/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 26:30</a>, footnote) What went through Jesus’ mind as he sang the words: “What shall I repay to Jehovah for all his benefits to me”? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998887/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 116:12</a>) He may have been reflecting on the perfect body that Jehovah had prepared for him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998887/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:5</a>) The following day, he would offer that body in sacrifice, proving the depth of his love. The students of the 105th class had tasted Jehovah’s goodness for the past five months. Now they would show their love for God by working hard in their missionary assignments.</p>

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page25" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span><strong>How Shall We Repay Jehovah?</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHEN somebody takes a genuine, warm interest in us, perhaps doing something for our benefit, how do we react? Kindness and generosity usually bring forth a response, do they not? What, then, are our feelings toward our God, Jehovah, for his constant loving-kindness to us?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It is so easy, hurried along as we are by the everyday pressures of life, to take Jehovah’s beneficence for granted, sometimes even acting as if we were not truly grateful. We do well, therefore, to pause and reflect on the psalmist’s question: “What shall I repay to Jehovah for all his benefits to me?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988887/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 116:12</a>) In what ways shall we respond?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>Benefits From Jehovah</strong></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Without Jehovah’s gift of his Word, the Bible, how lost we would be! Courageous men and women in past centuries risked their lives to possess and read this book, and we have grown to understand why. Men of God have always been grateful for inspired Scripture, knowing how beneficial it is “for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988887/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">We know, however, that to be “completely equipped for every good work,” we need more than mere head knowledge of the Bible. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988887/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:17</a>) It is through the power of God’s holy spirit that benefit is brought to our lives, and this fact is drawn to our attention by Jehovah’s appealing expressions through his prophet Isaiah: “And now the Sovereign Lord Jehovah himself has sent me, even his spirit. This is what Jehovah has said, your Repurchaser, the Holy One of Israel: ‘I, Jehovah, am your God, the One teaching you to benefit yourself, the One causing you to tread in the way in which you should walk. O if only you would actually pay attention to my commandments! Then your peace would become just like a river, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988887/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 48:16-18</a>) By his holy spirit, in conjunction with his Word, Jehovah directs us to benefit ourselves, and the result is peace and righteousness.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Furthermore, Jehovah’s active force works effectively for our benefit because a framework has been set up, an earthly organization, through which the holy spirit operates. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988887/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Corinthians chapter 12</a>, Paul likens the Christian congregation to a body and states in verse 7: “But the manifestation of the spirit is given to each one for a beneficial purpose.” He goes on to show how we benefit from being part of God’s earthly organization.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Five years or so after he wrote those words, he penned his letter to the congregation in Ephesus in which he enlarged on the benefits of being connected with that earthly arrangement. Although what he said applied initially to anointed Christians, are not those of the “great crowd” today also ‘readjusted for ministerial work,’ becoming ‘full-grown men’ spiritually, stabilized in the faith, ‘no longer babes,’ and ‘by love growing up in all things into him who is the head, Christ’? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988887/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988887/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Ephesians 4:12-16</a>) All of us have good reason to be grateful.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span id="page26" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="26" data-before-text="26"></span>Identified with the Christian congregation is the faithful and discreet slave, whose work, to feed us spiritually, is yet another evidence that Jehovah is benefiting us. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988887/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45, 46</a>) Here we are now in the foretold time of the Master’s presence. Is the “slave” doing his work? Despite the bleakness of these “last days,” are we filled with hope? Do we have a worthwhile purpose in life? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988887/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988887/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Romans 5:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988887/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 1 Timothy 4:10</a>) Yes! And our hope is not a mere probability but a sure conviction built on faith, which in turn is based on solid evidence.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988887/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:1</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Manifestly, then, Jehovah, our Great Benefactor, has given us so much for which to be grateful. The question reasonably follows:</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>What Will I Repay to Jehovah?</strong></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">First, we must acknowledge that Jehovah needs nothing from us. He is the one who says, “The silver is mine, and the gold is mine,” likewise “the beasts upon a thousand mountains.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988887/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Haggai 2:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988887/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Psalm 50:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988887/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Job 41:11</a>) This means we can in no way “buy” Jehovah’s favor; yet we are encouraged to make voluntary offerings to him. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988887/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 29:14</a>.) There are certain conditions, however, to our being allowed to offer gifts to Jehovah.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">“With what shall I confront Jehovah? With what shall I bow myself to God on high? Shall I confront him with whole burnt offerings, with calves a year old? Will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams, with tens of thousands of torrents of oil? Shall I give my firstborn son for my revolt, the fruitage of my belly for the sin of my soul? He has told you, O earthling man, what is good. And what is Jehovah asking back from you but to exercise justice and to love kindness and to be modest in walking with your God?”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988887/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Micah 6:6-8</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">We learn from this that Jehovah’s requirements are always reasonable, always attainable. Additionally, Jesus pointed out the prerequisite that our relationship with both Jehovah and our fellowman must be right in order for our offerings to be acceptable. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988887/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 5:23, 24</a>) Having laid the right basis, we can now see that all of us <span id="page27" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span>have something to give Jehovah, in appreciation for his goodness to us.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>How Can We Use What We Have?</strong></p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">It takes time, effort, and to some extent money, but what a privilege it is to represent Jehovah in the preaching work! This sacrifice of praise is something all of us can give to Jehovah. Here is how one pioneer elder with three small children feels about it:</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">“To share in the privilege of full-time service is worth any personal sacrifice​—and more—​because it is the most effective way to give praise to our heavenly Father. Also, it enables me in some measure to thank him for his undeserved kindness shown to me personally.”</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">His wife adds: “It is a real privilege to help my husband to pioneer. It enables the whole family to have a greater share in the ministry, and seeing Jehovah’s loving hand providing for us in a spiritual and material way makes us want to praise him all the more.”</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The Watch Tower Society has distributed Bibles and Bible literature on a voluntary basis for well over a hundred years and printed these on its own presses since 1920. The time and effort of volunteers working at Bethel to produce all the publications we have today, along with that of congregation publishers and pioneers to circulate them, become, in effect, an additional donation to the vital preaching work.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988887/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Also, Christians in the more economically stable countries are pleased to know that their kind gifts of money, sent to the branch office of the Watch Tower Society in their country, enable many of their brothers in other parts of the world to spend their whole time in preaching and disciple making. Missionaries from the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead, circuit and district overseers, and special pioneers are all helped to continue in their full-time service by these voluntary contributions.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Perhaps it is impossible for you to serve at Bethel or as a member of the International Volunteer Construction Worker Program. But maybe you have funds that can support those who are engaged in this activity but who lack a “surplus” of funds to maintain themselves in it. A helpful equalizing can therefore take place, as described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988887/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 8:14</a>. Letters accompanying such donations have included the following from one elderly sister who wrote:</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">“I am very grateful for all the blessings Jehovah gives me, and I pray for the building projects and the organization continually.”</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Another sister said: “I’d rather this small sum do some good theocratically than remain in a bank that is going to collapse before long!”</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">A brother expressed himself in these words: “Jehovah’s counseling us to use our belongings to glorify him is a means of real protection from greedy commerce, the ‘third wing’ of Satan’s wicked system of things. May I take this opportunity to say how glad I am to contribute something to the speeding up of the increase Jehovah is giving us, and I thank him for making it possible for me to be used.”</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="ss"><strong>Gifts From Old and Young</strong></p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">It is encouraging to read of the faithful determination of elderly ones who, though hoping to survive to the end of this system, make sure, by making an appropriate will, that the Kingdom work benefits in the event of their death. Some expressions received from executors, commenting on the fine attitude of such testators, include:</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">“A very kind person to everyone, all her life . . . she loved Jehovah and his creation.”</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">“Always, the interests of the Kingdom were her first concern.”</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">“He achieved his heavenly reward after 70 years of faithful service . . . he always <span id="page28" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>wanted to further the truth with his assets.”</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">We also enjoy hearing from young ones, intent on using their material things for Jehovah’s work. One letter received at the Society’s office in Britain came from a school-age publisher. She related that she had won first prize in an essay competition. She enclosed the entire prize money. The Society’s publications were the sole source of material for her essay on “Christian Commitment,” so she felt the money rightly belonged to Jehovah.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">After asking what he will repay to Jehovah, the writer of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988887/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 116</a> continues in verses 13 and 14 to say: “The cup of grand salvation I shall take up, and on the name of Jehovah I shall call. My vows I shall pay to Jehovah, yes, in front of all his people.” Appreciating the precious gift of salvation from Jehovah through his Son, we feel moved, as did the psalmist, to call on Him and keep our promises to Him.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">Jehovah has benefited us so much, and whatever we can do in return seems little in comparison. How appropriate, then, that as an expression of gratitude, we do all we can, in every way! “To you I shall offer the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and on the name of Jehovah I shall call.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988887/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 116:17</a>.</p>

<strong>How Valuable Is Your Life?</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The God who has such love for his people inspired one of his psalmists to write about his experience. (Actually, the psalmist seemed to be writing of himself as representing the entire nation of Israel.) He underwent a situation in which his life was on the verge of extinction at the hands of the enemies of God and His people. Then God delivered him from death. The apostle Paul quoted the psalmist’s words at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975402/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 116:10</a> and applied the words to himself and fellow Christians.

<strong>What Shall I Repay to Jehovah?</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">It is clear that the course of gratitude is now to sing forth the praises of our God to all we meet, letting them know about the blessings we have received, our completely new outlook on the future. Let us share with them the goodness of Jehovah. Freely we have received; freely let us give to other needy ones. And as we give of ourselves and our means, let us have confidence that Jehovah is pleased with our humble efforts to respond to the question: “What shall I repay to Jehovah for all his benefits to me?”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973362/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 116:12</a>.</p>

Just think of it! For these loyal ones there has come a good riddance of all the wicked ones on earth and in the invisible realm about the earth. There can now follow a preservation of such loyal ones all during the thousand years of God’s Messianic kingdom, the loyal ones of the “great crowd” being the ones that will forever keep living upon the cleansed earth. In appreciation of this the preserved loyal ones should feel moved to say what the psalmist said: “What shall I repay to Jehovah for all his benefits to me? The cup of grand salvation I shall take up, and on the name of Jehovah I shall call. My vows I shall pay to Jehovah, yes, in front of all his people.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101973029/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 116:12-14</a>.</p>

<strong>Giving Thanks Always for All Things</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">If you are associated with a congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses at a Kingdom Hall, you will certainly want to share in some way the expense of maintaining that fine center of Bible education. You do not need to be asked to do so, for you can plainly see the need. And besides, you have noticed that in the true Christian congregation collection plates are never passed around. Begging for funds just is not done. The Kingdom Hall does have a contribution box into which those who wish may drop their modest donations when moved to do so by the spirit of gratitude to God <span id="page282" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="282" data-before-text="282"></span>for his loving provisions for their spiritual welfare. Too, it may be that that congregation, after caring for local expense, is able also to make a direct contribution to the nearest branch office of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. It would thus be sharing in the upkeep of the Society’s countrywide activity.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">On the other hand, you may choose to mail your own modest donation direct to the office of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society in the country where you reside. In the United States contributions may be sent to 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201. Whatever you decide, we are sure that you will experience a deep satisfaction that your material things are being used for the advancement of the life-giving spiritual things.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">If you are not in association with a congregation of the Witnesses, it may be that you are a regular reader of this magazine. You are therefore in a position to appraise the excellent diet of spiritual food provided in these pages for those who hunger and thirst after righteousness. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969325/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 5:6</a>) Perhaps your appreciation will move you to share what you are learning with others—even providing them with some of the same publications. There can be no greater evidence of your thankfulness to Jehovah and your concern for the lasting good of fellow creatures than to share with them the spiritual treasures you are enjoying.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">At the same time we would like to urge you to seek out the Kingdom Hall nearest to your home and find there regular association with others who value <em>The Watchtower</em> as a real help in gaining an accurate knowledge of the deeper truths of the Bible. Each Sunday there is a discussion of the main article in <em>The Watchtower.</em> You will be amazed to find how much more you can learn through listening to such a discussion. There too you will see how persons at all stages of progress in Bible knowledge aid one another toward a deeper appreciation of God’s kind provisions.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>APPRECIATION IS THE KEY</strong></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Appreciation is, in fact, the key that opens up many avenues for expressing our thanks to God. The more we understand the details and preparations that God made long ago for the ultimate blessing of all those who please him, the more we find ourselves motivated to express gratitude by our minds, by our mouths and by our material possessions. We come to the same conclusion as the inspired psalmist, namely: “What shall I repay to Jehovah for all his benefits to me? The cup of grand salvation I shall take up, and on the name of Jehovah I shall call. My vows I shall pay to Jehovah, yes, in front of all his people.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969325/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 116:12-14</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Obviously, we cannot really “repay” Jehovah for all his loving-kindnesses, for everything already belongs to him. But surely we should always remember that we are constantly the recipients of his goodness. There is not one thing that we have that was not given to us. So we can meditate on Jehovah’s generosity, on the fact that from his open hand all creatures can be satisfied with good things. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969325/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 104:28</a>) And we can speak about this generous Creator and recommend him to others as the worthy object of their worship and service.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Finally, we can all make “token repayment” to Jehovah. How? By “giving thanks always for all things” in a material way, in a way that brings us a measure of satisfaction not otherwise obtained. Without doubt that satisfaction stems from the knowledge that we are using our material things for the honor of God. It is not the amount that counts; rather, it is the spirit of the donor.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"></p>

Nevertheless, he was willing to submit to Jehovah’s will and drink it.

<strong>Participation with Demons Forbidden</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Now as to the “cup of Jehovah”. Jesus offered the Memorial cup to his disciples with the words: “This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood, which is to be poured out in your behalf.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 22:20</a>, <em>NW</em>) This same cup is the “cup of Jehovah” because the new covenant is the agreement or contract he makes in order to take out of all nations a “people for his name”. But it is Christ Jesus who acts as mediator between God and men by providing the sacrificial blood to put that new covenant into force, just as Moses slaughtered animal victims and sprinkled their blood in order to put the ancient Law covenant into force between God and fleshly Israel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Jer. 31:31-34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Acts 15:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/12/2" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> Ex. 24:1-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/12/3" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> Heb. 9:14-24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/12/4" data-bid="13-5" class="b"> 1 Tim. 2:5, 6</a>) The ones taken into this new covenant are the “people for his name”, beginning with the faithful Jewish remnant at Pentecost and later taking in the Gentile believers from the centurion Cornelius onward. All these Jehovah God anoints with his spirit, by this making them anointed ones or members of the “body of the Christ”. These God gathers to him, saying: “Gather yourselves <span id="page53" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="53" data-before-text="53"></span>unto me—ye my men of loving-kindness, who have solemnised my covenant over sacrifice [Christ’s sacrifice].” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 50:5</a>, <em>Ro</em>) This new covenant is an additional fact which shows that the privilege of drinking of the cup at the Memorial celebration is limited to those who are members of Christ’s body.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>HOW THE CUP IS SHARED</strong></p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">11. How did Jesus indicate there is another sense to the cup, making it the “cup of Jehovah” in which his followers might share?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> These members do not share in providing the blood of the new covenant. Only Jesus does that. By his blood he mediates the new covenant in their behalf. And so the body members could not in that sense be “sharing in the blood of the Christ”. How, then, can the apostle’s words be true: “The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a sharing in the blood of the Christ?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:16</a>, <em>NW</em>) Because this cup is the “cup of Jehovah” in still another sense. How so? In that it pictures the portion which Jehovah has poured. Jesus and his little flock of Kingdom joint heirs must drink it in order to prove their integrity to Him and their worthiness of the Kingdom. This is the cup to which Jesus referred when, shortly after introducing the Memorial, he prayed: “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me. Yet, not as I will, but as you will.” And, again: “My Father, if it is not possible for this to pass away except I drink it, let your will take place.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 26:39,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 42</a>, <em>NW</em>) And when Peter, to defend Jesus, wounded one of the men who came out to arrest him, Jesus said: “Put the sword into its sheath. The cup that the Father has given me, should I not by all means drink it?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">John 18:11</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">12. How also was it shown to be a “cup of salvation”?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> That “cup of Jehovah” symbolized God’s will for the drinker, and drinking it spelled suffering and death on the disgraceful torture stake for Jesus. But God’s will for Jesus did not end in his death. It also included the resurrection of Jesus from the dead to immortal life in heaven as a glorified Son of God, and so a saving of him out of death. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Heb. 5:7</a>) It was therefore for him a “cup of salvation” also, salvation for holding fast his integrity to his Father without sin. Here the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 116</a>, which applies in particular to Jesus Christ in Gethsemane, are fitting, because Jesus determined to drink the “cup of Jehovah” even to the death: “What shall I render unto Jehovah for all his benefits toward me? I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of Jehovah. I will pay my vows unto Jehovah, yea, in the presence of all his people. Precious in the sight of Jehovah is the death of his saints.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 116:12-15</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">13. What was it Jesus said that made it sure his followers would drink the cup with him? What about it made it hard to drink?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> But according to God’s will the cup which Jesus was given to drink he also shares with his little flock of Kingdom joint heirs. This he made sure when he said to two of his apostles who applied for specific seats in the Kingdom with him: “The cup I am drinking you will drink, and with the baptism with which I am being baptized you will be baptized. However, this sitting down at my right or at my left is not mine to give, but it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Mark 10:34-40</a>, <em>NW</em>) The cup which Jesus was then drinking and which his heavenly Father had poured and given him was God’s will for him. This will was recorded aforetime in the Holy Scriptures and it marked out suffering and a disgraceful death for him as if he were a sinner, a blasphemer and a reproach to Jehovah God. This latter feature was what made it so hard for Jesus to drink, so that he took the matter to his Father three times in prayer and then resigned himself to drinking <span id="page54" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="54" data-before-text="54"></span>this portion of the divine will. This course led to gaining the Kingdom.</p>

<strong>Accept Gratefully—Give Wholeheartedly</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The psalmist wondered: “What shall I repay to Jehovah for all his benefits to me?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009528/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 116:12</a>) What benefits had he received? Jehovah had sustained him during a period of “distress and grief.” Moreover, Jehovah had “rescued [his] soul from death.” Now he wanted to “repay” Jehovah somehow. What could the psalmist do? He said: “My vows I shall pay to Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009528/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 116:3, 4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009528/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009528/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 10-14</a>) He resolved to keep all the solemn promises that he had made to Jehovah and to fulfill all his obligations to him.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">You can do the same. How? By following a life course that at all times conforms to God’s laws and principles. Hence, make sure that your worship of Jehovah remains the most important thing in your life and that you let God’s spirit guide you in everything you do. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009528/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Eccl. 12:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009528/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Gal. 5:16-18</a>) In reality, of course, you can never fully repay Jehovah for all he has done for you. Still, it does ‘make Jehovah’s heart rejoice’ to see that you are wholeheartedly giving of yourself in his service. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009528/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Prov. 27:11</a>) What a wonderful privilege it is to give Jehovah pleasure in this way!</p>

<strong>Preserved for God’s Kingdom of a Thousand Years</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> Thus when the glorious thousand years of Messiah’s reign over all the earth are ready to begin, a “grand salvation” will indeed have been wrought by God for all his loyal ones on earth. Just think of it! For these loyal ones there has come a good riddance of all the wicked ones on earth and in the invisible realm about the earth. There can now follow a preservation of such loyal ones all during the thousand years of God’s Messianic kingdom, the loyal ones of the “great crowd” being the ones that will forever keep living upon the cleansed earth. In appreciation of this the preserved loyal ones should feel moved to say what the psalmist said: “What shall I repay to Jehovah for all his benefits to me? The cup of grand salvation I shall take up, and on the name of Jehovah I shall call. My vows I shall pay to Jehovah, yes, in front of all his people.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101973029/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 116:12-14</a>.</p>

<strong>Taking Delight in Suffering</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Beyond any doubt, Jesus was keenly aware of what was ahead of him. It gave him a foretaste of that vivid prophetic word at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972203/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 116:3</a>: “The ropes of death encircled me and the distressing circumstances of Sheol themselves found me. Distress and grief I kept finding.” If only it could be avoided! But, no, as he said: “This is why I have come to this hour.” He was in full agreement with the entire process, every part of it. His opening and closing words clearly prove this, mentioning first his own glorification, then leading to the final glorifying of his Father’s name. And what a strength and comfort it must have been to hear immediately and audibly his Father’s confirmation on this, the main issue: “I both glorified it [my name] and will glorify it again.” From the beginning to the end of his ministry, Jesus was determined to pursue the course set out for him. At the start, he overcame John’s resistance to his ‘being baptized,’ and, when approaching the end, “he firmly set his face to go to Jerusalem.” In the same connections, he again had direct and wonderful evidence of his Father’s approval. He proved that his mental attitude was exactly as foretold in that same 116th Psalm: “My vows I shall pay to Jehovah, yes, in front of all his people.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972203/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 3:13-17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972203/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Luke 9:28-35,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972203/16/2" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 51;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972203/16/3" data-bid="17-4" class="b"> Ps. 116:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972203/16/4" data-bid="17-5" class="b"> 18</a>.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ An inspired psalmist sang: “Precious in the eyes of Jehovah is the death of his loyal ones.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012366/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 116:15</a>) The life of every true worshipper of Jehovah is very valuable to him. However, more than the death of an individual is meant by the words just quoted from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012366/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 116</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When delivering a memorial talk for a Christian, it is not fitting to apply <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012366/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 116:15</a> to the deceased person, even though he died as a loyal servant of Jehovah. Why? Because the psalmist’s statement has a broader significance. It means that God counts the death of <em>the entire group of his loyal ones</em> too costly for him to let it take place.​—See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012366/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 72:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012366/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 116:8</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012366/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 116:15</a> assures us that Jehovah will not allow his loyal servants <em>as a group</em> to be entirely removed from the earth. In fact, our modern-day history chronicles our endurance of severe trials and persecution, thus furnishing clear evidence that God will never permit us to be exterminated.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Because of his limitless power and unfailing purpose, Jehovah will not allow us to be swept out of existence as a group. If God were to permit that, it would seem that his enemies are more powerful than he is​—an impossibility! Jehovah’s purpose that this globe be inhabited by people loyal to him would go unfulfilled​—and there is no possibility of that. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012366/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isa. 45:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012366/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 55:10, 11</a>) Why, the rendering of sacred service to Jehovah would cease on earth if no humans were left to worship him in the earthly courtyards of his great spiritual temple! There would be no foundation for the “new earth”​—righteous human society living on our globe under the “new heaven.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012366/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rev. 21:1</a>) Then, too, Christ’s Thousand Year Reign could not become a reality without any earthly subjects.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012366/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Rev. 20:4, 5</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">God’s position and reputation would be called into question were he to allow his enemies to wipe out the entire group of his people on earth. Such a development would be a blot on Jehovah’s position as Universal Sovereign. Furthermore, because of his respect for himself and his holy name, Jehovah will not permit the death of his loyal ones as a group. And consider this: Since “there is no injustice” with God, he will never fail to preserve the group of humans who have been serving him loyally. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012366/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Deut. 32:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012366/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Gen. 18:25</a>) Moreover, permitting the extermination of his servants as a body would be contrary to God’s Word: “Jehovah will not desert his people for the sake of his great name.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012366/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Sam. 12:22</a>) Indeed, “Jehovah will not forsake his people, nor will he leave his own inheritance.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012366/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 94:14</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">How comforting it is to know that Jehovah’s people will never perish from the earth! By all means, then, let us ever prove loyal to God, trusting in his promise: “Any weapon whatever that will be formed against you will have no success, and any tongue at all that will rise up against you in the judgment you will condemn. This is the hereditary possession of the servants of Jehovah, and their righteousness is from me.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012366/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa. 54:17</a>.</p>

<strong>How Valuable Is Your Life?</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Continuing to speak in appreciation of Jehovah’s preservation, the psalmist emphasizes the value that Jehovah places on the lives of those who live according to his righteous principles: “Precious in the eyes of Jehovah is the death of his loyal ones. Ah, now, O Jehovah, for I am your servant. I am your servant, the son of your slave girl. You have loosened my bands.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975402/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 116:15, 16</a>) The psalmist appreciatively knew that Jehovah had considered him loyal by preserving him. He had been in dire danger of death, but Jehovah had loosened the bands with which he appeared to be tied to death. He called himself “the son of [Jehovah’s] slave girl,” which would simply indicate that he was one of Jehovah’s people. He recognized that Jehovah considered him one of His loyal servants.</p>

<strong>What Protection for God’s People?</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">When the “great tribulation” destroys this ungodly system there will definitely be survivors. In fact, the Bible refers to a “great crowd” who “come out of” or survive this “great tribulation.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974203/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Rev. 7:9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974203/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 14</a>) Jehovah God will not allow the haters of his people to vent their rage to the point of exterminating them. By means of his Son and the angelic forces, he will come to the defense of his people, rescuing them from annihilation. They being his “loyal ones,” their death as a <em>people</em> would be too “precious,” too costly, in his eyes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974203/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 116:15</a>) They will also be shielded from the execution of divine judgment. Neither Jesus Christ nor his angelic forces will make a mistake. None of God’s servants will be swept away along with the wicked.</p>

Instead of letting the psalmist suffer death and thereafter have a Levitical priest preach a funeral sermon and say over him, “Precious in the eyes of Jehovah is the death of his loyal ones,” Jehovah considered the death of the psalmist too costly to let it occur. So he rescued the psalmist’s “soul from death.” Consequently, the psalmist could now appreciate how costly the death of a loyal one would be to Jehovah. As it were, the <span id="page408" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="408" data-before-text="408"></span>death of the loyal servant was too high a price for Jehovah to pay.

For Him to let these enemies triumph over them and wipe them from the face of the earth would be a blot upon his universal sovereignty, his rulership over heaven and earth. He is the Creator of the earth and he created it for those loyal to him. If he cannot preserve his loyal ones on earth even under the heaviest, most dastardly attack by anti-God enemies, it would be as if his enemies were more powerful than he is and they had the right to say who shall live permanently on the earth. The wiping out of his loyal ones by his enemies during the “great tribulation” would impugn his rulership of the earth, in fact, his whole universal sovereignty. So he cannot let their death, forced by the enemies, occur!</p><p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="qu">22. Why is the forced “death of his loyal ones” too costly for Jehovah to allow when His worship and the founding of the “new earth” are considered?</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> What is more, if Jehovah were to let his earthly enemies defiantly destroy the remnant of His “chosen ones” and the “great crowd” during the “great tribulation,” not only would the enemies have momentarily triumphed and the onlooking Satan and his demon angels feel great glee, but what else? The forced “death” of all Jehovah’s loyal ones from the earth would leave the earth without those worshiping Him as the only living and true God. It would leave the courtyards of his great spiritual temple, which are at <span id="page409" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="409" data-before-text="409"></span>the earth, without those who offer up to Him the sacrifices of praise, thanksgiving and sacred service. Also, the basis for the “new earth” under “new heavens” would have been removed, before the thousand years of Jehovah’s Messiah Jesus were timed to begin! Could the Most High and Almighty God Jehovah let such a highly important thing take place by the forced “death of his loyal ones”? No! Their death under such circumstances in which a universal issue was involved would be “precious,” costly, for Jehovah. Out of respect for Himself, it is too costly to allow.</p><p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="qu">23.

In full favor and support of this he will do as he has solemnly promised in his unchangeable Word, namely, rescue the souls of his loyal ones on earth from death during the “great tribulation,” when the universal issue will be finally settled for all time to come! As in the case of the patient Job, whose life Jehovah preserved because of Job’s unbroken integrity, Jehovah will prove once again that he can put loyal men on earth who under the severest test by Satan the Devil will hold fast their loving integrity to Jehovah.</p>

They provide a witness to the rightfulness of Jehovah’s sovereignty, and God can use even their death in helping others to see the truth and be moved to serve Him.</p>

<strong>“Fully Accomplish Your Ministry”</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> In all of our ministry unity is essential. It is true that in the world a united front is often presented, either by a political party or in time of war. In the religious <span id="page407" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="407" data-before-text="407"></span>world, too, efforts are made in this direction, though in comparison they seem slow and cumbersome. Generally, however, is it not true that the motive prompting the united front is often that of fear, fear of a common enemy? As soon as the danger is overcome, then all too often the old factions break out again. Unity prompted by such a motive is liable to crack and break. It is not love that binds them together; but it is love, a Godlike love, that alone will bring about and lastingly preserve real, genuine unity. Let us see how this operates among all who are gathered under Christ’s administration.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">15. What initial steps are required to come into unity with God?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> Unity in any group of people must start with the individual. In this case we are concerned with Christians, or those who have become Christians. In order to become such, the first vital step is to come into unity with God. Often this is viewed as an emotional experience, a sudden conversion. But true unity requires a more solid foundation. To come into unity with God the individual must get to know the mind of God on all matters that properly concern him. That is one of the main reasons why God has given us his Word, the Bible. It expresses the mind and will of the Supreme One. As we study and get the understanding of it, our minds are influenced by the right thoughts and, in turn, we are moved to do the right works, those “which God prepared in advance for us to walk in them.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964484/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Eph. 2:10</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">16. How is the heart involved, leading to what blessed fruitage?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> But the heart as well as the mind is involved. As we learn and grow in knowledge, so our appreciation of God, the Source of all knowledge and wisdom, should also grow. Our hearts are drawn out to him in gratitude and worship, leading us to take the step of dedication and baptism, resulting in a personal and unified relationship with Jehovah. In order to maintain that relationship and meeting of the minds, we need to continue our study of his Word. This is a constant necessity. As beautifully expressed in the Psalms: “Happy is the man . . . [whose] delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.” With what result? “He will certainly become like a tree planted by streams of water that gives its own fruit in its season and the foliage of which does not wither, and everything he does will succeed.” What richer blessing could you desire?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964484/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">17. In view of all the suffering involved, how could Jesus say he delighted to do God’s will?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> In confirmation of this we also recall in the Psalms the prophetic word that is applied to Jesus at the time of his baptism, when he said: “To do your will, O my God, I have delighted, and your law is within my inward parts.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964484/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 40:8</a>; see <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964484/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:5-7</a>) How could Jesus say he delighted to do God’s will, when he knew from such scriptures as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964484/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Isaiah, chapter 53</a>, that his dedicated course would entail the keenest suffering and reproach, being despised and pierced and crushed in ‘pouring out his soul to the very death’? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964484/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Isa. 53:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964484/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964484/23/2" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> 12</a>) It was because his Father’s Word and law were within his inward parts. From his perfect knowledge and memory of God’s Word he knew his Father’s mind on all these things, and this guided and sustained him throughout. He knew his death was “precious in the eyes of Jehovah,” so he could say, as foretold: “To you [Jehovah] I shall offer the sacrifice of thanksgiving . . . My vows I shall pay to Jehovah.” Jesus is the perfect example of one who is at unity with Jehovah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964484/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ps. 116:15-18</a>; see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964484/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">John 5:19,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964484/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 30</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">18.

This is interesting. It comes in the detailed counsel given by Paul to both wives and husbands. We mention wives first, as both Paul and Peter do so when giving detailed counsel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964484/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Eph. 5:22-33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964484/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 3:1-7</a>) In each case they stress the need for wives to be in subjection to their husbands, even as without question the “congregation is in subjection to the Christ” in everything. This is manifested by the “incorruptible apparel of the quiet and mild spirit.” This is essential to family unity. After all, in the case of the first human couple, was it not the wife who first went wrong and aimed the initial blow at family unity by her show of independence?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964484/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Eph. 5:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964484/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 3:4</a>.</p>

<strong>A Close and Precious Relationship</strong><br/><p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"><sup>27</sup></span> Having briefly reviewed the marvelous benefits received and the benefits shared by those in the new covenant, also the close and precious relationship into which they enter, we can more fully appreciate what a wonderful privilege is theirs, besides a great responsibility. The “other sheep” should also learn about these important truths, forming a vital part of God’s purpose, even though they cannot enter into them in the sense of experiencing them for themselves. Truly, then, this yearly meeting incorporating the Lord’s evening meal is indeed unique. All sincerely interested people are welcome and should endeavor to attend. Such a meeting is an expression of true worship, for it can be said that all present are in attendance at the “table of Jehovah,” in a symbolic sense, though only those will partake of the emblems of unleavened bread and the wine who have the witness of God’s spirit that they are his spiritual sons, ‘heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.’ But by listening to what is said that evening all will realize afresh the importance of serving Jehovah in the interests of his kingdom <span id="page147" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="147" data-before-text="147"></span>in the spirit of undivided and exclusive worship, the importance of keeping clear from any course of action that would identify them as serving at the “table of demons,” and the importance of keeping in close unity with the New World society of Jehovah’s dedicated witnesses, for this is the time when Jehovah has gathered all the sheep “in unity . . . like a flock in the pen.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962163/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Mic. 2:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962163/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> John 10:16</a>.</p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">28.

Appreciating all that they have received at his hands, their prayer should be the same as Jesus prayed, as we know from a certain prophetic psalm: “What shall I repay to Jehovah for all his benefits to me?” Their steadfast determination must likewise be the same as was his, as expressed in that same psalm: “To you [Jehovah] I shall offer the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and on the name of Jehovah I shall call. My vows I shall pay to Jehovah.” Faithfully fulfilling their sacrificial course, ‘proving themselves faithful even to death,’ they are sustained by Jesus’ glorious promise: “I will give you the crown of life.” What comfort and what strong assurance it must have given to Jesus in his hour of need, likewise to those following the same sacrificial course, to read the word that Jehovah caused to be recorded so long ago for their benefit: “Precious in the eyes of Jehovah is the death of his loyal ones”!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962163/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962163/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> Rev. 2:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962163/30/2" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> Ps. 116:12-19</a>.</p>

<strong>How Valuable Is Your Life?</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Continuing to speak in appreciation of Jehovah’s preservation, the psalmist emphasizes the value that Jehovah places on the lives of those who live according to his righteous principles: “Precious in the eyes of Jehovah is the death of his loyal ones. Ah, now, O Jehovah, for I am your servant. I am your servant, the son of your slave girl. You have loosened my bands.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975402/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 116:15, 16</a>) The psalmist appreciatively knew that Jehovah had considered him loyal by preserving him. He had been in dire danger of death, but Jehovah had loosened the bands with which he appeared to be tied to death. He called himself “the son of [Jehovah’s] slave girl,” which would simply indicate that he was one of Jehovah’s people. He recognized that Jehovah considered him one of His loyal servants.</p>

Ah, now, O Jehovah, for I am your servant. I am your servant, the son of your slave girl. You have loosened my bands.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101973029/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Psalm 116:15, 16</a>) The psalmist exclaimed, “Ah, now, O Jehovah,” in a beseeching, entreating way. This supplicating attitude was what he did have during the period of his being endangered with death. At that time he appealed to God that those bands with which he appeared to be tied to death might be loosened and he be freed from death. He pleaded with God for this favor on the basis that he was Jehovah’s servant, yes, Jehovah’s servant of a second generation, for he was a son of Jehovah’s “slave girl.” As it were, the psalmist reminded Jehovah of His responsibility for his servants, to preserve them alive. And now, after his confrontation with death, the psalmist could speak of Jehovah as having lovingly carried out His responsibility.</p>

At the crucial time Jehovah will hear their earnest appeal to him and will loosen the “bands” of violent death that the foes of Jehovah and his Messianic kingdom try to fasten upon them. What a lasting reason this will be for them never to forget their servanthood to their heavenly Owner and Supreme Master, Jehovah!</p>

The unnamed psalmist desired to do more than offer merely a private expression of thanksgiving to his divine Rescuer.

<strong>A Close and Precious Relationship</strong><br/><p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"><sup>27</sup></span> Having briefly reviewed the marvelous benefits received and the benefits shared by those in the new covenant, also the close and precious relationship into which they enter, we can more fully appreciate what a wonderful privilege is theirs, besides a great responsibility. The “other sheep” should also learn about these important truths, forming a vital part of God’s purpose, even though they cannot enter into them in the sense of experiencing them for themselves. Truly, then, this yearly meeting incorporating the Lord’s evening meal is indeed unique. All sincerely interested people are welcome and should endeavor to attend. Such a meeting is an expression of true worship, for it can be said that all present are in attendance at the “table of Jehovah,” in a symbolic sense, though only those will partake of the emblems of unleavened bread and the wine who have the witness of God’s spirit that they are his spiritual sons, ‘heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.’ But by listening to what is said that evening all will realize afresh the importance of serving Jehovah in the interests of his kingdom <span id="page147" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="147" data-before-text="147"></span>in the spirit of undivided and exclusive worship, the importance of keeping clear from any course of action that would identify them as serving at the “table of demons,” and the importance of keeping in close unity with the New World society of Jehovah’s dedicated witnesses, for this is the time when Jehovah has gathered all the sheep “in unity . . . like a flock in the pen.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962163/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Mic. 2:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962163/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> John 10:16</a>.</p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">28.

Appreciating all that they have received at his hands, their prayer should be the same as Jesus prayed, as we know from a certain prophetic psalm: “What shall I repay to Jehovah for all his benefits to me?” Their steadfast determination must likewise be the same as was his, as expressed in that same psalm: “To you [Jehovah] I shall offer the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and on the name of Jehovah I shall call. My vows I shall pay to Jehovah.” Faithfully fulfilling their sacrificial course, ‘proving themselves faithful even to death,’ they are sustained by Jesus’ glorious promise: “I will give you the crown of life.” What comfort and what strong assurance it must have given to Jesus in his hour of need, likewise to those following the same sacrificial course, to read the word that Jehovah caused to be recorded so long ago for their benefit: “Precious in the eyes of Jehovah is the death of his loyal ones”!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962163/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962163/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> Rev. 2:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962163/30/2" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> Ps. 116:12-19</a>.</p>

The unnamed psalmist desired to do more than offer merely a private expression of thanksgiving to his divine Rescuer. He desired to offer thanksgiving publicly by means of a sacrifice on God’s altar in the temple courtyard, calling on Jehovah’s name in the hearing of all His people there.

<strong>Taking Delight in Suffering</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Beyond any doubt, Jesus was keenly aware of what was ahead of him.

Distress and grief I kept finding.” If only it could be avoided! But, no, as he said: “This is why I have come to this hour.” He was in full agreement with the entire process, every part of it. His opening and closing words clearly prove this, mentioning first his own glorification, then leading to the final glorifying of his Father’s name. And what a strength and comfort it must have been to hear immediately and audibly his Father’s confirmation on this, the main issue: “I both glorified it [my name] and will glorify it again.” From the beginning to the end of his ministry, Jesus was determined to pursue the course set out for him. At the start, he overcame John’s resistance to his ‘being baptized,’ and, when approaching the end, “he firmly set his face to go to Jerusalem.” In the same connections, he again had direct and wonderful evidence of his Father’s approval. He proved that his mental attitude was exactly as foretold in that same 116th Psalm: “My vows I shall pay to Jehovah, yes, in front of all his people.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972203/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 3:13-17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972203/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Luke 9:28-35,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972203/16/2" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 51;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972203/16/3" data-bid="17-4" class="b"> Ps. 116:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972203/16/4" data-bid="17-5" class="b"> 18</a>.</p>

The psalmist was overwhelmed with a feeling of gratitude, so that he concluded his beautiful psalm, saying: “To you I shall offer the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and on the name of Jehovah I shall call. My vows I shall pay to Jehovah, yes, in front of all his people, in the courtyards of the house of Jehovah, in the midst of you, O Jerusalem.

The unnamed psalmist desired to do more than offer merely a private expression of thanksgiving to his divine Rescuer. He desired to offer thanksgiving publicly by means of a sacrifice on God’s altar in the temple courtyard, calling on Jehovah’s name in the hearing of all His people there. Possibly he was the first one to recite this psalm of his own composition, thus furnishing a part of what became the Hallel (“Praise”) for the Jews on special occasions.

True to that prophetic pattern, after the approaching spectacular end of the present violent system of things thanksgiving to Jehovah will be offered up like sacrifices by the surviving remnant of His “chosen ones” and by their companions, the “great crowd,” because Jehovah has preserved them by His miraculous saving power.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101973029/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Psalm 116:17</a>.</p><p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">28.

In an ecstasy of joy and jubilation they will make the whole earth resound with their irrepressible cry, “Hallelujah!” What a pleasurable sense of being alive there will be then, especially after one has been snatched from the jaws of death!

Thus, he proved himself to be a God of loving-kindness. He also manifested his trueness by fulfilling his word of promise. Joshua, for example, reminded the Israelites: “You well know with all your hearts and with all your souls that not one word out of all the good words that Jehovah your God has spoken to you has failed.

On the basis of Jesus’ giving his life in sacrifice, peoples of all nations can have their sins forgiven and can gain an approved standing before the Most High. Truly, then, people of all nations have reason to give thanks to Jehovah for his loving-kindness and trueness in producing the seed of promise as a natural descendant of Abraham.</p>

He was the <em>real</em> one promised. <span id="page655" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="655" data-before-text="655"></span>He was no <em>shadow</em> king-priest. He was substantially the <em>true</em> one that had been prefigured. As such, he benefits not only the circumcised Jews but also all the non-Jewish nations. Hence the apostle Paul says:</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" data-rel-pid="[109]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="41"><sup>41</sup></span> “I say that Christ actually became a minister of those who are circumcised in behalf of God’s truthfulness, so as to verify the promises He made to their forefathers, and that the nations might glorify God for his mercy.

Naturally, by human birth, their “seed” would be Israelites or Jews, Hebrews. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Gen. 22:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/39/1" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> 26:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/39/2" data-bid="40-3" class="b"> 28:14</a>) Hence according to the natural order of things it was necessary for Jesus Christ to establish “God’s truthfulness” as regards those promises made to the three Hebrew patriarchs; how? By offering first to Jews the opportunity to receive the Abrahamic blessing and become the spiritual seed of Abraham. It was absolutely obligatory upon Jesus to respect the sworn oath of Jehovah God, because God had sworn with an oath that his promises to the patriarchs were truthful, and Jesus had to “verify” those promises.</p><p id="p111" data-pid="111" class="qu">43.

Just as it is written: ‘That is why I will openly acknowledge you among the nations and to your name I will make melody.’ And again he says: ‘Be glad, you nations, with his people.’ And again: ‘Praise Jehovah, all you nations, and let all the peoples praise him.’”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979803/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rom. 15:8-11</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">While Jehovah God dealt exclusively with the Israelites for many centuries, he was actually working out matters for the blessing of all mankind through the seed of Abraham, primarily Jesus Christ. On the basis of Jesus’ giving his life in sacrifice, peoples of all nations can have their sins forgiven and can gain an approved standing before the Most High. Truly, then, people of all nations have reason to give thanks to Jehovah for his loving-kindness and trueness in producing the seed of promise as a natural descendant of Abraham.</p>

<strong>“Let God Be Found True”</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> Such a God as this has inspired the writing of the Holy Scriptures. What confidence we should therefore have that these Scriptures are exclusively the truth, as distinct from all the other religious books that have been written, belonging to the religious systems of this world, ancient and modern! The very essence or substance of the written Word of God is <span id="page682" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="682" data-before-text="682"></span>truth, his Word being in full harmony with the facts and never once departing from actualities or from the successful carrying out of God’s glorious purpose. From its very beginning God’s written Word is the truth, and such truth moves on through the sixty-six Bible books to a grand climax of truth concerning God’s established kingdom for the eternal blessing of mankind.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">22. How is it true that the substance or sum of God’s Word is truth?</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> Added together, the sixty-six books of the Bible sum up to be a full, complete statement and expression of truth. That is why truth seekers love the Bible. The psalmist nicely expressed the matter when, under inspiration, he wrote in appreciation of God: “O see that I have loved your own orders. O Jehovah, according to your loving-kindness preserve me alive. The substance [or, sum] of your word is truth, and every righteous judicial decision of yours is to time indefinite.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965841/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 119:159, 160</a>; marginal reading, 1957 edition.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">23. Why could the psalmist say that God’s commandments are truth?</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> All of God’s commandments, as recorded in his written Word, are for the carrying out of the truth. They are given for the purpose of keeping the obedient ones in accord with the truth. His commandments are issued in order to move persons and things on to the realization of God’s prophecies, that thus these may come true. Sometimes persons who have got far away from God’s law in loose conduct come near to us to do us harm; but God is also near us if we lovingly and loyally keep his commandments. As the psalmist gratefully expressed the matter: “You are near, O Jehovah, and all your commandments are truth. Long ago I have known some of your reminders, for to time indefinite you have founded them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965841/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ps. 119:150-152</a>) Marvelously, those reminders and testimonies that God founded so long ago have continued till today, despite all efforts of the enemies of truth to overthrow and destroy them by destroying copies of the Bible and destroying believers in the Bible. But, says <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965841/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Psalm 117:2</a>, “the trueness of Jehovah is to time indefinite.”</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">24. How is fighting against Bible truth sure to result, and what course toward it is the better one to take?</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> To fight against the truth of the Bible means to fight against the “God of truth.” We can never win out in such a fight, but are sure to go down in defeat and death as liars. God’s truth has always prevailed and will always prevail. It is a wise reminder that the apostle Paul gives us, when he writes: “We can do nothing against the truth, but only for the truth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965841/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2 Cor. 13:8</a>) For that reason we should not, by a course contrary to God’s Word, cause the truth of God to show forth in triumph over us. To receive His blessing we should take a positive course in favor and support of God’s truth and publish it abroad to His glory and praise.</p>

<strong>How Will You Give Thanks for His Loving-kindness?</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> In this connection, have you ever thought of Jesus and the apostles as singers? They were, and they enjoyed it. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977126/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Mark 14:26</a> tells us that on their last night together on earth they sang praises. Customarily Jews sang <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977126/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalms 113 through 118</a> during the Passover meal. So it is probable that Jesus and the faithful eleven apostles concluded that meal by singing <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977126/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Psalm 118</a>, which both begins and ends: “Give thanks to Jehovah, you people, for he is good; for <em>his loving-kindness</em> is to time indefinite.”</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">19.

Is that how you view the songs based on Bible themes that you sing at the local meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses? Or do you find that during the singing you are doing other things? Or are your lips saying the words while your mind is on other matters? It is easy for this to occur. But how fine if, instead, we view these Christian songs as a means of giving thanks to Jehovah for his loving-kindness!</p>

Who wrote most of the Psalms, and how are they to be viewed?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Under inspiration, David wrote the majority of the Psalms, mostly based on his own experiences, and prefiguring the experiences of Jesus Christ, also of Christ’s followers as a class. Not only are they beautiful songs, composed of rich, sacred poetry, but they are primarily prophecies, part of ‘all the things that were written aforetime for our instruction’; and with this in mind we want to consider <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 118</a>. It is a remarkable confirmation of the fact that right now, before Armageddon, is the time to sing and rejoice “and [publicly] declare the works of Jehovah” on account of salvation already accomplished on our behalf.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ps. 118:17</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">18. What is the theme of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Psalm 118</a> and how does it tie in with <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Revelation 12:10</a>?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> The oft-recurring theme of this psalm is found in the expression: “For his loving-kindness endureth for ever.” This forms the basis for the opening call of the psalm: “Oh give thanks unto Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ps. 118:1</a>, <em>AS</em>) It is therefore a psalm, or song, of thanksgiving, not to any creature, not even David himself who was so mightily used to subdue Israel’s enemies, but to Jehovah, Israel’s real mighty Fighter and Savior. This idea finds expression time and again throughout the psalm, as David tells how his numerous enemies, “all nations,” tried to overwhelm him and the little kingdom of Israel, as he aptly says at one place, “they compassed me about like bees.” He then adds: “But Jehovah helped me,” and this leads him to the particular expression that arrests our attention: “Jehovah is my strength [as a fighter] and song; and he is become my salvation.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ps. 118:10-14</a>, <em>AS</em>) A cry corresponding exactly to that at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Revelation 12:10</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">19. Tied in with what particular events did David prosper as a fighter?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> Notice, too, corresponding with the argument already presented, that David did not attain to his very strong position of superiority over all his enemies by just one smashing victory, foreshadowing Armageddon, but it was by a series of victories. This is similar to what is said of Christ Jesus, the Greater David: “He went forth conquering and to complete his conquest.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Rev. 6:2</a>, <em>NW</em>) Neither did David wait till the final victory before starting to sing. The record shows that the key to the situation regarding David’s prosperity as Israel’s king is pinpointed to the time when he captured the hill of Zion and there established his throne, and later brought up the ark, the center of true worship for Israel. (See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">2 Samuel, chapters 5 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 6</a>.) From then on he prospered, while still fighting, and at the same time singing that Jehovah “is become my salvation”. As the record says: “And David waxed greater and greater; for Jehovah, the God of hosts, was with him,” until “Jehovah had given him rest from all his enemies round about”.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">2 Sam. 5:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/35/1" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> 7:1</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">20. On the basis of these events, how does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Psalm 118</a> reveal its prophetic significance for our own day?</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> It is from this point of time, from the time of the secure establishment of Zion, after a period of distress, that <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Psalm 118</a> is true, both in David’s experience and in what was foreshadowed thereby. The sure guide in this psalm, fixing this point of time in the great fulfillment in our own day, is found in the expression: “The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Ps. 118:22</a>, <em>AS</em>) Linking this with <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Isaiah 28:16</a> and; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:6, 7</a>, <em>The Watchtower</em> as of October 1, 1951, has given detailed proof that the laying of the cornerstone in Zion in the complete fulfillment took place A. D. 1918, when Christ was presented as King, corresponding to the miniature fulfillment at the first advent. <span id="page183" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="183" data-before-text="183"></span>(See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Matthew 21:4-9</a>, <em>NW</em>.) That was indeed a very special period of time, or “day”. In contrast with a 24-hour day, which appears to follow its predecessor as a matter of course, this prophetic day was specially made by Jehovah, and is a cause for great rejoicing and singing, as it says: “This is the day which Jehovah hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Ps. 118:24</a>, <em>AS</em>) Observe, too, how David not only speaks for himself, as when he says, “Jehovah is <em>my</em> strength and song,” but includes all true Israelites sharing with him, as when he next says: “The voice of rejoicing [singing] and salvation is in the tents of the righteous.” So now, let us all rejoice and sing aloud of Jehovah’s salvation wrought in Zion in this, his own day.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Ps. 118:14, 15</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p>

Otherwise he would not have said: “I find, then, this law in my case: that when I wish to do what is right, what is bad is present with me. I really delight in the law of God according to the man I am within, but I behold in my members another law warring against the law of my mind and leading me captive to sin’s law that is in my members.” So down to the day of his death this great Christian warrior admitted that it was necessary to put <span id="page531" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="531" data-before-text="531"></span>up a hard fight. “I browbeat my body and lead it as a slave, that, after I have preached to others, I myself should not become disapproved somehow.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964643/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Rom. 7:21-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964643/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 9:27</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> As in the apostle Paul’s case, so in ours, if we fail to browbeat the sinful tendencies of the fallen fleshly body and lead it as a slave to the dictates of a new personality, if we fail to display the fruitage of Jehovah’s spirit, we too will be disapproved by Jehovah, and that would be most tragic.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">20, 21.

Shortly before Jesus was taken captive that last night he warned his disciples of the terrible consequence that would come upon his anointed followers if they were disapproved because of not bearing the fruitage of Jehovah’s spirit. “I am the true vine,” said Jesus, “and my Father is the cultivator. Every branch in me not bearing fruit he takes away, and every one bearing fruit he cleans, that it may bear more fruit. . . . Just as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it remains in the vine, in the same way neither can you, unless you remain in union with me. . . . If anyone does not remain in union with me, he is cast out as a branch and is dried up; and men gather those branches up and pitch them into the fire and they are burned.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964643/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">John 15:1-6</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> Jehovah is a productive cultivator, and he will see to it that everyone in his lush theocratic organization produces and displays the pleasant fruitage of His spirit. Make no mistake about it, if you fail to produce the fruitage of a Christian personality you will have no place in the theocratic society of Jehovah’s Christian witnesses!

The sure guide in this psalm, fixing this point of time in the great fulfillment in our own day, is found in the expression: “The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Ps. 118:22</a>, <em>AS</em>) Linking this with <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Isaiah 28:16</a> and; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:6, 7</a>, <em>The Watchtower</em> as of October 1, 1951, has given detailed proof that the laying of the cornerstone in Zion in the complete fulfillment took place A. D. 1918, when Christ was presented as King, corresponding to the miniature fulfillment at the first advent. <span id="page183" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="183" data-before-text="183"></span>(See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Matthew 21:4-9</a>, <em>NW</em>.) That was indeed a very special period of time, or “day”. In contrast with a 24-hour day, which appears to follow its predecessor as a matter of course, this prophetic day was specially made by Jehovah, and is a cause for great rejoicing and singing, as it says: “This is the day which Jehovah hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Ps. 118:24</a>, <em>AS</em>) Observe, too, how David not only speaks for himself, as when he says, “Jehovah is <em>my</em> strength and song,” but includes all true Israelites sharing with him, as when he next says: “The voice of rejoicing [singing] and salvation is in the tents of the righteous.” So now, let us all rejoice and sing aloud of Jehovah’s salvation wrought in Zion in this, his own day.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Ps. 118:14, 15</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">21.

Not only so, but we are filled with the fighting spirit of determination to “observe the commandments of God” in “the work of bearing witness to Jesus”, “even despite the danger of death.” We unselfishly dedicate and bind ourselves to this course of action. See how beautifully this is expressed: “Jehovah is God, and he hath given us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Rev. 12:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/43/1" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> 17</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Ps. 118:27</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">22.

This is referred to in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Psalm 118 verse 18</a>: “Jehovah hath chastened me sore; but he hath not given me over unto death.” But now turn to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Isaiah, chapter 12</a>, <em>AS,</em> and see how this short prophecy in its every word abundantly confirms the main points of our study. As often explained in <em>The Watchtower,</em> Jehovah’s anger with his people in the early part of “that day” was due to their failure to live up to the commission of being singing fighters. But God, in his loving-kindness, remedied the situation and comforted his people by bringing salvation to Zion. “For a splendid thing hath he done,—well known is this in all the earth.” [<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Isa. 12:5</a>, <em>Ro</em>] So again the refrain comes in: “For Jehovah, even Jehovah, is my strength and song; and he is become my salvation. Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.” Yes, as Jesus indicated in his conversation with the Samaritan woman at a certain literal well, the life-giving water of truth can now be freely and joyfully drawn for all thirsting ones who desire to render sacred service in the spirit of true worship. A mighty response is therefore now rising from all quarters in response to the ringing command: “Cry aloud and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion; for great in the midst of thee is the Holy One of Israel.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Isa. 12:2, 3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/48/1" data-bid="49-2" class="b"> 6</a>, <em>AS;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">John 4:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/49/1" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> 23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/49/2" data-bid="50-3" class="b"> Rev. 22:17</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">23. Where in Scripture is Jehovah referred to as singing, and for what reason and with what encouragement to us?</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> Finally, you remember we mentioned early herein about the one instance in Scripture where Jehovah himself is referred to as singing. This is found at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Zephaniah 3:14-17</a> (<em>AS</em>). First, for our encouragement as singers, comes the command to ‘sing and shout, and to be glad and rejoice with all the heart’. Why? Because “Jehovah hath taken away [“set aside,” <em>Ro</em>] thy [adverse] judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy [the Babylonish and Pharaohlike oppressors]: the King of Israel, even Jehovah, is in the midst of thee; thou shalt not fear evil [“calamity,” <span id="page184" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="184" data-before-text="184"></span><em>Ro</em>] any more.” Then, for our encouragement as fighters, comes the thrilling command: “In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not; O Zion, let not thy hands be slack. Jehovah thy God is in the midst of thee, a mighty one who will save [from the enemy]; he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love; he will joy over thee with singing.” On what more stirring and exalted note could we conclude this study?—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Psalm 132:13-18</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p>

Those desiring salvation must make for God’s organization, and find entrance into it and remain there permanently. It is a real city of refuge. The multitudes must come in through the gates; so sing loudly, clearly and harmoniously that all may know there is a strong city offering salvation, and it is our city. It is Jehovah’s! To all countries the song must go: “Wherefore glorify ye Jehovah in the east, even the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel, in the isles of the sea.

A purpose sustained thou wilt guard, saying, Prosper! Prosper! because in thee hath he been led to trust. Trust ye in Yahweh unto futurity,—for in Yah Yahweh is a rock of ages.” (<em>Ro</em>) The gates must be unlocked, so that the nation can march in. The faithful anointed remnant in 1919 were awaiting entrance into the newly established city, Zion. “Thou wilt arise, and have mercy upon Zion; . . . yea, the set time is come. . . . For Jehovah hath built up Zion; he hath appeared in his glory.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952727/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ps. 102:13-16</a>, <em>AS</em>) They prayed, “Jehovah hath chastened me sore; but he hath not given me over unto death. Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will enter into them, I will give thanks unto Jehovah. This is the gate of Jehovah; the righteous shall enter into it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952727/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ps. 118:18-20</a>, <em>AS</em>) As a result Zion received many more children. It is exactly as foretold. “Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a manchild. Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? shall a nation be brought forth at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952727/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Isa. 66:7, 8</a>, <em>AS</em>) The King is brought forth as the new Ruler in 1914 by the mother organization, Zion, and after great trials and tribulations (1917-1918) Zion brings forth the rest of her royal children, the remnant of the Kingdom class. Since then, too, hundreds of thousands of persons of good will have been brought into association with the members of the remnant class. Just how many more thousands of these may be added to the ranks before the battle of Armageddon we do not know. This class will be carried through Armageddon with the faithful remnant when Jehovah rises up and fights for his people as he did in the days of old. The gates are now opened wide for the prisoners’ return. In Zion they will be fed, mothered and taught Jehovah’s commands and will learn to know him truly.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">24.

There is no need for us to doubt or get disturbed as to whether certain promises will come to fulfillment, for they will. Jehovah is as good as his name.

That could come about only by his being resurrected to life again. Jesus himself made such a connection. He gave a parable in which cultivators mistreated those whom the owner sent to them, just as the Israelites mistreated the prophets whom God sent to them. Finally, in the illustration, the owner sent his beloved son and heir. Was the son accepted? Far from it. The <span id="page10" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>cultivators went to the extreme of putting him to death.

And for what purpose? Peter answers: “You are ‘a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for special possession, that you should declare abroad the excellencies’ of the one that called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990121/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:4-10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990121/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Isa. 28:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990121/21/2" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> Ps. 118:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990121/21/3" data-bid="22-4" class="b"> Isa. 8:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990121/21/4" data-bid="22-5" class="b"> Ex. 19:5, 6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990121/21/5" data-bid="22-6" class="b"> Isa. 43:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990121/21/6" data-bid="22-7" class="b"> Hos. 1:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990121/21/7" data-bid="22-8" class="b"> 2:23</a>) It is to this “royal priesthood,” the general priesthood comprising the entire holy nation of God, that Peter holds forth the Kingdom promise of “an incorruptible and undefiled and unfading inheritance,” “the unfadable crown of glory,” “everlasting glory in union with Christ.” Thus, these are greatly encouraged to go on rejoicing that they may “rejoice and be overjoyed also during the revelation of his glory.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990121/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990121/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 5:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990121/22/2" data-bid="23-3" class="b"> 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990121/22/3" data-bid="23-4" class="b"> 4:13</a>.</p>

The fruitage that Jehovah expects from such cultivators is faith in his Son, the true Messiah. For their failing to provide such fruitage, Jesus warns: “Did you never read in the Scriptures [at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101991108/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 118:22, 23</a>], ‘The stone that the builders rejected is the one that has become the chief cornerstone. From Jehovah this has come to be, and it is marvelous in our eyes’? This is why I say to you, The kingdom of God will be taken from you and be given to a nation producing its fruits. Also, the person falling upon this stone will be shattered. As for anyone upon whom it falls, it will pulverize him.”</p>

<strong>Cormorant</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This bird appears only in the list of unclean birds under the Mosaic law, a list that prohibits the eating of birds most of which basically are birds of prey and carrion eaters, although there appear to be exceptions, such as the hoopoe and the swan.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011022/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 19:8</a>) The translators of the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> understood the bird to be the <em>ka·ta·raʹktes,</em> the Greek name of a bird that dives into the water and swims in pursuit of fish, while the Latin <em>Vulgate</em> uses <em>mergulus</em> (the “diver”) to indicate the bird. It, therefore seems evident that some fish-eating, diving bird is represented by the Hebrew term, and most translations consider the cormorant to be the most likely type, since it is quite common in Palestine, particularly along the Mediterranean coast and also in certain inland <span id="page382" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="382" data-before-text="382"></span>waters such as the Sea of Galilee. A smaller “pygmy cormorant,” though not so frequent, is to be found along lakes and rivers.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The cormorant is of the pelican family and somewhat resembles a duck. Usually long bodied and dark colored, the cormorant is swift and agile in the water, swimming under water mainly by use of its webbed feet but also at times employing its relatively long wings in darting after its prey. Its sharp, hooked beak makes it a splendid fisher, and from ancient times cormorants have been trained by fishermen in the Orient and parts of India to catch fish for their owners, a band being placed fairly loosely around the bird’s throat to prevent it from swallowing anything but very small fish. One observer describes the bird as seen sitting on a tree in the area where the Jordan River empties into the Dead Sea and satisfying its voracious appetite by swooping down into the water to catch fish that are dazed by being carried into the salty sea.</p>

At Pentecost of 33 C.E.—just ten days after Jesus had ascended to heaven and opened the way for others to follow him in due time—Jehovah indicated his selection of these members through the pouring out of holy spirit. Their receiving of the spirit on that occasion bore witness to them that they were now God’s spiritual sons and heirs of the kingdom with Christ.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969241/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 2:1-4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969241/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 16-21,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969241/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969241/10/3" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> Rom. 8:16, 17</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">However, the membership of the true church did not remain all Jewish.

It is his own perfect human life given as a ransom that makes possible this divine arrangement.

We may be sure that there is no contradiction.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>“UPON THIS ROCK I WILL BUILD MY CHURCH”</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Peter had just acknowledged Jesus to be the Christ (or, the Messiah), the Son of the living God. Jesus then said: “I say to thee: That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969241/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matt. 16:18</a>, <em>Dy</em>) Some understand these words to mean that Jesus’ church is built on Peter as the foundation. This is the official position of the Roman Catholic Church. But it is of interest to note that Archbishop Kenrick, in the book <em>An Inside View of the Vatican Council</em> (1870), shows that of at least eighty-six early church “fathers,” only seventeen understood Jesus’ reference to the “rock” as applying to Peter. Were you aware of this?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Consider, for example, the view of Augustine (354-430 C.E.), usually referred to as “Saint Augustine.” Though at one time he viewed Peter as the “rock,” in later life Augustine restated his position, saying in his <em>Retractationes:</em> “I have since frequently explained the words of our Lord: ‘Thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my Church,’ to the effect that they should be understood as referring to him whom Peter confessed when he said: <span id="page199" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="199" data-before-text="199"></span>‘Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God,’ . . . For what was said to [Peter] was not ‘Thou art the rock,’ but ‘Thou art Peter.’ But the rock was Christ.”</p>

It is a remarkable confirmation of the fact that right now, before Armageddon, is the time to sing and rejoice “and [publicly] declare the works of Jehovah” on account of salvation already accomplished on our behalf.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ps. 118:17</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">18.

This idea finds expression time and again throughout the psalm, as David tells how his numerous enemies, “all nations,” tried to overwhelm him and the little kingdom of Israel, as he aptly says at one place, “they compassed me about like bees.” He then adds: “But Jehovah helped me,” and this leads him to the particular expression that arrests our attention: “Jehovah is my strength [as a fighter] and song; and he is become my salvation.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ps. 118:10-14</a>, <em>AS</em>) A cry corresponding exactly to that at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Revelation 12:10</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">19.

This is similar to what is said of Christ Jesus, the Greater David: “He went forth conquering and to complete his conquest.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Rev. 6:2</a>, <em>NW</em>) Neither did David wait till the final victory before starting to sing. The record shows that the key to the situation regarding David’s prosperity as Israel’s king is pinpointed to the time when he captured the hill of Zion and there established his throne, and later brought up the ark, the center of true worship for Israel. (See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">2 Samuel, chapters 5 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 6</a>.) From then on he prospered, while still fighting, and at the same time singing that Jehovah “is become my salvation”. As the record says: “And David waxed greater and greater; for Jehovah, the God of hosts, was with him,” until “Jehovah had given him rest from all his enemies round about”.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">2 Sam. 5:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/35/1" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> 7:1</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">20.

That was indeed a very special period of time, or “day”. In contrast with a 24-hour day, which appears to follow its predecessor as a matter of course, this prophetic day was specially made by Jehovah, and is a cause for great rejoicing and singing, as it says: “This is the day which Jehovah hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Ps. 118:24</a>, <em>AS</em>) Observe, too, how David not only speaks for himself, as when he says, “Jehovah is <em>my</em> strength and song,” but includes all true Israelites sharing with him, as when he next says: “The voice of rejoicing [singing] and salvation is in the tents of the righteous.” So now, let us all rejoice and sing aloud of Jehovah’s salvation wrought in Zion in this, his own day.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953206/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Ps. 118:14, 15</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p>

Of those religious rulers who filled the part prefigured by the “drunkards of Ephraim” it is recorded: “When [John] caught sight of many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the baptism he said to them: ‘You offspring of vipers, who has shown you how to flee from the coming wrath? So then produce fruit that befits repentance.’” “Then Herod [the religio-political ruler], seeing he had been outwitted by the astrologers, fell into a great rage, and he sent out and had all the boys in Bethlehem and in all its districts killed, from two years of age and under, according to the time that he had carefully ascertained from the astrologers.” Said Jesus: “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you resemble whitewashed graves, which outwardly indeed appear beautiful but inside are full of dead men’s bones and of every kind of uncleanness. In that way you also, outwardly indeed, appear righteous to men, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951725/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 3:7, 8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951725/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951725/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 23:27, 28</a>; see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951725/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 3:11, 12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951725/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 12:33, 34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951725/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 23:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951725/8/3" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> 13,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951725/8/4" data-bid="9-5" class="b"> 25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951725/8/5" data-bid="9-6" class="b"> John 12:9-11</a>, <em>NW</em>) The foregoing shows these rulers to be just as reprehensible as the typical “drunkards” of old time.

It related to the planting of a vineyard. Those who were left in charge went to beating the slaves of the owner, who were sent to get some of the fruit, and they finally killed the son and heir of the owner, concluding that now the vineyard would be theirs. Jesus then said, ‘What will the owner therefore do?’ and the answer is given: “Because they are evil, he will bring an evil destruction upon them and will let out the vineyard for hire to other cultivators, who will render him the fruits when they become due.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951725/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 21:41</a>, <em>NW</em>) Following this reply Jesus then quoted from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951725/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 118:22,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951725/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Isaiah 8:14 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951725/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> Daniel 2:34</a>, and applied these to himself as the “son” and “heir” and showed that the rulers of Israel were the “cultivators” and murderers.</p>

The foundation of that second temple had already been laid, and so this “stone” would serve as a headstone.

<strong>Sharing in the Prosperity of God’s Nation</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> In Christendom there is no stable, guaranteed prosperity. In so-called heathendom there is none either. Is there, then, no prosperity anywhere on earth to prove that Jehovah God is the source and creator of it? There indeed is. Where? There where it should reasonably be found—among the people who bear his name, Jehovah’s witnesses. That explains the reason for their happiness, a happiness unequaled anywhere in this old world, a happiness that no turns for still worse or even the worst in this old world can dampen or wreck. Their happiness is not based on any material prosperity or any armed <span id="page722" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="722" data-before-text="722"></span>peace of this world. It is not dependent on having an abundance of the things of this world, such uncertain, vanishing things. It is a spiritual prosperity, a real, practical well-being that has transformed their lives and made them the happiest mortals on earth. It will never collapse. It is backed and guaranteed by the greatest and the only durable government in the universe, Jehovah’s kingdom established in the heavens in the year 1914 and with his Son Jesus Christ at his side.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 5.

In answering prayer he favors, not Christendom, but only his true name people. Their flourishing condition at this crucial time is an answer to their prayer. He has heard their prayer because it was offered with a right motive and was in harmony with his will expressed in the prophecies of his Word. Almost thirty years ago to the day, namely, Friday, September 8, 1922, at the international assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in Cedar Point, Ohio, the presence of Jehovah’s Day was announced and the prophetic prayer as contained at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952885/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 118:24, 25</a>, was shown to be appropriate now: “This is the day which Jehovah hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it. Save now, we beseech thee, O Jehovah: O Jehovah, we beseech thee, send now prosperity.” (<em>AS</em>) Today, after three decades, we can measure the amount of prosperity he has sent in this his day. Back there we were getting started on the road to postwar prosperity. Today the prosperity bestowed upon us is unparalleled in Christian history.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 6. In what poverty did the close of World War I find the remnant?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> The close of World War I in November of 1918 found the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses in poor condition. The vicious persecution by our religious enemies, using the military sword of the total state, had rendered them so. Their own fears and lack of understanding had helped to make it so. Throughout the world they were quite disorganized. Practical theocratic government was not in force among them. A number of their main officials were in literal prison for the endeavors of these to be faithful to God’s cause. Because of world opposition their public voice for the kingdom of God was quite muffled. They were quite uncertain as to what God’s further will was for them on the earth in the postwar period. Only some of them were in literal prisons in the world, but all of them were in a spiritual prison in the Devil’s world system, which the Bible calls “Babylon”. Here they felt the restrictions placed upon their free conscientious worship of the living and true God and upon their service of his kingdom. Here they felt the expression of God’s displeasure with them because of sins and worldly uncleanness of which they were not fully aware. Before God they were in a condition which <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952885/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 11:8, 9</a> likens to dead bodies of God’s witnesses lying exposed in the unclean city three and a half days.

Little does it realize the state of mind and the state of the organization back there. Ah, but God is so merciful, so full of loving-kindness, toward those whose hearts are sincere toward him and striving to cling to him with an unbreakable affection! Though angry and displeased with them so as to let them be thrown down, Jehovah was not willing to destroy them, which would have suited our enemies very much.

So he opened their blind eyes to see that he had promised them deliverance in his Word and that they were to enter upon a great work to be blessed with astonishing prosperity. The loyal and zealous were willing to serve God on earth to the finish, and oh how their hearts responded to this wondrous outlook portrayed in his prophetic Word! If only he would get them out of this restrained condition and open the way to liberty and free, fearless worship of him, how gladly they would share in his further work till its glorious climax! Every willing heart poured out gratitude to God for the fresh hope! How well the psalmist, under similar circumstances, expressed their thankfulness, their disposition to praise and their yearning in these touching words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952885/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 106:1-5</a>:</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980124/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ex. 12:38</a>) But the command to celebrate the festival of booths was not directed to the “vast mixed company” but was given to Israel. Neither was the Promised Land given to the “vast mixed company” to cultivate, but was divided up among the 12 non-Levitical tribes of Israel, and the law of the Jubilee restoration of land applied to the Israelites. So the festival of ingathering would be specially for the Israelites. Graciously the “alien resident” was allowed to join in. During the celebration in the days of Jesus Christ, the non-Jews, or Gentiles, were limited to the Courtyard of the Gentiles, the Stone Barrier and the Outer Courtyard dividing them off from the Courtyard of Israel. Their place was on the lowest level of the entire structure of Herod’s temple.</p>

The Jews in general did not know that he had been born in Bethlehem. Hence John tells us: “Others were saying: ‘This is the Christ.’ But some were saying: ‘The Christ is not actually coming out of Galilee, is he? Has not the Scripture said that the Christ is coming from the offspring of David, and from Bethlehem the village where David used to be?’ Therefore a division over him developed among the crowd.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962682/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">John 7:41-43</a>) However, when Jesus made his triumphal ride into Jerusalem in the spring of A.D. 33, there were many Jews who were ready to hail him as God’s promised King, the Son of King David of Bethlehem. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962682/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">John 12:12-15</a> tells us:</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" data-rel-pid="[75]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="31"><sup>31</sup></span> “The next day the great crowd that had come to the festival, on hearing that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, took the branches of palm trees and went out to meet him.

In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962682/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Revelation 3:7</a> Jesus himself says: “These are the things he says who is holy, who is true, who has the key of David.” In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962682/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Revelation 5:5</a> an elderly person says of Jesus: “Look!

I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright morning star.” Although Jesus on earth spoke of himself as “Jesus the Nazarene,” he had really been born in King David’s native town of Bethlehem but had merely been brought up in Nazareth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962682/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">John 18:5-7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962682/31/1" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 19:19</a>) There Joseph his caretaker came to be looked on as his father.

(b) How does Peter’s use of the key word, together with uses of it elsewhere, argue it?</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" data-rel-pid="[77]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="33"><sup>33</sup></span> The one who was the Word or Logos spent only a brief time among men, less than thirty-five years from the time of his conception in the womb of the Jewish virgin who descended from King David. As <em>An American Translation</em> renders <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962682/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">John 1:14</a>: “So the Word became flesh and blood and lived for a while among us.” Clergymen who believe in an incarnation and a God-Man call notice to the fact that the Greek verb translated “lived for a while” has its root in the word meaning “tent” or “tabernacle.” In fact, that is the way that Dr. Robert Young renders the expression, translating it: “And the Word became flesh, and did tabernacle among us.” Since campers dwell in a tent, the clergymen argue that Jesus was still a spirit person and was merely tabernacling in a fleshly body and so was an incarnation, a God-Man. However, the apostle Peter used a like expression about himself, saying: “I <span id="page560" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="560" data-before-text="560"></span>think it meet as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance: being assured that the laying away of this my tabernacle is at hand.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962682/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">2 Pet. 1:13, 14</a>, <em>Dy</em>) Certainly by such words Peter did not mean he himself was an incarnation. Peter meant he was merely going to reside for a while longer on earth as a fleshly creature.</p>

<strong>Sharing in the Prosperity of God’s Nation</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> In Christendom there is no stable, guaranteed prosperity. In so-called heathendom there is none either. Is there, then, no prosperity anywhere on earth to prove that Jehovah God is the source and creator of it? There indeed is. Where? There where it should reasonably be found—among the people who bear his name, Jehovah’s witnesses. That explains the reason for their happiness, a happiness unequaled anywhere in this old world, a happiness that no turns for still worse or even the worst in this old world can dampen or wreck. Their happiness is not based on any material prosperity or any armed <span id="page722" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="722" data-before-text="722"></span>peace of this world. It is not dependent on having an abundance of the things of this world, such uncertain, vanishing things. It is a spiritual prosperity, a real, practical well-being that has transformed their lives and made them the happiest mortals on earth. It will never collapse. It is backed and guaranteed by the greatest and the only durable government in the universe, Jehovah’s kingdom established in the heavens in the year 1914 and with his Son Jesus Christ at his side.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 5. To whose prayers, and since when, is this an answer?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> God answers prayer. In answering prayer he favors, not Christendom, but only his true name people. Their flourishing condition at this crucial time is an answer to their prayer. He has heard their prayer because it was offered with a right motive and was in harmony with his will expressed in the prophecies of his Word. Almost thirty years ago to the day, namely, Friday, September 8, 1922, at the international assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in Cedar Point, Ohio, the presence of Jehovah’s Day was announced and the prophetic prayer as contained at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952885/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 118:24, 25</a>, was shown to be appropriate now: “This is the day which Jehovah hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it. Save now, we beseech thee, O Jehovah: O Jehovah, we beseech thee, send now prosperity.” (<em>AS</em>) Today, after three decades, we can measure the amount of prosperity he has sent in this his day. Back there we were getting started on the road to postwar prosperity. Today the prosperity bestowed upon us is unparalleled in Christian history.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 6. In what poverty did the close of World War I find the remnant?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> The close of World War I in November of 1918 found the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses in poor condition. The vicious persecution by our religious enemies, using the military sword of the total state, had rendered them so. Their own fears and lack of understanding had helped to make it so. Throughout the world they were quite disorganized. Practical theocratic government was not in force among them. A number of their main officials were in literal prison for the endeavors of these to be faithful to God’s cause. Because of world opposition their public voice for the kingdom of God was quite muffled. They were quite uncertain as to what God’s further will was for them on the earth in the postwar period. Only some of them were in literal prisons in the world, but all of them were in a spiritual prison in the Devil’s world system, which the Bible calls “Babylon”. Here they felt the restrictions placed upon their free conscientious worship of the living and true God and upon their service of his kingdom. Here they felt the expression of God’s displeasure with them because of sins and worldly uncleanness of which they were not fully aware. Before God they were in a condition which <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952885/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 11:8, 9</a> likens to dead bodies of God’s witnesses lying exposed in the unclean city three and a half days. What poverty!</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 7, 8. How did Jehovah show them his loving-kindness, and who has well expressed their yearning and gratitude, and in what words?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> A young generation has grown up since then. Little does it realize the state of mind and the state of the organization back there. Ah, but God is so merciful, so full of loving-kindness, toward those whose hearts are sincere toward him and striving to cling to him with an unbreakable affection! Though angry and displeased with them so as to let them be thrown down, Jehovah was not willing to destroy them, which would have suited our enemies very much. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952885/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:8, 9</a>, <em>NW</em>) For his own name’s sake and in the abundance of his mercy he had other purposes for the remnant of his anointed consecrated <span id="page723" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="723" data-before-text="723"></span>ones. So he opened their blind eyes to see that he had promised them deliverance in his Word and that they were to enter upon a great work to be blessed with astonishing prosperity. The loyal and zealous were willing to serve God on earth to the finish, and oh how their hearts responded to this wondrous outlook portrayed in his prophetic Word! If only he would get them out of this restrained condition and open the way to liberty and free, fearless worship of him, how gladly they would share in his further work till its glorious climax! Every willing heart poured out gratitude to God for the fresh hope! How well the psalmist, under similar circumstances, expressed their thankfulness, their disposition to praise and their yearning in these touching words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952885/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 106:1-5</a>:</p>

<strong>For What “Sign” Are Christians Looking?</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Since Christ was to be invisible to human eyes at the time of his presence in Kingdom power from 1914 C.E. onward, he kindly gave his disciples a “sign” by <span id="page399" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="399" data-before-text="399"></span>which they could know and understand when that time had come. He foretold this “sign” just after he had predicted the destruction of the temple at Jerusalem. The occasion of his describing the “sign” came shortly after he had said to the Jewish religious leaders who rejected him: “Look! Your house is abandoned to you. For I say to you, You will by no means see me from henceforth until you say, ‘Blessed is he that comes in Jehovah’s name!’”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974483/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 23:38, 39</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">This strong statement of Jesus indicated that he was going away, and that there would be those who would take up the prophetic words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974483/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 118:26</a> and say: “Blessed be the One coming in the name of Jehovah.” But it would not be at that material temple in Jerusalem that these words would be spoken. This was made clear by Jesus’ next words. The account reads: “Departing now, Jesus was on his way from the temple, but his disciples approached to show him the buildings of the temple. In response he said to them: ‘Do you not behold all these things? Truly I say to you, By no means will a stone be left here upon a stone and not be thrown down.’”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974483/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matt. 24:1, 2</a>.</p>

The Lion that is of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has conquered.” Finally, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962682/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Revelation 22:16</a>, we read: “I, Jesus, sent my angel to bear witness to you people of these things for the congregations. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright morning star.” Although Jesus on earth spoke of himself as “Jesus the Nazarene,” he had really been born in King David’s native town of Bethlehem but had merely been brought up in Nazareth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962682/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">John 18:5-7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962682/31/1" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 19:19</a>) There Joseph his caretaker came to be looked on as his father. His forefather David had an earthly kingdom; but Jesus’ heavenly kingdom is something grander and more beneficial to all mankind.</p><p id="p77" data-pid="77" class="qu">33, 34. (a) How do the clergymen argue that the wording of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962682/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">John 1:14</a> implies an incarnation of the Word? (b) How does Peter’s use of the key word, together with uses of it elsewhere, argue it?</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" data-rel-pid="[77]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="33"><sup>33</sup></span> The one who was the Word or Logos spent only a brief time among men, less than thirty-five years from the time of his conception in the womb of the Jewish virgin who descended from King David. As <em>An American Translation</em> renders <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962682/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">John 1:14</a>: “So the Word became flesh and blood and lived for a while among us.” Clergymen who believe in an incarnation and a God-Man call notice to the fact that the Greek verb translated “lived for a while” has its root in the word meaning “tent” or “tabernacle.” In fact, that is the way that Dr. Robert Young renders the expression, translating it: “And the Word became flesh, and did tabernacle among us.” Since campers dwell in a tent, the clergymen argue that Jesus was still a spirit person and was merely tabernacling in a fleshly body and so was an incarnation, a God-Man. However, the apostle Peter used a like expression about himself, saying: “I <span id="page560" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="560" data-before-text="560"></span>think it meet as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance: being assured that the laying away of this my tabernacle is at hand.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962682/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">2 Pet. 1:13, 14</a>, <em>Dy</em>) Certainly by such words Peter did not mean he himself was an incarnation. Peter meant he was merely going to reside for a while longer on earth as a fleshly creature.</p>

<strong>Triumphal Procession</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>Other Processions.</strong> The Bible also refers to other processions, occasions when throngs moved along together in celebration of outstanding events. David described Jehovah’s victorious procession from Sinai to the holy temple site in Jerusalem​—war chariots of God, captives, singers and musicians, and congregated throngs blessing the Holy One of Israel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004479/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps 68:17, 18,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004479/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 24-26</a>) A procession was included in the inaugural celebration at the time of completion of the rebuilding of Jerusalem’s walls in the days of Nehemiah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004479/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ne 12:31</a>) And a “festival procession” is referred to in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004479/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 118:27</a>, evidently in connection with the annual Festival of Booths.</p>

<strong>Jehovah—The Supreme Example of Goodness</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> A similar expression of praise regarding Jehovah’s goodness appears in a number of psalms. Among them is <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002043/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Psalm 118</a>, sung by Israelite households to conclude the Passover observance. That psalm begins and ends with the words: “Give thanks to Jehovah, you people, for he is good; for his loving-kindness is to time indefinite.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002043/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Psalm 118:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002043/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 29</a>) These may well have been the last words of praise that Jesus Christ sang with his faithful apostles on the night before his death in 33 C.E.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002043/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matthew 26:30</a>.</p>

<strong>How Will You Give Thanks for His Loving-kindness?</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> In this connection, have you ever thought of Jesus and the apostles as singers? They were, and they enjoyed it. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977126/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Mark 14:26</a> tells us that on their last night together on earth they sang praises. Customarily Jews sang <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977126/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalms 113 through 118</a> during the Passover meal. So it is probable that Jesus and the faithful eleven apostles concluded that meal by singing <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977126/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Psalm 118</a>, which both begins and ends: “Give thanks to Jehovah, you people, for he is good; for <em>his loving-kindness</em> is to time indefinite.”</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">19. What should our attitude be toward congregational singing?

Is that how you view the songs based on Bible themes that you sing at the local meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses? Or do you find that during the singing you are doing other things? Or are your lips saying the words while your mind is on other matters? It is easy for this to occur. But how fine if, instead, we view these Christian songs as a means of giving thanks to Jehovah for his loving-kindness!</p>
