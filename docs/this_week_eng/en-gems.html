<strong>Castle</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Shushan the castle,” some 360 km (225 mi) E of Babylon, was a part-time residence of the Persian king. Here Nehemiah worked as a royal cupbearer before leaving for Jerusalem. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000904/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ne 1:1</a>) Here also was the setting of one of Daniel’s visions.

<strong>Nehemiah, Book of</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>Time Covered and Time of Writing.</strong> The month of Chislev (November-December) of a certain 20th year is the reference point with which the historical narrative begins. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003213/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ne 1:1</a>) As is evident from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003213/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Nehemiah 2:1</a>, this 20th year must be that of Artaxerxes’ reign. Obviously, the 20th year <span id="page488" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="488" data-before-text="488"></span>in this case is not reckoned as starting in Nisan (March-April), for Chislev of the 20th year could not then precede Nisan (mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003213/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ne 2:1</a>) of the same 20th year. So it may be that Nehemiah used his own count of time, reckoning the lunar year as beginning with Tishri (September-October), which month Jews today recognize as the beginning of their civil year. Another possibility is that the reign of the king was reckoned from the actual date that the monarch ascended the throne. This could be so even though the Babylonian scribes continued to reckon the years of the Persian king’s reign on their customary basis of a Nisan-to-Nisan count, as their cuneiform tablets show they did.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Reliable historical evidence and the fulfillment of Bible prophecy point to 455 B.C.E. as the year in which Nisan of the 20th year of Artaxerxes’ reign fell. (See <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003213/0">PERSIA, PERSIANS</a> [The Reigns of Xerxes and of Artaxerxes].) Accordingly, the Chislev preceding Nisan of that 20th year would fall in 456 B.C.E., and the 32nd year of Artaxerxes’ reign (the last date mentioned in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003213/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Nehemiah [13:6</a>]) would include part of 443 B.C.E. Therefore, the book of Nehemiah covers a period from Chislev of 456 B.C.E. until sometime after 443 B.C.E.</p>

<strong>Seventy Weeks</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">However, as evidence indicating that Nehemiah may have used a fall-to-fall year in referring to certain events, we can compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003915/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Nehemiah 1:1-3</a> with <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003915/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2:1-8</a>. In the first passage he tells of receiving the bad news about Jerusalem’s condition, in Chislev (third month in the civil calendar and ninth in the sacred calendar) in Artaxerxes’ 20th year. In the second, he presents his request to the king that he be permitted to go and rebuild Jerusalem, and he is granted permission in the month Nisan (seventh in the civil calendar and first in the sacred), but <em>still in the 20th year of Artaxerxes.</em> So Nehemiah was obviously not counting the years of Artaxerxes’ reign on a Nisan-to-Nisan basis.</p>

<strong>Highlights From the Book of Nehemiah</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006082/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>1:1;</strong></a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006082/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> <strong>2:1</strong></a>​<strong>—Is “the twentieth year” mentioned in these two verses counted from the same reference point?</strong> Yes, the 20th year is that of the reign of Artaxerxes the king. However, the method of counting used in these verses is different. Historical evidence points to 475 B.C.E. as the year of Artaxerxes’ ascension to the throne. Since the Babylonian scribes customarily counted the years of the Persian kings’ reign from Nisan (March/April) to Nisan, Artaxerxes’ first regnal year began in Nisan of 474 B.C.E. Hence, the 20th year of rulership mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006082/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Nehemiah 2:1</a> began in Nisan of 455 B.C.E.

Nehemiah refers to that month as also falling in the 20th year of Artaxerxes’ reign. Perhaps in <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>this case, he was counting the years from the accession date of the monarch. It could also be that Nehemiah was counting time by what the Jews today call a civil year, which begins in the month of Tishri, corresponding to September/October. In any case, the year in which the word went out to restore Jerusalem was 455 B.C.E.</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986127/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2:1</a>) Since Chislev (November-December) is placed before Nisan (March-April) in this narrative, apparently Persian kings counted each year of their reign from fall to fall, or from the time they actually ascended the throne. Reliable historical evidence and fulfilled Bible prophecies point to 455 B.C.E. as the year in which Nisan of the 20th year of Artaxerxes falls. Thus, Nehemiah’s account begins in the fall of 456 B.C.E., and the decree to rebuild the wall of Jerusalem was issued in the spring of 455 B.C.E.</p>

<strong>A Powerful Identification of the Messiah</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="si"><span id="page630" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="630" data-before-text="630"></span>He . . . ultimately sought protection at the Persian court, where he gained high favor with the reigning monarch, Artaxerxes Longimanus. He was deeply engaged in plans for the subjugation of Greece by the Persians, which he had promised Artaxerxes to compass, when, . . . according to some accounts, he took poison; . . .—<em>The Encyclopedia Americana,</em> edition of 1929, Volume 26, page 507.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">It was during Artaxerxes’ reign that the exiled Themistocles died in Asia Minor. According to the annals or chronology of Diodorus the Sicilian, a Greek historian of the first century B.C.E., the date of Themistocles’ death was 471 B.C.E. He must have arrived in Asia Minor in 473 B.C.E., according to the following information: Upon arriving in Asia Minor he sent a letter to King Artaxerxes and asked him for an audience, but he begged first for one year’s time in which to learn to speak Persian, after which he would come and lay before Artaxerxes some plans for subduing Greece. This request was granted by Artaxerxes, and Themistocles appeared at his court at the end of the year.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The Greek historian Thucydides of Athens lived during the reign of Artaxerxes the Persian, and tells us that General Themistocles fled from his home country to Asia (Persia) when Artaxerxes had but “lately come to the throne.”—See Thucydides in Book I, chapter 137.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="si">Nepos, a Roman historian of the first century B.C.E., backs up Thucydides by saying: “I know that most historians have related that Themistocles went over into Asia in the reign of Xerxes, but I give credence to Thucydides in preference to others, because he, of all who have left records of that period, was nearest in point of time to Themistocles, and was of the same city. Thucydides says that he went to Artaxerxes.”—Nepos, Themistocles, chapter 9.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965762/0">a</a></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Jerome’s <em>Eusebius</em> places Themistocles’ arrival in Asia in the fourth year of the 76th Olympiad (four-year periods beginning in 776 B.C.E.), that is, in 473 B.C.E. The German scholar Ernst Hengstenberg says that Artaxerxes’ reign commenced in 474 B.C.E.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">On the basis of these historical records we can establish the very important date: the first year of Artaxerxes’ reign. For since he had “lately come to the throne” when Themistocles arrived in Asia in 473 B.C.E., this would support other sources that point to 474 B.C.E. as the beginning of Artaxerxes’ reign.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>WHEN THE SEVENTY WEEKS BEGAN</strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Now, as to the start of Daniel’s time prophecy in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Daniel 9:24-27</a>, Nehemiah leaves no doubt. His calendar year began with the month Tishri (September/October, just as the Jews’ civil calendar today) and ended with the month Elul (August/ September) as the twelfth month. The month Chislev, in which Nehemiah got reports of the plight of the Jews and the bad physical state of Jerusalem, was the third month from Tishri and fell partly in November and partly in December. Nehemiah tells us (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Neh. 1:1, 2</a>):</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="si">“Now it came about in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, that I myself happened to be in Shushan the castle. Then Hanani, one of my brothers, came in, he and other men from Judah, and I proceeded to ask about the Jews, those who had escaped, who had been left over of the captivity, and also about Jerusalem.”</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">What year in the currently used Gregorian calendar would be the twentieth year of Artaxerxes? We set forth here the chronological evidence: Xerxes began to reign in December, 486 B.C.E. Since the record in the book of Esther counts the year as beginning in the spring (Nisan, or March/April), Xerxes’ first year on that calendar would end February/March, 485 <span id="page631" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="631" data-before-text="631"></span>B.C.E. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Esther 9:1</a>) Xerxes’ twelfth year ran from March/April of 475 through February/March of 474. It is possible that Xerxes lived beyond his twelfth year (that is, beyond Adar [February/March of 474] into his thirteenth year, as mentioned above). Artaxerxes succeeded him in the same year, 474. But Nehemiah’s calendar counted the year as beginning in the fall (Tishri, or September/October), so the calendar year running from Tishri 475 to Tishri 474 would be the year in which Artaxerxes’ rule began.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965762/1">b</a> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Neh. 1:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 2:1</a>) Artaxerxes’ twentieth year ran, therefore, from September/October of 456 B.C.E. through August/September of 455 B.C.E.</p>

<strong>Jerusalem Rebuilt for Messiah’s Coming</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Encouraged by so manifest a blessing from God, the Jews hastened the work and in less than four and one half years’ time the temple was completed. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezra 6:15</a> gives <span id="page600" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="600" data-before-text="600"></span>the date of completion, saying: “And they completed this house by the third day of the lunar month Adar, that is, in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.” If the first year of Darius I is counted from 522 B.C.E., when his predecessor Cambyses died, then the rebuilding of the temple was completed in March of 516 B.C.E.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965723/0">a</a></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The next month after Adar is Nisan. So by completing the temple on Adar 3 the Jews were able to inaugurate it in time to hold the Passover in Nisan in the beginning of the seventh year of King Darius I: “And the sons of Israel, the priests and the Levites and the rest of the former exiles held the inauguration of this house of God with joy.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ezra 6:16</a>) Now worship of Jehovah at Jerusalem was fully restored. The joy of the builders must have been great, seeing the temple building fully accomplished.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>CITY-BUILDING GETS ATTENTION</strong></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">But what about the city itself? And what about Isaiah’s prophecy that Jerusalem would flourish and Daniel’s prophecy about the rebuilding of its public square and moat? While it was some time before this took place, still it was something that had to be done to prepare the way for the coming of Messiah the Prince. It was not until the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia that Jehovah stirred up the spirit of another faithful servant to see that this was done. This servant was Nehemiah, who at the time had the responsible position of cupbearer to King Artaxerxes of Persia. Though he could not be in Jerusalem, nevertheless his heart was there, for there, he knew, was centered the true worship of Jehovah. Jerusalem was the place on which Jehovah’s name rested and it was the temple of Jehovah that was now rebuilt there. He tells us of his concern over the city and the delay in rebuilding revealed by a report of its condition some sixty years after the temple had been rebuilt: “Now it came about in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, that I myself happened to be in Shushan the castle. Then Hanani, one of my brothers, came in, he and other men from Judah, and I proceeded to ask about the Jews, those who had escaped, who had been left over of the captivity, and also about Jerusalem. Accordingly they said to me: ‘Those left over, who have been left over from the captivity, there in the jurisdictional district, are in a very bad plight and in reproach; and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its very gates have been burned with fire.’ . . . Now I myself happened to be cupbearer to the king.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Neh. 1:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 11</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Nehemiah was greatly grieved on hearing this report. He took the matter immediately to Jehovah in prayer. The answer to his prayer was not long in coming. He tells us: “And it came about in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him, and I as usual took up the wine and gave it to the king. But never had I happened to be gloomy before him. So the king said to me: ‘Why is your face gloomy when you yourself are not sick? This is nothing but a gloominess of heart.’ At this I became very much afraid.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Neh. 2:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Nehemiah explained the reason for his sadness to the king. When Artaxerxes asked: “What is this that you are seeking to secure?” Nehemiah offered a silent prayer to Jehovah and took courage to ask the king to send him to rebuild Jerusalem. <span id="page601" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="601" data-before-text="601"></span>The prayer was answered; King Artaxerxes was agreeable. Nehemiah relates: “So it seemed good before the king that he should send me, when I gave him the appointed time. And I went on to say to the king: ‘If to the king it does seem good, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River [Euphrates], that they may let me pass until I come to Judah; also a letter to Asaph the keeper of the park that belongs to the king, that he may give me trees to build with timber the gates of the Castle that belongs to the house, and for the wall of the city and for the house into which I am to enter.’ So the king gave them to me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Neh. 2:3-8</a>.</p>

<strong>Nehemiah</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><span id="page1216" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1216" data-before-text="1216"></span>It was after this that the enemies made attempts to stop the rebuilding work. Four times they tried to allure Nehemiah away from his project, but he informed them that he was unable to take time off from the great work that he was doing. Thereafter Sanballat sent an open letter that contained false charges and suggested that they meet for counsel. Nehemiah replied: “Things such as you are saying have not been brought about, but it is out of your own heart that you are inventing them.” Trying still another trick, Tobiah and Sanballat hired a Jew to frighten Nehemiah into wrongfully hiding in the temple. Nehemiah, however, did not give way to fear, and the repair work came to a successful completion on the twenty-fifth day of Elul (August-September), just fifty-two days after construction work began. Nevertheless, Tobiah continued to send intimidating letters to Nehemiah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Neh. chap. 6</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">With the wall completed, Nehemiah directed his attention to the work of organizing the temple servants. Next he placed two men in command of the city, one of these being his brother Hanani. Nehemiah also gave instructions regarding the opening and the closing of the city gates and the guarding of them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Neh. 7:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>GENEALOGICAL ENROLLMENT</strong></p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">At this time Jerusalem’s population was quite small. This seemingly was why God put it into Nehemiah’s heart to assemble the nobles, deputy rulers and people to get them enrolled genealogically, for the information procured thereby could have served as a basis for taking steps to increase the population of Jerusalem. Apparently while Nehemiah was giving consideration to this genealogical enrollment, he found the record of those who had returned from Babylonian exile with Zerubbabel.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Neh. 7:4-7</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>LAW OBSERVANCE RESTORED</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">It was probably at Nehemiah’s direction that an assembly was held in the public square near the Water Gate. Although Ezra the priest evidently took the lead in giving instruction in the Law, Nehemiah also shared therein. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Neh. 8:1-12</a>) Next the eight-day festival of booths was held. Two days later the Israelites convened again. During this assembly a general confession of Israel’s sin was made. Thereafter a written confession contract was drawn up. This confession contract or “trustworthy arrangement” was attested by the princes, Levites, and priests. Nehemiah, the “Tirshatha [governor]” was the first to attest it by seal. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Neh. 8:13–10:1</a>) All the people agreed to refrain from intermarriage with foreigners, to observe the sabbaths and to support the temple service. Next, one person out of every ten was selected by lot to dwell permanently in Jerusalem.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Neh. 10:28–11:1</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">It was after this that the wall of Jerusalem was inaugurated. For the occasion Nehemiah appointed two large thanksgiving choirs and processions to make a tour of the wall in opposite directions. This was done and all met at the temple to offer sacrifices. Additionally, men were appointed to be in charge of the contributions for the priests and Levites.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Neh. 12:27-47</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">About twelve years later, in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, Nehemiah left Jerusalem. Upon his return, he found deplorable conditions among the Jews. Eliashib the high priest had made a dining hall in the courtyard of the temple for the use of Tobiah, the very man who earlier had viciously opposed the work of Nehemiah. Immediately Nehemiah took action. He threw all of Tobiah’s furniture outside the dining hall and instructed that the dining hall be cleansed.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Additionally, Nehemiah took measures to ensure the contributions for the Levites and enforced strict sabbath observance. He also administered discipline against those who had taken foreign wives, their sons by these women not even being able to speak the Jewish tongue: “And I began to find fault with them and call down evil upon them and strike some men of them and pull out their hair and make them swear by God: ‘You should not give your daughters to their sons, and you should not accept any of their daughters for your sons or yourselves.’”</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Nehemiah’s ‘finding fault’ with these men doubtless was his reproving and rebuking them by means of God’s law, exposing their wrong action. These men were bringing the restored nation into disfavor with God, after God had kindly repatriated them from Babylon to restore true worship at Jerusalem. Nehemiah ‘called down evil upon them,’ meaning that he recited the judgments of God’s law against such violators. He “struck” them, probably not personally, but ordered them flogged as an official judicial action. He ‘pulled out [a portion of] their hair.’ This was a symbol of moral indignation and ignominy before the people. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ezra 9:3</a>.) Nehemiah then chased away the grandson of High Priest Eliashib, who had become a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Neh. 13:1-28</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong>NEHEMIAH AN OUTSTANDING EXAMPLE</strong></p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Nehemiah stands out as a sterling example of faithfulness and devotion. He was unselfish, leaving behind a prominent position as cupbearer in the courtyard of Artaxerxes to undertake the rebuilding of Jerusalem’s walls. As there were many enemies, Nehemiah willingly exposed himself to danger in behalf of his people and true worship. Not only did he direct the work of repairing the wall of Jerusalem, but he also had an active personal share in the task. He wasted no time, was courageous and fearless, relied fully on Jehovah and was discreet in what he did. Zealous for true worship, Nehemiah knew God’s law and applied it. He was concerned about building up the faith of his fellow Israelites. He showed himself to be a man who manifested a proper fear of Jehovah God. Though enforcing God’s law zealously, he did not domineer over others for selfish benefit, but showed concern for the oppressed. Never did he demand the bread due the governor. Instead, he provided food for a considerable number of persons at his own expense. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Neh. 5:14-19</a>) Appropriately Nehemiah could pray: “Do remember me, O my God, for good.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Neh. 13:31</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"></p>

<strong>District</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When Nehemiah organized the rebuilding of the wall of Jerusalem, he assigned portions to the leaders, or ‘princes,’ and inhabitants of certain ‘districts.’ These districts were named after their principal city, and some (Jerusalem, Beth-zur, Keilah) were double.

<strong>A City That Jehovah Guarded</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The temple was first rebuilt by a small number of Jews who made the hazardous 500-mile (805-kilometer) journey across the wilderness. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979170/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezra 6:15</a>) However, showing that Jerusalem’s restoration was not left to men, and could not be credited to the power or determination of men, was the fact that these first returnees, because of opposition from surrounding peoples, weakened and finally became completely engrossed in their own affairs. They deteriorated into a very sad state, and were reproached by their enemies, which reproach reflected on the God they represented.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>JERUSALEM’S PERILOUS PLIGHT</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">About 82 years after the return of the first repatriates, a Jew named Nehemiah, who had been serving as cupbearer to King Artaxerxes (Longimanus) of Persia, received news from his brother, Hanani, and other men from Judah, of the deplorable state of the city of Jerusalem. They reported: “Those left over, who have been left over from the captivity, . . . are in a very bad plight and in reproach; and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down [there were great breaches in the wall], and its very gates have been burned with fire [as the king of Babylon had left them].”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979170/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Neh. 1:1-3</a>.</p>

Apparently this official directed any serious complaints concerning the districts under his jurisdiction to the king and then waited for royal authorization to act. Also, lesser officials could request that the activities of a particular jurisdictional district be investigated. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012499/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ezra 4:8-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012499/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 5:3-17</a>) When authorized by the king, jurisdictional districts could receive monies from the royal treasury, and the royal decrees were sent by means of couriers to the various parts of the empire. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012499/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ezra 6:6-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012499/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Esther 1:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012499/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 3:12-15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012499/10/3" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 8:10-14</a>) Therefore, all the inhabitants of the jurisdictional districts were familiar with the laws and decrees of the central government.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012499/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Esther 4:11</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The system of jurisdictional districts existing in nations of antiquity often made the lot of the subject peoples more difficult. This fact is acknowledged by the wise writer of Ecclesiastes: “If you see any oppression of the one of little means and the violent taking away of judgment and of righteousness in a jurisdictional district, do not be amazed over the affair, for one that is higher than the high one is watching, and there are those who are high above them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012499/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Eccl. 5:8</a>) There was little reason to be amazed about the oppression of the lowly one when lesser administrators were watched by higher officials, most of whom sought their own advantage at the expense of their subjects.—See PROVINCE.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"></p>

He prayed about the matter. “It came about that, as soon as I heard these words, I sat down and began to weep and mourn for days, and I was continually fasting and praying before the God of the heavens.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964684/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Neh. 1:4</a>) Nehemiah’s prayer brought results.

In time the mother became ill with heart trouble, and was given only a short time to live. The father and son became very downhearted. Finally, in their sorrow they prayed to Jehovah for help that the mother would become a believer. Soon the mother began to make inquiries as to the Bible. In her remaining days she embraced the truth, witnessed by means of the telephone, and died with a hope of living in the new order of things. Yes, the earnest prayers of the father and son brought results.

All of a sudden her opposing husband stood in the doorway with a loaded shotgun pointed at her to prevent her from leaving the house. In this desperate situation she immediately prayed silently to Jehovah. After some minutes her husband began to calm down. He listened to her earnest appeal and finally permitted her to attend the closing part of the Memorial service. Her prayer brought further results in that her husband is now more tolerant and listens to explanations of the Bible.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="ss"><strong>ORGANIZATIONAL PROBLEMS</strong></p><p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu">27, 28.

It is written that Jesus prayed the night before he made the organizational appointment of his twelve apostles, to ascertain the divine will.

The circuit servant told him that this congregation was known as a “trouble congregation,” but no one knew why. After the very first meeting he attended, their coldness confirmed that difficulties existed. The new congregation servant repeatedly prayed about this organizational problem. In a few weeks evidence of immorality was revealed that necessitated the disfellowshiping of a sister and the putting of two others on probation. Not only were these prayers answered in producing a cleansed congregation, but in the second year the congregation had a 40-percent <span id="page565" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="565" data-before-text="565"></span>increase in ministers preaching from house to house.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>What was involved in being cupbearer to the king?</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn"><strong>▪</strong> Nehemiah was cupbearer to Persian King Artaxerxes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010485/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Nehemiah 1:11</a>) In the royal courts of the ancient Middle East, the king’s cupbearer was no menial servant. On the contrary, he was a high-ranking official. Classical literature and a wealth of ancient pictorial representations of cupbearers allow us to draw a number of conclusions regarding Nehemiah’s role at the Persian court.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The cupbearer would taste the king’s wine to protect him from poisoning. The cupbearer thus had the king’s unreserved confidence. “The great need for trustworthy court attendants is underscored by the intrigues which were endemic to the Achaemenid [Persian] court,” says scholar Edwin M. Yamauchi. The cupbearer was likely also a favorite official who had considerable influence with the king. His close proximity to the monarch on a daily basis may have enabled him to decide who had access to the king.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Such a position may have had a bearing on the success of Nehemiah’s request to be allowed to return to Jerusalem to rebuild its walls. Nehemiah must have been highly valued by the king. <em>The Anchor Bible Dictionary</em> observes: “The king’s only reply was ‘How soon will you come back?’”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010485/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Nehemiah 2:1-6</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="se"><strong>[Diagram/​Picture on page 9]</strong></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> Relief from the Persian palace of Persepolis</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> <strong>[Diagram]</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> (For fully formatted text, see publication)</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> Cupbearer</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> Crown Prince Xerxes</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> Darius the Great</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> <strong>[Credit Line]</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> © The Bridgeman Art Library International</p>

<strong>Chronology</strong><br/><p id="p243" data-pid="243" class="sb">The next date of major importance is the 20th year of Artaxerxes (Longimanus), the year Nehemiah received permission to go and rebuild Jerusalem.

The events of this year that involve the rebuilding of Jerusalem and its walls mark the starting point of the prophecy concerning the “seventy weeks” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/83/0" data-bid="84-1" class="b">Daniel 9:24-27</a>.

As demonstrated under the heading <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/18">SEVENTY WEEKS</a>, the prophecy pointed to Jesus’ appearance as the Messiah in the year 29 C.E.; his death at “the half of the week” or in the middle of the last week of years, that is, in 33 C.E.; and the end of the period of God’s special favor to the Jews in 36 C.E. Thus, the 70 weeks of years closed with the conversion of Cornelius, 490 years from the year 455 B.C.E.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/85/0" data-bid="86-1" class="b">Ac 10:30-33,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/85/1" data-bid="86-2" class="b"> 44-48;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/85/2" data-bid="86-3" class="b"> 11:1</a>.</p>

<strong>Nehemiah, Book of</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>Time Covered and Time of Writing.</strong> The month of Chislev (November-December) of a certain 20th year is the reference point with which the historical narrative begins. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003213/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ne 1:1</a>) As is evident from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003213/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Nehemiah 2:1</a>, this 20th year must be that of Artaxerxes’ reign. Obviously, the 20th year <span id="page488" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="488" data-before-text="488"></span>in this case is not reckoned as starting in Nisan (March-April), for Chislev of the 20th year could not then precede Nisan (mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003213/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ne 2:1</a>) of the same 20th year. So it may be that Nehemiah used his own count of time, reckoning the lunar year as beginning with Tishri (September-October), which month Jews today recognize as the beginning of their civil year. Another possibility is that the reign of the king was reckoned from the actual date that the monarch ascended the throne. This could be so even though the Babylonian scribes continued to reckon the years of the Persian king’s reign on their customary basis of a Nisan-to-Nisan count, as their cuneiform tablets show they did.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Reliable historical evidence and the fulfillment of Bible prophecy point to 455 B.C.E. as the year in which Nisan of the 20th year of Artaxerxes’ reign fell. (See <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003213/0">PERSIA, PERSIANS</a> [The Reigns of Xerxes and of Artaxerxes].) Accordingly, the Chislev preceding Nisan of that 20th year would fall in 456 B.C.E., and the 32nd year of Artaxerxes’ reign (the last date mentioned in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003213/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Nehemiah [13:6</a>]) would include part of 443 B.C.E. Therefore, the book of Nehemiah covers a period from Chislev of 456 B.C.E. until sometime after 443 B.C.E.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong><em>When did the prophetic “seventy weeks” actually begin?</em></strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">As to the beginning of the 70 weeks, Nehemiah was granted permission by King Artaxerxes of Persia, in the 20th year of his rule, in the month <span id="page900" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="900" data-before-text="900"></span>of Nisan, to rebuild the wall and the city of Jerusalem. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003915/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ne 2:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003915/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003915/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 7, 8</a>) In his calculations as to the reign of Artaxerxes, Nehemiah apparently used a calendar year that began with the month Tishri (September-October), as does the Jews’ present civil calendar, and ended with the month Elul (August-September) as the 12th month. Whether this was his own reckoning or the manner of reckoning employed for certain purposes in Persia is not known.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Some may object to the above statement and may point to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003915/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Nehemiah 7:73</a>, where Nehemiah speaks of Israel as being gathered in their cities in the <em>seventh</em> month​—the monthly order here being based on a Nisan-to-Nisan year. But Nehemiah was here copying from “the book of genealogical enrollment of those who came up at the first” with Zerubbabel, in 537 B.C.E. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003915/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ne 7:5</a>) Again, Nehemiah describes the celebration of the Festival of Booths in his time as taking place in the <em>seventh</em> month. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003915/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ne 8:9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003915/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 13-18</a>) This was only fitting because the account says that they found what Jehovah commanded “written in the law,” and in that law, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003915/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Leviticus 23:39-43</a>, it says that the Festival of Booths was to be in “the seventh month” (that is, of the sacred calendar, running from Nisan to Nisan).</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">However, as evidence indicating that Nehemiah may have used a fall-to-fall year in referring to certain events, we can compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003915/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Nehemiah 1:1-3</a> with <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003915/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2:1-8</a>. In the first passage he tells of receiving the bad news about Jerusalem’s condition, in Chislev (third month in the civil calendar and ninth in the sacred calendar) in Artaxerxes’ 20th year. In the second, he presents his request to the king that he be permitted to go and rebuild Jerusalem, and he is granted permission in the month Nisan (seventh in the civil calendar and first in the sacred), but <em>still in the 20th year of Artaxerxes.</em> So Nehemiah was obviously not counting the years of Artaxerxes’ reign on a Nisan-to-Nisan basis.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">To establish the time for the 20th year of Artaxerxes, we go back to the end of the reign of his father and predecessor Xerxes, who died in the latter part of 475 B.C.E. Artaxerxes’ accession year thus began in 475 B.C.E., and his first regnal year would be counted from 474 B.C.E., as other historical evidence indicates. The 20th year of Artaxerxes’ rule would accordingly be 455 B.C.E.​—See <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003915/0">PERSIA, PERSIANS</a> (The Reigns of Xerxes and of Artaxerxes).</p>

However, the method of counting used in these verses is different. Historical evidence points to 475 B.C.E. as the year of Artaxerxes’ ascension to the throne. Since the Babylonian scribes customarily counted the years of the Persian kings’ reign from Nisan (March/April) to Nisan, Artaxerxes’ first regnal year began in Nisan of 474 B.C.E. Hence, the 20th year of rulership mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006082/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Nehemiah 2:1</a> began in Nisan of 455 B.C.E.

Nehemiah refers to that month as also falling in the 20th year of Artaxerxes’ reign. Perhaps in <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>this case, he was counting the years from the accession date of the monarch. It could also be that Nehemiah was counting time by what the Jews today call a civil year, which begins in the month of Tishri, corresponding to September/October. In any case, the year in which the word went out to restore Jerusalem was 455 B.C.E.</p>

If so, remember Nehemiah. He was gloomy in the presence of King Artaxerxes, being depressed over the devastated condition of Jerusalem and its walls. When questioned by the Persian ruler, Nehemiah “prayed to the God of the heavens.” Thereafter he asked permission to go to Jerusalem for the rebuilding work. The king responded favorably, granting this request. Truly, the ‘good hand of God’ was upon Nehemiah.

<strong>Identifying the Son of God</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">With all these qualifications, one would expect that the Messiah would be received well in his work among God’s chosen people. <span id="page379" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="379" data-before-text="379"></span>But the prophecies reveal otherwise, as can be clearly seen by reading <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966445/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah</a>. In this chapter Jehovah shows that God’s own people would reject his Son, as it was written: “He was despised, and we held him as of no account. Truly our sicknesses were what he himself carried; and as for our pains, he bore them. But we ourselves accounted him as plagued, stricken by God and afflicted. But he was being pierced for our transgression.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966445/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Isa. 53:3-5</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The cone of identification is surely approaching its tip, but the all-wise God is exacting and leaves no room for doubt, and so he pinpoints his Son’s identity mathematically through chronology.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>PINPOINT CHRONOLOGY</strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Through his prophet Daniel, Jehovah says: “You should know and have the insight that from the going forth of the word to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem until Messiah the Leader, there will be seven weeks, also sixty-two weeks.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966445/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Dan. 9:25</a>) Thus in a total of sixty-nine “weeks” from the going forth of the word to restore and rebuild Jerusalem “Messiah the Leader” would appear. Now, just how much time does this entail?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">The word for “week” in Hebrew means a cycle of seven, usually seven days, but not necessarily. It can be a cycle of seven periods of other lengths. In this case an unusual grammatical structure appears in the Hebrew. The usual word for “weeks” in Hebrew is <em>shavuoth</em> (feminine ending). But in this instance the Hebrew word used is <em>shavuim</em> (masculine ending), which may well indicate to the reader that the week mentioned here is not the normal cycle of seven days, but, rather, seven years. In fact, some translators of this passage into English have rendered it “weeks of years.” This fits in with the Bible principle of “a day for a year.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966445/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Num. 14:34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966445/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Ezek. 4:6</a>) Thus the sixty-nine “weeks” would come to 483 years [7 x 69=483].</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">But when would this 483-year period begin counting? In the year 455 B.C.E. That year Nehemiah received approval to go “to the city of the burial places of my forefathers, that I may rebuild it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966445/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Neh. 2:5</a>) This occurred “in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966445/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Neh. 2:1</a>) According to information agreed upon by historians Thucydides and Diodorus, this took place in the year 455 B.C.E. The sixty-nine “weeks of years” would begin counting from the time the commandment of Artaxerxes <em>took effect;</em> that is, after the Jews with Nehemiah reached Jerusalem and when he gave the orders to build the city walls. Since it took about four months to make the trip from the king’s winter capital to Jerusalem, it was early in Ab, 455 B.C.E., or about July 26-27 or 27-28, 455 B.C.E., that marks the starting point for the count of time given by Daniel’s prophecy. This is when the commandment to restore and rebuild Jerusalem took effect.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">If we count 483 years from that date, we will arrive at the year 29 C.E. [454 years from 455 B.C.E. to 1 B.C.E., 1 year from 1 B.C.E. to 1 C.E. and 28 years from 1 C.E. to 29 C.E.=483 years], the year in which the Son of God would appear as the Messiah or Anointed One.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">The prophecy continues: “After the sixty-two weeks [of years] Messiah will be cut off, with nothing for himself.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966445/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Dan. 9:26</a>) Thus after the 62-week period, which came after the 7-week period [a total of 69 weeks], the Messiah was to die. But at what time after 69 weeks of years? <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966445/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Da 9 Verse 27</a> explains: “At the half of the [seventieth] week [of years] he will cause sacrifice and gift offering to cease.” So, then, half of a week of years being three and a half years, the Messiah would <span id="page380" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="380" data-before-text="380"></span>die three and a half years after the year 29 C.E., which began in the fall of the year.

<strong>A Powerful Identification of the Messiah</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Those who do not believe the Bible to be inspired, if they sincerely consider this matter, cannot be but convinced at least to look further into God’s Word with greater respect. Persons of the Jewish faith who believe in God’s Word and who believe that God’s prophets could not and did not lie will be constrained to reexamine <span id="page628" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="628" data-before-text="628"></span>the position of their religion on the matter of Messiah’s coming.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The prophecy in question is one given by the prophet Daniel, who had a very favorable standing before God and who is mentioned in God’s Word as a man of highest integrity. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">the ninth chapter of Daniel</a>’s prophecy, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Da 9 verses 24 to 27</a>, he was inspired to say:</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="si">“There are seventy weeks that have been determined upon your people and upon your holy city, in order to terminate the transgression, and to finish off sin, and to make atonement for error, and to bring in righteousness for times indefinite, and to imprint a seal upon vision and prophet, and to anoint the Holy of Holies. And you should know and have the insight that from the going forth of the word to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem until Messiah the Leader, there will be seven weeks, also sixty two weeks. She will return and be actually rebuilt, with a public square and moat, but in the straits of the times. And after the sixty-two weeks Messiah will be cut off, with nothing for himself. And the city and the holy place the people of a leader that is coming will bring to their ruin. And the end of it will be by the flood. And until the end there will be war; what is decided upon is desolations. And he must keep the covenant in force for the many for one week; and at the half of the week he will cause sacrifice and gift offering to cease. And upon the wing of disgusting things there will be the one causing desolation; and until an extermination, the very thing decided upon will go pouring out also upon the one lying desolate.”</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">From the reading of this prophecy it is evident that here is a real jewel in the matter of identifying the Messiah and that it is of utmost importance to determine the time of the beginning of the seventy weeks and also the length of these prophetic weeks. We might say at the outset that if these were literal weeks of seven days each, then Messiah came more than twenty-four centuries ago in the days of the Persian Empire and was not identified. Also, the other hundreds of qualifications in the Bible were therefore not fulfilled. So it follows that the seventy weeks were symbolic of a much longer time. When did this time begin and end?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In Daniel’s prophecy above quoted, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Da 9 verse 25</a> shows us that, from the time that the commandment would take effect, a marked period of time would follow that would indicate the exact year in which the Promised Seed of God’s woman or the Messiah would make his appearance on earth. To determine when this commandment took place and when it went into effect it is necessary to determine who was the king who gave the commandment and to establish the year when this king began his reign, for it was in the twentieth year of this king that the command went forth. Nehemiah tells us: “And it came about in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him, and I as usual took up the wine and gave it to the king.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Neh. 2:1</a>) At this time Nehemiah brought to the king’s attention the sad state of Jerusalem and asked to be commissioned to go back to rebuild the city. The date of this conversation was 455 B.C.E. and the king was Artaxerxes of Persia, as shown by the following historical facts.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>FOUR KINGS WHO PRECEDED ARTAXERXES</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Daniel 11:1</a> he mentions Darius the Mede and in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Da 11 verse 2</a> he prophesies that there will yet be three kings standing up for Persia and a fourth one who will amass greater riches than all the others and who “will rouse up everything against the kingdom <span id="page629" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="629" data-before-text="629"></span>of Greece.” The third king was Darius I, who began ruling the Persian Empire in 522 B.C.E. He had been preceded since Darius the Mede by two kings, Cyrus the Persian and Cambyses, Cyrus’ son. In 490 B.C.E. King Darius ordered a second Persian invasion of Greece. The Persian forces far outnumbered the Athenians, but at Marathon, Greece, the Persians were defeated. King Darius intended to invade Greece a third time but died in 486 B.C.E. before he could finish preparations.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Then the fourth king mentioned by Daniel rose up to make further attempts to conquer Greece. In some modern Bible translations his name is mentioned as Xerxes.

If Ahasuerus is Xerxes, he began to reign in December, 486 B.C.E. The reason that King Xerxes I figures in a discussion of the seventy weeks of Daniel’s prophecy is that he was the father of King Artaxerxes, who issued the decree to rebuild Jerusalem.

Mordecai, the cousin of Xerxes’ Jewish wife Esther, was then acting as prime minister for Xerxes and he established for the Jews the memorial festival of Purim or Lots on the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the twelfth lunar month, Adar (February/ March). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Esther 9:20, 21</a>) Xerxes was then ruling in his twelfth year (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Esther 3:7</a>) and his rule must have extended over into his thirteenth year, to some time in 474 B.C.E., for after the decree of Xerxes other things took place, as stated at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Esther 9:32 to 10:3</a>:</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="si">“The command of Esther also confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in a book.

Crossing the Hellespont in 480 B.C.E., Xerxes’ invasion forces, greatly outnumbering the Greeks, were defeated through the tactics of the Athenian general Themistocles. There was a Greek delaying action at Thermopylae that inflicted great losses on the Persians and that was followed by the destruction of more than half of Xerxes’ fleet. The following year the Greeks defeated the Persian army that had been left behind under the command of one of its ablest generals. On the same day the remains of the Persian fleet were destroyed near the promontory of Mycale in Asia Minor. The Persians never invaded Greece again. Thus the efforts of the Fourth World Power to invade deeply into Europe were checked in 479 B.C.E., the eighth year of Xerxes’ reign. Nevertheless, the Persian Empire continued to hold world domination for a century and a half.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>BEGINNING OF ARTAXERXES’ REIGN</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Here we present historical evidence that the reign of Artaxerxes began in 474 B.C.E.: Even though Themistocles had accomplished these victories and had greatly strengthened the Grecian defenses, he later on began to lose the confidence of the people. He was finally accused of treasonable negotiations with the Persians. He fled to Asia Minor and was proclaimed a traitor and his property confiscated.

<strong>A Powerful Identification of the Messiah</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">What year in the currently used Gregorian calendar would be the twentieth year of Artaxerxes? We set forth here the chronological evidence: Xerxes began to reign in December, 486 B.C.E. Since the record in the book of Esther counts the year as beginning in the spring (Nisan, or March/April), Xerxes’ first year on that calendar would end February/March, 485 <span id="page631" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="631" data-before-text="631"></span>B.C.E. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Esther 9:1</a>) Xerxes’ twelfth year ran from March/April of 475 through February/March of 474. It is possible that Xerxes lived beyond his twelfth year (that is, beyond Adar [February/March of 474] into his thirteenth year, as mentioned above). Artaxerxes succeeded him in the same year, 474. But Nehemiah’s calendar counted the year as beginning in the fall (Tishri, or September/October), so the calendar year running from Tishri 475 to Tishri 474 would be the year in which Artaxerxes’ rule began.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965762/1">b</a> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Neh. 1:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 2:1</a>) Artaxerxes’ twentieth year ran, therefore, from September/October of 456 B.C.E. through August/September of 455 B.C.E.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Nehemiah, a zealous servant of Jehovah God, was vitally interested in true worship at the place where Jehovah had put his name, the city of Jerusalem. On hearing the bad news about Jerusalem, he prayed to Jehovah, desiring to be used to bring Jerusalem relief. In the seventh month of the lunar calendar year in this same twentieth year of Artaxerxes, which would be Nisan (March/April) according to Nehemiah’s reckoning, in the year 455 B.C.E., Nehemiah as cupbearer had opportunity to present the matter, to obtain the king’s approval, as he relates: “And it came about in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him, and I as usual took up the wine and gave it to the king.” “So it seemed good before the king that he should send me, when I gave him the appointed time.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Neh. 2:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 6</a>) Nehemiah acted promptly.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Just as the ending of the seventy years of desolation of Jerusalem took place when the decree of Cyrus <em>went into effect</em> at the arrival of the Jews in Jerusalem to lay the foundation of the temple, so there would be seventy weeks of years from the time the commandment of Artaxerxes <em>took effect,</em> that is, after the Jews with Nehemiah reached Jerusalem and when he gave the orders to build the city walls. Let us see next just when the command to build the city actually took effect.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">It would take about four months to make the trip from Shushan, the king’s winter capital, to Jerusalem, placing Nehemiah’s arrival at about the beginning of the eleventh month Ab. Nehemiah rested and held conferences for three days, inspected the city walls by night, then gave orders for the building to begin. This would be about the third or fourth day of Ab, 455 B.C.E., or about July 26-27 or 27-28, 455 B.C.E., still in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes.<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965762/2">c</a> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Neh. 2:11-18</a>) It marks our starting point for the count of time given by this important prophecy of Daniel.

<strong>Identifying the Messiah</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><em>The Jewish Encyclopedia</em> claims: “Not until the fall of the Maccabean dynasty, when the despotic government of Herod the Great and his family, and the increasing <span id="page678" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="678" data-before-text="678"></span>tyranny of the Roman empire had made their condition ever more unbearable, did the Jews seek refuge in the hope of a personal Messiah.” The facts and the Scriptures, however, prove otherwise. As far back as the garden of Eden God gave basis for hope in a personal Messiah when he said to the Serpent: “I shall put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed. He will bruise you in the head and you will bruise him in the heel.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957841/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 3:15</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The hope of a personal Messiah became brighter when God promised Abraham that, because of his obedience, “by means of your seed all nations of the earth will certainly bless themselves.” Becoming still more specific, the prophecy Jacob made on his deathbed stated: “The scepter will not turn aside from Judah, neither the commander’s staff from between his feet, until Shiloh comes, and to him the obedience of the people will belong.” Helping further to identify the Messiah are God’s words to David: “I shall certainly raise up your seed after you, . . . and I shall certainly establish the throne of his kingdom firmly forever.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957841/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 22:17, 18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957841/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 49:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957841/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 2 Sam. 7:12, 13,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957841/1/3" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 16</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The very place where this promised One was to be born was also foretold: “But thou, Bethlehem . . . , out of thee shall one come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth are from of old.” Surely such prophetic promises gave hope that a personal Messiah was to come and cannot at all be made to apply to a nation, much less to a co-operative effort among many nations.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957841/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mic. 5:2</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">And not only were the lineage and birthplace of the Messiah thus clearly given, but the very year of his appearing was pinpointed. Where? At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957841/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Daniel 9:25</a> (<em>AV</em>): “From the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks.” By means of the Scriptural rule found at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957841/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezekiel 4:6</a> of counting a day for a year this is seen to involve a total of 483 years. God’s Word shows that the command to restore and build Jerusalem went forth in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes (III), which secular history shows to be the year 455 B.C. Counting 483 years from that time we come to A.D. 29, the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar. This was the very year that Jesus appeared as the promised Messiah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957841/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Neh. 2:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957841/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Luke 3:1</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>FULFILLING THE PROPHECIES</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Clearly, then, ever since the first martyr, Abel, men of faith have hoped for the coming of the Messiah, a personal deliverer, and particularly since God gave David a Messianic promise, some thousand years before the days of Herod the Great.

Thus, in reply to the woman at the well of Sychar, who had said: “I know that Messiah is coming, who is called Christ,” Jesus replied: “I who am speaking to you am he.” Likewise, when the high priest asked Jesus: “Are you the Christ the Son of the Blessed One?” Jesus answered, “I am.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957841/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 4:25, 26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957841/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Mark 14:61, 62</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Micah had prophesied that the Messiah had a prehuman existence and Jesus repeatedly testified thereto.

According to the Greek historian Thucydides, this happened when Artaxerxes had but “lately come to the throne.” The Greek historian Diodorus Siculus puts the death of Themistocles at 471 B.C.E. Since Themistocles requested a year to learn Persian before having an audience with King Artaxerxes, he must have arrived in Asia Minor no later than 473 B.C.E. That date is supported by Jerome’s <em>Chronicle of Eusebius.</em> As Artaxerxes had “lately come to the throne” when Themistocles arrived in Asia in 473 B.C.E., German scholar Ernst Hengstenberg stated in his <em>Christology of the Old Testament</em> that Artaxerxes’ reign commenced in 474 B.C.E., as do other sources.

<strong>Artaxerxes</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">During Longimanus’ reign he extended permission to priest Ezra and also to Nehemiah to make trips to Jerusalem.

This coincides with his actions during the seventh year of his reign (468 B.C.E.), when Longimanus granted Ezra “all his request” in a decree that provided for silver and gold and vessels for temple use (gifts that totaled some $4,946,000 at modern values), in addition to provisions of wheat, wine, oil and salt. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010389/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezra 7:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010389/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 12-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010389/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 8:25-27</a>) This generous contribution may explain why Artaxerxes (Longimanus) is included along with Cyrus and Darius at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010389/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ezra 6:14</a> as one of those whose orders contributed to the ‘building and finishing’ of the temple, although the actual construction was completed by 515 B.C.E., some forty-seven years previous. The king’s decree even authorized Ezra to appoint magistrates and judges to teach God’s law (as well as that of the king), and to use capital punishment against violators where necessary.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010389/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ezra 7:25, 26</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>ARTAXERXES LONGIMANUS’ TWENTIETH YEAR</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">During the twentieth year of his reign, Artaxerxes Longimanus granted permission to Nehemiah to return to Jerusalem to rebuild the walls and gates of the city. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010389/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Neh. 2:1-8</a>) Because this edict is referred to at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010389/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Daniel 9:25</a> as relating to the time of the promised coming of the Messiah, the date of Artaxerxes’ twentieth year has been a matter of considerable study. Whereas most secular works fix the date of the start of his reign at 465 or 464 B.C.E., there is sound reason for placing it at an earlier date, as follows:</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The first year of the reign of Xerxes, father and predecessor of Longimanus, ran from December of 486 B.C.E. to the spring of 485 B.C.E. During 480-479 B.C.E. (the seventh year of his reign) he attempted an invasion of Greece but suffered defeats due to the tactics of the Athenian general Themistocles. The book of Esther (which calls him Ahasuerus) refers to the twelfth year of Xerxes’ rule (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010389/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Esther 3:7</a>) and indicates that his rule likely extended on into its thirteenth year (474 B.C.E.). Though modern historians generally extend Xerxes’ reign on to include a total of twenty-one years, and although some clay tablets referring to a sixteenth, twentieth and twenty-first year have been assigned by certain scholars to his reign, there is strong testimony to show that Xerxes’ rule ended in 474 B.C.E. and that he was then replaced by his son, Artaxerxes Longimanus.—See CHRONOLOGY.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The key to the matter relates to the flight of Athenian general Themistocles to the Persian capital, because of being accused of treason in his own land. The Greek historian Thucydides of Athens lived during the reign of Artaxerxes, and he records that Themistocles fled to Persia when Artaxerxes had but “lately come to the throne.” (See Thucydides in Book I, chapter 137.) Nepos, a Roman historian of the first century B.C.E., supports this statement, saying: “I know that most historians have related that Themistocles went over into Asia in the reign of Xerxes, but I give credence to Thucydides in preference to others, because he, of all who have left records of that period, was nearest in point of time to Themistocles, and was of the same city. Thucydides says that he went to Artaxerxes.” (Nepos, <em>Themistocles,</em> chap. 9) Similarly, the Greek biographer Plutarch, of the first century C.E., says: “Thucydides, and Charon of Lampsacus, say that Xerxes was dead, and that Themistocles had an interview with his son, Artaxerxes; but Ephorus, Dinon, Clitarchus, Heraclides and many others, write that he came to Xerxes. The chronological tables better agree with the account of Thucydides.”—Themistocles, c. 27; see also <em>The Encyclopedia Americana,</em> 1956 ed., Vol. 26, p. 507.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The weight of historical evidence, therefore, points to Themistocles’ flight as occurring in the reign of Artaxerxes, not of Xerxes. As to the date of that flight, Jerome’s <em>Eusebius</em> places Themistocles’ arrival in Asia in the fourth year of the 76th Olympiad (four-year periods beginning in 776 B.C.E.), that is, in the year 473/472 B.C.E. Confirming this are the annals or chronology of Diodorus the Sicilian, a Greek historian of the first century B.C.E., which place the date of Themistocles’ death in 471 B.C.E. Since after his arrival Themistocles is reported to have requested one year’s time in which to learn Persian before receiving audience with the king, it fits well that his arrival would reasonably have taken place about two years before his death or by the year 473 B.C.E. And since, as Thucydides records, Themistocles arrived when Artaxerxes had but “lately come to the throne,” then the first year of Artaxerxes’ reign evidently began in 474 B.C.E. The noted German scholar Ernst Wm. Hengstenberg (1802-1869) in his work entitled “Christology of the Old Testament” (Vol. 2, p. 395) states: “Krueger . . . places the death of Xerxes in the year 474 or 473, and the flight of Themistocles a year later.” Archbishop James Ussher, of Ireland (1581-1656), as a chronologist, also held that Artaxerxes Longimanus ascended the Persian throne in 474 B.C.E., as did the celebrated writer Vitringa (1659-1722).</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Accepting the year 474 B.C.E. on this basis as the initial year of Artaxerxes’ reign, we conclude that the twentieth year of his rule should have been the year 455 B.C.E., at which time his decree sent to Palestine by Nehemiah for the rebuilding of the city of Jerusalem would go into effect, thus marking the start of the “seventy weeks” of Daniel’s prophecy. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010389/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Dan. 9:24</a>) Hengstenberg sums up the matter in saying (Vol. 2, p. 394): “The difference [of opinion] concerns only the year of the commencement of the reign of Artaxerxes. Our problem is completely solved, when we have shown that this year falls in the year 474 before Christ. For then the twentieth year of Artaxerxes is the year 455 before Christ, according to the usual reckoning.” Undoubtedly the strongest proof for the date of 455 B.C.E. as the twentieth year of the reign of Artaxerxes, however, is the fact of the Messiah’s appearance in the year 29 C.E., and his death in 33 C.E., in fulfillment of the time period indicated in Daniel’s prophecy.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010389/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Dan. 9:25, 26</a>; see MESSIAH.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010389/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Nehemiah 13:6</a> refers to the “thirty-second year of Artaxerxes,” at which time (443-442 B.C.E.) Nehemiah returned to Babylon for a time. Artaxerxes Longimanus evidently died in 424 or 423 B.C.E. (according to <em>Babylonian Chronology 626 B.C.—A.D. 75</em> by Parker and Dubberstein, page 18) and was succeeded by Darius II.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Nehemiah</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><span id="page1216" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1216" data-before-text="1216"></span>It was after this that the enemies made attempts to stop the rebuilding work. Four times they tried to allure Nehemiah away from his project, but he informed them that he was unable to take time off from the great work that he was doing. Thereafter Sanballat sent an open letter that contained false charges and suggested that they meet for counsel. Nehemiah replied: “Things such as you are saying have not been brought about, but it is out of your own heart that you are inventing them.” Trying still another trick, Tobiah and Sanballat hired a Jew to frighten Nehemiah into wrongfully hiding in the temple. Nehemiah, however, did not give way to fear, and the repair work came to a successful completion on the twenty-fifth day of Elul (August-September), just fifty-two days after construction work began. Nevertheless, Tobiah continued to send intimidating letters to Nehemiah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Neh. chap. 6</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">With the wall completed, Nehemiah directed his attention to the work of organizing the temple servants. Next he placed two men in command of the city, one of these being his brother Hanani. Nehemiah also gave instructions regarding the opening and the closing of the city gates and the guarding of them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Neh. 7:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>GENEALOGICAL ENROLLMENT</strong></p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">At this time Jerusalem’s population was quite small. This seemingly was why God put it into Nehemiah’s heart to assemble the nobles, deputy rulers and people to get them enrolled genealogically, for the information procured thereby could have served as a basis for taking steps to increase the population of Jerusalem. Apparently while Nehemiah was giving consideration to this genealogical enrollment, he found the record of those who had returned from Babylonian exile with Zerubbabel.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Neh. 7:4-7</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>LAW OBSERVANCE RESTORED</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">It was probably at Nehemiah’s direction that an assembly was held in the public square near the Water Gate. Although Ezra the priest evidently took the lead in giving instruction in the Law, Nehemiah also shared therein. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Neh. 8:1-12</a>) Next the eight-day festival of booths was held. Two days later the Israelites convened again. During this assembly a general confession of Israel’s sin was made. Thereafter a written confession contract was drawn up. This confession contract or “trustworthy arrangement” was attested by the princes, Levites, and priests. Nehemiah, the “Tirshatha [governor]” was the first to attest it by seal. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Neh. 8:13–10:1</a>) All the people agreed to refrain from intermarriage with foreigners, to observe the sabbaths and to support the temple service. Next, one person out of every ten was selected by lot to dwell permanently in Jerusalem.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Neh. 10:28–11:1</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">It was after this that the wall of Jerusalem was inaugurated. For the occasion Nehemiah appointed two large thanksgiving choirs and processions to make a tour of the wall in opposite directions. This was done and all met at the temple to offer sacrifices. Additionally, men were appointed to be in charge of the contributions for the priests and Levites.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Neh. 12:27-47</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">About twelve years later, in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, Nehemiah left Jerusalem. Upon his return, he found deplorable conditions among the Jews. Eliashib the high priest had made a dining hall in the courtyard of the temple for the use of Tobiah, the very man who earlier had viciously opposed the work of Nehemiah. Immediately Nehemiah took action. He threw all of Tobiah’s furniture outside the dining hall and instructed that the dining hall be cleansed.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Additionally, Nehemiah took measures to ensure the contributions for the Levites and enforced strict sabbath observance. He also administered discipline against those who had taken foreign wives, their sons by these women not even being able to speak the Jewish tongue: “And I began to find fault with them and call down evil upon them and strike some men of them and pull out their hair and make them swear by God: ‘You should not give your daughters to their sons, and you should not accept any of their daughters for your sons or yourselves.’”</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Nehemiah’s ‘finding fault’ with these men doubtless was his reproving and rebuking them by means of God’s law, exposing their wrong action. These men were bringing the restored nation into disfavor with God, after God had kindly repatriated them from Babylon to restore true worship at Jerusalem. Nehemiah ‘called down evil upon them,’ meaning that he recited the judgments of God’s law against such violators. He “struck” them, probably not personally, but ordered them flogged as an official judicial action. He ‘pulled out [a portion of] their hair.’ This was a symbol of moral indignation and ignominy before the people. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ezra 9:3</a>.) Nehemiah then chased away the grandson of High Priest Eliashib, who had become a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Neh. 13:1-28</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong>NEHEMIAH AN OUTSTANDING EXAMPLE</strong></p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Nehemiah stands out as a sterling example of faithfulness and devotion. He was unselfish, leaving behind a prominent position as cupbearer in the courtyard of Artaxerxes to undertake the rebuilding of Jerusalem’s walls. As there were many enemies, Nehemiah willingly exposed himself to danger in behalf of his people and true worship. Not only did he direct the work of repairing the wall of Jerusalem, but he also had an active personal share in the task. He wasted no time, was courageous and fearless, relied fully on Jehovah and was discreet in what he did. Zealous for true worship, Nehemiah knew God’s law and applied it. He was concerned about building up the faith of his fellow Israelites. He showed himself to be a man who manifested a proper fear of Jehovah God. Though enforcing God’s law zealously, he did not domineer over others for selfish benefit, but showed concern for the oppressed. Never did he demand the bread due the governor. Instead, he provided food for a considerable number of persons at his own expense. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Neh. 5:14-19</a>) Appropriately Nehemiah could pray: “Do remember me, O my God, for good.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Neh. 13:31</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"></p>

For one thing, such appreciation will help us to guard against hurrying through our prayers as if we needed to get to more important things. Nothing can be more important than talking to the Universal Sovereign, Jehovah God. True, there may be occasions when time is limited. For example, when King Artaxerxes asked his cupbearer Nehemiah, “What is this that you are seeking to secure?” Nehemiah ‘at once prayed to the God of the heavens.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1987523/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Nehemiah 2:4</a>) Since the king was expecting an immediate reply, Nehemiah could not linger long in that prayer. But we may be sure that it was meaningful and came from his heart because Jehovah immediately answered it. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1987523/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Nehemiah 2:5, 6</a>) Except for such rare occasions, however, we should take time for our prayers and let other things wait. If our prayers tend to be hurried, we do not fully appreciate the importance of prayer.</p>

When questioned by the Persian ruler, Nehemiah “prayed to the God of the heavens.” Thereafter he asked permission to go to Jerusalem for the rebuilding work. The king responded favorably, granting this request. Truly, the ‘good hand of God’ was upon Nehemiah.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Luke 23:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Acts 17:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/24/2" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> 24:5</a>) Jesus warned his followers: “You will be haled before governors and kings for my sake for the purpose of a witness to them and the nations.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Matt. 10:18</a>, <em>NW</em>) The Christian would certainly pray to God before such appearances, and the prayer would concern the official before whom you were to appear, he being mentioned. The Christian might pray that the message be presented clearly and boldly and in understandable form for the official or judge, and that if it please God will he make this highly stationed one amenable to the message, unprejudiced, reasonable, so that he will see the justice of the Christian’s cause and rule in his favor, allowing him freedom of action for preaching, and not curbing such activity by imprisoning the minister.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">18.

When Queen Esther appeared unbidden before the Persian king Xerxes she put her life in jeopardy, so before she did this she sent word to Mordecai: “Go and gather all the Jews to be found in Susa, fast for me, eat and drink nothing for three days and three nights; I and my maids will fast as you do; and so I will go to the king, though it is against the law. If I perish, I perish.” Such fasting before God would certainly be accompanied by prayers and supplications for Esther’s safety, which means they would ask God to make the king view Esther with favor, for that was the point on which her safety hinged. The intercessions were successful, for Esther found favor with the king.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Esther 4:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 5:2</a>, <em>Mo.</em></p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">19.

Ah, let thy servant have success at this time, let him find favour in the sight of this man!” The man was the king, for whom Nehemiah was cupbearer. When Nehemiah appeared before the king he was asked: “What request have you to make?” Before ever answering Nehemiah did something, and he tells us what: “So I prayed to the God of heaven; then I said to the king.” The quick prayer came first, and brought results, for the request was granted. “This the king granted me, thanks to the kind favour of my God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Neh. 1:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/27/2" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> 2:4, 5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/27/3" data-bid="28-4" class="b"> 8</a>, <em>Mo</em>) It is quite evident that Nehemiah prayed for God to shape the king’s decision, and God answered that prayer, and Nehemiah gave God the credit for the favorable reply from the king.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">20. Wherein did Paul show willingness to make supplication for rulers?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> And consider the following exchange of words between King Agrippa and Paul, when a weighty question involving Paul’s preaching was up for decision: “Agrippa said to Paul: ‘In a short time you would persuade me to become a Christian.’ At this Paul said: ‘I could wish to God that whether in a short time or in a long time not only you but also all those who hear me today would become men such as I also am, with the exception of these bonds.’” With the king were the governor and other persons in high station. These words of Paul concerning these rulers, if not a regular prayer, were in the nature of supplication or intercession, for they constituted a “wish to God”. No conversion of the high officials followed, but their decision was favorable to Paul: “This man practices nothing deserving death or bonds”; “This man could have been released if he had not <span id="page380" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="380" data-before-text="380"></span>appealed to Caesar.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Acts 26:28-32</a>, <em>NW</em>) In this particular case Paul was subsequently released by Caesar.</p>

<strong>Nehemiah Makes Most of Opportunities</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Little is known of Nehemiah’s genealogy, aside from the fact that his father’s name was Hacaliah. However, it is quite apparent that his parents were God-fearing Jews, for the name they gave their son means “Jah is comfort”; and from Nehemiah’s own course it is clear that he had been <span id="page238" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="238" data-before-text="238"></span>brought up in the “nurture and admonition of the Lord”.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eph. 6:4</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Nehemiah was cupbearer to the king Artaxerxes III, ruler of the Persian world empire in the middle of the fifth century B.C. While Nehemiah could hardly have wished for a more honorable and lucrative position, he was one of those faithful exiles who preferred Jerusalem ‘above his chief joy’. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 137:5, 6</a>) Receiving word that some Jews had returned from Jerusalem, including his kinsman Hanani, he eagerly made inquiry, and to his sorrow learned that the survivors there were in great misery and reproach and that the walls and gates of Jerusalem were still in ruins. Hearing this bad news, Nehemiah wept, fasted, and prayed to Jehovah. In his prayer he recounted what Jehovah had promised to do for his people if, after having been scattered because of disobedience, they repented and obeyed his commandments. He claimed this promise and asked Jehovah to bless his efforts to bring this matter to the attention of the king. How Nehemiah longed to go to Jerusalem and rebuild those walls!</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Unexpectedly, the opportunity came one day as the king noticed that Nehemiah was sad, and he inquired why. He told the king of the sorry state of affairs in Jerusalem, the city of his fathers. The king gave him a sympathetic ear, and asked what he could do for him. Nehemiah, first inwardly praying to God, requested: “If it please the king, . . . send me to Judah . . . that I may rebuild it . . . and [give me] a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king’s park, that he may give me timber to furnish beams for the gates of the citadel, which belongs to the temple, and for the walls of the city, and for the house that I shall enter.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Neh. 2:1-8</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em>) Alert Nehemiah certainly made the most of this opportunity; also note that his first concern was the temple, then the walls of the city, and then his own dwelling. God answered his silent prayer, causing the king not only to grant his requests but also to provide him with an escort of army officers and horsemen.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In this Nehemiah, though doubtless without realizing it, was being used by Jehovah to bring about a fulfillment of the prophecy of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Daniel (9:25</a>) regarding the decree to rebuild Jerusalem, and which was to mark the beginning of the seventy weeks relative to the Messiah’s coming. Thus that year, 455 B.C., became an outstanding one in Bible chronology.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Three days after his arrival in Jerusalem, Nehemiah made a night inspection tour of the city’s walls, carefully examining in detail their condition. He did this secretly, for he had not yet told any man what God had put in his heart to do for Jerusalem. Gossip might misrepresent the matter. Then, evidently to a gathering of the rulers and the people, he first revealed his purpose to rebuild the walls, told of God’s blessing upon it, and of the king’s cooperation with it. Their enthusiastic response was: “Let us arise and build.” And “they took courage for the good work”. When envious neighbors questioned his motive Nehemiah replied, “The God of the heavens, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Neh. 2:11-20</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Such an extensive construction project required efficient organization, and Nehemiah made the most of this opportunity also. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">the Ne third chapter</a> of his book he records the details of all the assignments made; each group going forward with the work given to them, with the exception of the nobles of the Tekoites, who refused to bend their necks in the service of the Lord.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Noting all this activity the envious neighbors, Sanballat the Samaritan, and Tobiah the Ammonite, began to ridicule: “Will they revive the stones out of the rubbish heaps? . . . if a fox should go up he would break down their stone wall.” Looking to God, Nehemiah prayed: “Hear, O our God—for we are despised—and turn back their reproach upon their own head.” So the building work continued and soon the walls were joined together to half of their height, “for the people had a mind to work.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Neh. 4:1-6</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Seeing that ridicule did not discourage the builders, their enemies, Sanballat, Tobiah, and others, conspired to make war on Jerusalem. Ten times Nehemiah received reports to that effect from the Jews living in the outskirts of the city. But instead of quitting because of fear, Nehemiah states: “We made supplication to our God, and set a watch as a protection against them day and night.” Arming all the workmen, organizing a corp of guards and an alarm system, he encourages them: “Remember the LORD, who is great and terrible, and fight for your kinsmen,” further assuring them that “our God will fight for us”. So they continued to build in troublous times, even as was foretold, each man with a tool in one hand, and with the other he held a weapon.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Neh. 4:9-23</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Though occupied with directing such a great building project, and commanding an army as well, Nehemiah was not too busy to show his love for his humbler Jewish brethren. Hearing their complaints that they were being oppressed by the rich Jews in the matter of usury, he took action. Calling a great assembly he exposed this evil and admonished, “Ought you not to walk in the fear of our God?” Then he made them go on record that they would no longer exact interest from their poor brethren. In striking contrast with the course of these rich nobles and rulers was that of Nehemiah. “Because of the fear of God” he bore all the expenses of maintaining the governor’s mansion, which among other things involved the feeding of more than 150 men daily.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Nehemiah chapter 5</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Obviously the Lord was blessing Nehemiah, and his enemies, noting that neither sly innuendo nor ridicule nor even threat of war had any effect on him, schemed to lure him away from his work and assassinate him. But alert Nehemiah answered them: “I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down.” After four such vain attempts his foes sent a letter telling that rumors were abroad that he was plotting sedition against the king, and suggesting that he meet with them to take counsel. Immediately seeing through their schemes, he plainly told them that this was just one of their inventions. Trying still another trick, his enemies hired a Jew to warn Nehemiah that a plot was afoot to kill him and that therefore he should hide in the temple. But Nehemiah would not hear of such a thing. “Should a man like me flee?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Neh. 6:1-11</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Nehemiah, by being alert and fearless, made the most of his opportunities, permitting absolutely nothing to interfere with the great building work. As a result, in the incredibly short time of less than two months, fifty-two days, to be exact, the entire wall around Jerusalem was completed. <span id="page239" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="239" data-before-text="239"></span>And all to Jehovah’s glory: “When all our enemies heard of it, all the nations round about us feared and fell decidedly in their own esteem; for they perceived that this work had been done with the help of our God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Neh. 6:15, 16</a>, <em>An Amer.

<strong>Chronology</strong><br/><p id="p243" data-pid="243" class="sb">The next date of major importance is the 20th year of Artaxerxes (Longimanus), the year Nehemiah received permission to go and rebuild Jerusalem. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/82/0" data-bid="83-1" class="b">Ne 2:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/82/1" data-bid="83-2" class="b"> 5-8</a>) The reasons for favoring the date of 455 B.C.E. for this year as against the popular date of 445 B.C.E. are considered in the article <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/17">PERSIA, PERSIANS</a>. The events of this year that involve the rebuilding of Jerusalem and its walls mark the starting point of the prophecy concerning the “seventy weeks” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/83/0" data-bid="84-1" class="b">Daniel 9:24-27</a>. The weeks there are clearly “weeks of years” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/84/0" data-bid="85-1" class="b">Da 9:24</a>, <em>RS, AT, Mo</em>), totaling 490 years. As demonstrated under the heading <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/18">SEVENTY WEEKS</a>, the prophecy pointed to Jesus’ appearance as the Messiah in the year 29 C.E.; his death at “the half of the week” or in the middle of the last week of years, that is, in 33 C.E.; and the end of the period of God’s special favor to the Jews in 36 C.E. Thus, the 70 weeks of years closed with the conversion of Cornelius, 490 years from the year 455 B.C.E.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/85/0" data-bid="86-1" class="b">Ac 10:30-33,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/85/1" data-bid="86-2" class="b"> 44-48;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/85/2" data-bid="86-3" class="b"> 11:1</a>.</p>

<strong>Seventy Weeks</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">In Nisan (March-April) of the 20th year of Artaxerxes’ rule (455 B.C.E.), Nehemiah petitioned the king: “If your servant seems good before you, . . . send me to Judah, to <em>the city</em> of the burial places of my forefathers, that <em>I may rebuild it.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003915/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ne 2:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003915/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 5</a>) The king granted permission, and Nehemiah made the long journey from Shushan to Jerusalem. On about the fourth of Ab (July-August), after making a night inspection of the walls, Nehemiah gave the command to the Jews: “Come and let us <em>rebuild the wall of Jerusalem,</em> that we may no longer continue to be a reproach.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003915/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ne 2:11-18</a>) Thus, “the going forth of the word” to rebuild Jerusalem, as authorized by Artaxerxes, was put into effect by Nehemiah in Jerusalem that same year. This clearly establishes 455 B.C.E. as the year from which the 70 weeks would begin to count.</p>

In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">the Ne third chapter</a> of his book he records the details of all the assignments made; each group going forward with the work given to them, with the exception of the nobles of the Tekoites, who refused to bend their necks in the service of the Lord.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Noting all this activity the envious neighbors, Sanballat the Samaritan, and Tobiah the Ammonite, began to ridicule: “Will they revive the stones out of the rubbish heaps? . . . if a fox should go up he would break down their stone wall.” Looking to God, Nehemiah prayed: “Hear, O our God—for we are despised—and turn back their reproach upon their own head.” So the building work continued and soon the walls were joined together to half of their height, “for the people had a mind to work.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Neh. 4:1-6</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Seeing that ridicule did not discourage the builders, their enemies, Sanballat, Tobiah, and others, conspired to make war on Jerusalem. Ten times Nehemiah received reports to that effect from the Jews living in the outskirts of the city. But instead of quitting because of fear, Nehemiah states: “We made supplication to our God, and set a watch as a protection against them day and night.” Arming all the workmen, organizing a corp of guards and an alarm system, he encourages them: “Remember the LORD, who is great and terrible, and fight for your kinsmen,” further assuring them that “our God will fight for us”. So they continued to build in troublous times, even as was foretold, each man with a tool in one hand, and with the other he held a weapon.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Neh. 4:9-23</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Though occupied with directing such a great building project, and commanding an army as well, Nehemiah was not too busy to show his love for his humbler Jewish brethren. Hearing their complaints that they were being oppressed by the rich Jews in the matter of usury, he took action. Calling a great assembly he exposed this evil and admonished, “Ought you not to walk in the fear of our God?” Then he made them go on record that they would no longer exact interest from their poor brethren. In striking contrast with the course of these rich nobles and rulers was that of Nehemiah. “Because of the fear of God” he bore all the expenses of maintaining the governor’s mansion, which among other things involved the feeding of more than 150 men daily.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Nehemiah chapter 5</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Obviously the Lord was blessing Nehemiah, and his enemies, noting that neither sly innuendo nor ridicule nor even threat of war had any effect on him, schemed to lure him away from his work and assassinate him. But alert Nehemiah answered them: “I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down.” After four such vain attempts his foes sent a letter telling that rumors were abroad that he was plotting sedition against the king, and suggesting that he meet with them to take counsel. Immediately seeing through their schemes, he plainly told them that this was just one of their inventions. Trying still another trick, his enemies hired a Jew to warn Nehemiah that a plot was afoot to kill him and that therefore he should hide in the temple. But Nehemiah would not hear of such a thing. “Should a man like me flee?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Neh. 6:1-11</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Nehemiah, by being alert and fearless, made the most of his opportunities, permitting absolutely nothing to interfere with the great building work. As a result, in the incredibly short time of less than two months, fifty-two days, to be exact, the entire wall around Jerusalem was completed. <span id="page239" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="239" data-before-text="239"></span>And all to Jehovah’s glory: “When all our enemies heard of it, all the nations round about us feared and fell decidedly in their own esteem; for they perceived that this work had been done with the help of our God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Neh. 6:15, 16</a>, <em>An Amer.

<strong>Who Is the Messiah of the Book of Daniel?</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Although a Jewish remnant returned to Judah and Jerusalem from Babylonian exile in 537 B.C.E., the wall of the city and its gates were not rebuilt or repaired until years later. In describing the city, a delegation of Jewish exiles told Nehemiah, the Jewish cupbearer of Persian King Artaxerxes (Longimanus): “Those left over, who have been left over from the captivity, there in the jurisdictional district, are in a very bad plight and in reproach; and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its very gates have been burned with fire.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101971881/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Neh. 1:3</a>) Some months after receiving this report, Nehemiah was commissioned by King Artaxerxes to rebuild Jerusalem. This was in the month of Nisan in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes’ reign. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101971881/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Neh. 2:1-6</a>) The best historical evidence indicates that the Nisan of that twentieth year fell in 455 B.C.E.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/101971881/0">a</a> So it was with Nehemiah’s arrival at Jerusalem a number of months later in 455 B.C.E. that the word to restore and rebuild Jerusalem could take effect.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Using 455 B.C.E. as a starting point for counting the sixty-nine weeks of years (483 years), we find that a “messiah” or “anointed one” was scheduled to arrive in 29 C.E. Were the Jews expecting a “messiah” at that time? Did a “messiah” make his appearance then?</p>

<strong>Jerusalem Rebuilt for Messiah’s Coming</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Nehemiah explained the reason for his sadness to the king. When Artaxerxes asked: “What is this that you are seeking to secure?” Nehemiah offered a silent prayer to Jehovah and took courage to ask the king to send him to rebuild Jerusalem. <span id="page601" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="601" data-before-text="601"></span>The prayer was answered; King Artaxerxes was agreeable. Nehemiah relates: “So it seemed good before the king that he should send me, when I gave him the appointed time. And I went on to say to the king: ‘If to the king it does seem good, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River [Euphrates], that they may let me pass until I come to Judah; also a letter to Asaph the keeper of the park that belongs to the king, that he may give me trees to build with timber the gates of the Castle that belongs to the house, and for the wall of the city and for the house into which I am to enter.’ So the king gave them to me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Neh. 2:3-8</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">How marvelously Jehovah showed that his hand was not shortened! Just as he had foretold at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Daniel 9:25</a>, the rebuilding work was done in straitened, difficult times. Even after the king’s decree Nehemiah and his fellow builders experienced many threats and much opposition from the non-Jewish people round about. Efforts were made to draw them away from the work. Nehemiah was placed in danger of his life, but by faith and trust in Almighty God and by arming themselves for defense against attack, and by sticking to the work that God had assigned them, they built the defensive walls around Zion or Jerusalem within two months. “At length the wall came to completion on the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in fifty-two days.” (According to Nehemiah’s reckoning, the year began with Tishri and ended with Elul as the twelfth month.)—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Neh. 6:15</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>JEHOVAH’S FULFILLED PURPOSE BRINGS HAPPINESS</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Nothing could stop Jehovah’s purpose. It was a very small matter for him to push aside the bitter foes whom Satan the Devil had aroused. They were completely blind to the glorious purpose that they were fighting against and had no understanding of the tremendous importance of this rebuilding work in connection with the coming of the Promised Seed who was to bless all families of the earth. They were unknowingly fighting against an arrangement that will result finally in blessing to many of their own number.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">But Jehovah had people who loved him and his worship and who looked for Messiah’s coming. He could inspire them with the zeal and strength to do this important rebuilding work even in the straits of the times. Nehemiah relates: “And it came about that, as soon as the wall had been rebuilt, I at once set up the doors. Then there were appointed the gatekeepers and the singers and the Levites. And I went on to put in command of Jerusalem Hanani my brother and Hananiah the prince of the Castle, for he was such a trustworthy man and feared the true God more than many others.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Neh. 7:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">This was certainly the time for the greatest joy. Accordingly the next month, the month of Tishri, in the twenty-first year of Artaxerxes, the regular religious festivals for this month were celebrated: the blowing of the trumpet and the festival on the first day, the day of the new moon, the day of atonement on the tenth day and, beginning on the fifteenth day, the feast of the booths or tabernacles. Ezra the noted copyist of God’s law was there to read publicly to them the written Word of God. After the reading, Governor Nehemiah strengthened the celebrants with the words: “Do not feel hurt, for the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.” Jehovah desired his faithful people to be happy and indeed they were, as the account reads: “The sons of Israel had not done that way from the days of Joshua the son of Nun until that day, so that there came to be very great rejoicing. And there was a reading <span id="page602" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="602" data-before-text="602"></span>aloud of the book of the law of the true God day by day, from the first day until the last day; and they went on holding the festival seven days, and on the eighth day there was a solemn assembly, according to the rule.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Neh. 8:1-18</a>.</p>

<strong>A Powerful Identification of the Messiah</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">What year in the currently used Gregorian calendar would be the twentieth year of Artaxerxes? We set forth here the chronological evidence: Xerxes began to reign in December, 486 B.C.E. Since the record in the book of Esther counts the year as beginning in the spring (Nisan, or March/April), Xerxes’ first year on that calendar would end February/March, 485 <span id="page631" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="631" data-before-text="631"></span>B.C.E. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Esther 9:1</a>) Xerxes’ twelfth year ran from March/April of 475 through February/March of 474. It is possible that Xerxes lived beyond his twelfth year (that is, beyond Adar [February/March of 474] into his thirteenth year, as mentioned above). Artaxerxes succeeded him in the same year, 474. But Nehemiah’s calendar counted the year as beginning in the fall (Tishri, or September/October), so the calendar year running from Tishri 475 to Tishri 474 would be the year in which Artaxerxes’ rule began.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965762/1">b</a> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Neh. 1:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 2:1</a>) Artaxerxes’ twentieth year ran, therefore, from September/October of 456 B.C.E. through August/September of 455 B.C.E.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Nehemiah, a zealous servant of Jehovah God, was vitally interested in true worship at the place where Jehovah had put his name, the city of Jerusalem. On hearing the bad news about Jerusalem, he prayed to Jehovah, desiring to be used to bring Jerusalem relief. In the seventh month of the lunar calendar year in this same twentieth year of Artaxerxes, which would be Nisan (March/April) according to Nehemiah’s reckoning, in the year 455 B.C.E., Nehemiah as cupbearer had opportunity to present the matter, to obtain the king’s approval, as he relates: “And it came about in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him, and I as usual took up the wine and gave it to the king.” “So it seemed good before the king that he should send me, when I gave him the appointed time.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Neh. 2:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 6</a>) Nehemiah acted promptly.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Just as the ending of the seventy years of desolation of Jerusalem took place when the decree of Cyrus <em>went into effect</em> at the arrival of the Jews in Jerusalem to lay the foundation of the temple, so there would be seventy weeks of years from the time the commandment of Artaxerxes <em>took effect,</em> that is, after the Jews with Nehemiah reached Jerusalem and when he gave the orders to build the city walls. Let us see next just when the command to build the city actually took effect.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">It would take about four months to make the trip from Shushan, the king’s winter capital, to Jerusalem, placing Nehemiah’s arrival at about the beginning of the eleventh month Ab. Nehemiah rested and held conferences for three days, inspected the city walls by night, then gave orders for the building to begin. This would be about the third or fourth day of Ab, 455 B.C.E., or about July 26-27 or 27-28, 455 B.C.E., still in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes.<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965762/2">c</a> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Neh. 2:11-18</a>) It marks our starting point for the count of time given by this important prophecy of Daniel.

En-rogel is commonly suggested as its alternate name. This could well be, for though En-rogel is a considerable distance down the Kidron Valley, the account simply says that Nehemiah passed “in front of the Fountain,” and this could mean by the corner of the wall facing En-rogel and within sight of, but still some distance from, the fountain.​—See <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001560/0">EN-ROGEL</a>.</p>

<strong>Gate, Gateway</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The Gate of the Old City was located on the NW side of the city between the Fish Gate and the Gate of Ephraim. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Neh. 3:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/51/1" data-bid="52-2" class="b"> 12:39</a>) In Hebrew, the gate is called simply “Gate of the Old,” the word “city” being supplied by some translators. It is suggested that the name was derived from its having been the main N entrance to the old city. It may have been at the junction of the Broad Wall (that formed a N boundary of the old city) and the S end of the W wall of the second quarter. Some think that this gate is identical with the “First Gate” mentioned by Zechariah. He seemingly refers to the E-W limits of the city in saying “from [1] the gate of Benjamin <span id="page626" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="626" data-before-text="626"></span>all the way to the place of [2] the First Gate, all the way to [3] the Corner Gate,” and to the N-S limits in saying “from the Tower of Hananel all the way to the press vats of the king.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Zech. 14:10</a>) If so, this places the First Gate E of the Corner Gate, possibly naming, from E to W, (1) the gate in or near the E corner, (2) the gate at the angle where the walls of the second quarter and the old city meet, and (3) the gate in the NW corner of the old city wall. Hence this would allow for the above-suggested identity of the First Gate with the Gate of the Old City. Others would connect the Gate of the Old City with the “Middle Gate” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Jeremiah 39:3</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong><em>Gate of Ephraim</em></strong></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">The Gate of Ephraim was located in the Broad Wall 400 cubits (c. 583 feet [c. 178 meters]) E of the Corner Gate.

Uzziah built a tower by this gate; whether or not it was the Tower of the Bake Ovens is not stated.

The Corner Gate does not appear in Nehemiah’s accounts; again the reason may be that it did not need extensive repairs. The account does speak of repairing the Tower of the Bake Ovens, which seems to have been a part of, or near, the Corner Gate.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Neh. 3:11</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="ss"><strong><em>Valley Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">At the SW corner of the city wall, the Valley Gate led to the Valley of Hinnom, and corresponds to the modern Jaffa Gate.

Also, there may have been a potter’s industry near this gate, for there was clay nearby in the Valley of Hinnom as well as a water supply at the mouth of the Tyropean valley and at the spring En-rogel. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/70/0" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Jeremiah 18:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/70/1" data-bid="71-2" class="b"> 19:1, 2</a>.)

They reach this conclusion from the account of Athaliah’s execution, which reports that, on being led out of the Temple by the soldiers, “she came to the entry of the horse gate of the king’s house.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/77/0" data-bid="78-1" class="b">2 Chron. 23:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/77/1" data-bid="78-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 11:16</a>) However, this was likely an entry just to the precincts of the royal palace and not the Horse Gate through which the horses passed in and out of the city itself. Nehemiah definitely includes the Horse Gate in his reconstruction description, indicating that it was a gate in the city wall. It was probably located near the SE corner of the Temple-palace area.

<strong>Gate, Gateway</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The Gate of the Old City was located on the NW side of the city between the Fish Gate and the Gate of Ephraim. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Neh. 3:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/51/1" data-bid="52-2" class="b"> 12:39</a>) In Hebrew, the gate is called simply “Gate of the Old,” the word “city” being supplied by some translators. It is suggested that the name was derived from its having been the main N entrance to the old city. It may have been at the junction of the Broad Wall (that formed a N boundary of the old city) and the S end of the W wall of the second quarter. Some think that this gate is identical with the “First Gate” mentioned by Zechariah. He seemingly refers to the E-W limits of the city in saying “from [1] the gate of Benjamin <span id="page626" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="626" data-before-text="626"></span>all the way to the place of [2] the First Gate, all the way to [3] the Corner Gate,” and to the N-S limits in saying “from the Tower of Hananel all the way to the press vats of the king.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Zech. 14:10</a>) If so, this places the First Gate E of the Corner Gate, possibly naming, from E to W, (1) the gate in or near the E corner, (2) the gate at the angle where the walls of the second quarter and the old city meet, and (3) the gate in the NW corner of the old city wall. Hence this would allow for the above-suggested identity of the First Gate with the Gate of the Old City. Others would connect the Gate of the Old City with the “Middle Gate” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Jeremiah 39:3</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong><em>Gate of Ephraim</em></strong></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">The Gate of Ephraim was located in the Broad Wall 400 cubits (c. 583 feet [c. 178 meters]) E of the Corner Gate.

It, too, has been identified by some researchers with the Middle Gate (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Jer. 39:3</a>), by others with the First Gate.

There was a public square near the Gate of Ephraim, in which the people made booths to celebrate the Festival of Booths in Nehemiah’s time.

Uzziah built a tower by this gate; whether or not it was the Tower of the Bake Ovens is not stated. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:9</a>) Both Jeremiah and Zechariah appear to refer to the Corner Gate as being on the western edge of the city. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/60/0" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Jer. 31:38;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/60/1" data-bid="61-2" class="b"> Zech. 14:10</a>) Some think the Corner Gate is the same as the First Gate, but the statement in the book of Zechariah seems to weigh against this view as to its location, for, apparently describing the E-W limits, Zechariah wrote, “from the gate of Benjamin all the way to the place of the First Gate, all the way to the Corner Gate,” thus evidently placing the First Gate E of the Corner Gate.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">There is no other gate described as existing in the W wall from the Corner Gate to the Valley Gate at the S end, this no doubt being because of the steep slope of the Hinnom valley, making any other gate impractical. The Corner Gate does not appear in Nehemiah’s accounts; again the reason may be that it did not need extensive repairs. The account does speak of repairing the Tower of the Bake Ovens, which seems to have been a part of, or near, the Corner Gate.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Neh. 3:11</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="ss"><strong><em>Valley Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">At the SW corner of the city wall, the Valley Gate led to the Valley of Hinnom, and corresponds to the modern Jaffa Gate. Josephus’ “Gate of the Essenes” may have been located here or nearby. Uzziah, in his city-fortification program, built a tower by this gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/62/0" data-bid="63-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:9</a>) It was from the Valley Gate that Nehemiah went out for his inspection of the damaged wall, riding eastward through the Valley of Hinnom and then up the Kidron valley, finally reentering the city by the same gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/63/0" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Neh. 2:13-15</a>) Although not named as such, the Valley Gate appears to be the point at which the inauguration procession started, one group marching counterclockwise around the walls past the Gate of the Ash-heaps and the other clockwise past the Corner Gate and the Tower of the Bake Ovens.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Neh. 12:31-40</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="ss"><strong><em>Gate of the Ash-heaps</em></strong></p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">This gate is also known as the <em>Gate of the Potsherds,</em> and is usually called the <em>Dung Gate</em>.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/66/0" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Neh. 3:13, 14</a>) It was at the SE corner of the city wall, and led to the Valley of Hinnom near the point where it joined the Tyropean valley. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/67/0" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Jer. 19:2</a>) It was from this gate that Topheth in the Valley of Hinnom was reached by those idolatrously burning their children in the fire to Baal.

Also, there may have been a potter’s industry near this gate, for there was clay nearby in the Valley of Hinnom as well as a water supply at the mouth of the Tyropean valley and at the spring En-rogel. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/70/0" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Jeremiah 18:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/70/1" data-bid="71-2" class="b"> 19:1, 2</a>.)

This gate was near Ophel, not far from the Temple area.

They reach this conclusion from the account of Athaliah’s execution, which reports that, on being led out of the Temple by the soldiers, “she came to the entry of the horse gate of the king’s house.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/77/0" data-bid="78-1" class="b">2 Chron. 23:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/77/1" data-bid="78-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 11:16</a>) However, this was likely an entry just to the precincts of the royal palace and not the Horse Gate through which the horses passed in and out of the city itself. Nehemiah definitely includes the Horse Gate in his reconstruction description, indicating that it was a gate in the city wall. It was probably located near the SE corner of the Temple-palace area.

<strong>Nehemiah Makes Most of Opportunities</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Little is known of Nehemiah’s genealogy, aside from the fact that his father’s name was Hacaliah. However, it is quite apparent that his parents were God-fearing Jews, for the name they gave their son means “Jah is comfort”; and from Nehemiah’s own course it is clear that he had been <span id="page238" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="238" data-before-text="238"></span>brought up in the “nurture and admonition of the Lord”.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eph. 6:4</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Nehemiah was cupbearer to the king Artaxerxes III, ruler of the Persian world empire in the middle of the fifth century B.C. While Nehemiah could hardly have wished for a more honorable and lucrative position, he was one of those faithful exiles who preferred Jerusalem ‘above his chief joy’. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 137:5, 6</a>) Receiving word that some Jews had returned from Jerusalem, including his kinsman Hanani, he eagerly made inquiry, and to his sorrow learned that the survivors there were in great misery and reproach and that the walls and gates of Jerusalem were still in ruins. Hearing this bad news, Nehemiah wept, fasted, and prayed to Jehovah. In his prayer he recounted what Jehovah had promised to do for his people if, after having been scattered because of disobedience, they repented and obeyed his commandments. He claimed this promise and asked Jehovah to bless his efforts to bring this matter to the attention of the king. How Nehemiah longed to go to Jerusalem and rebuild those walls!</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Unexpectedly, the opportunity came one day as the king noticed that Nehemiah was sad, and he inquired why. He told the king of the sorry state of affairs in Jerusalem, the city of his fathers. The king gave him a sympathetic ear, and asked what he could do for him. Nehemiah, first inwardly praying to God, requested: “If it please the king, . . . send me to Judah . . . that I may rebuild it . . . and [give me] a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king’s park, that he may give me timber to furnish beams for the gates of the citadel, which belongs to the temple, and for the walls of the city, and for the house that I shall enter.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Neh. 2:1-8</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em>) Alert Nehemiah certainly made the most of this opportunity; also note that his first concern was the temple, then the walls of the city, and then his own dwelling. God answered his silent prayer, causing the king not only to grant his requests but also to provide him with an escort of army officers and horsemen.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In this Nehemiah, though doubtless without realizing it, was being used by Jehovah to bring about a fulfillment of the prophecy of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Daniel (9:25</a>) regarding the decree to rebuild Jerusalem, and which was to mark the beginning of the seventy weeks relative to the Messiah’s coming. Thus that year, 455 B.C., became an outstanding one in Bible chronology.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Three days after his arrival in Jerusalem, Nehemiah made a night inspection tour of the city’s walls, carefully examining in detail their condition. He did this secretly, for he had not yet told any man what God had put in his heart to do for Jerusalem. Gossip might misrepresent the matter. Then, evidently to a gathering of the rulers and the people, he first revealed his purpose to rebuild the walls, told of God’s blessing upon it, and of the king’s cooperation with it. Their enthusiastic response was: “Let us arise and build.” And “they took courage for the good work”. When envious neighbors questioned his motive Nehemiah replied, “The God of the heavens, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Neh. 2:11-20</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Such an extensive construction project required efficient organization, and Nehemiah made the most of this opportunity also. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">the Ne third chapter</a> of his book he records the details of all the assignments made; each group going forward with the work given to them, with the exception of the nobles of the Tekoites, who refused to bend their necks in the service of the Lord.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Noting all this activity the envious neighbors, Sanballat the Samaritan, and Tobiah the Ammonite, began to ridicule: “Will they revive the stones out of the rubbish heaps? . . . if a fox should go up he would break down their stone wall.” Looking to God, Nehemiah prayed: “Hear, O our God—for we are despised—and turn back their reproach upon their own head.” So the building work continued and soon the walls were joined together to half of their height, “for the people had a mind to work.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Neh. 4:1-6</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Seeing that ridicule did not discourage the builders, their enemies, Sanballat, Tobiah, and others, conspired to make war on Jerusalem. Ten times Nehemiah received reports to that effect from the Jews living in the outskirts of the city. But instead of quitting because of fear, Nehemiah states: “We made supplication to our God, and set a watch as a protection against them day and night.” Arming all the workmen, organizing a corp of guards and an alarm system, he encourages them: “Remember the LORD, who is great and terrible, and fight for your kinsmen,” further assuring them that “our God will fight for us”. So they continued to build in troublous times, even as was foretold, each man with a tool in one hand, and with the other he held a weapon.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Neh. 4:9-23</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Though occupied with directing such a great building project, and commanding an army as well, Nehemiah was not too busy to show his love for his humbler Jewish brethren. Hearing their complaints that they were being oppressed by the rich Jews in the matter of usury, he took action. Calling a great assembly he exposed this evil and admonished, “Ought you not to walk in the fear of our God?” Then he made them go on record that they would no longer exact interest from their poor brethren. In striking contrast with the course of these rich nobles and rulers was that of Nehemiah. “Because of the fear of God” he bore all the expenses of maintaining the governor’s mansion, which among other things involved the feeding of more than 150 men daily.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Nehemiah chapter 5</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Obviously the Lord was blessing Nehemiah, and his enemies, noting that neither sly innuendo nor ridicule nor even threat of war had any effect on him, schemed to lure him away from his work and assassinate him. But alert Nehemiah answered them: “I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down.” After four such vain attempts his foes sent a letter telling that rumors were abroad that he was plotting sedition against the king, and suggesting that he meet with them to take counsel. Immediately seeing through their schemes, he plainly told them that this was just one of their inventions. Trying still another trick, his enemies hired a Jew to warn Nehemiah that a plot was afoot to kill him and that therefore he should hide in the temple. But Nehemiah would not hear of such a thing. “Should a man like me flee?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Neh. 6:1-11</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Nehemiah, by being alert and fearless, made the most of his opportunities, permitting absolutely nothing to interfere with the great building work. As a result, in the incredibly short time of less than two months, fifty-two days, to be exact, the entire wall around Jerusalem was completed. <span id="page239" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="239" data-before-text="239"></span>And all to Jehovah’s glory: “When all our enemies heard of it, all the nations round about us feared and fell decidedly in their own esteem; for they perceived that this work had been done with the help of our God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Neh. 6:15, 16</a>, <em>An Amer.

<strong>Seventy Weeks</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">In Nisan (March-April) of the 20th year of Artaxerxes’ rule (455 B.C.E.), Nehemiah petitioned the king: “If your servant seems good before you, . . . send me to Judah, to <em>the city</em> of the burial places of my forefathers, that <em>I may rebuild it.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003915/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ne 2:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003915/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 5</a>) The king granted permission, and Nehemiah made the long journey from Shushan to Jerusalem. On about the fourth of Ab (July-August), after making a night inspection of the walls, Nehemiah gave the command to the Jews: “Come and let us <em>rebuild the wall of Jerusalem,</em> that we may no longer continue to be a reproach.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003915/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ne 2:11-18</a>) Thus, “the going forth of the word” to rebuild Jerusalem, as authorized by Artaxerxes, was put into effect by Nehemiah in Jerusalem that same year. This clearly establishes 455 B.C.E. as the year from which the 70 weeks would begin to count.</p>

<strong>A Powerful Identification of the Messiah</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">What year in the currently used Gregorian calendar would be the twentieth year of Artaxerxes? We set forth here the chronological evidence: Xerxes began to reign in December, 486 B.C.E. Since the record in the book of Esther counts the year as beginning in the spring (Nisan, or March/April), Xerxes’ first year on that calendar would end February/March, 485 <span id="page631" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="631" data-before-text="631"></span>B.C.E. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Esther 9:1</a>) Xerxes’ twelfth year ran from March/April of 475 through February/March of 474. It is possible that Xerxes lived beyond his twelfth year (that is, beyond Adar [February/March of 474] into his thirteenth year, as mentioned above). Artaxerxes succeeded him in the same year, 474. But Nehemiah’s calendar counted the year as beginning in the fall (Tishri, or September/October), so the calendar year running from Tishri 475 to Tishri 474 would be the year in which Artaxerxes’ rule began.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965762/1">b</a> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Neh. 1:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 2:1</a>) Artaxerxes’ twentieth year ran, therefore, from September/October of 456 B.C.E. through August/September of 455 B.C.E.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Nehemiah, a zealous servant of Jehovah God, was vitally interested in true worship at the place where Jehovah had put his name, the city of Jerusalem. On hearing the bad news about Jerusalem, he prayed to Jehovah, desiring to be used to bring Jerusalem relief. In the seventh month of the lunar calendar year in this same twentieth year of Artaxerxes, which would be Nisan (March/April) according to Nehemiah’s reckoning, in the year 455 B.C.E., Nehemiah as cupbearer had opportunity to present the matter, to obtain the king’s approval, as he relates: “And it came about in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him, and I as usual took up the wine and gave it to the king.” “So it seemed good before the king that he should send me, when I gave him the appointed time.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Neh. 2:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 6</a>) Nehemiah acted promptly.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Just as the ending of the seventy years of desolation of Jerusalem took place when the decree of Cyrus <em>went into effect</em> at the arrival of the Jews in Jerusalem to lay the foundation of the temple, so there would be seventy weeks of years from the time the commandment of Artaxerxes <em>took effect,</em> that is, after the Jews with Nehemiah reached Jerusalem and when he gave the orders to build the city walls. Let us see next just when the command to build the city actually took effect.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">It would take about four months to make the trip from Shushan, the king’s winter capital, to Jerusalem, placing Nehemiah’s arrival at about the beginning of the eleventh month Ab. Nehemiah rested and held conferences for three days, inspected the city walls by night, then gave orders for the building to begin. This would be about the third or fourth day of Ab, 455 B.C.E., or about July 26-27 or 27-28, 455 B.C.E., still in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes.<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965762/2">c</a> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Neh. 2:11-18</a>) It marks our starting point for the count of time given by this important prophecy of Daniel. This is when the <span id="page632" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="632" data-before-text="632"></span>commandment to restore and rebuild Jerusalem <em>took effect.</em><a id="footnotesource4" data-fnid="4" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965762/3">d</a></p>
