<strong>Joel, Book of</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The Jews did not question the canonicity of the book of Joel but placed it second among the “Minor Prophets.” It also harmonizes completely with the rest of the Scriptures, as evident from the numerous parallels between Joel and other Bible books.

Thus, there was a Jewish colony in Elephantine (Egyptian, <em>Yeb</em>), an island in the Nile near Aswan, some 690 km (430 mi) S of Cairo. A valuable find of papyri reveals conditions prevailing there during the fifth century B.C.E., about the time when Ezra and Nehemiah were active in Jerusalem.

He was slain by Darius, who reigned nineteen years.” (<em>Diodorus of Sicily,</em> XII, 71, 1) The original name of this Darius (known as Darius II) was Ochus, but he adopted the name Darius upon becoming king.

Darius, with the aid of six other Persian nobles, slew Gaumata and gained the throne, the account of this being set forth in three languages in the immense Behistun Inscription that Darius had carved on sheer cliffs facing a plain through which ran the principal caravan route from Baghdad to Teheran. According to the inscription Gaumata was a usurper, posing as Cambyses’ brother who had been put to death. Most modern authorities accept this account (which is laced with repeated assurances by Darius that “it is true and not lies”) as basically factual, while some believe that Darius was a “monumental liar” and that the evidence indicates him to be the actual usurper. Whatever the case, Darius was faced with an empire in revolt upon assuming the kingship and is considered as having spent the next two years in subduing the insurrectionary elements throughout the realm. Egypt, which had thrown off the Persian yoke, was reconquered by Darius about 519-518 B.C.E. Thereafter he extended the imperial borders into India in the E and into Thrace and Macedonia in the W. He is noted as well for his <span id="page422" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="422" data-before-text="422"></span>efficient reorganization of the administrative structure throughout the empire, the formation of an imperial law code, called the “Ordinance of Good Regulations,” and for having reopened the canal connecting the Nile River of Egypt with the Red Sea.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">It is particularly with regard to the rebuilding of the temple at Jerusalem that Darius Hystaspis figures in the Bible record. The temple work had begun in 537 B.C.E. but about 522 it came under ban and “continued stopped until the second year of the reign of Darius” (520/519). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ezra 4:4, 5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 24</a>) During this year the prophets Haggai and Zechariah stirred up the Jews to renew the construction and the work got under way again. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ezra 5:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> Hag. 1:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/27/2" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> 14, 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/27/3" data-bid="28-4" class="b"> Zech. 1:1</a>) This provoked an inquiry and the sending of a letter to Persian King Darius by Tattenai, the governor representing the imperial interests in the region W of the Euphrates, and other officials, advising him of the construction work, setting forth the Jews’ claim for the legality of the project, and requesting an investigation in the royal archives to see if there existed written evidence to substantiate that claim. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ezra 5:3-17</a>) The Jewish declaration that contrasted the actions of the Chaldean Nebuchadnezzar, as the destroyer of the temple, with the Persian Cyrus, as the one authorizing its reconstruction, should have had an appropriate and felicitous effect on Darius since, in the first years of his reign, he had to overcome two revolts by rebels each taking the name Nebuchadnezzar (called Nebuchadnezzar III and Nebuchadnezzar IV by historians), claiming to be sons of Nabonidus, and endeavoring to make Babylon independent of the Persian Empire.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">The official search of records in the archives at Ecbatana, the ancient Median capital, uncovered the document by Cyrus. Darius thereupon sent orders to Governor Tattenai that he and the other officials should not only refrain from interfering with the temple work but also provide building funds from the “royal treasury of the tax beyond the River,” as well as animals and other necessary supplies for the sacrificial offerings. Anyone violating the king’s order was to be impaled on a stake and his house “turned into a public privy.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ezra 6:1-12</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">With this official cooperation, and with continued prophetical encouragement (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Zech. 7:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 8:1-9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/30/2" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> 20-23</a>), the temple work went on to successful completion by the “sixth year of the reign of Darius” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ezra 6:13-15</a>; probably by March 5/6 of 515 B.C.E.). Since Darius’ inscriptions show him to be a devoted worshiper of Ahura Mazda, it is evident that his action, though serving Jehovah God’s purpose and doubtless having his direction, was basically done out of respect for the irrevocable nature of the Medo-Persian laws and in harmony with a policy of tolerance by Darius’ government, evidence for which tolerance is found in some of his inscriptions.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="ss"><strong>LATER CAMPAIGNS IN GREECE</strong></p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">Toward the turn of the century, various Greek cities of Ionia revolted against Persian domination and, though their revolt was quelled, Darius determined to punish Athens and Eretria for their having rendered aid to the rebellious cities. This led to a Persian invasion of Greece, resulting, however, in defeat of Darius’ forces at the battle of Marathon in 490 B.C.E. Though Darius made careful preparations for a further Grecian campaign, he was unable to carry it out before his death in 486 B.C.E. He was succeeded by his son Xerxes.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">3. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Nehemiah 12:22</a> mentions the recording of Levitical heads of paternal houses “in the days of Eliashib, Joiada and Johanan and Jaddua . . . down till the kingship of Darius the Persian.” Since Eliashib was high priest at the time of Nehemiah’s return to Jerusalem (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Neh. 3:1</a>) and since by the time of Nehemiah’s second visit to that city (during or following the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes [c. 443 B.C.E.]) Joiada had a married son (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Neh. 13:28</a>), it is likely that the “Darius” mentioned was Darius II, Ochus (also called Nothus, the “illegitimate son” of Artaxerxes I), who ruled from 423 to 404 B.C.E.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">A letter found among the Elephantine Papyri, reckoned as dating from the last years of the fifth century B.C.E., makes reference to “Johanan” as high priest at Jerusalem at that time.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">4. Darius III (surnamed Codomannus), the last king of the Persian Empire. He became king in 336 B.C.E., the same year Alexander the Great was crowned king of Macedonia. Though Darius III is not mentioned directly in the Bible account, he, as the head of the Persian Empire, experienced the fulfillment of Daniel’s prophecy concerning the two-horned ram (representing Medo-Persia) and the powerful he-goat (representing the Grecian kingdom). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Dan. 8:2-7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/35/1" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> 20, 21</a>) Darius III was able to effect the reconquest of Egypt, but when he later (334 B.C.E.) marched against the swiftly advancing forces of Alexander he met defeat at the Granicus River in the northwestern corner of Asia Minor. The Persian forces withdrew and prepared for another attempt at halting Alexander’s advances, this time engaging the Greek forces on the narrow plain of Issus, at the point where Asia Minor and Syria join. Again Alexander routed the Persians and, two years later (331), the final battle was fought at Gaugamela, not far from the ruins of ancient Nineveh on the Tigris River. Utterly defeated, Darius took flight but was murdered by a satrap of the Persian Empire in the year 330 B.C.E. Thus, the Medo-Persian Empire had “no deliverer out of its [the symbolic he-goat’s] hand.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011096/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Dan. 8:7</a>; see PERSIA, PERSIANS.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Persia, Persians</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The Greek stories of the end of Xerxes’ reign revolve around marital difficulties, disorders in the harem, and a supposed dominance of Xerxes by certain of his courtiers. These traditional accounts may reflect, though in a very confused and twisted way, some of the basic facts of the book of Esther, including the deposing of Queen Vashti and her replacement by Esther, and also the ascension of Mordecai to a position of great authority in the realm. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Esther 2:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 10:3</a>) According to the secular accounts, Xerxes was assassinated by one of his courtiers. While most secular authorities present 466/465 B.C.E. <span id="page1295" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1295" data-before-text="1295"></span>as the date of his death, thereby giving him a rule of some twenty-one years, an earlier date of 475/474 B.C.E. accords with the Bible record and has creditable testimony in its favor from certain of the ancient secular historians.—See ARTAXERXES No. 3.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong><em>Artaxerxes (Longimanus) to Darius II</em></strong></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">The reign of Xerxes’ successor, Artaxerxes’ (Longimanus), is notable for his authorization of Ezra’s return to Jerusalem with a large contribution for the support of the temple there. This occurred in Artaxerxes, seventh year (469/468 B.C.E. according to the above-mentioned dating). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ezra 7:1-26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 8:24-36</a>) Some have assumed the reference to “a stone wall in Judah and in Jerusalem” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ezra 9:9</a>) to mean that Ezra was commissioned by Artaxerxes to rebuild the city walls. However, the Hebrew term does not necessarily refer to a massive wall, such as surrounded a city, but often describes a wall such as encompassed a vineyard (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Num. 22:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Isa. 5:5</a>) or lined a courtyard.

Darius II, Artaxerxes’ son by a concubine, succeeded to the throne after Xerxes II was murdered. His original name was Ochus but he adopted the name Darius upon becoming king in 423 B.C.E., according to secular history. He seems to be the “Darius” referred to at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Nehemiah 12:22</a>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="ss"><strong><em>Papyrus documents of Biblical significance</em></strong></p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">A considerable number of papyrus documents were written in Aramaic by a Jewish colony in Elephantine, an island in the Nile River near Syene (Aswan) Egypt, and these have been recovered and are dated by secular historians as from the reign of Darius I (beginning about 521 B.C.E.) to at least the reign of Darius II (c. 423-404 B.C.E.). The names “Sanballat” and “Johanan” occur in them and are thought to refer to those persons bearing the same names mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Nehemiah 4:1 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 12:22</a>. These papyri demonstrate the accuracy with which the books of Ezra and Nehemiah depict conditions and official communications during the Persian rule. As Professor Wright states: “Now . . . we are able to see that the Aramaic of Ezra is precisely that of its age, while the government documents are of the general type which we have become accustomed to associate with the Persian regime.” (<em>Biblical Archaeology,</em> p. 208) One document, credited to Darius II, contains a royal order concerning the celebration of the Passover by the Jewish colony in Egypt.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="ss"><strong>DOWN TO THE FALL AND DIVISION OF THE EMPIRE</strong></p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">Following Darius II came Artaxerxes II (called Mnemon), during whose reign Egypt revolted and relations with Greece deteriorated. His reign (dated as from 404 to 358 B.C.E.) was followed by that of his son Artaxerxes III (also called Ochus), who is credited with some twenty-one years of rule (358-338/37 B.C.E.) and is said to be the most bloodthirsty of all the Persian rulers. His major feat was the reconquest of Egypt. Secular history then gives a two-year rule for Arses and a five-year rule for Darius III (Codomannus), during whose reign Philip of Macedonia was murdered (336 B.C.E.) and succeeded by his son Alexander. In 334 B.C.E. Alexander began his attack on the Persian Empire, defeating the Persian forces first at Granicus in the NW corner of Asia Minor and again at Issus at the opposite corner of Asia Minor (333 B.C.E.). Finally, after the Greeks had conquered Phoenicia and Egypt, the Persians’ last stand, at Gaugamela in 331 B.C.E., was crushed and the Persian Empire came to its end.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">Following Alexander’s death and the subsequent division of the empire, Seleucus Nicator obtained control of the major portion of the Asiatic territories with Persia as its central part. The Seleucid dynasty of kings, thus begun, continued until 64 B.C.E. Seleucus Nicator seems to be the one with whom the prophetic figure of the “king of the north” of Daniel’s prophecy first begins to manifest itself, opposing the Ptolemaic line of kings in Egypt, who initially appear to fill the role of the symbolic “king of the south.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Dan. 11:4-6</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">The Seleucid kings were restricted to the western part of their domain by the incursions of the Parthians, who conquered the territory of Persia proper during the third and second centuries B.C.E. They were defeated by the Sasanians in 226 C.E. and the Sasanian rule continued until the Arab conquest in 642.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">The prophecy of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Ezekiel (27:10</a>) includes Persians among the men of war serving in the military force of wealthy Tyre, and contributing to its splendor.

Jehoiachin had sons at Babylon, Shealtiel, Malchiram, Pedaiah, Shenazzar, Jekamiah, Hoshama and Nedabiah.

The timing of the enforcement of Jehovah’s prophecy here is remarkable. For it was in this seventh month Ethanim, on the tenth day, the day of atonement, that the trumpet was blown in a Jubilee year to “proclaim liberty in the land to all its inhabitants.” It began a sabbath year for the God-given land.

The land was to enjoy, figuratively, a perfect number of sabbath years—seventy, during which time it was to be utterly desolate, without human inhabitant, a place to be shunned like a haunted place by passers-by.

<strong>Jerusalem Rebuilt for Messiah’s Coming</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">This was certainly the time for the greatest joy. Accordingly the next month, the month of Tishri, in the twenty-first year of Artaxerxes, the regular religious festivals for this month were celebrated: the blowing of the trumpet and the festival on the first day, the day of the new moon, the day of atonement on the tenth day and, beginning on the fifteenth day, the feast of the booths or tabernacles. Ezra the noted copyist of God’s law was there to read publicly to them the written Word of God. After the reading, Governor Nehemiah strengthened the celebrants with the words: “Do not feel hurt, for the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.” Jehovah desired his faithful people to be happy and indeed they were, as the account reads: “The sons of Israel had not done that way from the days of Joshua the son of Nun until that day, so that there came to be very great rejoicing. And there was a reading <span id="page602" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="602" data-before-text="602"></span>aloud of the book of the law of the true God day by day, from the first day until the last day; and they went on holding the festival seven days, and on the eighth day there was a solemn assembly, according to the rule.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Neh. 8:1-18</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Though the account of the inauguration of the walls is not recorded until farther along in the book of Nehemiah, yet it probably took place after the above-mentioned religious ceremony. It enabled the Israelites to extend beyond the festivals the expression of their rejoicing that overflowed. We read: “At the inauguration of the wall of Jerusalem they looked for the Levites, to bring them out of all their places to Jerusalem to carry on an inauguration and a rejoicing even with thanksgivings and with song, cymbals and stringed instruments and with harps.” It was a colorful inauguration with two processions formed to march in opposite directions on the finished wall. The wall had not a break in it. “At length the two thanksgiving choirs came to a stand at the house of the true God, also,” says Nehemiah, “I and half of the deputy rulers with me, and the priests . . . And the singers with Izrahiah the overseer kept making themselves heard.” Following this the celebrators went to the temple on Mount Moriah and great sacrifices were joyfully offered on Jehovah’s altar. “For the true God himself caused them to rejoice with great joy. And also the women and the children themselves rejoiced, so that the rejoicing of Jerusalem could be heard far away.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Neh. 12:27-43</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">How marvelously Jehovah God showed his power to bring about his purposes! What a victory over Satan the Devil and what a humiliation to the opposers to Jehovah’s true worship! What spiritual strengthening for the faithful Jewish remnant there at Jerusalem! They were doubly sure of Jehovah’s loving-kindness and the certainty of his purposes. With what confidence and zeal they could sing God’s praises and relate to their children and to others God’s marvelous works! Even they at that time could not fully understand the marvelous part they played in God’s purposes. But how they will rejoice when they come back in a resurrection at the hands of the Messiah for whom they looked and when they find the part that Jehovah allowed them to play in the development of his purposes concerning the great Messiah, the Seed of promise!</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">By gathering his people back to Jerusalem, God kept a nation intact to whom the Messiah came. Much of the Messiah’s preaching was done in the temple area, where many who came up to worship Jehovah could hear and be among his first followers. Outside its gates he gave his life in sacrifice for mankind. Truly, it was an essential part of God’s purpose for Jerusalem to be restored after its desolation by Babylon. But there is another very important factor with regard to these events and Daniel’s prophecy concerning them. That is the <em>time</em> of their occurrence. It provides us with one of the most accurate identifications of the Messiah. It helps all believers in the Hebrew Scriptures, Jew or Gentile, to prove for themselves features of the ministry of God’s promised Messiah that can lead to their salvation. This important subject will be discussed in our next issue.</p>

<strong>Gate, Gateway</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The Gate of the Old City was located on the NW side of the city between the Fish Gate and the Gate of Ephraim. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Neh. 3:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/51/1" data-bid="52-2" class="b"> 12:39</a>) In Hebrew, the gate is called simply “Gate of the Old,” the word “city” being supplied by some translators. It is suggested that the name was derived from its having been the main N entrance to the old city. It may have been at the junction of the Broad Wall (that formed a N boundary of the old city) and the S end of the W wall of the second quarter. Some think that this gate is identical with the “First Gate” mentioned by Zechariah. He seemingly refers to the E-W limits of the city in saying “from [1] the gate of Benjamin <span id="page626" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="626" data-before-text="626"></span>all the way to the place of [2] the First Gate, all the way to [3] the Corner Gate,” and to the N-S limits in saying “from the Tower of Hananel all the way to the press vats of the king.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Zech. 14:10</a>) If so, this places the First Gate E of the Corner Gate, possibly naming, from E to W, (1) the gate in or near the E corner, (2) the gate at the angle where the walls of the second quarter and the old city meet, and (3) the gate in the NW corner of the old city wall. Hence this would allow for the above-suggested identity of the First Gate with the Gate of the Old City. Others would connect the Gate of the Old City with the “Middle Gate” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Jeremiah 39:3</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong><em>Gate of Ephraim</em></strong></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">The Gate of Ephraim was located in the Broad Wall 400 cubits (c. 583 feet [c. 178 meters]) E of the Corner Gate.

It, too, has been identified by some researchers with the Middle Gate (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Jer. 39:3</a>), by others with the First Gate.

There was a public square near the Gate of Ephraim, in which the people made booths to celebrate the Festival of Booths in Nehemiah’s time. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Neh. 8:16</a>) This gate is not named in Nehemiah’s reconstruction text, evidently because it did not need extensive repairs.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="ss"><strong><em>Corner Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">This gate was evidently located in the NW angle of the city wall, 400 cubits (c. 583 feet [c. 178 meters]) along the Broad Wall W of the Gate of Ephraim. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/58/0" data-bid="59-1" class="b">2 Ki. 14:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/58/1" data-bid="59-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 25:23</a>) It was on the E side of the Valley of Hinnom, apparently in the W wall of the old city at the point where it joined the Broad Wall. Uzziah built a tower by this gate; whether or not it was the Tower of the Bake Ovens is not stated. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:9</a>) Both Jeremiah and Zechariah appear to refer to the Corner Gate as being on the western edge of the city. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/60/0" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Jer. 31:38;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/60/1" data-bid="61-2" class="b"> Zech. 14:10</a>) Some think the Corner Gate is the same as the First Gate, but the statement in the book of Zechariah seems to weigh against this view as to its location, for, apparently describing the E-W limits, Zechariah wrote, “from the gate of Benjamin all the way to the place of the First Gate, all the way to the Corner Gate,” thus evidently placing the First Gate E of the Corner Gate.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">There is no other gate described as existing in the W wall from the Corner Gate to the Valley Gate at the S end, this no doubt being because of the steep slope of the Hinnom valley, making any other gate impractical. The Corner Gate does not appear in Nehemiah’s accounts; again the reason may be that it did not need extensive repairs. The account does speak of repairing the Tower of the Bake Ovens, which seems to have been a part of, or near, the Corner Gate.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Neh. 3:11</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="ss"><strong><em>Valley Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">At the SW corner of the city wall, the Valley Gate led to the Valley of Hinnom, and corresponds to the modern Jaffa Gate. Josephus’ “Gate of the Essenes” may have been located here or nearby. Uzziah, in his city-fortification program, built a tower by this gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/62/0" data-bid="63-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:9</a>) It was from the Valley Gate that Nehemiah went out for his inspection of the damaged wall, riding eastward through the Valley of Hinnom and then up the Kidron valley, finally reentering the city by the same gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/63/0" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Neh. 2:13-15</a>) Although not named as such, the Valley Gate appears to be the point at which the inauguration procession started, one group marching counterclockwise around the walls past the Gate of the Ash-heaps and the other clockwise past the Corner Gate and the Tower of the Bake Ovens.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Neh. 12:31-40</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="ss"><strong><em>Gate of the Ash-heaps</em></strong></p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">This gate is also known as the <em>Gate of the Potsherds,</em> and is usually called the <em>Dung Gate</em>.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/66/0" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Neh. 3:13, 14</a>) It was at the SE corner of the city wall, and led to the Valley of Hinnom near the point where it joined the Tyropean valley. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/67/0" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Jer. 19:2</a>) It was from this gate that Topheth in the Valley of Hinnom was reached by those idolatrously burning their children in the fire to Baal.

Also, there may have been a potter’s industry near this gate, for there was clay nearby in the Valley of Hinnom as well as a water supply at the mouth of the Tyropean valley and at the spring En-rogel. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/70/0" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Jeremiah 18:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/70/1" data-bid="71-2" class="b"> 19:1, 2</a>.)

Probably it was at the S tip of the E hill of the city (that is, at the southern end of the “City of David”). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/72/0" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Neh. 2:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/72/1" data-bid="73-2" class="b"> 3:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/72/2" data-bid="73-3" class="b"> 12:37</a>) The Fountain Gate would afford convenient exit and access to En-rogel for those living in the City of David, while the Gate of the Ash-heaps, not far to the SW, would also lead out toward En-rogel and would likely be a better exit for the residents of the Tyropean valley and the SW hill of the city.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="ss"><strong><em>Water Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">The name of this gate may have been derived from its proximity, or at least its access, to the Spring of Gihon about midway up the E side of the city. This gate was near Ophel, not far from the Temple area. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/73/0" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Neh. 3:26</a>) The Water Gate was where one of the groups of the inauguration procession left the wall, proceeding from there to the Temple, where they assembled with the other group, apparently not traversing that part of the city wall to the E of the Temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/74/0" data-bid="75-1" class="b">Neh. 12:37-40</a>) There was a public square before this gate in which all the people gathered to hear Ezra read the Law, and where they afterward built booths to celebrate the Festival of Booths.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/75/0" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Neh. 8:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/75/1" data-bid="76-2" class="b"> 16</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="ss"><strong><em>Horse Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb">Repair work above the Horse Gate was done by the priests, which implies that its location was near the Temple.

They reach this conclusion from the account of Athaliah’s execution, which reports that, on being led out of the Temple by the soldiers, “she came to the entry of the horse gate of the king’s house.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/77/0" data-bid="78-1" class="b">2 Chron. 23:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/77/1" data-bid="78-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 11:16</a>) However, this was likely an entry just to the precincts of the royal palace and not the Horse Gate through which the horses passed in and out of the city itself. Nehemiah definitely includes the Horse Gate in his reconstruction description, indicating that it was a gate in the city wall. It was probably located near the SE corner of the Temple-palace area.

<strong>David, City Of</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Solomon transferred the Ark to the newly constructed temple on the more spacious plateau to the N of the city of David.

<strong>Gate, Gateway</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The Gate of the Old City was located on the NW side of the city between the Fish Gate and the Gate of Ephraim. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Neh. 3:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/51/1" data-bid="52-2" class="b"> 12:39</a>) In Hebrew, the gate is called simply “Gate of the Old,” the word “city” being supplied by some translators. It is suggested that the name was derived from its having been the main N entrance to the old city. It may have been at the junction of the Broad Wall (that formed a N boundary of the old city) and the S end of the W wall of the second quarter. Some think that this gate is identical with the “First Gate” mentioned by Zechariah. He seemingly refers to the E-W limits of the city in saying “from [1] the gate of Benjamin <span id="page626" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="626" data-before-text="626"></span>all the way to the place of [2] the First Gate, all the way to [3] the Corner Gate,” and to the N-S limits in saying “from the Tower of Hananel all the way to the press vats of the king.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Zech. 14:10</a>) If so, this places the First Gate E of the Corner Gate, possibly naming, from E to W, (1) the gate in or near the E corner, (2) the gate at the angle where the walls of the second quarter and the old city meet, and (3) the gate in the NW corner of the old city wall. Hence this would allow for the above-suggested identity of the First Gate with the Gate of the Old City. Others would connect the Gate of the Old City with the “Middle Gate” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Jeremiah 39:3</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong><em>Gate of Ephraim</em></strong></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">The Gate of Ephraim was located in the Broad Wall 400 cubits (c. 583 feet [c. 178 meters]) E of the Corner Gate.

It, too, has been identified by some researchers with the Middle Gate (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Jer. 39:3</a>), by others with the First Gate.

There was a public square near the Gate of Ephraim, in which the people made booths to celebrate the Festival of Booths in Nehemiah’s time. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Neh. 8:16</a>) This gate is not named in Nehemiah’s reconstruction text, evidently because it did not need extensive repairs.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="ss"><strong><em>Corner Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">This gate was evidently located in the NW angle of the city wall, 400 cubits (c. 583 feet [c. 178 meters]) along the Broad Wall W of the Gate of Ephraim. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/58/0" data-bid="59-1" class="b">2 Ki. 14:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/58/1" data-bid="59-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 25:23</a>) It was on the E side of the Valley of Hinnom, apparently in the W wall of the old city at the point where it joined the Broad Wall. Uzziah built a tower by this gate; whether or not it was the Tower of the Bake Ovens is not stated. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:9</a>) Both Jeremiah and Zechariah appear to refer to the Corner Gate as being on the western edge of the city. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/60/0" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Jer. 31:38;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/60/1" data-bid="61-2" class="b"> Zech. 14:10</a>) Some think the Corner Gate is the same as the First Gate, but the statement in the book of Zechariah seems to weigh against this view as to its location, for, apparently describing the E-W limits, Zechariah wrote, “from the gate of Benjamin all the way to the place of the First Gate, all the way to the Corner Gate,” thus evidently placing the First Gate E of the Corner Gate.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">There is no other gate described as existing in the W wall from the Corner Gate to the Valley Gate at the S end, this no doubt being because of the steep slope of the Hinnom valley, making any other gate impractical. The Corner Gate does not appear in Nehemiah’s accounts; again the reason may be that it did not need extensive repairs. The account does speak of repairing the Tower of the Bake Ovens, which seems to have been a part of, or near, the Corner Gate.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Neh. 3:11</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="ss"><strong><em>Valley Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">At the SW corner of the city wall, the Valley Gate led to the Valley of Hinnom, and corresponds to the modern Jaffa Gate. Josephus’ “Gate of the Essenes” may have been located here or nearby. Uzziah, in his city-fortification program, built a tower by this gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/62/0" data-bid="63-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:9</a>) It was from the Valley Gate that Nehemiah went out for his inspection of the damaged wall, riding eastward through the Valley of Hinnom and then up the Kidron valley, finally reentering the city by the same gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/63/0" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Neh. 2:13-15</a>) Although not named as such, the Valley Gate appears to be the point at which the inauguration procession started, one group marching counterclockwise around the walls past the Gate of the Ash-heaps and the other clockwise past the Corner Gate and the Tower of the Bake Ovens.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Neh. 12:31-40</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="ss"><strong><em>Gate of the Ash-heaps</em></strong></p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">This gate is also known as the <em>Gate of the Potsherds,</em> and is usually called the <em>Dung Gate</em>. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/65/0" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Neh. 2:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/65/1" data-bid="66-2" class="b"> 12:31</a>) Nehemiah’s description seems to place it 1,000 cubits (c. 1,458 feet [c. 444 meters]) E of the Valley Gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/66/0" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Neh. 3:13, 14</a>) It was at the SE corner of the city wall, and led to the Valley of Hinnom near the point where it joined the Tyropean valley. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/67/0" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Jer. 19:2</a>) It was from this gate that Topheth in the Valley of Hinnom was reached by those idolatrously burning their children in the fire to Baal.

Also, there may have been a potter’s industry near this gate, for there was clay nearby in the Valley of Hinnom as well as a water supply at the mouth of the Tyropean valley and at the spring En-rogel. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/70/0" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Jeremiah 18:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/70/1" data-bid="71-2" class="b"> 19:1, 2</a>.)

Probably it was at the S tip of the E hill of the city (that is, at the southern end of the “City of David”). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/72/0" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Neh. 2:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/72/1" data-bid="73-2" class="b"> 3:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/72/2" data-bid="73-3" class="b"> 12:37</a>) The Fountain Gate would afford convenient exit and access to En-rogel for those living in the City of David, while the Gate of the Ash-heaps, not far to the SW, would also lead out toward En-rogel and would likely be a better exit for the residents of the Tyropean valley and the SW hill of the city.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="ss"><strong><em>Water Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">The name of this gate may have been derived from its proximity, or at least its access, to the Spring of Gihon about midway up the E side of the city. This gate was near Ophel, not far from the Temple area. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/73/0" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Neh. 3:26</a>) The Water Gate was where one of the groups of the inauguration procession left the wall, proceeding from there to the Temple, where they assembled with the other group, apparently not traversing that part of the city wall to the E of the Temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/74/0" data-bid="75-1" class="b">Neh. 12:37-40</a>) There was a public square before this gate in which all the people gathered to hear Ezra read the Law, and where they afterward built booths to celebrate the Festival of Booths.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/75/0" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Neh. 8:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/75/1" data-bid="76-2" class="b"> 16</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="ss"><strong><em>Horse Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb">Repair work above the Horse Gate was done by the priests, which implies that its location was near the Temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/76/0" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Neh. 3:28</a>) Some have held that the Horse Gate was one providing communication between two parts of the Temple-palace quarter. They reach this conclusion from the account of Athaliah’s execution, which reports that, on being led out of the Temple by the soldiers, “she came to the entry of the horse gate of the king’s house.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/77/0" data-bid="78-1" class="b">2 Chron. 23:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/77/1" data-bid="78-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 11:16</a>) However, this was likely an entry just to the precincts of the royal palace and not the Horse Gate through which the horses passed in and out of the city itself. Nehemiah definitely includes the Horse Gate in his reconstruction description, indicating that it was a gate in the city wall. It was probably located near the SE corner of the Temple-palace area. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/78/0" data-bid="79-1" class="b">Neh. 3:28</a>) According to Jeremiah, there must have been a <span id="page627" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="627" data-before-text="627"></span>corner of the wall near this gate, probably as the wall turned toward the left as one comes up the Kidron valley, thereby following the valley’s contour (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/79/0" data-bid="80-1" class="b">Jer. 31:40</a>) The Horse Gate is omitted in the inauguration procession account, evidently because the two parts of the procession left off at the Water Gate and the Gate of the Guard, respectively, and did not walk over the section of the wall E of the Temple, where the Horse Gate and the Inspection Gate were located.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/80/0" data-bid="81-1" class="b">Neh. 12:37-40</a>.</p>

<strong>Bake, Baker</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Bread was generally baked in ovens in Bible times. (See OVEN.) Occasionally, however, baking was done by kindling a fire on stones that had been laid together. When they were well heated, the cinders were swept aside and dough was placed on the stones. After a while, the cake was turned and then left on the stones until the bread was thoroughly baked. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010540/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hos. 7:8</a>) Travelers might bake coarse bread in a shallow pit filled with hot pebbles, upon which a fire had been built. After the embers were removed, dough was laid on the heated stones, perhaps being turned several times while the bread was baking. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010540/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Ki. 19:6</a>) <span id="page182" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="182" data-before-text="182"></span>Bedouins still bake bread in this way, or do so on a heated iron disk, the Arabic <em>sadj.</em></p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Grain offerings made by the Israelites were often “something baked in the oven,” came “from off the griddle,” or from “out of the deep-fat kettle.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010540/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Lev. 2:4-7</a>) The griddle was a thick pottery plate having depressions (comparable to a modern waffle iron), though iron griddles were also used.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010540/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezek. 4:3</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Professional bakers were in business in the cities. While Jeremiah was in custody in the Courtyard of the Guard in Jerusalem during the time of scarcity prior to that city’s overthrow in 607 B.C.E., he was given a daily ration of a round loaf of bread “from the street of the bakers,” as long as the supply lasted. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010540/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jer. 37:21</a>) So, commercial bakers evidently occupied a particular street in Jerusalem. Years later, when Jerusalem’s walls were restored under Nehemiah’s supervision, the “Tower of the Bake Ovens” was also repaired. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010540/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Neh. 3:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010540/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 12:38</a>) Just how the tower came to be named is uncertain, but it is possible that it was given its unusual name because the ovens of commercial bakers were located there.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In modern times, the professional Oriental baker does not customarily prepare the dough. Instead, it is made by the house baker and is then sent to the public baker. So it is not uncommon to observe the baker’s boy walking along with trays of freshly baked bread balanced on his head, delivering the bread to customers’ homes. In Bible times, too, the professional baker may often have baked the dough (and even meat and vegetables) brought to him. After removing the bread or cakes from his oven with a long shovel, the baker at times greased them. The fine quality of bread baked in the larger oven of the Oriental commercial baker seems to be indicated by this proverb of the Arabs: “Send your bread to the oven of the baker, though he should eat the half of it.”</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Bakers in ancient Egypt had to render to the overseer of granaries strict accounts of the materials they had in stock. The Greek historian Herodotus of the fifth century B.C.E. spent some time in Egypt and provides a detailed account of Egyptian baking processes. He says the Egyptians kneaded bread with their feet, a procedure confirmed in a wall painting from the tomb of Ramses III.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The royal baker was evidently a man of some importance in ancient Egypt. The above-mentioned wall painting from Ramses III’s tomb in the Valley of the Kings at Thebes depicts an Egyptian royal bakery in full operation, showing such steps as the kneading of dough with the feet, the making of cakes of bread and the preparing of the oven. As reported in Genesis, one Egyptian royal baker gained particular notoriety because he sinned against the king and was cast into prison. There he had a dream in which he saw himself carrying three baskets of bread on his head, with fowls eating from the topmost basket. This “chief of the bakers” was taken out on the third day and “hung up,” thus fulfilling Joseph’s interpretation: “The three baskets are three days. In three days from now Pharaoh will lift up your head from off you and will certainly hang you upon a stake; and the fowls will certainly eat your flesh from off you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010540/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Gen. 40:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010540/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 16-22</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Gate, Gateway</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><strong><em>Sheep Gate.</em></strong> The Sheep Gate was rebuilt by Eliashib the high priest and associate priests. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Ne 3:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/47/1" data-bid="48-2" class="b"> 32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/47/2" data-bid="48-3" class="b"> 12:39</a>) This fact would indicate that it was near the temple area. Its location was probably in the wall of the second quarter, the part built by Manasseh (see “Fish Gate” below), at or near the NE corner of the city. This gate may have been so named because through it were brought sheep and goats for sacrifice or perhaps for a market that was located nearby. “The sheepgate” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">John 5:2</a> is likely this Sheep Gate or a later gate corresponding to it, for it was located in the same vicinity, near the pool of Bethzatha.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><strong><em>Fish Gate.</em></strong> Hezekiah apparently built a part of the wall around the second quarter as far as the Fish Gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">2Ch 32:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/49/1" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> 33:14</a>) In Nehemiah’s reconstruction and procession accounts, the Fish Gate is placed W of the Sheep Gate, perhaps near the N end of the Tyropoeon Valley. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Ne 3:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/50/1" data-bid="51-2" class="b"> 12:39</a>) It is mentioned in conjunction with the second quarter at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Zephaniah 1:10</a>. The name may be due to the gate’s nearness to the fish market where the Tyrians sold fish.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Ne 13:16</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><strong><em>Gate of the Old City.</em></strong> The Gate of the Old City was located on the NW side of the city between the Fish Gate and the Gate of Ephraim. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Ne 3:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/53/1" data-bid="54-2" class="b"> 12:39</a>) In Hebrew, the gate is called simply “Gate of the Old,” the word “city” being supplied by some translators. It is suggested that the name was derived from its having been the main N entrance to the old city. It may have been at the junction of the Broad Wall (that formed a N boundary of the old city) and the S end of the W wall of the second quarter. Some think that this gate is identical with “the First Gate” mentioned by Zechariah. He seemingly refers to the E-W limits of the city in saying “from [1] the Gate of Benjamin all the way to the place of [2] the First Gate, all the way to [3] the Corner Gate,” and to the N-S limits in saying “from the Tower of Hananel all the way to the press vats of the king.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Zec 14:10</a>) Others would connect the Gate of the Old City with “the Middle Gate” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Jeremiah 39:3</a>. Some term this Gate of the Old City the “Mishneh Gate” and locate it in the W wall of the second quarter.</p>

<strong>Gate, Gateway</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"><strong><em>Horse Gate.</em></strong> Repair work above the Horse Gate was done by the priests, which implies that its location was near the temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/77/0" data-bid="78-1" class="b">Ne 3:28</a>) Some have held that the Horse Gate was one providing communication between two parts of the temple-palace quarter. They reach this conclusion from the account of Athaliah’s execution, which reports that, on being led out of the temple by the soldiers, “she came to the entry of the horse gate of the king’s house.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/78/0" data-bid="79-1" class="b">2Ch 23:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/78/1" data-bid="79-2" class="b"> 2Ki 11:16</a>) However, this was likely an entry just to the precincts of the royal palace and not the Horse Gate through which the horses passed in and out of the city itself. Nehemiah definitely includes the Horse Gate in his reconstruction description, indicating that it was a gate in the city wall. It was probably located SE of the temple area. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/79/0" data-bid="80-1" class="b">Ne 3:28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/79/1" data-bid="80-2" class="b"> Jer 31:40</a>) The Horse Gate is omitted in the inauguration procession account, evidently because the two parts of the procession left off at the Water Gate and the Gate of the Guard, respectively, and did not walk over the section of the wall E of the temple, where the Horse Gate and the Inspection Gate were located.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/80/0" data-bid="81-1" class="b">Ne 12:37-40</a>.</p>

We shall concern ourselves here mainly with the gates mentioned in the book of Nehemiah, which gives us the most complete description or listing. The gates named in Nehemiah’s record are gates in the wall that was built prior to the eighth century B.C.E. and in the wall surrounding the “second quarter.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">2 Ki. 22:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/42/1" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 34:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/42/2" data-bid="43-3" class="b"> Zeph. 1:10</a>) The “second quarter” was a part of the city bounded on the W and part of the N by Hezekiah’s wall (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:5</a>) and joined by Manasseh’s wall, which continued on the NE and E.

We shall follow this procedure in our listing below, inserting the gates not mentioned in the reconstruction account but named in the description of the inauguration procession (chap. 12), along with gates spoken of in other scriptures, some of which are merely other names for those in Nehemiah’s record.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong><em>Sheep Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The Sheep Gate was rebuilt by Eliashib the high priest and associate priests.

Its location was probably in the N wall of the second quarter, the part built by Manasseh (see “Fish Gate,” below), at or near the NE corner of the city. This gate may have been so named because through it were brought sheep and goats for sacrifice or perhaps for a market that was located nearby. It may also have been called the “Gate of Benjamin” (which see). The “sheepgate” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">John 5:2</a> is likely this Sheep Gate or a later gate corresponding to it, for it was located in the same vicinity, near the pool Bethzatha.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><span id="page625" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="625" data-before-text="625"></span><strong><em>Fish Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Hezekiah apparently built a part of the wall around the second quarter on the W side as far as the Fish Gate, and Manasseh’s wall building continued from the Fish Gate around to the City of David.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Neh. 3:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/48/1" data-bid="49-2" class="b"> 12:39</a>) It is mentioned in conjunction with the second quarter at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Zephaniah 1:10</a>.

It is suggested that the name was derived from its having been the main N entrance to the old city. It may have been at the junction of the Broad Wall (that formed a N boundary of the old city) and the S end of the W wall of the second quarter. Some think that this gate is identical with the “First Gate” mentioned by Zechariah. He seemingly refers to the E-W limits of the city in saying “from [1] the gate of Benjamin <span id="page626" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="626" data-before-text="626"></span>all the way to the place of [2] the First Gate, all the way to [3] the Corner Gate,” and to the N-S limits in saying “from the Tower of Hananel all the way to the press vats of the king.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Zech. 14:10</a>) If so, this places the First Gate E of the Corner Gate, possibly naming, from E to W, (1) the gate in or near the E corner, (2) the gate at the angle where the walls of the second quarter and the old city meet, and (3) the gate in the NW corner of the old city wall. Hence this would allow for the above-suggested identity of the First Gate with the Gate of the Old City. Others would connect the Gate of the Old City with the “Middle Gate” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Jeremiah 39:3</a>.</p>

They reach this conclusion from the account of Athaliah’s execution, which reports that, on being led out of the Temple by the soldiers, “she came to the entry of the horse gate of the king’s house.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/77/0" data-bid="78-1" class="b">2 Chron. 23:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/77/1" data-bid="78-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 11:16</a>) However, this was likely an entry just to the precincts of the royal palace and not the Horse Gate through which the horses passed in and out of the city itself. Nehemiah definitely includes the Horse Gate in his reconstruction description, indicating that it was a gate in the city wall. It was probably located near the SE corner of the Temple-palace area.

Of these possibilities, the Gate of Benjamin is the more likely. (However, see “Sheep Gate,” considered earlier.) Its mention by Nehemiah in his reconstruction account would seem to support the idea that it was a gate in the E wall of the city in front of the Temple area and N of the Horse Gate. Nehemiah’s statement that there was a corner in the wall beyond the Inspection Gate would place this gate in the E wall, S of where the wall turned (likely in a northwestward direction).</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb">The account tells us that the repair work was done “in front of the Inspection Gate.” Some have understood this to refer to a repair work on the city wall in front of a Temple gate by this name.

Probably the most likely is that it is identical with the Gate of the Old City, since this gate was at the convergence of the Broad Wall, the N wall of the old city, and the W wall of the second quarter, and would be a central or commanding position. However, some say that the Middle Gate may have been the Gate of Ephraim. Another suggestion is that it was the Fish Gate, another commanding position, because this gate stood at the point where the valley dividing the city into two parts entered the city.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="ss"><strong><em>Gate of Benjamin</em></strong></p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sb">Some identify the Gate of Benjamin with the Sheep Gate.

The latter identification seems less likely, although it would also have been possible for Jeremiah to travel toward his hometown Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin from the Inspection Gate. Another argument for the Sheep Gate as being another name for the Gate of Benjamin is that Zedekiah was sitting in the Gate of Benjamin when approached by Ebed-melech with a plea in Jeremiah’s behalf.

The Sheep Gate on the N of the city would be the most seriously threatened by the attacking Babylonians, not the Inspection Gate, which was apparently on the E side of the Temple area, and not in a particularly vulnerable position.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="ss"><strong><em>Other gates mentioned</em></strong></p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sb">When King Zedekiah fled from the Babylonians, he went out “by the way of the gate between the double wall that is by the king’s garden.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/88/0" data-bid="89-1" class="b">Jer. 52:7, 8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/88/1" data-bid="89-2" class="b"> 39:4</a>) There is much uncertainty as to the identity of the “double wall.” However, from present knowledge, either the Gate of the Ash-heaps or the Fountain Gate might fit the circumstances described in the Scriptures, both of these being near the king’s garden. Those supporting the Fountain Gate location say that the exit from the city through this gate led through a fifteen-meter- (c. 49-foot-) long corridor between two strong walls. On the other hand, Dr. J. Simons, who advocates the Gate of the Ash-heaps as Zedekiah’s place of exit, says that the lower part of the Central (Tyropean) valley was enclosed between a supposed SW wall of the city of David and a wall discovered by archaeologist J. Bliss (apparently an old S wall), in which was the Gate of the Ash-heaps. From either of those gates Zedekiah could have fled toward the Arabah and to “the desert plains of Jericho,” where the Babylonians caught him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/89/0" data-bid="90-1" class="b">2 Ki. 25:5</a>.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/90/0" data-bid="91-1" class="b">2 Kings 23:8</a> reference is made to the “high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua, the chief of the city, which was at the left as a person came into the gate of the city.” Here “gate of Joshua” is not the name of a city gate, but evidently is a gate within the city walls leading to the governor’s residence, which was at the left as a person entered the city gate.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="ss"><strong>TEMPLE GATES</strong></p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="sb"><em>East Gate</em>.

<strong>Ammonites</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><strong>Intermarriage With Israelites.</strong> Following the return of the Jews from exile (537 B.C.E.), an Ammonite named Tobiah took a leading part in endeavoring to obstruct the rebuilding of Jerusalem’s walls.

Many of the returned Jewish exiles also had taken wives of Ammonite and other foreign extraction and were severely rebuked for this, resulting in a general dismissal of such wives.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Ezr 9:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/47/1" data-bid="48-2" class="b"> 10:10-19,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/47/2" data-bid="48-3" class="b"> 44;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/47/3" data-bid="48-4" class="b"> Ne 13:23-27</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">After Tobiah’s ejection from the temple grounds, God’s law at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 23:3-6</a> prohibiting the entry of Ammonites and Moabites into the congregation of Israel was read and applied.

It does not mean, of necessity, that Ammonite and Moabite individuals could not associate themselves with or reside among the Israelites and thereby benefit from the divine blessings upon God’s people, and this is evident from the inclusion of Zelek, mentioned earlier, among David’s chief warriors, as well as from the record concerning Ruth the Moabitess.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Ru 1:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/50/1" data-bid="51-2" class="b"> 16-18</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">As to this latter case, Ruth’s marriage to Boaz shows that females of these nations, upon turning to the worship of the true God, could be acceptable for marriage by Jewish males.

Nevertheless, Ezra’s insistence that the Jewish men send away their foreign wives and Nehemiah’s similar attitude, previously mentioned, indicate that the admission of Ammonite and Moabite females into association with Israel was dependent upon their acceptance of true worship.</p>

<strong>Nehemiah, Book of</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Reliable historical evidence and the fulfillment of Bible prophecy point to 455 B.C.E. as the year in which Nisan of the 20th year of Artaxerxes’ reign fell.

Accordingly, the Chislev preceding Nisan of that 20th year would fall in 456 B.C.E., and the 32nd year of Artaxerxes’ reign (the last date mentioned in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003213/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Nehemiah [13:6</a>]) would include part of 443 B.C.E. Therefore, the book of Nehemiah covers a period from Chislev of 456 B.C.E. until sometime after 443 B.C.E.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">It was in the 32nd year of Artaxerxes’ reign that Nehemiah left Jerusalem. Upon his return, he found that the Jews were not supporting the priests and Levites, the Sabbath law was being violated, many had married foreign women, and the offspring of the mixed marriages did not even know how to speak the language of the Jews. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003213/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ne 13:10-27</a>) For conditions to have deteriorated to this point indicates that Nehemiah’s absence entailed a considerable period. But there is no way to <span id="page489" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="489" data-before-text="489"></span>determine just how long after 443 B.C.E.

Therefore, it is impossible to determine the length of his absence. Upon his return to Jerusalem, though, Nehemiah found that the priesthood was not being supported, nor was the Sabbath law being observed. Many had taken foreign wives, and their offspring did not even speak the language of the Jews. For conditions to deteriorate so much, Nehemiah must have been gone for a long time.</p>

Since the temple service is mentioned but without reference to building the temple, it must have been after the time of Governor Zerubbabel, during whose tenure of office the temple was completed. There is only one other governor of this period mentioned in the Scriptures, and he is Nehemiah. Does the prophecy fit Nehemiah’s time? Nothing is stated in Malachi concerning the rebuilding of Jerusalem and its wall, which eliminates the early part of Nehemiah’s governorship. However, much is said concerning the abuses by the priesthood, tying Malachi in with the situation that existed when Nehemiah came a second time to Jerusalem, following his recall to Babylon by Artaxerxes in 443 B.C.E., the 32nd year of the king’s reign.

<strong>Music</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Considerable importance was attached to the singing at the temple.

<strong>How Does Your Religion Raise Money?</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Much of this form of raising money is done by mail, as when Billy Graham sends out postal cards soliciting help to pay off the deficits incurred by his publicity campaigns. A letter sent out by the Passionist Fathers Missions, located in the southern part of the United States, begins this way: “Dear Friend: Did you ever have to beg? God grant that you shall never have to. It is a most unpleasant task—one that often meets with harsh refusals and bitter, <span id="page647" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="647" data-before-text="647"></span>unkind words, or simply ignoring. Yet, beg we must. The priest in the mission is forced to be a beggar for Christ.”</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">But can we imagine God’s cause in such dire straits that his servants have to beg to keep it alive? Does begging for God make sense? Is it in the fitness of things to beg for the One to whom belongs the universe, “the beasts upon a thousand mountains”? The priests and Levites under the Mosaic law never found it necessary to beg. When, in the days of Nehemiah, the Israelites failed to provide properly for the temple worship, the Levites went to working in the fields to provide for themselves.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963801/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 50:10-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963801/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Deut. 12:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963801/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Neh. 13:10</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The same principle applied in the days of Jesus’ apostles. When fellow Christians failed to support the apostle Paul in his ministry, he worked at making tents. He acted on the principle laid down by Jesus: “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.” Paul set the pattern for Christians.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963801/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 18:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963801/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 20:34, 35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963801/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 1 Cor. 11:1</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>TITHING</strong></p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Perhaps your church is one of those that raise money by means of the tithe. Some of the smaller denominations, such as the Seventh-day Adventists and the Mormons, have practiced tithing for a long time, but today there is a definite trend toward its use in both the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches. Especially zealous in this regard is the American Roman Catholic weekly, <em>Our Sunday Visitor.</em> Says a “Father” Joseph Payne: “This is God’s plan, not man’s, that each wage earner give 10 per cent to His works. . . . If we question the fairness of tithing we are questioning God’s wisdom.” It is said that every family must tithe the gross income, and this regardless of how large the family is and how small the income.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">But is tithing “God’s plan”? No, says the Roman Catholic theologian Gregory Baum, professor of theology at St. Michael’s College, Toronto, Canada. To claim that it is, says he, is dangerous, “because it not only proclaims wrong teaching but also falsifies men’s conscience and causes anguish and revolt. The divine teaching confided to Israel has been abrogated. . . . As Christians we are free from the law of Moses. Circumcision, tithing and other commandments are no longer for us. Is tithing the law of the church? The answer is very simple. It is not.” However, the sixteenth-century Catholic Council of Trent went so far as ordering the tithe on pain of excommunication.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Gregory Baum may be mistaken as to Roman Catholic teaching on the subject of tithing, but he is not mistaken as to what the Bible teaches about it. When Jesus Christ abolished by his death “the Law of commandments consisting in decrees,” he also abolished tithing.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963801/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Eph. 2:14, 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963801/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Rom. 6:14</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">If tithing were for Christians there would be some indication to that effect in the Christian Greek Scriptures, but we look in vain for such an indication. Although tithing is mentioned some forty times in the Bible, there are only three separate and distinct references to it in the so-called New Testament.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The first of these is where Jesus said: “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you give the tenth [or tithe] . . . but you have disregarded the weightier matters of the Law, namely, justice and mercy and faithfulness.” Another reference is found in the words of the self-righteous Pharisee of Jesus’ parable: “I fast twice a week, I give the tenth [or tithe] of all things I acquire.” Yet a third reference is found in a discussion of the subject in the book of Hebrews, where tithing is mentioned to show the superiority <span id="page648" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="648" data-before-text="648"></span>of the priesthood of Jesus, but not to show that tithing is for Christians.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963801/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 23:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963801/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Luke 11:42;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963801/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 18:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963801/7/3" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> Heb. 7:4-9</a>.</p>

<strong>Music</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The Bible gives very little information concerning the shape or construction of the more than a dozen different musical instruments that it mentions. Hence, most authorities draw heavily on what archaeologists have discovered about the instruments used by contemporary surrounding nations. However, this may not always be a reliable guide, since it appears that Israel excelled in music in comparison with her <span id="page1192" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1192" data-before-text="1192"></span>neighbors. Additionally, some have linked various instruments of Scripture to instruments used in modern times in the Middle East, which are supposed to have an ancient background. This, too, is conjectural.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The musical instruments of the Bible may be classified as follows:</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="si">String: harp, lute, zither, and others.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sv">Wind: bagpipe, flute, horn, pipe, trumpet, (possibly) nehiloth.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sv">Percussion: cymbals, sistrums, tambourine.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">(See individual articles on the above instruments for further information.)</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">There is no reason to believe that the musical instruments of Israel were crude in design, construction or sound production. The Bible notes that the harps and stringed instruments for temple use were of the choicest imported almug wood; the trumpets, in all probability, of silver. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Ki. 10:11, 12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Num. 10:2</a>) Undoubtedly, in the manufacture of the temple instruments, the most skilled craftsmen were employed.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Both the Scriptures and non-Biblical manuscripts dating from before the Common Era testify to the quality of the instruments as well as the competence of the Israelite musicians. The Dead Sea Scrolls state that a number of trumpets were assigned various complicated signals to be executed “as with one mouth.” This would require not only skilled musicians but also instruments so constructed that the pitch might be regulated in order to bring them all into tune with one another. Freedom from dissonance is indicated by the inspired account of the music at the inauguration of Solomon’s temple: “The [one hundred and twenty] trumpeters and the singers were <em>as one in causing one sound</em> to be heard.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Chron. 5:12, 13</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The Bible lists but four instruments as definitely being in the temple orchestra: trumpets, harps, stringed instruments (Hebrew, <em>neʹvel</em>) and cymbals. While this may not seem to be a complete orchestra by modern standards, it was never intended to be a symphony orchestra, but only to provide accompaniment for the singing at the temple. Such a combination of instruments would serve this purpose excellently.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Chron. 29:25, 26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Neh. 12:27,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/17/2" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 41, 42</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">As to the times when the sacred instruments performed, the Scriptures enumerate the following in connection with the trumpets: “In the day of your rejoicing and in your festal seasons and at the commencements of your months, you must blow on the trumpets over your burnt offerings and your communion sacrifices.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Num. 10:10</a>) After the temple music organization was established, it is likely that the rest of the instruments joined the trumpets on these and other special occasions. This conclusion, as well as the musical procedure followed, seems to be indicated by the order of events described as taking place when sacred services were revived by King Hezekiah after he had cleansed the temple: “At the time that the burnt offering started, the song of Jehovah started and also the trumpets, even under the direction of the instruments of David the king of Israel. And all the congregation were bowing down while the song was resounding and the trumpets were blaring—all this until the burnt offering was finished.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Chron. 29:27, 28</a>) The trumpets being “under the direction of the instruments of David” seems to denote that the trumpeters played in such a manner as to complement the other instruments rather than to overshadow them. The position of the entire body of musicians was “to the east of the altar.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Chron. 5:12</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="ss"><strong>VOCAL MUSIC</strong></p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">The singers at the temple were Levite males. Nowhere do the Scriptures speak of female vocalists at the temple. One of the Targums, too, clearly indicates that they were not present in the chorus. The fact that women were prohibited from even entering certain areas of the temple would seem to preclude their occupying any official position there.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">2 Chron. 5:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Neh. 10:39;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/21/2" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> 12:27-29</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Considerable importance was attached to the singing at the temple. This is evident from the many Scriptural references to the singers as well as from the fact that they were “set free from duty” common to other Levites in order to devote themselves wholly to their service. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Chron. 9:33</a>) Their continuance as a special group of Levites is emphasized by their being listed separately among those returning from Babylon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ezra 2:40, 41</a>) Even the authority of the Persian King Artaxerxes (Longimanus) was brought to bear in their behalf, exempting them, along with other special groups, from ‘tax, tribute and toll.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ezra 7:24</a>) Later, the king commanded that there was to be “a fixed provision for the singers as each day required.” Although Artaxerxes is credited with this order, most likely it was issued by Ezra on the basis of the power granted to him by Artaxerxes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Neh. 11:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Ezra 7:18-26</a>) Thus, it is understandable that, although the singers were all Levites, the Bible makes reference to them as a special body, speaking of “the singers and the Levites.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Neh. 7:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 13:10</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Apart from temple worship, other singers, men and women, are spoken of in Scripture. Examples of these are the male and female singers maintained by Solomon in his court; also, about two hundred singers of both sexes who, in addition to the Levitical musicians, returned from Babylon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Eccl. 2:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> Ezra 2:65;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/27/2" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> Neh. 7:67</a>) These non-Levitical singers, common in Israel, were employed not only to enhance various festive occasions but also to chant dirges in times of sorrow. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">2 Sam. 19:35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 35:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/28/2" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> Jer. 9:17,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/28/3" data-bid="29-4" class="b"> 20</a>) The custom of hiring professional musicians at times of joy and sadness appears to have continued into the time Jesus was on earth.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matt. 11:16, 17</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Although not as prominent as in the Hebrew Scriptures, music is not ignored or overlooked in the Christian Greek Scriptures. Instrumental music in connection with true worship is mentioned only in a figurative sense in the Greek Scriptures (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Rev. 14:2</a>); yet singing seems to have been quite common among God’s servants. Jesus and his apostles sang praises after the Lord’s Evening Meal. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Mark 14:26</a>) Luke tells of Paul and Silas singing when in prison, and Paul’s encouragement to fellow believers was to sing songs of praise to Jehovah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Acts 16:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/32/1" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> Eph. 5:18, 19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/32/2" data-bid="33-3" class="b"> Col. 3:16</a>) Paul’s statement at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 14:15</a> concerning singing appears to indicate that it was a regular feature of Christian worship. In recording his inspired vision, John tells of various heavenly creatures singing to God and Christ.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Rev. 5:8-10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 14:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/34/2" data-bid="35-3" class="b"> 15:2-4</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong>NATURE OF BIBLICAL MUSIC</strong></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">The Israelites’ higher plane of morality and their superior literature, as exemplified by the poetry and prose of the Hebrew Scriptures, suggest that the music of ancient Israel most likely transcended that of her contemporaries. Certainly the inspiration for the music of Israel was far loftier than that of neighboring nations. Of interest is an Assyrian bas-relief wherein King Sennacherib is represented as demanding that King Hezekiah pay him as tribute both male and female musicians.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">It has long been held by some that Hebrew music was all melody, without harmony. However, the prominence alone of the harp and other stringed instruments in Israel weighs heavily against this assumption. It is almost inconceivable that a musician would play a multistringed instrument and fail to notice that a combination of certain tones was quite pleasing or that a specific series of notes as in an arpeggio produced a pleasant sound. An authority on the history of music, Kurt Sachs, states: “The deep-rooted prejudice that harmony and polyphony [two or more musical parts or voices combined] have been a <span id="page1193" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1193" data-before-text="1193"></span>prerogative of the medieval and modern West does not hold water.” He goes on to say that even among primitive cultures there are many examples of music running in fifths, fourths, thirds as well as in octaves, and that among these peoples, including certain pygmy tribes, there was a development of overlapping antiphony (alternate singing by two divisions of vocalists) into regular canon singing.</p>

Upon his return, he found that the Jews were not supporting the priests and Levites, the Sabbath law was being violated, many had married foreign women, and the offspring of the mixed marriages did not even know how to speak the language of the Jews. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003213/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ne 13:10-27</a>) For conditions to have deteriorated to this point indicates that Nehemiah’s absence entailed a considerable period. But there is no way to <span id="page489" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="489" data-before-text="489"></span>determine just how long after 443 B.C.E. Nehemiah completed the book bearing his name.</p>

Not having this support, the Levites were abandoning their assignments and going off to work in their fields. Nehemiah blamed the deputy rulers for the situation. Apparently, they were not caring for their duties. Either they were not collecting the people’s tithes or they were not forwarding them to the temple, as they had been assigned to do. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013602/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Neh. 12:44</a>) So Nehemiah took steps to have the tithes collected. He appointed trustworthy men to oversee the temple stores and future distributions.</p>

<strong>Neglecting the House of the Creator of Heaven and Earth</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> A neglect in rendering all these necessary things to support the temple servants and to maintain the temple operations would be a neglecting of the house or temple of Jehovah God. Especially now, in the face of the attested “trustworthy arrangement” in writing and the oath and the liability to a curse from God as now undertaken by the Israelites, they <span id="page746" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="746" data-before-text="746"></span>should not again become guilty of such neglect. Nehemiah the governor of Judah included himself under the obligation when he said: “We [not, you] should not neglect the house of our God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Neh. 10:30-39</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>WORTH REMEMBERING AND OBSERVING</strong></p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">22.

How prone the fallen human flesh is to give in to materialism and to overlook the spiritual interests and benefits and thus to fall into a neglecting of God’s house! Governor Nehemiah found that out. After serving as governor for twelve years he returned to the royal palace of the Persian king, namely, “in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king of [conquered] Babylon.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Neh. 13:6</a>) Then after an absence from Jerusalem, the length of which he does not tell, he returned to Judah and Jerusalem with permission of the Persian king. He himself had not lost interest in God’s house, but sadly he found out that the people in Judah had lost interest.</p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">23. Whom had high priest Eliashib admitted to occupancy in the temple, and what did Nehemiah do about this?</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> Eliashib the high priest had admitted an enemy Ammonite, Tobiah, who had opposed the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem, into the temple. He had also become a relative of Tobiah and had assigned to his personal use one of the dining halls in the temple courtyard, where formerly supplies for the support of the temple servants used to be stored. This was contrary to God’s command in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 23:3-6</a>. What seemed all right to the temple high priest was tolerated by the people. But not by Nehemiah! He tells us: “It seemed very bad to me. So I threw all the furniture of Tobiah’s house outside the dining hall. After that I said the word and they cleansed the dining halls; and I proceeded to put back there the utensils of the house of the true God, with the grain offering and the frankincense.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Neh. 13:4-9</a>.</p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">24.

He let the contributions of the tenth parts or tithes of the Israelites drop off, so that the ministerial Levites did not receive the necessary material support. Many of these felt obliged to leave the temple work and go home to their Levite cities and work their garden lands roundabout for food supplies for themselves and their families. So what did Nehemiah do?</p><p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu">25. What did Nehemiah report doing about this?</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"><sup>25</sup></span> He reports: “I got to find out that the very portions of the Levites had not been given them, so that the Levites and the singers doing the work went running off, each one to his own field. And I began to find fault with the deputy rulers and say: ‘Why has the house of the true God been neglected?’ Consequently I collected them together and stationed them at their standing place.” He did not wait any longer for action by the deputy rulers but arranged that all the inhabitants of Judah bring in the tenth parts to the temple storehouses.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Neh. 13:10-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Num. 35:1-8</a>.</p><p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="qu">26.

Did he mention that he had left his position as cupbearer of the king of Persia and had made the long journey to Jerusalem and had rebuilt its wall in fifty-two days despite enemy threats? No! But he spoke of what he had done in behalf of the house of God. He prayed: “Do remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my acts of loving-kindness that I have performed in connection with the house of my God and the guardianship of it.” He insisted on clean servants ministering at God’s house; but not so the high priest Eliashib, for he had let a grandson of his enter a mixed marriage and marry the daughter of the Samaritan enemy, Sanballat the Horonite. As regards this, Nehemiah says:</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="28"><sup>28</sup></span> “And one of the sons of Joiada the son of Eliashib the high priest was a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite.

And I purified them from everything foreign and proceeded to assign duties to the priests and to the Levites, each one in his own work, even for the supply of the wood at appointed times and for the first ripe fruits.

Yes; for Nehemiah’s everlasting good. Jehovah God is not unrighteous so that he has forgot and will leave unrewarded all the good that Governor Nehemiah did for the house of God in Jerusalem. He has kept Nehemiah’s prayer for remembrance on permanent record by having it made a part of the inspired Holy Scriptures. To the Hebrew followers of Jesus Christ, who has done even greater service in behalf of the true “house of our God,” it is written: “God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name, in that you have ministered to the holy ones and continue ministering.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Heb. 6:10</a>) So too with Nehemiah. He truly feared Jehovah God; and in the writings of Malachi, who was evidently a contemporary of Nehemiah in the rebuilt city of Jerusalem, we find these appropriate words included:</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="31"><sup>31</sup></span> “At that time those in fear of Jehovah spoke with one another, each one with his companion, and Jehovah kept paying attention and listening.

But during the thousand-year reign of “Messiah the Leader,” Nehemiah will be rewarded with a resurrection from the dead.

He will learn what happened to the last one of the Jewish temples there in the year 70 of our Common Era, as foretold by Jesus Christ the Son of God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matt. 23:37 to 24:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Luke 19:36-44;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/24/2" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> 21:5, 6</a>) He will learn about the spiritual temple of God, the one that was prefigured by that material temple on Mount Moriah in Jerusalem. He will learn how the spiritual temple was kept from being neglected by the followers of the great High Priest of this temple. Nehemiah himself will join other faithful ones on earth in worshiping Jehovah God through this exalted spiritual temple. He will be an outstanding example of how persons who do not neglect God’s house are fully rewarded without fail.</p>

<strong>Why Expect God to Listen to Prayer?</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The fact that God commands us to pray and fills his Word, the Bible, with examples of his servants praying should suffice to show that they can expect God to listen to prayers. But, it may be asked, Why? Why should this great Eternal One, the Most High and Universal Sovereign, listen to the prayers of his servants? One overriding or compelling reason is that the reputation of his name is involved. Thus Moses repeatedly pleaded with God successfully on the basis of God’s name and fame being involved: “Why, O Jehovah, should your anger blaze against your people. . . ? Why should the Egyptians say, ‘With evil intent he brought them out in order to kill them’?” “Were you to put this people to death as one man, then the <span id="page71" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="71" data-before-text="71"></span>nations who have heard of your fame would certainly say this, ‘Because of Jehovah’s not being able to bring this people into the land about which he swore to them he proceeded to slaughter them in the wilderness.”’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex. 32:11, 12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Num. 14:15, 16</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Thus also Jehovah listened to Joshua when, after the defeat at Ai, he prayed: “Excuse me, O Jehovah, but what can I say after Israel has turned his back before his enemies? And the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and they will certainly surround us and cut our name off from the earth; and what will you do for your great name?” The same was true of the prayer that Hezekiah, faithful king of the two-tribe kingdom of Judah, offered when confronted with the taunts of the sneering king of Assyria, Sennacherib: “And now, O Jehovah our God, save us, please, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, O Jehovah, are God alone.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Josh. 7:8, 9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 19:19</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Then again, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 79:9</a>, we read the prayer: “Help us, O God of our salvation, for the sake of the glory of your name.” And so did Daniel pray, as recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Daniel 9:19</a>: “O Jehovah, do hear. . . . Do not delay, for your own sake, O my God, for your own name has been called upon your city and upon your people.” Many more examples could be given, but these should be sufficient to show that Jehovah God can be expected to listen to prayer, particularly when it is related to the vindication of his name.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>BECAUSE OF HAVING KEPT INTEGRITY</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Another reason why God’s servants can expect God to listen to their prayers is his love of righteousness: “Jehovah is righteous; he does love righteous acts.” Because of this we read: “Jehovah is far away from the wicked ones, but the prayer of the righteous ones he hears.” Those who follow an upright course can come to God on the basis of their having kept integrity with God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 11:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Prov. 15:29</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Thus Job made an eloquent plea to God on the basis of his having followed a righteous course. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job Chapters 29-31</a>) Likewise King David, in praying for God’s blessing at the time of gathering materials for the building of the temple, said: “I well know, O my God, that you are an examiner of the heart, and that it is in rectitude that you take pleasure. I, for my part, in the uprightness of my heart have voluntarily offered all these things.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:17</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">In the same vein we find Nehemiah praying: “Do remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my acts of loving-kindness that I have performed in connection with the house of my God and the guardianship of it.” The writer of the letter to the Hebrews, doubtless the apostle Paul, likewise shows the connection between purposeful prayer and right conduct: “Carry on prayer for us, for we trust we have an honest conscience, as we wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things.” In fact, this very same principle is implied in the model prayer Jesus gave his disciples: “Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.” Yes, because of Jehovah’s love for righteousness all who are lovers of God’s righteousness and seek to practice it can expect God to listen to their prayers.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Neh. 13:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Heb. 13:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> Matt. 6:12</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>PRAYING ON THE BASIS OF INHERITED SIN</strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">One of the basic requests imperfect creatures can make in their prayers is that God may forgive them their sins.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Many archaeological discoveries over the years verify the existence of various peoples and places and the accuracy of events mentioned in the Bible. As an example, consider the evidence for one minor detail. The Bible states that in the time of Nehemiah, Tyrians (Phoenicians from Tyre) who lived in Jerusalem “were bringing in fish and all kinds of merchandise.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020003/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Nehemiah 13:16</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Is there any evidence to support this Bible verse? Yes, there is. Archaeologists have discovered Phoenician goods in Israel, suggesting trade between the two ancient nations. Furthermore, in Jerusalem, the remains of Mediterranean fish have been unearthed. Archaeologists believe that the fish were brought from the distant coast by merchants. After analyzing the evidence, one scholar concluded: “The statement in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020003/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Neh[emiah] 13:16</a> that the Tyrians sold fish in Jerusalem is quite plausible.”</p>

It does not mean, of necessity, that Ammonite and Moabite individuals could not associate themselves with or reside among the Israelites and thereby benefit from the divine blessings upon God’s people, and this is evident from the inclusion of Zelek, mentioned earlier, among David’s chief warriors, as well as from the record concerning Ruth the Moabitess.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Ru 1:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/50/1" data-bid="51-2" class="b"> 16-18</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">As to this latter case, Ruth’s marriage to Boaz shows that females of these nations, upon turning to the worship of the true God, could be acceptable for marriage by Jewish males. Because the terms “Ammonite” and “Moabite” in the Hebrew text of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000240/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 23:3-6</a> are in the masculine gender, the Jewish Mishnah (<em>Yevamot</em> 8:3) argues that only male Ammonites and Moabites were excluded from Israel. Nevertheless, Ezra’s insistence that the Jewish men send away their foreign wives and Nehemiah’s similar attitude, previously mentioned, indicate that the admission of Ammonite and Moabite females into association with Israel was dependent upon their acceptance of true worship.</p>

Oneness of language in itself would also be a unifying force among the people. The Hebrew Scriptures doubtless were a major factor in the stability of the Hebrew language.

The children of these foreign women could not read or speak Hebrew. When they got older, would they identify themselves as Israelites? Or would they rather think of themselves as Ashdodites, Ammonites, or Moabites? Without knowing the Hebrew language, was it likely that they would be able to understand God’s Law?

<strong>Nehemiah</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Additionally, Nehemiah took measures to ensure the contributions for the Levites and enforced strict Sabbath observance. He also administered discipline against those who had taken foreign wives, whose sons by these women were not even able to speak the Jewish tongue: “And I began to find fault with them and call down evil upon them and strike some men of them and pull out their hair and make them swear by God: ‘You should not give your daughters to their sons, and you should not accept any of their daughters for your sons or yourselves.’”</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Nehemiah’s ‘finding fault’ with these men doubtless was his reproving and rebuking them by means of God’s law, exposing their wrong action. These men were bringing the restored nation into disfavor with God, after God had kindly repatriated them from Babylon to restore true worship at Jerusalem. Nehemiah ‘called down evil upon them,’ meaning that he recited the judgments of God’s law against such violators. He ‘struck’ them, probably not personally, but ordered them flogged as an official judicial action. He ‘pulled out (a portion of) their hair.’ This was a symbol of moral indignation and ignominy before the people. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003212/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ezr 9:3</a>.)

<strong>Weighing Wedlock in These Last Days</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> You may be a Christian parent who will arrange a marriage for your son or daughter. Or you may be an adult dedicated servant of Jehovah God who plans to marry. In either case, let the words of faithful Ezra ring in your ears, his earnest supplication at a time of national wrongdoing. The Jews had been delivered from captivity to Babylon. They had the Scriptures and good examples from the past. These they ignored, and great was their guilt before Jehovah. But how had they sinned? This Ezra revealed as he pleaded: “And after all that has come upon us for our bad deeds and our great guiltiness—for you yourself, O our God, have underestimated our error, and you have given us those who have escaped such as these—shall we go breaking your commandments again and forming marriage alliances with the peoples of these detestable things? Will you not get incensed at us to the limit so that there will be none remaining and none escaping? O Jehovah the God of Israel, you are righteous, because we have been left over as an escaped people as at this day. Here we are before you in our guiltiness, for it is impossible to stand before you on account of this.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965683/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezra 9:13-15</a>) The Jews put away their foreign wives in the days of Ezra, in recognition of their great guiltiness before God. Do not forget that they had sinned against <span id="page561" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="561" data-before-text="561"></span>Jehovah by intermarrying with the pagan Canaanites. Never minimize the gravity of disobeying God with respect to wedlock.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 5. According to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965683/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Malachi 2:10-12</a>, in what way had the Jews profaned Jehovah’s holiness? What conclusion must a Christian therefore reach?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> As a Christian dedicated to Jehovah God you undoubtedly hold the Bible in high esteem and you wish to abide by its righteous principles. Well, then, take to heart also these words of the prophet Malachi: “Is it not one father that all of us have? Is it not one God that has created us? Why is it that we deal treacherously with one another, in profaning the covenant of our forefathers? Judah has dealt treacherously, and a detestable thing has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the holiness of Jehovah, which He has loved, and he has taken possession of the daughter of a foreign god as a bride. Jehovah will cut off each one that does it, one who is awake and one who is answering, from the tents of Jacob, and one who is presenting a gift offering to Jehovah of armies.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965683/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Mal. 2:10-12</a>) Those Jews certainly did not please Jehovah by taking “the daughter of a foreign god as a bride.” In doing so, they had profaned His holiness. Earlier, Solomon had married many foreign women. Because of them he sinned. For Jews of Nehemiah’s day who had married pagan women, Nehemiah used Solomon as an example of a wrongdoer. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965683/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Neh. 13:25-27</a>) Christians today realize, therefore, that they could never please Almighty God by marrying an unbeliever.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 6.

Or what fellowship does light have with darkness? Further, what harmony is there between Christ and Belial? Or what portion does a faithful person have with an unbeliever?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965683/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Cor. 6:14, 15</a>) Obey Jehovah, the unchanging God. Do not go against his will in matters relating to wedlock and risk your spirituality and life itself by becoming unevenly yoked with an unbeliever.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965683/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Mal. 3:6</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 7.

Naturally, the congregation service committee is responsible for deciding whether the congregation’s Kingdom Hall will be used for a particular marriage ceremony or not.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>AVOIDING AN UNEVEN YOKE</strong></p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 8.

At his place of employment?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> A person may realize that, as a Christian, he should marry “only in the Lord.” Yet school activities, secular employment, and the like, may throw a dedicated single Christian into contact with unbelievers of the opposite sex. What then? Well, while attending school is not something to be avoided, the Christian student assuredly does not have to engage in extracurricular school activities, regularly attending school dances and other functions that will place him in unnecessary contact with unbelievers. Similarly, one may have to work with worldly persons in the same office, but that does not mean that the mature Christian will attend office parties at which he may become emotionally involved with an unbeliever, even running the risk of falling into immorality. To avoid these things, watch your associations. Be firm, resolute. <span id="page562" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="562" data-before-text="562"></span>In your determination to do what is right, Jehovah will surely uphold you.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965683/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:33</a>.</p>

In time they succeeded in twisting Solomon’s thinking so that he took up their false forms of worship and ended his reign with God’s anger blazing against him. If bad companionship could cause a man of Solomon’s wisdom and greatness to fall from God’s favor, can it not do the same to you? Do you think you are wiser than Solomon and can marry outside the New World society without endangering your position in it?

Some were following the example of Solomon rather than the example of Jacob. “You should not give your daughters to their sons, and you should not accept any of their daughters for your sons or yourselves. Was it not because of these that Solomon the king of Israel sinned? And among the many nations there proved to be no king like him; and loved of his God he happened to be, so that God constituted him king over all Israel.

Why marry someone who may be compared with the Canaanites because of unbelief? If you cannot find a prospective marriage mate who is dedicated to God as you are, wait until you can. Do not jeopardize your Christian integrity by becoming yoked with an unbeliever. “Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership do righteousness and lawlessness have?

It is difficult enough to stay on the narrow way to life without endangering your footing with bad associations. When you came into the New World society and began walking with God on the narrow way to life, you had to make many changes that were for your own good. The apostle Paul spoke about this when he said: “Quit being fashioned after this system of things, but be transformed by making your mind over, that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and complete will of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961483/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Rom. 12:2</a>) Now that you have transformed your mind from worldly thinking to Scriptural thinking, do not turn back to the old world for companions or for a marriage partner. Did not Jesus speak of worldly people as being spiritually dead when he said: “Let the dead bury their dead”?

Why, then, should the living seek close association with the dead?</p>

<strong>Nehemiah</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><span id="page1216" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1216" data-before-text="1216"></span>It was after this that the enemies made attempts to stop the rebuilding work. Four times they tried to allure Nehemiah away from his project, but he informed them that he was unable to take time off from the great work that he was doing. Thereafter Sanballat sent an open letter that contained false charges and suggested that they meet for counsel. Nehemiah replied: “Things such as you are saying have not been brought about, but it is out of your own heart that you are inventing them.” Trying still another trick, Tobiah and Sanballat hired a Jew to frighten Nehemiah into wrongfully hiding in the temple. Nehemiah, however, did not give way to fear, and the repair work came to a successful completion on the twenty-fifth day of Elul (August-September), just fifty-two days after construction work began. Nevertheless, Tobiah continued to send intimidating letters to Nehemiah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Neh. chap. 6</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">With the wall completed, Nehemiah directed his attention to the work of organizing the temple servants. Next he placed two men in command of the city, one of these being his brother Hanani. Nehemiah also gave instructions regarding the opening and the closing of the city gates and the guarding of them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Neh. 7:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>GENEALOGICAL ENROLLMENT</strong></p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">At this time Jerusalem’s population was quite small. This seemingly was why God put it into Nehemiah’s heart to assemble the nobles, deputy rulers and people to get them enrolled genealogically, for the information procured thereby could have served as a basis for taking steps to increase the population of Jerusalem. Apparently while Nehemiah was giving consideration to this genealogical enrollment, he found the record of those who had returned from Babylonian exile with Zerubbabel.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Neh. 7:4-7</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>LAW OBSERVANCE RESTORED</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">It was probably at Nehemiah’s direction that an assembly was held in the public square near the Water Gate. Although Ezra the priest evidently took the lead in giving instruction in the Law, Nehemiah also shared therein. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Neh. 8:1-12</a>) Next the eight-day festival of booths was held. Two days later the Israelites convened again. During this assembly a general confession of Israel’s sin was made. Thereafter a written confession contract was drawn up. This confession contract or “trustworthy arrangement” was attested by the princes, Levites, and priests. Nehemiah, the “Tirshatha [governor]” was the first to attest it by seal. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Neh. 8:13–10:1</a>) All the people agreed to refrain from intermarriage with foreigners, to observe the sabbaths and to support the temple service. Next, one person out of every ten was selected by lot to dwell permanently in Jerusalem.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Neh. 10:28–11:1</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">It was after this that the wall of Jerusalem was inaugurated. For the occasion Nehemiah appointed two large thanksgiving choirs and processions to make a tour of the wall in opposite directions. This was done and all met at the temple to offer sacrifices. Additionally, men were appointed to be in charge of the contributions for the priests and Levites.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Neh. 12:27-47</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">About twelve years later, in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, Nehemiah left Jerusalem. Upon his return, he found deplorable conditions among the Jews. Eliashib the high priest had made a dining hall in the courtyard of the temple for the use of Tobiah, the very man who earlier had viciously opposed the work of Nehemiah. Immediately Nehemiah took action. He threw all of Tobiah’s furniture outside the dining hall and instructed that the dining hall be cleansed.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Additionally, Nehemiah took measures to ensure the contributions for the Levites and enforced strict sabbath observance. He also administered discipline against those who had taken foreign wives, their sons by these women not even being able to speak the Jewish tongue: “And I began to find fault with them and call down evil upon them and strike some men of them and pull out their hair and make them swear by God: ‘You should not give your daughters to their sons, and you should not accept any of their daughters for your sons or yourselves.’”</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Nehemiah’s ‘finding fault’ with these men doubtless was his reproving and rebuking them by means of God’s law, exposing their wrong action. These men were bringing the restored nation into disfavor with God, after God had kindly repatriated them from Babylon to restore true worship at Jerusalem. Nehemiah ‘called down evil upon them,’ meaning that he recited the judgments of God’s law against such violators. He “struck” them, probably not personally, but ordered them flogged as an official judicial action. He ‘pulled out [a portion of] their hair.’ This was a symbol of moral indignation and ignominy before the people. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ezra 9:3</a>.) Nehemiah then chased away the grandson of High Priest Eliashib, who had become a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Neh. 13:1-28</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong>NEHEMIAH AN OUTSTANDING EXAMPLE</strong></p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Nehemiah stands out as a sterling example of faithfulness and devotion. He was unselfish, leaving behind a prominent position as cupbearer in the courtyard of Artaxerxes to undertake the rebuilding of Jerusalem’s walls. As there were many enemies, Nehemiah willingly exposed himself to danger in behalf of his people and true worship. Not only did he direct the work of repairing the wall of Jerusalem, but he also had an active personal share in the task. He wasted no time, was courageous and fearless, relied fully on Jehovah and was discreet in what he did. Zealous for true worship, Nehemiah knew God’s law and applied it. He was concerned about building up the faith of his fellow Israelites. He showed himself to be a man who manifested a proper fear of Jehovah God. Though enforcing God’s law zealously, he did not domineer over others for selfish benefit, but showed concern for the oppressed. Never did he demand the bread due the governor. Instead, he provided food for a considerable number of persons at his own expense. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Neh. 5:14-19</a>) Appropriately Nehemiah could pray: “Do remember me, O my God, for good.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013140/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Neh. 13:31</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Weighing Wedlock in These Last Days</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> You may be a Christian parent who will arrange a marriage for your son or daughter. Or you may be an adult dedicated servant of Jehovah God who plans to marry. In either case, let the words of faithful Ezra ring in your ears, his earnest supplication at a time of national wrongdoing. The Jews had been delivered from captivity to Babylon. They had the Scriptures and good examples from the past. These they ignored, and great was their guilt before Jehovah. But how had they sinned? This Ezra revealed as he pleaded: “And after all that has come upon us for our bad deeds and our great guiltiness—for you yourself, O our God, have underestimated our error, and you have given us those who have escaped such as these—shall we go breaking your commandments again and forming marriage alliances with the peoples of these detestable things? Will you not get incensed at us to the limit so that there will be none remaining and none escaping? O Jehovah the God of Israel, you are righteous, because we have been left over as an escaped people as at this day. Here we are before you in our guiltiness, for it is impossible to stand before you on account of this.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965683/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezra 9:13-15</a>) The Jews put away their foreign wives in the days of Ezra, in recognition of their great guiltiness before God. Do not forget that they had sinned against <span id="page561" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="561" data-before-text="561"></span>Jehovah by intermarrying with the pagan Canaanites. Never minimize the gravity of disobeying God with respect to wedlock.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 5. According to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965683/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Malachi 2:10-12</a>, in what way had the Jews profaned Jehovah’s holiness? What conclusion must a Christian therefore reach?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> As a Christian dedicated to Jehovah God you undoubtedly hold the Bible in high esteem and you wish to abide by its righteous principles. Well, then, take to heart also these words of the prophet Malachi: “Is it not one father that all of us have? Is it not one God that has created us? Why is it that we deal treacherously with one another, in profaning the covenant of our forefathers? Judah has dealt treacherously, and a detestable thing has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the holiness of Jehovah, which He has loved, and he has taken possession of the daughter of a foreign god as a bride. Jehovah will cut off each one that does it, one who is awake and one who is answering, from the tents of Jacob, and one who is presenting a gift offering to Jehovah of armies.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965683/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Mal. 2:10-12</a>) Those Jews certainly did not please Jehovah by taking “the daughter of a foreign god as a bride.” In doing so, they had profaned His holiness. Earlier, Solomon had married many foreign women. Because of them he sinned. For Jews of Nehemiah’s day who had married pagan women, Nehemiah used Solomon as an example of a wrongdoer. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965683/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Neh. 13:25-27</a>) Christians today realize, therefore, that they could never please Almighty God by marrying an unbeliever.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 6. What is Jehovah’s unchanging view of marriage for his servants?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Despite the passing of time, Jehovah’s view of marriage alliances for his servants has never changed. “Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers,” wrote the apostle Paul to the Corinthians. “For what sharing do righteousness and lawlessness have? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness? Further, what harmony is there between Christ and Belial? Or what portion does a faithful person have with an unbeliever?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965683/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Cor. 6:14, 15</a>) Obey Jehovah, the unchanging God. Do not go against his will in matters relating to wedlock and risk your spirituality and life itself by becoming unevenly yoked with an unbeliever.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965683/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Mal. 3:6</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 7. (a) Does either the Watch Tower Society or the Christian congregation advocate the marriage of a dedicated Christian to an unbeliever?

Naturally, the congregation service committee is responsible for deciding whether the congregation’s Kingdom Hall will be used for a particular marriage ceremony or not.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>AVOIDING AN UNEVEN YOKE</strong></p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 8. How can a Christian avoid becoming emotionally involved with an unbeliever at school? At his place of employment?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> A person may realize that, as a Christian, he should marry “only in the Lord.” Yet school activities, secular employment, and the like, may throw a dedicated single Christian into contact with unbelievers of the opposite sex. What then? Well, while attending school is not something to be avoided, the Christian student assuredly does not have to engage in extracurricular school activities, regularly attending school dances and other functions that will place him in unnecessary contact with unbelievers. Similarly, one may have to work with worldly persons in the same office, but that does not mean that the mature Christian will attend office parties at which he may become emotionally involved with an unbeliever, even running the risk of falling into immorality. To avoid these things, watch your associations. Be firm, resolute. <span id="page562" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="562" data-before-text="562"></span>In your determination to do what is right, Jehovah will surely uphold you.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965683/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:33</a>.</p>

<strong>Part Two</strong><br/><p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[69]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="29"><sup>29</sup></span> The Ninevites will thus condemn the <span id="page114" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="114" data-before-text="114"></span>Jews of that generation for their unbelief and hardheartedness, but they will not sentence such Jews to Gehenna. Only the heavenly Judge, Jehovah God, and his Deputy Jesus Christ, can do that. By what the Jews of that condemned generation do on earth during the remaining years of the millennial reign of Christ, they will prove one of two things. What? Whether they deserve to be sentenced to Gehenna or the “lake of fire,” “the second death,” or deserve to have their names entered on the “scroll of life.” They will thus have to prove whether they came forth from Haʹdes or Sheol to a resurrection of life or to a resurrection of adverse judgment.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965122/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29</a>.</p><p id="p70" data-pid="70" class="qu">30. (a) By whom else will a condemnation come upon that Jewish generation? (b) To that end what will the queen of Sheba have to have?</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[70]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"><sup>30</sup></span> Similar condemnation of those Jews of Jesus’ day will come from another quarter besides that of the men of Assyrian Nineveh, namely, from the “queen of the south.” According to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965122/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">1 Kings 10:1-10</a> and; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965122/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 9:1-9</a>, she was the queen of Sheba. Her country, Sheba or the land of the Sabaeans, lay over a thousand miles to the south of Jerusalem, in southwest Arabia, probably in the eastern area of what is today known as Yemen. Her land or people is not named in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965122/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Ezekiel, chapters 31 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965122/38/1" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> 32</a>, among those nations whose dead are declared to be in Sheol or Haʹdes, but her land was in that general land area. This queen of the south or of Sheba will “be raised up in the judgment with [not, against] this generation.” This will require a resurrection of her, and it is not reasonable to think that she will be the only one of her people to rise up in that judgment before the “great white throne” during the thousand years of Christ’s reign. Like those others whom Ezekiel named, the queen of the south and her people are in Sheol or Haʹdes and will therefore have a resurrection.</p><p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="qu">31. (a) Why was the queen of the south’s conduct condemnatory of the Jewish generation of Jesus’ days? (b) How should this affect them on Judgment Day?</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" data-rel-pid="[71]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="31"><sup>31</sup></span> Among her resurrected people the queen in particular will condemn the Jewish generation of Jesus’ day, by her conduct a thousand years before Jesus’ day. She came all that distance by the transportation of that time to hear the wisdom of King Solomon and to behold his works at Jerusalem; and as a result she acknowledged the God of King Solomon. But Jesus Christ was far greater and more important than King Solomon; and yet the Jewish generation of Jesus’ day, for the most part, would not listen to his heavenly wisdom. So, on the judgment day during Christ’s reign, the contrast between them and the queen of the south will be something additional to humiliate them. This ought to help them to be obedient to the millennial kingdom of the Greater Solomon.</p><p id="p72" data-pid="72" class="qu">32.

His father David is mentioned in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965122/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:32</a> as being among the approved ancient witnesses of Jehovah, but Solomon, the wisest king of ancient times and the writer of three Bible books, is not mentioned there. Some time after the queen of Sheba visited him, he yielded to the influence of his hundreds of wives and concubines and fell away to the foolish worship of pagan idols.

Was it not because of these that Solomon the king of Israel sinned?

It is difficult enough to stay on the narrow way to life without endangering your footing with bad associations. When you came into the New World society and began walking with God on the narrow way to life, you had to make many changes that were for your own good. The apostle Paul spoke about this when he said: “Quit being fashioned after this system of things, but be transformed by making your mind over, that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and complete will of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961483/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Rom. 12:2</a>) Now that you have transformed your mind from worldly thinking to Scriptural thinking, do not turn back to the old world for companions or for a marriage partner.

Did he mention that he had left his position as cupbearer of the king of Persia and had made the long journey to Jerusalem and had rebuilt its wall in fifty-two days despite enemy threats? No! But he spoke of what he had done in behalf of the house of God. He prayed: “Do remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my acts of loving-kindness that I have performed in connection with the house of my God and the guardianship of it.” He insisted on clean servants ministering at God’s house; but not so the high priest Eliashib, for he had let a grandson of his enter a mixed marriage and marry the daughter of the Samaritan enemy, Sanballat the Horonite. As regards this, Nehemiah says:</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="28"><sup>28</sup></span> “And one of the sons of Joiada the son of Eliashib the high priest was a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite.

And I purified them from everything foreign and proceeded to assign duties to the priests and to the Levites, each one in his own work, even for the supply of the wood at appointed times and for the first ripe fruits.

Yes; for Nehemiah’s everlasting good. Jehovah God is not unrighteous so that he has forgot and will leave unrewarded all the good that Governor Nehemiah did for the house of God in Jerusalem. He has kept Nehemiah’s prayer for remembrance on permanent record by having it made a part of the inspired Holy Scriptures. To the Hebrew followers of Jesus Christ, who has done even greater service in behalf of the true “house of our God,” it is written: “God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name, in that you have ministered to the holy ones and continue ministering.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Heb. 6:10</a>) So too with Nehemiah. He truly feared Jehovah God; and in the writings of Malachi, who was evidently a contemporary of Nehemiah in the rebuilt city of Jerusalem, we find these appropriate words included:</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="31"><sup>31</sup></span> “At that time those in fear of Jehovah spoke with one another, each one with his companion, and Jehovah kept paying attention and listening.

But during the thousand-year reign of “Messiah the Leader,” Nehemiah will be rewarded with a resurrection from the dead.

He will learn what happened to the last one of the Jewish temples there in the year 70 of our Common Era, as foretold by Jesus Christ the Son of God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matt. 23:37 to 24:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Luke 19:36-44;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/24/2" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> 21:5, 6</a>) He will learn about the spiritual temple of God, the one that was prefigured by that material temple on Mount Moriah in Jerusalem. He will learn how the spiritual temple was kept from being neglected by the followers of the great High Priest of this temple. Nehemiah himself will join other faithful ones on earth in worshiping Jehovah God through this exalted spiritual temple. He will be an outstanding example of how persons who do not neglect God’s house are fully rewarded without fail.</p>

<strong>The Samaritans—a Fading People</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In the lapse of time, between the exiling of the Israelites and the bringing of these foreigners into the emptied Samaritan cities, the land became infested with wild beasts. The inspired account says: “It came about at the start of their dwelling <span id="page425" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="425" data-before-text="425"></span>there that they did not fear Jehovah. Therefore Jehovah sent lions among them and they came to be killers among them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960522/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Ki. 17:25</a>) These pagans believed that each district and country had its own god and that to prosper they must learn how to appease the God of this land. So they sent word to their king requesting that someone be sent to teach them the ways of Jehovah, that they might know how to worship the God of Israel. The king sent back a Samaritan priest, who took up residence at Bethel. He began to teach these foreigners the ways of Jehovah. The pagan settlers incorporated this worship of the God of Israel with their demon worship. A mixed religion resulted—the Samaritan religion. The few remaining Israelites became miserably corrupted both in their behavior and in their religion. They married foreigners and brought forth a mixed race, composed partly of Israelites and partly of settlers. This mixture of humanity became known as Samaritans.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960522/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezra 4:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960522/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 10</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">This idolatrous religious concoction continued for about three hundred years, down till the building of the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim by the governor of Samaria, Sanballat the Horonite, said to be with the sanction of Alexander the Great. Earlier, during the reigns of Hezekiah and Josiah, some few returned to true worship. The high places of demon worship of Samaria were destroyed. Their altars were desecrated, their priests slain and all the remnant of Israel acknowledged the temple on Mount Zion or, more specifically, on adjacent Mount Moriah. Any restoration of true worship, however, was short-lived. With the death of Josiah the land of Samaria fell back into idolatrous worship.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>THE SAMARITAN SCHISM</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Nothing is known of the Samaritans from Josiah’s time down till the arrival of Zerubbabel and Joshua the high priest in Palestine in 537 B.C. These men were authorized by King Cyrus to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem. The Samaritans approached them with an offer to assist them in their building program, but Zerubbabel rejected their offer. This treatment roused the wrath of the Samaritans. By the time Ezra arrived on the scene in Jerusalem nearly seventy years later, the ill feeling had faded and the Jews and the Samaritans were on the friendliest of terms. In fact, too friendly for Ezra’s liking, for the Jews had intermarried with the Samaritans. Ezra, the priest, declared these intermarriages illegal, contrary to God’s instruction given at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960522/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Exodus 34:16</a>. He called for the Jews to separate themselves from their foreign wives. This caused much resentment among both the Jews and the Samaritans. Many influential Jews refused to listen to Ezra’s appeal and fled to Samaria. The Samaritans became embittered with the way their womenfolk and children were being treated. This led to a sharp division between the Jews and the Samaritans.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">During Nehemiah’s absence from Jerusalem, about 443 B.C., the Jews again married Samaritan women. When Nehemiah returned to Jerusalem, he insisted that they separate from their foreign wives. Nehemiah says: “One of the sons of Joiada the son of Eliashib the high priest was a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite. So I chased him away from me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960522/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Neh. 13:28</a>) It was Nehemiah and not popular Jewish sentiment that expelled the unworthy priestling. This led to more resentment.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The Bible says nothing more about this and in no way connects it with the Samaritan schism. The Jewish historian Josephus, however, informs us that a nephew of this man whom Nehemiah chased away from him married a daughter of Sanballat, the governor of Samaria. The nephew’s name was Manasseh. The elders of Jerusalem <span id="page426" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="426" data-before-text="426"></span>were quite indignant that a relative of the high priest should marry a foreigner. They demanded that Manasseh either divorce his wife or not serve in the priesthood. All Jerusalem was in an uproar over this, because many priests and Levites were entangled in these marriages. When Manasseh refused to give up his Samaritan wife, he was thrown out of the country. A number of priests, who also refused to separate from their wives, joined him.</p>

<strong>Nehemiah</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><strong>Nehemiah, an Outstanding Example.</strong> Nehemiah stands out as a sterling example of faithfulness and devotion. He was unselfish, leaving behind a prominent position as cupbearer in the courtyard of Artaxerxes to undertake the rebuilding of Jerusalem’s walls. As there were many enemies, Nehemiah willingly exposed himself to danger in behalf of his people and true worship. Not only did he direct the work of repairing the wall of Jerusalem but he also had an active, personal share in the task. He wasted no time, was courageous and fearless, relied fully on Jehovah, and was discreet in what he did. Zealous for true worship, Nehemiah knew God’s law and applied it. He was concerned about building up the faith of his fellow Israelites. He showed himself to be a man who manifested a proper fear of Jehovah God. Though enforcing God’s law zealously, he did not domineer over others for selfish benefit but showed concern for the oppressed. Never did he demand the bread due the governor. Instead, he provided food for a considerable number of persons at his own expense.

Have you ever been plagued with similar feelings, thinking that you do not merit God’s attention, let alone have his approval? If so, the words recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011084/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Nehemiah 13:31</a> may be of encouragement to you.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Nehemiah, governor of the Jews in the fifth century B.C.E., did his best to please God. He spearheaded the rebuilding of Jerusalem’s walls despite enemy opposition. He enforced God’s Law, cared for the oppressed, and sought to build up the faith of his fellow Israelites. Did God notice the good that this faithful man had done? Did Nehemiah have Jehovah’s approval? We can discern the answers in the closing words of the book that bears his name.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Nehemiah prays: “Do remember me, O my God, for good.”<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2011084/0">a</a> Is Nehemiah afraid that his good deeds have gone unnoticed by God or that God will forget about him? No. Nehemiah is no doubt aware of what earlier Bible writers have said about Jehovah’s keen interest in his faithful worshippers and their good deeds. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011084/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Exodus 32:32, 33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011084/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Psalm 56:8</a>) What, then, is he asking God to do? One reference work notes that the Hebrew term translated “remember” implies “the affection of the mind and the action which accompanies recollection.” With full faith in the power of prayer, Nehemiah is asking God to remember him with affection and to bless him.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011084/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Nehemiah 2:4</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Will Jehovah answer Nehemiah’s prayer for remembrance? In one respect, he already has. The very fact that Jehovah saw fit to have a permanent record made of Nehemiah’s prayer, making it part of the inspired Scriptures, assures us that he remembers Nehemiah with affection. But the “Hearer of prayer” will do more to answer Nehemiah’s heartfelt request.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011084/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 65:2</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">God will yet reward Nehemiah for all the good that he did for pure worship.

<strong>Neglecting the House of the Creator of Heaven and Earth</strong><br/><p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"><sup>26</sup></span> Besides this, Nehemiah did not wait upon the delinquent high priest Eliashib, but, as he says: “I put Shelemiah the priest and Zadok the copyist and Pedaiah of the Levites in charge of the stores; and under their control there was Hanan the son of Zaccur the son of Mattaniah, for <span id="page747" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="747" data-before-text="747"></span>they were considered faithful; and upon them it devolved to do the distributing to their brothers.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Neh. 13:13</a>) So now the ministerial Levites had no reason to run home!</p><p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="qu">27, 28.

Did he mention that he had left his position as cupbearer of the king of Persia and had made the long journey to Jerusalem and had rebuilt its wall in fifty-two days despite enemy threats? No! But he spoke of what he had done in behalf of the house of God. He prayed: “Do remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my acts of loving-kindness that I have performed in connection with the house of my God and the guardianship of it.” He insisted on clean servants ministering at God’s house; but not so the high priest Eliashib, for he had let a grandson of his enter a mixed marriage and marry the daughter of the Samaritan enemy, Sanballat the Horonite. As regards this, Nehemiah says:</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="28"><sup>28</sup></span> “And one of the sons of Joiada the son of Eliashib the high priest was a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite. So I chased him away from me.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Neh. 13:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 28</a>.</p><p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="qu">29. According to his concluding words, what did Nehemiah do with regard to the defilement of the priesthood and the covenant of the temple servants?</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[62]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="29"><sup>29</sup></span> The report of this action for the benefit of God’s house Nehemiah follows up by saying at the close of the book that bears his name: “Do remember them, O my God, on account of the defilement of the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites. And I purified them from everything foreign and proceeded to assign duties to the priests and to the Levites, each one in his own work, even for the supply of the wood at appointed times and for the first ripe fruits. Do remember me, O my God, for good.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Neh. 13:29-31</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="ss"><strong>REMEMBERED FOR NOT NEGLECTING</strong></p><p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="qu">30, 31.

(b) What appropriate words did the prophet Malachi write regarding fearers of Jehovah?</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"><sup>30</sup></span> Will Jehovah God answer that prayer of Nehemiah’s of twenty-four centuries ago? Yes; for Nehemiah’s everlasting good. Jehovah God is not unrighteous so that he has forgot and will leave unrewarded all the good that Governor Nehemiah did for the house of God in Jerusalem. He has kept Nehemiah’s prayer for remembrance on permanent record by having it made a part of the inspired Holy Scriptures. To the Hebrew followers of Jesus Christ, who has done even greater service in behalf of the true “house of our God,” it is written: “God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name, in that you have ministered to the holy ones and continue ministering.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Heb. 6:10</a>) So too with Nehemiah. He truly feared Jehovah God; and in the writings of Malachi, who was evidently a contemporary of Nehemiah in the rebuilt city of Jerusalem, we find these appropriate words included:</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="31"><sup>31</sup></span> “At that time those in fear of Jehovah spoke with one another, each one with his companion, and Jehovah kept paying attention and listening. And a book of remembrance began to be written up before him for those in fear of Jehovah and for those thinking upon his name.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Mal. 3:16</a>.</p><p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu">32. (a) How will Nehemiah be rewarded, and what will he then learn? (b) Of what will he be an outstanding example?</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" data-rel-pid="[64]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="32"><sup>32</sup></span> Nehemiah yet sleeps in death in Sheol or Haʹdes, the common grave of dead mankind. But during the thousand-year reign of “Messiah the Leader,” Nehemiah will be rewarded with a resurrection from the dead. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Dan. 9:24-27</a>) He will then find no longer a material temple of Jehovah <span id="page748" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="748" data-before-text="748"></span>God standing on Mount Moriah in Jerusalem. He will learn what happened to the last one of the Jewish temples there in the year 70 of our Common Era, as foretold by Jesus Christ the Son of God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matt. 23:37 to 24:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Luke 19:36-44;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/24/2" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> 21:5, 6</a>) He will learn about the spiritual temple of God, the one that was prefigured by that material temple on Mount Moriah in Jerusalem. He will learn how the spiritual temple was kept from being neglected by the followers of the great High Priest of this temple. Nehemiah himself will join other faithful ones on earth in worshiping Jehovah God through this exalted spiritual temple. He will be an outstanding example of how persons who do not neglect God’s house are fully rewarded without fail.</p>

<strong>Nehemiah Makes Most of Opportunities</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Nehemiah, by being alert and fearless, made the most of his opportunities, permitting absolutely nothing to interfere with the great building work. As a result, in the incredibly short time of less than two months, fifty-two days, to be exact, the entire wall around Jerusalem was completed. <span id="page239" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="239" data-before-text="239"></span>And all to Jehovah’s glory: “When all our enemies heard of it, all the nations round about us feared and fell decidedly in their own esteem; for they perceived that this work had been done with the help of our God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Neh. 6:15, 16</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The wall being completed, Nehemiah then gave his attention to the work of organizing the temple servants. Next he placed two men in charge of the city, one of whom he describes as “a faithful man” and one who “feared God more than many”. He also gave instructions regarding the opening and the closing of the city’s gates and the guarding of them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Neh. 7:1-3</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Now was a suitable time for assemblies, and so Nehemiah arranged for a series of these to be held in a comparatively short period of time. Each of these furnished an opportunity to advance the worship of Jehovah; and Nehemiah made good use of them. At the first one he checked the genealogies and arranged for contributions for the temple service. Nehemiah set a good example, and the heads of the families and the rest of the Jews responded to the extent of more than one-third of a million dollars. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Neh. 7:5-72</a>) Another assembly featured instruction from the law of God. The people were told to rejoice for “the joy of Jehovah is your strength” (<em>Am. Stan. Ver.</em>). This assembly led to the celebration of the feast of tabernacles, which lasted for eight days.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Nehemiah 8</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Two days later Nehemiah called the people together for another assembly, to which they came clothed in sackcloth, and fasting. In a prayer to Jehovah the people heard the record of his loving-kindness and mercy from Abraham’s time to their own day, and a covenant was proposed to which they all subscribed. They bound themselves to faithfully keep the law of God, not to intermarry with the heathen, to observe the sabbath day and year, and to bring their offerings to the temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Nehemiah 9 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 10</a>) After this lots were cast and one out of ten dwelt in Jerusalem.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The dedication of the walls called for another assembly. For this Nehemiah summoned all the Levite musicians, both singers and instrumentalists with their harps, cymbals and lyres. Two groups were appointed to give thanks to Jehovah, each under the direction of a leader. “They offered great sacrifices that day and rejoiced; for God had made them rejoice with great joy; . . . so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard far away.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Neh. 12:27-43</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">After twelve years of governorship Nehemiah returned to Shushan the palace, but not to stay there. “After some days” he again asked leave of the king and came back to Jerusalem. And what a condition he found! Israel had backslid; the temple was being polluted, its service neglected, the sabbath was being profaned and there was intermarrying with the heathen. He cast all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the great temple chamber that that enemy of the Jews had appropriated for himself with the connivance of a priestly relative; had the temple chambers cleansed and the vessels and offerings returned to them. Noting that the Levites had gone back to their farms because of lack of support, he brought this to the attention of the rulers, recalled the Levites and provided for the faithful distribution of the tithes. He also enforced the keeping of the sabbath and took punitive measures against those who intermarried with the heathen, especially the priests and Levites, not mincing matters one bit.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Neh. 13:4-30</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Nehemiah was indeed an alert, discreet, fearless and unselfish servant of Jehovah God. With zeal he ‘made the most of his opportunities’ to build and to fight, and to organize the true worship and to keep it pure. At all times he looked to God to direct his ways and ascribed all honor to him. Soon God will answer his prayer, “Remember me, O my God, for good,” by giving him a resurrection to life on earth, with princely service in the new world. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950564/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Neh. 13:31</a>) Are you, as Nehemiah did, making the most of your opportunities?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"></p>

<strong>May Jehovah Credit Good to Your Account</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> One man who gave a good account of himself to God was Nehemiah, cupbearer to Persian King Artaxerxes (Longimanus).

He could therefore pray: “This, also, do remember to my account, O my God, and do feel sorry for me according to the abundance of your loving-kindness.” Appropriately, too, Nehemiah concluded his divinely inspired book with the plea: “Do remember me, O my God, for good.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996683/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Nehemiah 13:22,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996683/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 31</a>.</p>
