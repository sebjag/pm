<strong>Christians and Taxpaying</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Scriptures often mention taxes. Through Moses, God commanded the Israelites to pay certain taxes for the upkeep of the central sanctuary of worship.

While subject to Persia, for example, each Israelite had to pay a “tribute” that was apparently quite high, since many of the Jews had to borrow money to meet that obligation.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101979171/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Neh. 5:4</a>.</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006082/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Nehemiah 5:11</a>) It was cruel to impose this on people already heavily burdened with taxes and a food shortage.

<strong>Bank, Banker</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Certain ones of the Israelites who returned from Babylon to the land of Judah were condemned for applying harsh banking practices toward their needy brothers, exacting security in the form of their homes, lands, vineyards, and even their children, and charging an interest rate of 12 percent annually (one hundredth part per month). Those debtors who defaulted because of insolvency thus suffered the loss of their properties. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000554/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ne 5:1-11</a>) Such improper action, however, did not place a blanket condemnation on the receiving of interest, as is evidenced by Jesus’ later expression of implied approval of the use of capital to obtain increased funds.​—See <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000554/1">INTEREST</a>.</p>

<strong>Attitudes And Gestures</strong><br/><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb"><span id="page165" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="165" data-before-text="165"></span><em>The laying on of hands</em> was a method of designating the appointment of a person to an office or duty, as in the case of the seven men who were appointed by the apostles to care for the food distribution in the congregation at Jerusalem. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/85/0" data-bid="86-1" class="b">Acts 6:6</a>) Timothy was appointed to a position of oversight by the body of older men in the congregation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/86/0" data-bid="87-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:14</a>) He, in turn, was delegated by the apostle Paul to make appointments of others, which he was admonished to do only after careful consideration.—1Tim. 5:22.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb">The laying on of hands also had other significances, one being the acknowledgment of something, as at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/87/0" data-bid="88-1" class="b">Exodus 29:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/87/1" data-bid="88-2" class="b"> 15</a>, where Aaron and his sons acknowledged the sacrifices as being offered in their behalf. Similar meaning is found in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/88/0" data-bid="89-1" class="b">Leviticus 4:15</a>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">The laying on of hands was also used to designate certain ones to whom benefits or power would flow, as in Jesus’ healing (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/89/0" data-bid="90-1" class="b">Luke 4:40</a>) and in the holy spirit’s coming upon those upon whom Paul laid his hands. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/90/0" data-bid="91-1" class="b">Acts 19:6</a>) This does not mean that the spirit passed through the hands of Paul, but that as Christ’s representative he was authorized to designate, in harmony with the requirements laid down, who would receive gifts of the spirit.

There was a subtle depreciation of true worship from the top down and from the bottom up. Subsequent rebellions of the Jews did not bring relief but brought more oppression by the nations. In the first century the Jewish system of things revolved around the Sanhedrin and around the imposing of handed-down tradition rather than the pure Word of God. There were still a high priest and auxiliary priests to offer sacrifice and administer at the temple, but practices and sectarian doctrines violated completely the spirit of the Mosaic law. How greatly the people needed a leader, a faithful overseer, to lead them back to true worship! Their very lives depended upon this, for the time had come now to take an accounting.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">17.

Jesus was to be the true overseer, and he described himself as being the Fine Shepherd. “The sheep listen to his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.” “I have come that they might have life and might have it in abundance.

He was a leader and called for his followers to come after him. As a nation the Jews rejected him as their overseer and life-giver. So he said: “How often I wanted to gather your children together in the manner that a hen gathers her brood of chicks under her wings, but you people did not want it! Look! Your house is abandoned to you.” How horrible it was in the year 70 when the Romans sacked the city, all “because you did not discern the time of your being inspected.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962322/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Luke 13:34, 35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962322/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 19:44</a>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">19.

A body of older men, including the apostles, took charge of the work and sent representatives from Jerusalem to various parts of the land. “When he [Jesus] ascended on high . . . he gave gifts in men . . . some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelizers, some as shepherds and teachers, with a view to the training of the holy ones, for ministerial work.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962322/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Eph. 4:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962322/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 11, 12</a>) Congregations of holy ones were organized. Overseers were appointed over them. Instructions were sent from the governing body at Jerusalem to strengthen and confirm their faith.

So the enemies proposed that Nehemiah meet them halfway to resolve the differences. Nehemiah could have thought: ‘That sounds reasonable. It is better to talk than to fight.’ But Nehemiah refused. He explained why: “They were scheming to do me harm.” He saw through their scheme and was not deceived. Four times he told his opposers: “I am not able to go down. Why should the work cease while I take off from it and have to go down to you?” The enemies’ attempts to get Nehemiah to compromise failed.

Nehemiah explained: “All of them were trying to make us afraid, saying: ‘Their hands will drop down from the work so that it will not be done.’” This time, however, Nehemiah did rebut his enemies’ accusation, stating: “Things such as you are saying have not been brought about, but it is out of your own heart that you are inventing them.” Moreover, Nehemiah turned to Jehovah for support, praying: “Strengthen my hands.” He trusted that with Jehovah’s help, he would be able to foil this evil plot and push forward with the building project.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007485/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Nehemiah 6:5-9</a>.</p>

<strong>Leprosy</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><span id="page1056" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1056" data-before-text="1056"></span><strong>DIAGNOSIS</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">By means of the Mosaic law Jehovah provided Israel with information enabling the priest to diagnose leprosy and to distinguish between it and other less serious skin afflictions. From what is recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012664/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Leviticus 13:1-46</a>, it can be seen that leprosy might begin with an eruption, a scab, a blotch, a boil, or a scar in one’s flesh from fire. Sometimes the symptoms were very clear. The hair in the affected area had turned white and the malady was seen to be deeper than the skin. For example, a white eruption in the skin might turn the hair white and raw flesh might appear in the eruption. This meant that one had leprosy and was to be declared unclean. However, in other cases the malady was not deeper than the skin and a period of quarantine was imposed, with subsequent inspection by the priest, who made a final determination in the case.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">It was acknowledged that leprosy could reach a stage in which it was not contagious. When it overspread the entire body, all of it having turned white, and living flesh was not in evidence, it was a sign that the diseased action was over and that only the marks of its ravages remained. The priest would then declare the victim clean, the disease posing no further danger to anyone.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012664/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Lev. 13:12-17</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">If the leper’s malady left him and he was cured, there were arrangements whereby he could ceremonially purify himself, and these included the offering of sacrifice in his behalf by the priest. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012664/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Lev. 14:1-32</a>) But the priest declared the uncured leper unclean, whereupon his garments were torn, his head was to become ungroomed, he was to cover the moustache or upper lip and was to call out “Unclean, unclean!” He had to dwell in isolation outside the camp (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012664/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Lev. 13:43-46</a>), a measure that was taken so that the leper would not contaminate those in the midst of whom Jehovah was tenting. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012664/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Num. 5:1-4</a>) It seems that in Biblical times lepers associated with one another or lived in groups, making it possible for them to aid one another.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012664/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Ki. 7:3-5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012664/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Luke 17:12</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong><em>In garments and houses</em></strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Leprosy could also affect woolen or linen garments, or an article of skin. The plague might disappear with washing, and there were arrangements for quarantining the article. But where this yellowish-green or reddish plague persisted, malignant leprosy was present and the article was to be burned. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012664/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Lev. 13:47-59</a>) If yellowish-green or reddish depressions appeared in the wall of a house, the priest imposed a quarantine. It might be necessary to tear out affected stones and have the house scraped off inside, the stones and scraped-off mortar being disposed of in an unclean place outside the city. If the plague returned, the house was declared unclean and was pulled down, and the materials were disposed of in an unclean place. But for the house pronounced clean there was an arrangement for purification. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012664/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Lev. 14:33-57</a>) It has been suggested that the leprosy affecting garments or houses was a type of mildew or mold; however, about this there is uncertainty.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>AS A SIGN</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">One of the signs Jehovah empowered Moses to perform to prove to the Israelites that God sent him involved leprosy. As instructed, Moses stuck his hand in the upper fold of his garment and, upon withdrawing it, “his hand was stricken with leprosy like snow!” It was restored “like the rest of his flesh” by returning it into the upper fold of his garment and withdrawing it once again. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012664/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ex. 4:6, 7</a>) Miriam was stricken with “leprosy as white as snow” as a divine act because she spoke against Moses. He begged God to heal her, which was done, but she was quarantined outside the camp for seven days.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012664/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Num. 12:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012664/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 9-15</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>IN ELISHA’S TIME</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Naaman the Syrian was “a valiant, mighty man, though a leper.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012664/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Ki. 5:1</a>) His pride nearly lost him the opportunity of being cured, but he eventually did as instructed by Elisha, plunging into the Jordan seven times, and “his flesh came back like the flesh of a little boy and he became clean.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012664/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Ki. 5:14</a>) He thereupon became a worshiper of Jehovah. However, Elisha’s attendant Gehazi greedily acquired a gift from Naaman in the prophet’s name, thus misrepresenting his master and, in effect, making the undeserved kindness of God a means of material gain. For his misdeed Gehazi was now stricken with leprosy by God and became “a leper white as snow.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012664/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Ki. 5:20-27</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">That there were various lepers in Israel in Elisha’s day is shown by the presence of four Israelite lepers outside Samaria’s gates while Elisha was inside the city.

Hence, Christ said: “Also, there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed, but Naaman the man of Syria.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012664/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Luke 4:27</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>HEALED BY JESUS AND HIS DISCIPLES</strong></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">During his Galilean ministry, Jesus healed a leper described by Luke as “a man full of leprosy.” Jesus ordered him to tell nobody and said: “But go off and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering in connection with your cleansing just as Moses directed, for a witness to them.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012664/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Luke 5:12-16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012664/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Matt. 8:2-4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012664/18/2" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> Mark 1:40-45</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">When Christ sent out the twelve apostles, he told them, among other things, “make lepers clean.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012664/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matt. 10:8</a>) Later, while he was going through Samaria and Galilee, Jesus cured ten lepers in a certain village.

Nehemiah explained: “All of them were trying to make us afraid, saying: ‘Their hands will drop down from the work so that it will not be done.’” This time, however, Nehemiah did rebut his enemies’ accusation, stating: “Things such as you are saying have not been brought about, but it is out of your own heart that you are inventing them.” Moreover, Nehemiah turned to Jehovah for support, praying: “Strengthen my hands.” He trusted that with Jehovah’s help, he would be able to foil this evil plot and push forward with the building project.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007485/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Nehemiah 6:5-9</a>.</p>

Shemaiah said to Nehemiah: “Let us meet by appointment at the house of the true God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple; for they are coming in to kill you.” Shemaiah said that Nehemiah was about to be assassinated but that he could save his life by hiding in the temple. However, Nehemiah was not a priest. He would commit a sin by hiding in the house of God. Would he break God’s Law in an attempt to save his life? Nehemiah responded: “Who is there like me that could enter into the temple and live? I shall not enter!” Why did Nehemiah not fall into the trap that had been set for him? Because he knew that although Shemaiah was a fellow Israelite, “it was not God that had sent him.” After all, a true prophet would never advise him to break God’s Law. Again, Nehemiah did not let himself be conquered by evil opposers.

The apostle Paul stated that “he that prophesies up-builds and encourages and consoles men by his speech,” and he held prophesying forth as a proper and particularly desirable goal for all Christians to strive after. Whereas speaking foreign tongues was a sign for unbelievers, prophesying was for believers. Yet even the unbeliever attending a Christian meeting would benefit by prophesying, being reproved and closely examined by it so that the “secrets of his heart become manifest.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/91/0" data-bid="92-1" class="b">1 Cor. 14:1-6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/91/1" data-bid="92-2" class="b"> 22-25</a>) This, too, indicates that Christian prophesying did not consist mainly of prediction but instead often dealt with things relating to the present, though clearly proceeding from a source beyond the ordinary, being inspired by God. Paul counseled on the need for good order and self-control in congregational prophesying, so that all could learn and be encouraged.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/92/0" data-bid="93-1" class="b">1 Cor. 14:29-33</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">There were, of course, certain ones particularly selected or gifted to serve as prophets. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/93/0" data-bid="94-1" class="b">1 Cor. 12:4-11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/93/1" data-bid="94-2" class="b"> 27-29</a>) Paul himself had the gift of prophesying, yet he is primarily known as an apostle. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/94/0" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Acts 20:22-25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/94/1" data-bid="95-2" class="b"> 27:21-26,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/94/2" data-bid="95-3" class="b"> 31,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/94/3" data-bid="95-4" class="b"> 34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/94/4" data-bid="95-5" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 13:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013482/94/5" data-bid="95-6" class="b"> 14:6</a>.) Those especially designated as prophets, such as Agabus, Judas and Silas, appear to have been outstanding spokesmen for the Christian congregation, second only to the apostles.

<strong>A Powerful Identification of the Messiah</strong><br/><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">It would take about four months to make the trip from Shushan, the king’s winter capital, to Jerusalem, placing Nehemiah’s arrival at about the beginning of the eleventh month Ab. Nehemiah rested and held conferences for three days, inspected the city walls by night, then gave orders for the building to begin. This would be about the third or fourth day of Ab, 455 B.C.E., or about July 26-27 or 27-28, 455 B.C.E., still in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes.<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965762/2">c</a> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Neh. 2:11-18</a>) It marks our starting point for the count of time given by this important prophecy of Daniel. This is when the <span id="page632" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="632" data-before-text="632"></span>commandment to restore and rebuild Jerusalem <em>took effect.</em><a id="footnotesource4" data-fnid="4" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965762/3">d</a></p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="ss"><strong>LENGTH AND END OF THE SEVENTY WEEKS</strong></p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">As to the length of the prophetic weeks, <em>An American Translation</em> and Dr. James Moffatt’s translation render the expression at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Daniel 9:24-27</a> “seventy weeks of years.” These, then, were seventy “weeks” of seven years each, or 490 (70 x 7) years. It would be after 69 (7 + 62) weeks of years that the Messiah would appear. Starting with 455 B.C.E., to what date does the prophecy bring us for the coming of Messiah the Leader?</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="se"><strong>[Chart]</strong></p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">Certainly Daniel’s prophecy was true, that the year 455 B.C.E., which was the twentieth year of the Persian emperor, Artaxerxes Longimanus, was a marked year beginning a time of divine favor to Zion. It was one of the most prominent dates in history, for it was the start of the sixty-nine weeks of years leading up to the arrival of the long-promised Seed of God’s woman, the Messiah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Dan. 9:25</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">This remarkable prophecy of Daniel served for more than 400 years as a light. Not only that: it was one of the most powerful provisions for identifying the Messiah to the Jewish nation and to us today. Before the 483 years were up, the prophecy about the Messiah’s forerunner was fulfilled and the Jews heard John the Baptist announcing the Messiah’s appearance. As a matter of fact, the Jews were looking for the appearance of Messiah the Leader as they considered the prophecies, including Daniel’s time prophecy, and the work of John the Baptist. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Luke 3:15</a> says: “Now as the people were in expectation and all were reasoning in their hearts about John: ‘May he perhaps be the Christ?’” As Daniel had foretold, in the middle of this final week of years, or after <span id="page633" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="633" data-before-text="633"></span>three and one half years of Jesus’ ministry, he was cut off. He died on the torture stake on Nisan 14, the middle of the lunar year that began in the fall with the month of Tishri. Three and a half years later the seventieth week of years came to an end with the anointing of Cornelius, the first Gentile to be brought into the body of Christ, to be among the body of anointed ones.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Isa. 40:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Matt. 3:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/23/2" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> Dan. 9:24</a>.</p>

<strong>Jerusalem Rebuilt for Messiah’s Coming</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Nehemiah explained the reason for his sadness to the king. When Artaxerxes asked: “What is this that you are seeking to secure?” Nehemiah offered a silent prayer to Jehovah and took courage to ask the king to send him to rebuild Jerusalem. <span id="page601" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="601" data-before-text="601"></span>The prayer was answered; King Artaxerxes was agreeable. Nehemiah relates: “So it seemed good before the king that he should send me, when I gave him the appointed time. And I went on to say to the king: ‘If to the king it does seem good, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River [Euphrates], that they may let me pass until I come to Judah; also a letter to Asaph the keeper of the park that belongs to the king, that he may give me trees to build with timber the gates of the Castle that belongs to the house, and for the wall of the city and for the house into which I am to enter.’ So the king gave them to me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Neh. 2:3-8</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">How marvelously Jehovah showed that his hand was not shortened! Just as he had foretold at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Daniel 9:25</a>, the rebuilding work was done in straitened, difficult times. Even after the king’s decree Nehemiah and his fellow builders experienced many threats and much opposition from the non-Jewish people round about. Efforts were made to draw them away from the work. Nehemiah was placed in danger of his life, but by faith and trust in Almighty God and by arming themselves for defense against attack, and by sticking to the work that God had assigned them, they built the defensive walls around Zion or Jerusalem within two months. “At length the wall came to completion on the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in fifty-two days.” (According to Nehemiah’s reckoning, the year began with Tishri and ended with Elul as the twelfth month.)—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Neh. 6:15</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>JEHOVAH’S FULFILLED PURPOSE BRINGS HAPPINESS</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Nothing could stop Jehovah’s purpose. It was a very small matter for him to push aside the bitter foes whom Satan the Devil had aroused. They were completely blind to the glorious purpose that they were fighting against and had no understanding of the tremendous importance of this rebuilding work in connection with the coming of the Promised Seed who was to bless all families of the earth. They were unknowingly fighting against an arrangement that will result finally in blessing to many of their own number.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">But Jehovah had people who loved him and his worship and who looked for Messiah’s coming. He could inspire them with the zeal and strength to do this important rebuilding work even in the straits of the times. Nehemiah relates: “And it came about that, as soon as the wall had been rebuilt, I at once set up the doors. Then there were appointed the gatekeepers and the singers and the Levites. And I went on to put in command of Jerusalem Hanani my brother and Hananiah the prince of the Castle, for he was such a trustworthy man and feared the true God more than many others.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Neh. 7:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">This was certainly the time for the greatest joy. Accordingly the next month, the month of Tishri, in the twenty-first year of Artaxerxes, the regular religious festivals for this month were celebrated: the blowing of the trumpet and the festival on the first day, the day of the new moon, the day of atonement on the tenth day and, beginning on the fifteenth day, the feast of the booths or tabernacles. Ezra the noted copyist of God’s law was there to read publicly to them the written Word of God. After the reading, Governor Nehemiah strengthened the celebrants with the words: “Do not feel hurt, for the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.” Jehovah desired his faithful people to be happy and indeed they were, as the account reads: “The sons of Israel had not done that way from the days of Joshua the son of Nun until that day, so that there came to be very great rejoicing. And there was a reading <span id="page602" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="602" data-before-text="602"></span>aloud of the book of the law of the true God day by day, from the first day until the last day; and they went on holding the festival seven days, and on the eighth day there was a solemn assembly, according to the rule.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965723/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Neh. 8:1-18</a>.</p>

<strong>Music</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Considerable importance was attached to the singing at the temple. This is evident from the many Scriptural references to the singers as well as from the fact that they were “set free from <span id="page453" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="453" data-before-text="453"></span>duty” common to other Levites in order to devote themselves wholly to their service. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003137/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1Ch 9:33</a>) Their continuance as a special group of Levites is emphasized by their being listed separately among those returning from Babylon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003137/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ezr 2:40, 41</a>) Even the authority of the Persian king Artaxerxes (Longimanus) was brought to bear in their behalf, exempting them, along with other special groups, from ‘tax, tribute, and toll.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003137/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ezr 7:24</a>) Later, the king commanded that there was to be “a fixed provision for the singers as each day required.” Although Artaxerxes is credited with this order, most likely it was issued by Ezra on the basis of the power granted to him by Artaxerxes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003137/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ne 11:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003137/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Ezr 7:18-26</a>) Thus, it is understandable that, although the singers were all Levites, the Bible makes reference to them as a special body, speaking of “the singers and the Levites.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003137/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ne 7:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003137/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 13:10</a>.</p>

<strong>Music</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The Bible gives very little information concerning the shape or construction of the more than a dozen different musical instruments that it mentions. Hence, most authorities draw heavily on what archaeologists have discovered about the instruments used by contemporary surrounding nations. However, this may not always be a reliable guide, since it appears that Israel excelled in music in comparison with her <span id="page1192" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1192" data-before-text="1192"></span>neighbors. Additionally, some have linked various instruments of Scripture to instruments used in modern times in the Middle East, which are supposed to have an ancient background. This, too, is conjectural.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The musical instruments of the Bible may be classified as follows:</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="si">String: harp, lute, zither, and others.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sv">Wind: bagpipe, flute, horn, pipe, trumpet, (possibly) nehiloth.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sv">Percussion: cymbals, sistrums, tambourine.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">(See individual articles on the above instruments for further information.)</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">There is no reason to believe that the musical instruments of Israel were crude in design, construction or sound production. The Bible notes that the harps and stringed instruments for temple use were of the choicest imported almug wood; the trumpets, in all probability, of silver. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Ki. 10:11, 12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Num. 10:2</a>) Undoubtedly, in the manufacture of the temple instruments, the most skilled craftsmen were employed.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Both the Scriptures and non-Biblical manuscripts dating from before the Common Era testify to the quality of the instruments as well as the competence of the Israelite musicians. The Dead Sea Scrolls state that a number of trumpets were assigned various complicated signals to be executed “as with one mouth.” This would require not only skilled musicians but also instruments so constructed that the pitch might be regulated in order to bring them all into tune with one another. Freedom from dissonance is indicated by the inspired account of the music at the inauguration of Solomon’s temple: “The [one hundred and twenty] trumpeters and the singers were <em>as one in causing one sound</em> to be heard.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Chron. 5:12, 13</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The Bible lists but four instruments as definitely being in the temple orchestra: trumpets, harps, stringed instruments (Hebrew, <em>neʹvel</em>) and cymbals. While this may not seem to be a complete orchestra by modern standards, it was never intended to be a symphony orchestra, but only to provide accompaniment for the singing at the temple. Such a combination of instruments would serve this purpose excellently.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Chron. 29:25, 26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Neh. 12:27,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/17/2" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 41, 42</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">As to the times when the sacred instruments performed, the Scriptures enumerate the following in connection with the trumpets: “In the day of your rejoicing and in your festal seasons and at the commencements of your months, you must blow on the trumpets over your burnt offerings and your communion sacrifices.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Num. 10:10</a>) After the temple music organization was established, it is likely that the rest of the instruments joined the trumpets on these and other special occasions. This conclusion, as well as the musical procedure followed, seems to be indicated by the order of events described as taking place when sacred services were revived by King Hezekiah after he had cleansed the temple: “At the time that the burnt offering started, the song of Jehovah started and also the trumpets, even under the direction of the instruments of David the king of Israel. And all the congregation were bowing down while the song was resounding and the trumpets were blaring—all this until the burnt offering was finished.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Chron. 29:27, 28</a>) The trumpets being “under the direction of the instruments of David” seems to denote that the trumpeters played in such a manner as to complement the other instruments rather than to overshadow them. The position of the entire body of musicians was “to the east of the altar.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Chron. 5:12</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="ss"><strong>VOCAL MUSIC</strong></p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">The singers at the temple were Levite males. Nowhere do the Scriptures speak of female vocalists at the temple. One of the Targums, too, clearly indicates that they were not present in the chorus. The fact that women were prohibited from even entering certain areas of the temple would seem to preclude their occupying any official position there.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">2 Chron. 5:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Neh. 10:39;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/21/2" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> 12:27-29</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Considerable importance was attached to the singing at the temple. This is evident from the many Scriptural references to the singers as well as from the fact that they were “set free from duty” common to other Levites in order to devote themselves wholly to their service. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Chron. 9:33</a>) Their continuance as a special group of Levites is emphasized by their being listed separately among those returning from Babylon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ezra 2:40, 41</a>) Even the authority of the Persian King Artaxerxes (Longimanus) was brought to bear in their behalf, exempting them, along with other special groups, from ‘tax, tribute and toll.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ezra 7:24</a>) Later, the king commanded that there was to be “a fixed provision for the singers as each day required.” Although Artaxerxes is credited with this order, most likely it was issued by Ezra on the basis of the power granted to him by Artaxerxes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Neh. 11:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Ezra 7:18-26</a>) Thus, it is understandable that, although the singers were all Levites, the Bible makes reference to them as a special body, speaking of “the singers and the Levites.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Neh. 7:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 13:10</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Apart from temple worship, other singers, men and women, are spoken of in Scripture. Examples of these are the male and female singers maintained by Solomon in his court; also, about two hundred singers of both sexes who, in addition to the Levitical musicians, returned from Babylon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Eccl. 2:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> Ezra 2:65;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/27/2" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> Neh. 7:67</a>) These non-Levitical singers, common in Israel, were employed not only to enhance various festive occasions but also to chant dirges in times of sorrow. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">2 Sam. 19:35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 35:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/28/2" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> Jer. 9:17,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/28/3" data-bid="29-4" class="b"> 20</a>) The custom of hiring professional musicians at times of joy and sadness appears to have continued into the time Jesus was on earth.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matt. 11:16, 17</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Although not as prominent as in the Hebrew Scriptures, music is not ignored or overlooked in the Christian Greek Scriptures. Instrumental music in connection with true worship is mentioned only in a figurative sense in the Greek Scriptures (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Rev. 14:2</a>); yet singing seems to have been quite common among God’s servants. Jesus and his apostles sang praises after the Lord’s Evening Meal. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Mark 14:26</a>) Luke tells of Paul and Silas singing when in prison, and Paul’s encouragement to fellow believers was to sing songs of praise to Jehovah.

In recording his inspired vision, John tells of various heavenly creatures singing to God and Christ.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Rev. 5:8-10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 14:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/34/2" data-bid="35-3" class="b"> 15:2-4</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong>NATURE OF BIBLICAL MUSIC</strong></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">The Israelites’ higher plane of morality and their superior literature, as exemplified by the poetry and prose of the Hebrew Scriptures, suggest that the music of ancient Israel most likely transcended that of her contemporaries. Certainly the inspiration for the music of Israel was far loftier than that of neighboring nations. Of interest is an Assyrian bas-relief wherein King Sennacherib is represented as demanding that King Hezekiah pay him as tribute both male and female musicians.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">It has long been held by some that Hebrew music was all melody, without harmony. However, the prominence alone of the harp and other stringed instruments in Israel weighs heavily against this assumption. It is almost inconceivable that a musician would play a multistringed instrument and fail to notice that a combination of certain tones was quite pleasing or that a specific series of notes as in an arpeggio produced a pleasant sound. An authority on the history of music, Kurt Sachs, states: “The deep-rooted prejudice that harmony and polyphony [two or more musical parts or voices combined] have been a <span id="page1193" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1193" data-before-text="1193"></span>prerogative of the medieval and modern West does not hold water.” He goes on to say that even among primitive cultures there are many examples of music running in fifths, fourths, thirds as well as in octaves, and that among these peoples, including certain pygmy tribes, there was a development of overlapping antiphony (alternate singing by two divisions of vocalists) into regular canon singing.</p>

However, there is no need to assume a contradiction in these texts. The record at Genesis (paralleled by that in Chronicles) is genealogical.

Apparently this official directed any serious complaints concerning the districts under his jurisdiction to the king and then waited for royal authorization to act. Also, lesser officials could request that the activities of a particular jurisdictional district be investigated.

This fact is acknowledged by the wise writer of Ecclesiastes: “If you see any oppression of the one of little means and the violent taking away of judgment and of righteousness in a jurisdictional district, do not be amazed over the affair, for one that is higher than the high one is watching, and there are those who are high above them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012499/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Eccl. 5:8</a>) There was little reason to be amazed about the oppression of the lowly one when lesser administrators were watched by higher officials, most of whom sought their own advantage at the expense of their subjects.—See PROVINCE.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"></p>

Atad may have been a person, but the name itself appears to designate a thorny locale. The funeral party included Pharaoh’s servants and the older men of Egypt, and when the Canaanites saw the mourning rites, they exclaimed: “This is a heavy mourning for the Egyptians!” Hence, the place was called Abel-mizraim, meaning “mourning of the Egyptians.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010450/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 50:7-13</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Various translations (for example, <em>AS, AT, RS</em>) use “beyond the Jordan” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010450/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 50:10, 11</a>, and some conclude that the threshing floor of Atad was situated E of the Jordan River. This would mean that the procession took, not a direct, but a circuitous route, around the Dead Sea, which it could have done in order to avoid contact with the Philistines. However, the Hebrew word <em>ʽeʹver,</em> translated “beyond,” can refer to a region either E or W of the Jordan. From Moses’ viewpoint in the land of Moab at the time of the completion (and possible final editing) of the Pentateuch, “beyond the Jordan” could mean W of the river. Yet, all difficulties are overcome by <em>NW,</em> which accurately renders the Hebrew text “in the region of the Jordan” in these verses.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"></p>

Since all independent human life from Cain and Abel onward begins at birth, Micah’s prophecy makes us look for a certain birth in the rebuilt Bethlehem. This is to be a foretold birth.

Recall the Canaanites from Gibeon who became “gatherers of wood and drawers of water for the assembly and for Jehovah’s altar.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Joshua 9:27</a>) Probably some of their descendants were among the Nethinim returning from Babylon, as well as others who had been added as Nethinim during David’s reign and at other times.

After the Return from Exile, these [foreigners] were no longer regarded as <em>slaves</em> of the Temple, but as <em>ministrants</em> in it, enjoying a status similar to that of those other bodies, which officiated in the Temple.”​—See the box “A Changed Status.”</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">17. Why did the Nethinim receive more to do, and what Biblical evidence is there for this?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Of course, the Nethinim did not become the equals of the priests and the Levites. The latter groups were Israelites, who were chosen by Jehovah himself and not to be supplanted by non-Israelites. Yet, the Biblical indications are that in the face of a reduced number of Levites, the Nethinim were given more to do in God’s service. They were assigned living quarters close to the temple. In Nehemiah’s day they worked with priests in repairing walls near the temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Nehemiah 3:22-26</a>) And the king of Persia decreed that the Nethinim be exempt from taxes, just as the Levites were exempt because of their temple service. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ezra 7:24</a>) This indicates how closely these “given ones” (Levites and Nethinim) were then linked in spiritual matters and how the Nethinim’s assignments increased in accord with the need, though <span id="page16" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>they never were counted as being Levites. When Ezra later collected exiles to return, no Levites were initially among them. So he intensified efforts to collect some. That resulted in 38 Levites and 220 Nethinim returning to serve as “ministers for the house of our God.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ezra 8:15-20</a>.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">18.

The Bible gives few details about them. Some were “the sons of Sophereth.” Ezra adds a definite article to that name, making it <em>Has·so·pheʹreth,</em> possibly meaning “the scribe.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ezra 2:55;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Nehemiah 7:57</a>) They thus may have been a staff of scribes or copyists, possibly temple/​administrative scribes.

What, though, of the fact that the Bible singles out the Nethinim and the sons of the servants of Solomon? In the pattern the Nethinim and the sons of the servants of Solomon were given privileges beyond those of other non-Israelite returnees. This could well foreshadow that God today has extended privileges and added duties to some mature and willing other sheep.</p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">21.

After the Return from Exile, these [foreigners] were no longer regarded as <em>slaves</em> of the Temple, but as <em>ministrants</em> in it, enjoying a status similar to that of those other bodies, which officiated in the Temple.”​—See the box “A Changed Status.”</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">17.

The latter groups were Israelites, who were chosen by Jehovah himself and not to be supplanted by non-Israelites. Yet, the Biblical indications are that in the face of a reduced number of Levites, the Nethinim were given more to do in God’s service. They were assigned living quarters close to the temple. In Nehemiah’s day they worked with priests in repairing walls near the temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Nehemiah 3:22-26</a>) And the king of Persia decreed that the Nethinim be exempt from taxes, just as the Levites were exempt because of their temple service. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ezra 7:24</a>) This indicates how closely these “given ones” (Levites and Nethinim) were then linked in spiritual matters and how the Nethinim’s assignments increased in accord with the need, though <span id="page16" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>they never were counted as being Levites. When Ezra later collected exiles to return, no Levites were initially among them. So he intensified efforts to collect some. That resulted in 38 Levites and 220 Nethinim returning to serve as “ministers for the house of our God.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ezra 8:15-20</a>.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">18.

The Bible gives few details about them. Some were “the sons of Sophereth.” Ezra adds a definite article to that name, making it <em>Has·so·pheʹreth,</em> possibly meaning “the scribe.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ezra 2:55;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Nehemiah 7:57</a>) They thus may have been a staff of scribes or copyists, possibly temple/​administrative scribes.

What, though, of the fact that the Bible singles out the Nethinim and the sons of the servants of Solomon? In the pattern the Nethinim and the sons of the servants of Solomon were given privileges beyond those of other non-Israelite returnees.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">John 3:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/16/2" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> Romans 8:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/16/3" data-bid="17-4" class="b"> Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>) Of course, that anointing is a unique manifestation of God’s spirit in behalf of the little flock. But God’s spirit is also needed to carry out his will. Hence, Jesus said: ‘The Father in heaven gives holy spirit to those asking him.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Luke 11:13</a>) Whether the one asking has the heavenly hope or is of the other sheep, Jehovah’s spirit is abundantly available to carry out His will.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">13.

Every one of us​—whichever our hope—​ought to cultivate the fruits of the spirit, which all of us need in full measure.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Galatians 5:22-26</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>Given for Special Service</strong></p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">14, 15.

Recall the Canaanites from Gibeon who became “gatherers of wood and drawers of water for the assembly and for Jehovah’s altar.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Joshua 9:27</a>) Probably some of their descendants were among the Nethinim returning from Babylon, as well as others who had been added as Nethinim during David’s reign and at other times. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ezra 8:20</a>) What did the Nethinim do? The Levites were given to help the priests, and thereafter the Nethinim were given to help the Levites.

After the Return from Exile, these [foreigners] were no longer regarded as <em>slaves</em> of the Temple, but as <em>ministrants</em> in it, enjoying a status similar to that of those other bodies, which officiated in the Temple.”​—See the box “A Changed Status.”</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">17. Why did the Nethinim receive more to do, and what Biblical evidence is there for this?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Of course, the Nethinim did not become the equals of the priests and the Levites. The latter groups were Israelites, who were chosen by Jehovah himself and not to be supplanted by non-Israelites. Yet, the Biblical indications are that in the face of a reduced number of Levites, the Nethinim were given more to do in God’s service. They were assigned living quarters close to the temple. In Nehemiah’s day they worked with priests in repairing walls near the temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Nehemiah 3:22-26</a>) And the king of Persia decreed that the Nethinim be exempt from taxes, just as the Levites were exempt because of their temple service. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ezra 7:24</a>) This indicates how closely these “given ones” (Levites and Nethinim) were then linked in spiritual matters and how the Nethinim’s assignments increased in accord with the need, though <span id="page16" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>they never were counted as being Levites. When Ezra later collected exiles to return, no Levites were initially among them. So he intensified efforts to collect some. That resulted in 38 Levites and 220 Nethinim returning to serve as “ministers for the house of our God.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ezra 8:15-20</a>.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">18.

The Bible gives few details about them. Some were “the sons of Sophereth.” Ezra adds a definite article to that name, making it <em>Has·so·pheʹreth,</em> possibly meaning “the scribe.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ezra 2:55;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Nehemiah 7:57</a>) They thus may have been a staff of scribes or copyists, possibly temple/​administrative scribes. Though of foreign extraction, the sons of the servants of Solomon proved their devotion to Jehovah by leaving Babylon and returning to share in restoring His worship.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="ss"><strong>Giving of Ourselves Today</strong></p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">19.

What, though, of the fact that the Bible singles out the Nethinim and the sons of the servants of Solomon? In the pattern the Nethinim and the sons of the servants of Solomon were given privileges beyond those of other non-Israelite returnees. This could well foreshadow that God today has extended privileges and added duties to some mature and willing other sheep.</p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">21.

The sons of the servants of Solomon evidently received administrative responsibilities. Similarly today, Jehovah has blessed his people with “gifts in men” to care for their needs.

The fact that some of them, comparable to the Nethinim and the sons of the servants of Solomon, are now being assigned weighty responsibilities under the oversight of the anointed remnant does not cause them to be presumptuous or feel self-important. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Romans 12:3</a>) This gives us confidence that as God’s people “come out of the great tribulation,” there will be experienced men​—“princes”—​prepared to take the lead among the other sheep.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Revelation 7:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/36/1" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> Isaiah 32:1</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992283/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Acts 6:2-7</a>.</p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">23.

<strong>Urim and Thummim</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>Use Ceased in 607 B.C.E.</strong> According to Jewish tradition, use of the Urim and the Thummim ceased when Jerusalem was desolated and her temple destroyed in 607 B.C.E. by the Babylonian armies under King Nebuchadnezzar. (Babylonian Talmud, <em>Sotah</em> 48<em>b</em>) This view is supported by what we read regarding these objects in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah. There, certain men who were claimants to priestly descent, but who could not find their names in the public register, were told that they could not eat from the most holy things provided for the priesthood until a priest stood up with Urim and Thummim. But there is no record of their use at that time, and thereafter the Bible makes no further reference to these sacred objects.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004524/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ezr 2:61-63;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004524/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Ne 7:63-65</a>.</p>

<strong>Do We Need a Priesthood?</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">In Israel the high priest was the primary figure in the priesthood. He was the one who made atonement for the entire nation once a year, on atonement day. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974167/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Lev. chap. 16</a>) He was the one who petitioned God in behalf of the nation, and questions of national importance were presented to God by the high priest. The answer was given by God by means of the sacred lots, the Urim and the Thummim (meaning “lights,” that is, <em>“the</em> light” and “perfections,” that is, <em>“the</em> perfection”). He was also the chief instructor in the law of God.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974167/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ex. 28:30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974167/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Num. 27:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974167/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Neh. 7:65</a>.</p>

These may not have been listed in the family groupings but could have been included in the total. So the 42,360 persons could be the combined total of the number from each family plus many others who were unable to establish their ancestry.

The accounts harmonize in giving 42,360 as the total number of returned exiles, apart from slaves and singers. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013141/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ezra 2:64;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013141/33/1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> Neh. 7:66</a>) However, there are differences between the numbers given for each family or house, and in both listings the individual figures yield a total of far less than 42,360. Many scholars would attribute these variations to scribal errors. While this aspect cannot be completely ignored, there are other possible explanations for the differences.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">It may be that Ezra and Nehemiah based their listings on different sources. For example, Ezra could have used a document listing those who enrolled to return to their homeland, whereas Nehemiah might have copied from a record listing those who actually did return. Since there were priests who were unable to establish their genealogy (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013141/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ezra 2:61-63;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013141/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> Neh. 7:63-65</a>), it is not unreasonable to conclude that many of the other Israelites faced the same problem. Consequently, the 42,360 persons could be the combined total of the number from each family plus many others who were unable to establish their ancestry. Later, however, some may have been able to establish their correct genealogy. This could explain how a fluctuation in numbers might still give the same total.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>OUTLINE OF CONTENTS</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><strong>I.</strong> Nehemiah’s reaction to report concerning conditions at Jerusalem (1:1-11)</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="s6"><strong>A.</strong> Visit to Shushan of Nehemiah’s brother Hanani and other Jews; their answer to Nehemiah’s inquiry about the Jews in the jurisdictional district of Judah (1:1-3)</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="s6"><strong>B.</strong> Nehemiah is moved to mourn, fast and pray (1:4-11)</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><strong>II.</strong> Nehemiah’s request to go to Jerusalem; his subsequent restoration of Jerusalem’s wall attended by opposition (2:1–4:23)</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="s6"><strong>A.</strong> Nehemiah granted royal authorization to go to Judah; his departure with chiefs of the military force and horsemen (2:1-10)</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="s6"><strong>B.</strong> Restoration of wall of Jerusalem in the face of opposition (2:11–4:23)</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="s7"><strong>1.</strong> Nehemiah inspects wall at night (2:11-20)</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="s7"><strong>2.</strong> Those sharing in making repairs on various sections of the wall (3:1-32)</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="s7"><strong>3.</strong> Opposition intensifies; Nehemiah arms workmen to counter enemy threat (4:1-23)</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"><strong>III.</strong> Nehemiah urges wealthy Jews to make restoration for wrongly having charged fellow Israelites interest on loans; his unselfishness as governor (5:1-19)</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb"><strong>IV.</strong> Enemies unsuccessful in plots against Nehemiah, but, even after wall is rebuilt in fifty-two days, Tobiah continues to threaten him (6:1-19)</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"><strong>V.</strong> Events immediately following completion of wall (7:1–12:47)</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="s6"><strong>A.</strong> Nehemiah makes appointments of gatekeepers, places Hanani and Hananiah in command of Jerusalem and gives instructions on opening and closing gates of sparsely populated city (7:1-4)</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="s6"><strong>B.</strong> Finds book of genealogical enrollment (7:5-73)</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="s6"><strong>C.</strong> People assembled at public square near Water Gate hear reading of Law and explanations (8:1-15)</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="s6"><strong>D.</strong> Festival of booths follows (8:16-18)</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="s6"><strong>E.</strong> On Tishri (Ethanim) 24, about two days after festival of booths, another assembly is held (9:1–10:39)</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="s7"><strong>1.</strong> During assembly Israelites make confession of sins and hear review of God’s dealings from the time he chose Abram (9:1-37)</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="s7"><strong>2.</strong> A trustworthy arrangement is contracted and attested by seal; people obligate themselves to refrain from marriage alliances with foreigners, to keep the sabbaths and to support temple services (9:38–10:39)</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="s6"><strong>F.</strong> One out of every ten is designated by lot to dwell in Jerusalem; listing of those dwelling in Jerusalem and other places; genealogical information about priests and Levites (11:1–12:26)</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="s6"><strong>G.</strong> Events associated with the inauguration of Jerusalem’s wall (12:27-47)</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb"><strong>VI.</strong> Activities following Nehemiah’s return to Jerusalem after his being away for some time (13:1-31)</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="s6"><strong>A.</strong> Law read to people; they respond by separating themselves from mixed company (13:1-3)</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="s6"><strong>B.</strong> Nehemiah has dining halls in temple courtyards cleansed, sees to it that material support is given to the Levites and the temple; enforces sabbath observance, chastises those involved in mixed marriages; purifies and gives assignments to priests and Levites (13:4-31)</p>

And the people began to gather themselves as one man to Jerusalem. And Jeshua the son of Jehozadak and his brothers the priests and [Governor] Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his brothers proceeded to rise up and build the altar of the God of Israel, to offer up burnt sacrifices upon it, according to what is written in the law of Moses the man of the true God.” The Israelites that returned from Babylon then numbered 42,360, along with whom there came 7,337 slaves and some 200 to 245 professional singers.

The very next month, on Sunday night, April 13, many thousands of these dedicated Bible Students gratefully gathered together in their congregations around the world to celebrate the Lord’s Supper, that being the anniversary of Jesus’ instituting of this memorial of his death. Early reports from congregations that had an attendance of thirty or more in just eight European cities and 164 other cities in North and South America showed a total attendance of 17,961. Later additional reports were not published.

Great Babylon has fallen! That is why the anointed remnant of Zion’s seed began turning away from her since the year 1919 and the full number of them have now been gathered. They do not want to touch the unclean thing or be in the midst of it anymore. They want to keep religiously clean, in order to practice pure, undefiled, acceptable worship in the sight of Jehovah their God. They have carried with them, not the Babylonish religious practices and traditions and doctrines of demons, but the pure utensils of Jehovah’s worship, pictured by the sacred utensils that the Babylonians stole from Jehovah’s temple in 607 B.C. when Jerusalem was destroyed. They have left Great Babylon, not wildly and in confusion like the radical elements of this world, but in theocratic orderliness, under divine guidance. Jehovah their God has gone before them! Although the enemy has dogged their rear, Jehovah God has been a rear guard to them. That is why today they are <em>out</em> of Great Babylon!

Just as, away back in 537 B.C., there were upward of 7,537 slaves and professional singers that got out of the midst of Babylon with the Israelite remnant, so there is something similar today. A “great multitude” of persons located in “all the ends of the earth” have observed Jehovah’s salvation of the faithful remnant of spiritual Israelites, and in adoration they have turned to the worship of this glorious God of liberation. They have followed the remnant of spiritual Israelites out of Great Babylon and purified themselves from all her defilements and courageously dedicated themselves to the pure, holy worship of Jehovah God.

<strong>Hebrew Weights and Money</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Every Bible reader is acquainted with David, and most of us have some idea of the picture David and Goliath must have presented as they faced each other on the battlefield. Goliath was insulted as he saw the lad David coming out with a simple sling in his hand. There in front of young David stood a giant, “his height being six cubits and a span,” or nine feet nine inches. “And there was a helmet of copper on his head, and he was clad with a coat of mail, of overlapping scales, and the weight of the coat of mail was five thousand shekels of copper. And there were greaves of copper above his feet and a javelin of copper between his shoulders. And the wooden shaft of his spear was like the beam of loom workers, and the blade of his spear was six hundred shekels of iron.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Sam. 17:4-7</a>, <em>NW</em>) His coat <span id="page652" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="652" data-before-text="652"></span>of mail alone weighed over 157 pounds and just the head of his spear came to almost 19 pounds. But this metal-clad monstrosity did not cause David to turn back in dismay. Fully confident that Jehovah was with him David went through with his assignment and came off victorious.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">It is often observed in these Bible accounts, especially in the Law of Moses, that weights, or payment of money, were to be figured according to the shekel of the sanctuary. What was that shekel of the sanctuary, as it is so often called? McClintock and Strong’s <em>Cyclopædia</em> views the matter this way: “The Weight of the Sanctuary, or Weight of the Temple (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Exodus 30:13,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 24</a>), was probably the standard weight, preserved in some apartment of the Temple, and not a different weight from the common shekel; for though Moses appoints that all things valued by their price in silver should be rated by the weight of the sanctuary, he makes no difference between this shekel of twenty oboli, or twenty gerahs, and the common shekel.” (Volume 10, pages 900, 901) In other words, the expression may indicate nothing other than that the weight should be accurate, following the standard weights kept by the priests in the temple.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Since the practice was to weigh silver to determine its value, counting money was rare, and then it was probably done only to get an estimate of value. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Ki. 12:10</a>) When coins came into use, of course, it was different. But in Israel this was not until after their exile in Babylon.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>COINS</strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">The Lydians in Asia Minor were probably the first to issue coins, doing so toward the end of the eighth century B.C. History shows that staters, made of an alloy of gold and silver called electron, were struck at Lydia about that time. It was along in the sixth century B.C. that the practice reached Persia, where a thick gold coin, the daric, featuring the king kneeling and holding a javelin, was issued. The Jews became acquainted with these coins through Persia, no doubt taking some back to Jerusalem with them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ezra 1:4</a>) The post-captivity books of Ezra, Chronicles and Nehemiah make reference to them.

When Jews traveled to the temple from foreign lands they brought their own money with them. The Greeks had brought in their talent (smaller than the Hebrew talent) and mina, and the drachma and stater or tetradrachma coins; now the Romans used the denarius, quadrans and assarion. But this money was not accepted for contributions in the temple. Whether the poll tax or a freewill offering, it had to be presented in the native coin.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Thus arose the need for money-changers. They set up stalls for business in the city and at the time of the passover they actually moved into the temple area, setting up their tables in the Court of Gentiles. They made about three cents profit on just a single half shekel change. Their dishonesty and selfishness were entirely out of harmony with the true worship that should have been practiced there. Twice during his earthly ministry Jesus overturned their tables, spilling their money and denouncing their commercializing of the worship there.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">John 2:14-16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Matt. 21:12, 13</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">On one occasion as Jesus, using an illustration, spoke to his disciples he said: “The kingdom of the heavens is like a man, a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.

<strong>Hebrew Weights and Money</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Every Bible reader is acquainted with David, and most of us have some idea of the picture David and Goliath must have presented as they faced each other on the battlefield. Goliath was insulted as he saw the lad David coming out with a simple sling in his hand. There in front of young David stood a giant, “his height being six cubits and a span,” or nine feet nine inches. “And there was a helmet of copper on his head, and he was clad with a coat of mail, of overlapping scales, and the weight of the coat of mail was five thousand shekels of copper. And there were greaves of copper above his feet and a javelin of copper between his shoulders. And the wooden shaft of his spear was like the beam of loom workers, and the blade of his spear was six hundred shekels of iron.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Sam. 17:4-7</a>, <em>NW</em>) His coat <span id="page652" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="652" data-before-text="652"></span>of mail alone weighed over 157 pounds and just the head of his spear came to almost 19 pounds. But this metal-clad monstrosity did not cause David to turn back in dismay. Fully confident that Jehovah was with him David went through with his assignment and came off victorious.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">It is often observed in these Bible accounts, especially in the Law of Moses, that weights, or payment of money, were to be figured according to the shekel of the sanctuary. What was that shekel of the sanctuary, as it is so often called? McClintock and Strong’s <em>Cyclopædia</em> views the matter this way: “The Weight of the Sanctuary, or Weight of the Temple (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Exodus 30:13,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 24</a>), was probably the standard weight, preserved in some apartment of the Temple, and not a different weight from the common shekel; for though Moses appoints that all things valued by their price in silver should be rated by the weight of the sanctuary, he makes no difference between this shekel of twenty oboli, or twenty gerahs, and the common shekel.” (Volume 10, pages 900, 901) In other words, the expression may indicate nothing other than that the weight should be accurate, following the standard weights kept by the priests in the temple.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Since the practice was to weigh silver to determine its value, counting money was rare, and then it was probably done only to get an estimate of value. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Ki. 12:10</a>) When coins came into use, of course, it was different. But in Israel this was not until after their exile in Babylon.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>COINS</strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">The Lydians in Asia Minor were probably the first to issue coins, doing so toward the end of the eighth century B.C. History shows that staters, made of an alloy of gold and silver called electron, were struck at Lydia about that time. It was along in the sixth century B.C. that the practice reached Persia, where a thick gold coin, the daric, featuring the king kneeling and holding a javelin, was issued. The Jews became acquainted with these coins through Persia, no doubt taking some back to Jerusalem with them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ezra 1:4</a>) The post-captivity books of Ezra, Chronicles and Nehemiah make reference to them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ezra 2:69;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 29:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/20/2" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> Neh. 7:70-72</a>) Later Grecian and Roman currency circulated in Palestine, and at times even the Jews coined money.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">By Jesus’ day a strange complexity of coins was in use around Jerusalem. When Jews traveled to the temple from foreign lands they brought their own money with them. The Greeks had brought in their talent (smaller than the Hebrew talent) and mina, and the drachma and stater or tetradrachma coins; now the Romans used the denarius, quadrans and assarion. But this money was not accepted for contributions in the temple. Whether the poll tax or a freewill offering, it had to be presented in the native coin.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Thus arose the need for money-changers. They set up stalls for business in the city and at the time of the passover they actually moved into the temple area, setting up their tables in the Court of Gentiles. They made about three cents profit on just a single half shekel change. Their dishonesty and selfishness were entirely out of harmony with the true worship that should have been practiced there. Twice during his earthly ministry Jesus overturned their tables, spilling their money and denouncing their commercializing of the worship there.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">John 2:14-16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Matt. 21:12, 13</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">On one occasion as Jesus, using an illustration, spoke to his disciples he said: “The kingdom of the heavens is like a man, a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard. When he had agreed with the workers for <span id="page653" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="653" data-before-text="653"></span>a denarius a day, he sent them forth into his vineyard.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matt. 20:1, 2</a>, <em>NW</em>) This statement of one denarius, or about 17 cents, as an acceptable day’s wage at that time sheds much light on <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Revelation 6:6</a>, which says: “And I heard a voice as if in the midst of the four living creatures say: ‘A quart of wheat for a day’s wage [denarius, rendered penny in the <em>King James Version</em> and shilling in the <em>American Standard Version</em>], and three quarts of barley for a day’s wage; and do not harm the olive oil and the wine.’” (<em>NW</em>) That denarius represented a day’s wage—a great deal of money for a single quart of wheat. The text speaks of real famine, just as Jesus foretold at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matthew 24:7</a>.</p>
