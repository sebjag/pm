<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>●</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974766/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 5:4</strong></a> <strong>says about Jehovah, “No one bad may reside for any time with you.” Why, then, did Jehovah allow Satan to remain in heaven for millenniums and even to come into His presence on occasion?​—U.S.A.</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The context reveals that Satan did not “reside” with Jehovah God in the sense referred to by the psalmist David. In the fifth psalm, David expressed confidence in Jehovah’s readiness to listen to his prayer. Then, presenting his reason for this, David points to God’s righteousness, saying: “For you are not a God taking delight in wickedness; no one bad may reside for any time with you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974766/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 5:3, 4</a>) Such ‘residing’ with God means being an approved guest in his house or holy temple. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974766/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 15:1-5</a>.) This is clear from David’s later words. Contrasting his own situation with the practicers of bad, who are not allowed to “reside” with Jehovah, he says: “As <span id="page640" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="640" data-before-text="640"></span>for me, in the abundance of your loving-kindness I shall come into your house, I shall bow down toward your holy temple in fear of you.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974766/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 5:7</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Satan the Devil was permitted to continue in heaven for millenniums and on certain occasions (evidently for some specific reason) allowed to be present in an assembly of God’s sons. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974766/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 1:6, 7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974766/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 2:1</a>) But it was only because of a moral issue needing settlement that Jehovah God tolerated Satan’s presence in the heavens. As evident from the book of Job, Satan maintained that all intelligent creatures were basically selfish and would prove to be unfaithful and disloyal to God if obedience to Him no longer appeared to be a course of material or personal gain. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974766/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 2:4, 5</a>) So that this universally important issue might be settled, Jehovah God permitted Satan to attempt to prove his claim. This allowed Satan to use his influence in trying to persuade other angelic sons to assert their independence, thereby putting them to a test as to their loyalty to God.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Many angels did become disloyal. But all such unfaithful ones, though still having access to the heavens, lost their positions of trust and responsibility. They were debased, put under restraint and deprived of additional divine enlightenment. This situation is spoken of figuratively at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974766/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jude 6</a>: “The angels that did not keep their original position but forsook their own proper dwelling place he has reserved with eternal bonds under dense darkness for the judgment of the great day.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Thus these unfaithful angels were expelled from God’s family of loyal spirit creatures. Neither they nor their ruler, Satan, continued residing with Jehovah God in the manner that they had enjoyed as his obedient sons. Though having access to the heavenly realm, they were now outcasts.</p>

<strong>Proving Ourselves God’s Friends</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> That the Almighty God takes into his <span id="page111" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="111" data-before-text="111"></span>tent as guests only certain ones is not surprising. Whoever has a home of his own does not receive into it as a guest just anybody; he does not entertain all persons. Many home owners would not have bad persons staying with them even for a short time. The same principle applies with Jehovah God. He does not receive everybody into his tent: “No one bad may reside for any time with you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 5:4</a>) This was true in David’s day, in regard to the tent of God. David had brought the ark of Jehovah from the house of Obed-edom to Jerusalem: “So they brought the ark of Jehovah in and set it in its place inside the tent that David had pitched for it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Sam. 6:17</a>) To enter this tent was to enter into the presence of the Most High. David selected certain ones to serve at this tent, Asaph being among those so privileged. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Chron. 16:4-6</a>) Only those who walked faultlessly and who were pure and upright could be in constant attendance in Jehovah’s tent on his holy mountain.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 4. What is said about the requirement for staying in God’s presence, and so what should be the Christian’s attitude?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Jehovah is very careful about those who stay in his holy presence. If the requirements in David’s day for being a guest in Jehovah’s tent there on his holy mountain were strict, then how much more so must be the requirements for abiding in Jehovah’s tent as a permanent guest, as a member of his holy family! That we may be accounted worthy of this incomparable privilege and be able to say with David, “I will be a guest in your tent for times indefinite,” we must prove ourselves God’s friends. Since “His intimacy is with the upright ones,” it is absolutely imperative that those who would enjoy his protection and hospitality forever learn what God requires for being upright in his eyes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 61:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Prov. 3:32</a>) Hence every Christian should ask himself these questions: “O Jehovah, who will be a guest in your tent? Who will reside in your holy mountain?” And every Christian should be thoroughly familiar with what the psalmist answered: “He who is walking faultlessly and practicing righteousness and speaking the truth in his heart.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 15:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>WALKING FAULTLESSLY</strong></p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 5. How did Adam fail to walk faultlessly, and so what did he lose?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> To walk faultlessly, in God’s eyes, the Christian must trust Jehovah God implicitly and prove that trust by being obedient to his commands. Adam, the first man, was God’s guest in the Paradise of Eden. Adam could have enjoyed that Paradise as an everlasting dwelling place, one blessed with God’s presence. But Adam failed to prove himself God’s friend. Because of Adam’s failure to obey his heavenly Father and Host, he lost his Paradise dwelling place and disqualified himself for being a guest in “the garden of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ezek. 28:13</a>) Adam failed to walk faultlessly, and so could not be God’s friend.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 6. Who was called “Jehovah’s friend,” and why?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> But the Bible abounds with examples of those who succeeded in proving themselves God’s friends. A list of those who proved themselves friends of God is found in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">the book of Hebrews, chapter eleven</a>. Mentioned in that chapter is Abraham, of whom James wrote: “The scripture was fulfilled which says: ‘Abraham put faith in Jehovah, and it was counted to him as righteousness,’ and he came to be called ‘Jehovah’s friend.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jas. 2:23</a>) What a privilege to be called “Jehovah’s friend”! Are we, like Abraham, willing to meet the requirements for being Jehovah’s friend? We cannot be God’s friends by merely wishing it to be so; we must prove ourselves friends of God. Abraham demonstrated his faith and trust in God by obeying Jehovah’s command to leave Ur of the Chaldees and later in attempting to offer up his only son by Sarah, his beloved Isaac. <span id="page112" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="112" data-before-text="112"></span>Thus the writer of Hebrews states: “By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed in going out into a place he was destined to receive as an inheritance; and he went out, although not knowing where he was going. By faith Abraham, when he was tested, as good as offered up Isaac, and the man that had gladly received the promises attempted to offer up his only-begotten son, although it had been said to him: ‘What will be called “your seed” will be through Isaac.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Heb. 11:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 17, 18</a>) Abraham walked faultlessly, proving his faith and trust in God by his obedience; “and he came to be called ‘Jehovah’s friend.’”</p>

<strong>Great Crowd</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">This poses the question: If the “great crowd” are persons who gain salvation and remain on earth, how could they be said to be ‘standing before God’s throne and before the Lamb’? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001762/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Re 7:9</a>) The position of ‘standing’ is sometimes used in the Bible to indicate the holding of a favored or approved position in the eyes of the one in whose presence the individual or group stands. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001762/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps 1:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001762/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 5:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001762/23/2" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> Pr 22:29</a>, <em>AT;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001762/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Lu 1:19</a>) In fact, in the previous chapter of Revelation, “the kings of the earth and the top-ranking ones and the military commanders and the rich and the strong ones and every slave and every free person” are depicted as seeking to hide themselves “from the face of the One seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb, because the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001762/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Re 6:15-17</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001762/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Lu 21:36</a>.) It thus appears that the “great crowd” is formed of those persons who have been preserved during that time of wrath and who have been able to “stand” as approved by God and the Lamb.</p>

<strong>When Hate Is Folly</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The very fact that God hates certain things and certain kinds of people shows that hate is not always folly.

<strong>Should You Fear the Dead?</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The One who identifies himself in the Bible as the true God could never approve of the practices that have come about because of people’s fear of the dead. Why not? Because those practices, in addition to being based on a false idea, are completely out of harmony with His personality, ways and dealings. “God is not a man that he should tell lies.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974068/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Numbers 23:19</a>) He does not approve of deception resorted to for selfish gain.

<strong>Part Two</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Jesus thus used Gehenna as a symbol of complete, endless destruction, just as fire is destructive. Because the destruction <span id="page110" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="110" data-before-text="110"></span>is everlasting, the fire of the symbolic Gehenna is said to be “everlasting fire.” This means that such a Gehenna will always exist; it will never give up those in it; it will never be emptied, never be wiped out as Adamic death and Haʹdes will be. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965122/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rev. 20:13</a>) Figuratively speaking, the symbolic Gehenna always burns and will always be available for executing any who rebel against God throughout everlasting time, all eternity.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">11. Why is there no resurrection from the symbolic Gehenna?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Since the symbolic Gehenna is the place of everlasting destruction, Jesus correctly set a person’s entering into Gehenna as the opposite of one’s entering into life. Hence if anyone enters into the symbolic Gehenna, in which God destroys both body and soul, how can anyone have a resurrection to an opportunity for everlasting life in God’s heavenly kingdom or in Paradise restored here on earth under God’s kingdom? There is no resurrection from the symbolic Gehenna.</p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">12, 13. (a) The uncontrolled tongue can inflame how many and spot up what? (b) Like Gehenna, what can it cause?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Because fiery Gehenna is destructive, the disciple James ties it in with the uncontrolled human tongue, in these words: “Well, [like the little fire setting aflame a great woodland] the tongue is a fire. The tongue is constituted a world of unrighteousness among our members, for it spots up all the body and sets the wheel of natural life aflame and it is set aflame by Gehenna.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965122/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Jas. 3:6</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> Hence, all the world of mankind, not one particular person, has to watch the tongue, for all the world is born in unrighteousness. The tongue, by its propaganda that spreads from tongue to tongue, can inflame a whole world of people and incite them to unrighteousness. It spots up not just the mouth in which it wags, but all the human body; so that, if one has a beautiful body but an uncontrolled tongue, it takes away from the fine impression made by the attractive body. This is especially so before God, because, as Jesus tells us, by our words we shall be declared righteous and by our words we shall be condemned. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965122/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 12:37</a>) Like Gehenna, the tongue can cause destruction that is beyond repair.</p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">14.

An unruly injurious thing, it is full of death-dealing poison.” The tongue, when “set aflame by Gehenna,” can cause the user to be sentenced by God to go to the symbolic Gehenna, as it denotes a bad heart condition.—See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965122/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 5:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965122/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Romans 3:13</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>THE “LAND OF NO RETURN”</strong></p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">15.

Thus, too, as in Revelation, we have a deadly lake associated with fire and sulphur (brimstone). The people upon whom the fire and sulphur rained may have been tormented for the time that they continued conscious, but the final effect of the fire and sulphur together was to destroy them.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965122/1">b</a> This destruction preceded by torment is the thought conveyed in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965122/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Revelation 14:10, 11</a>, and also in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965122/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 11:5, 6</a>, where fire and sulphur are mentioned together, evidently in a symbolic sense.</p>

Also, along with other plants, they have played a significant role in purifying the air by taking in carbon dioxide and giving off oxygen.

<strong>Is Hell Hot?</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">What, then, is the “hell” in which Jacob thought he would join his son? The correct answer to this question lies in getting the proper sense of the original-language word for “hell,” namely, <em>sh<sup>e</sup>’ohlʹ,</em> which is transliterated “Sheol.” This term, also translated as “grave,” “pit,” “abode of the dead” and “nether world,” appears sixty-six times<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1101974071/0">a</a> (in the <em>New World Translation</em>) in the thirty-nine books of the Hebrew Scriptures (commonly called the “Old Testament”), but it is never associated with life, activity or torment. To the contrary, it is often linked with death and inactivity. A few examples are:</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="si">“For in death there is no mention of you [Jehovah]; in Sheol [the grave, <em>Authorized Version;</em> hell, <em>Douay Version</em>] who will laud you?”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974071/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 6:5</a> (6:6, <em>Douay Version</em>).</p>

<strong>The Dead Who Are in Line for Resurrection</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> Now let the reader ask himself, Did Jesus really mean that the angels carried the dead body of Lazarus, full of sores, to the cave of Machpelah in front of the city of Hebron and there laid the dead Lazarus in the bosom of Abraham, crowding out Abraham’s dead wife Sarah? Furthermore, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are all in Haʹdes or Sheol. So did Jesus really mean that there is flaming fire in Haʹdes or Sheol, the place in which, Jesus said, the dead and buried “rich man” found himself? And does that flaming fire torment certain ones in Haʹdes or Sheol and not torment others? Can those in Haʹdes or Sheol see one another and talk back and forth across a “great gulf”? And is there <span id="page76" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="76" data-before-text="76"></span>water down in Haʹdes or Sheol into which a person can dip the finger?</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">14. (a) Are the “rich man” and “Lazarus” reported today to be buried at the traditional burial place of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob? (b) With reference to Jesus’ parable, what does the Bible teach is not so in the literal Haʹdes or Sheol?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Many religious Bible readers say that Jesus was not telling a parable or pictorial illustration but was telling things as they actually are. This makes Jesus ridiculous. It makes him talk contrary to the rest of the Bible as to what it has to say about Haʹdes or Sheol. Go, please, to the Middle East today, to the traditional location of the burial place of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the city of Hebron, under a Mohammedan mosque. Will they tell you that either the beggar Lazarus or the “certain rich man” (the so-called Diʹves) lies buried there? No! Furthermore, the Holy Bible says that Haʹdes or Sheol is not the location of Paradise for some dead ones and of fiery torment for others, but that it is the place of silence and of inactivity in every respect; that the dead ones there do not speak even to laud and praise God, and that there is no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in Haʹdes or Sheol.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Isa. 38:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Eccl. 9:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/16/2" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/16/3" data-bid="17-4" class="b"> Ps. 6:5</a>.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">15.

Such readers see that Jesus was using Abraham as a picture of the heavenly Father, Jehovah God, who made the promise to his earthly friend Abraham to bless all the families of the earth by means of Abraham’s seed or offspring. Just as Abraham at God’s command presented his son Isaac for human sacrifice, so Jehovah God actually sacrificed his Son Jesus Christ, the real promised Seed of Abraham for the blessing of all the nations of the earth.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Gen. 22:1-18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> John 3:16</a>.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">16. Whom do the rich man and Lazarus therefore picture, and on what is this explanation based?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Accordingly, the “certain rich man” and the “certain beggar named Lazarus” were not literal men; they simply pictured two classes of people. The one class died to its favored position with the Greater Abraham, Jehovah God, and thereafter had a tormenting religious experience on earth. The other class died to its unfavorable religious condition and was conducted by angelic power into the favor of the Greater Abraham, Jehovah God, through his sacrificed Son, Jesus Christ. This understanding and explanation of Jesus’ prophetic parable is based upon the actual historical experience of the two general religious classes among the natural descendants of the patriarch Abraham in Jesus’ day.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965082/0">a</a></p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">17.

Long ago when Abraham obediently attempted to sacrifice his beloved son Isaac, he displayed his own faith in the resurrection of the dead. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:17-19</a> tells us so in these words: “By faith Abraham, when he was tested, as good as offered up Isaac, and the man that had gladly received the promises attempted to offer up his only-begotten son, although it had been said to him: ‘What will be called “your seed” will be through Isaac.’ But he reckoned that God was able to raise him up even from the dead; and from there he did receive him also in an illustrative way.”</p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">18.

<strong>Part Two</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> Thus the Bible evidence is so abundant, plain and simple that no doubt should <span id="page47" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="47" data-before-text="47"></span>exist about it: the Biblical Sheol or Haʹdes is the common grave of dead mankind. That is why numbers of Bible translators render these two words into English as “the grave” (not, a grave). The <em>Authorized Version</em> or King James Bible Version renders the Hebrew word Sheol as “the grave” thirty-one times and as “the pit” three times, and the Greek word Haʹdes as “grave” once (in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:55</a>). But for centuries the religious clergy of Christendom have taught that Haʹdes is a place of fiery torment. So now our question is, What is the condition of people who are dead in Sheol or Haʹdes? Are they consciously alive as immortals, or are they really dead and out of existence? What does God’s own Word, the Holy Bible, not the clergy of Christendom, say in answer to this question?</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">14, 15. According to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/58/0" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:4-6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/58/1" data-bid="59-2" class="b"> 10</a>, in what condition are those in Sheol?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> In answer the words of King Solomon, who specially received wisdom from Jehovah God, are found in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:4-6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 10</a>: “As respects whoever is joined to all the living there exists confidence, because a live dog is better off than a dead lion. For the living [though like dogs] are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they [even though like lions] are conscious of nothing at all, neither do they any more have wages, because the remembrance of them has been forgotten. Also, their love and their hate and their jealousy have already perished, and they have no portion any more to time indefinite in anything that has to be done under the sun. All that your hand finds to do, do with your very power, for there is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol, the place to which you are going.”</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> According to that, those people dead in Sheol must really be dead, not even having an “intermediate existence.” Certainly they must be dead and out of existence if they are “conscious of nothing at all,” and if their love, hatred and jealousy, which are strong emotions, have “perished” with them, and if they have no wisdom and no knowledge and are not working at something or devising something. Little wonder why those in Sheol are called “dead” and why death, not life, is always associated with Sheol.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">16. (a) According to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Psalm 6:4, 5</a>, about whom is there no talk or thought in Sheol? (b) According to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/60/0" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Isaiah 38:17-19</a>, why did King Hezekiah not want to die at thirty-nine years of age?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> In Sheol the dead do not even think about God or talk about him. That was why the God-fearing psalmist David prayed: “Do return, O Jehovah, do rescue my soul; save me for the sake of your loving-kindness. For in death there is no mention of you; in Sheol who will laud you?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ps. 6:4, 5</a>) The same thought was expressed by King Hezekiah, when he was spared from dying at thirty-nine years of age. He said to God his Savior: “You yourself have become attached to my soul and kept it from the pit of disintegration. For you have thrown behind your back all my sins. For it is not Sheol that can laud you; death itself cannot praise you. Those going down into the pit cannot look hopefully to your trueness. The living, the living, he is the one that can laud you, just as I can this day.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Isa. 38:17-19</a>) Fifteen years later, when King Hezekiah died and went to Sheol, he was not able to praise Jehovah God and he had no consciousness to be able to hope in his God. However, he died with hope of a resurrection from Sheol.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">17. How do <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Psalm 139:7, 8 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/61/1" data-bid="62-2" class="b"> Proverbs 15:11</a> prove that the clergy are not correct in teaching that the dead are still alive but only separated from God?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> In the face of this it is foolish for the clergy of Christendom to argue that those in Sheol or Haʹdes are still alive as immortals and are dead only in the sense of being separated from God. The psalmist David does not agree with those clergymen, for he says to Jehovah God: “Where can I go from your spirit, and where can I run away <span id="page48" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="48" data-before-text="48"></span>from your face? If I should ascend to heaven, there you would be; and if I should spread out my couch in Sheol, look! you would be there.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ps. 139:7, 8</a>) Confirming that fact, King David’s son Solomon said, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:11</a>: “Sheol and the place of destruction are in front of Jehovah.

<strong>Cush</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Though Cushites were to be found in Arabia, the name “Cush” as used in the Bible in most cases clearly refers to a region in Africa and, where the relationship is obvious, translators simply render “Cush” as “Ethiopia.” It is regularly associated with Egypt (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isa. 20:3-5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 43:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/15/2" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> Jer. 46:7-9</a>) and also with Libya.

Cush thus embraced a more extensive and generally more southern area than that included in present-day <span id="page404" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="404" data-before-text="404"></span>Ethiopia. The “rivers of Ethiopia [Cush]” are suggested to have been the Blue and White Nile Rivers, which have their junction at Khartoum, and also the Atbara River, which joins the Nile S of the fifth cataract.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Zeph. 3:10</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The “Arabs that were by the side of the Ethiopians [<em>Ku·shim</em>ʹ]” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Chron. 21:16</a>) likely were those Arab tribes occupying the SW coast of the Arabian Peninsula and thus facing Africa across the Red Sea.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Much of the land of Cush was evidently arid desert country. The “region of the rivers of Ethiopia” is described as the “land of the whirring insects with wings” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Isa. 18:1</a>), perhaps referring to the locusts that swarm in Ethiopia and Egypt, while some suggest the mosquitoes, and others point out that the Hebrew word for “whirring” (<em>ts<sup>e</sup>la·tsal</em>ʹ) resembles in sound the name given to the tsetse fly (<em>tsaltsalya</em>) by the Galla tribes (a Hamitic people living in modern Ethiopia). Ivory, ebony, gold, precious stones, iron and aromatics were products of the land, and Biblical mention is made of the “merchants of Ethiopia” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Isa. 45:14</a>) and the “topaz of Cush.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Job 28:19</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>LATER HISTORY</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">At about the time of the exodus of Israel from Egypt, Cush or Ethiopia had come under Egyptian domination and continued thus for some five hundred years. A viceroy administering this domain under the Egyptian Pharaoh was known by the title “King’s Son of Kush.” Evidently toward the close of the second millennium B.C.E. Ethiopia freed itself from Egypt’s control. The Ethiopian capital was thereafter located first at Napata, near the fourth cataract, and later at Meroe, about 130 miles (209 kilometers) N-NE of Khartoum.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Ethiopian warriors formed part of Pharaoh Shishak’s forces that attacked Judah in the fifth year of Rehoboam (993-992 B.C.E.).

Ethiopia conquered Egypt and dominated it for some sixty years. This was during the Twenty-fifth (Ethiopian) Dynasty, which included among its rulers King Taharka, called Tirhakah in the Bible. This king came up against the forces of Sennacherib during their invasion of Judah (c. 732 B.C.E.), but, according to the Assyrian inscriptions, was defeated at Elteke.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">2 Ki. 19:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Isa. 37:8, 9</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Assyrian Emperors Esar-haddon and Ashurbanipal invaded Egypt during their respective reigns, and the destruction of Thebes in Upper Egypt (called No-amon at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Nahum 3:8-10</a>) by Ashurbanipal (c. 684 B.C.E.) completely subjugated Egypt and also ended Ethiopian dominance of the Nile valley.

It is thus the basis on which God can judge us. Job well understood this truth.

David similarly said: “Jehovah himself will pass sentence on the peoples. Judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousness and according to my integrity in me. . . . And God as righteous is testing out heart and kidneys.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008920/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 7:8, 9</a>) We know that God can look into the very depths of the inner person, the figurative “heart and kidneys.” We need to remember, though, what he is looking for. As David said, Jehovah judges us according to our integrity.</p>

There is nought but swearing and breaking faith, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery; they break out, and blood toucheth blood.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956603/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hos. 4:1, 2</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> These words predictively tell of a condition that in our day is increasing to an alarming degree. World-wide hypocrisy, injustice, falsehood, crime and immorality are rampant and spreading. Law-enforcing and welfare agencies, if themselves untainted, find their problems constantly multiplying. True, in the world there still are some honest persons, but too often those in political offices look for graft, bribes and gifts. Integrity is almost entirely forgotten. Also, there still are persons on earth who appreciate the value of integrity. These include such as the physician interested not merely in his profits but in the health of his patient; the lawyer who fights not merely for a large fee but for justice for his client; the clerk or the laborer who toils not just for silver but to give genuinely good service; and the person who truly loves honesty and does not merely practice being honest because it is good policy. Refreshing as it is to hear of integrity kept among men, there is yet a more important consideration; namely, the keeping of integrity with God. Such integrity-keeping by Jehovah’s slaves is praiseworthy and beautiful in his eyes. He will judge and in due time he will reward those practicing it.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 3, 4.

From intimate acquaintance with his Maker, Moses wrote of him: “Who among the gods is like you, O Jehovah? Who is like you, proving yourself mighty in holiness?

That divine law was given not to restrict man in the proper exercise of his liberties but merely to guard him against improper use of these powers, so as not to injure others or himself.</p>

<strong>Why Keep Your Integrity?</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> We see that integrity enables us to take our stand for Jehovah’s sovereignty. It is thus the basis on which God can judge us. Job well understood this truth. (<em>Read</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008920/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b"><em>Job 31:6</em></a><em>.</em>) Job knew that God weighs all mankind in “accurate scales,” using His perfect standard of justice to gauge our integrity. David similarly said: “Jehovah himself will pass sentence on the peoples. Judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousness and according to my integrity in me. . . . And God as righteous is testing out heart and kidneys.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008920/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 7:8, 9</a>) We know that God can look into the very depths of the inner person, the figurative “heart and kidneys.” We need to remember, though, what he is looking for. As David said, Jehovah judges us according to our integrity.</p>

The verse reads: “I, Jehovah, am searching the heart, examining the kidneys, even to give to each one according to his ways, according to the fruitage of his dealings.” Jehovah makes such an examination, not as a medical doctor would, but in a judicial way. He looks, not at their purely physical state, but at the moral and spiritual state as connected with those body organs. This is the sense conveyed in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977805/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 7:9</a>, where we read: “God as righteous is testing out heart and kidneys.” As our physical life depends to a large extent on the condition of our kidneys, so our eternal life in God’s incoming realm of righteousness, peace and perfect bodily health depends upon what God as Judge determines us to be, as disclosed by heart and kidneys. According to our ways of life, what will he give to each one of us? What will he find the fruitage of our dealings to be, for his guidance in giving us what is appropriate, deserved? Will it be destruction or eternal life?</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">10.

Then the prophet Jeremiah wrote as if he represented the whole nation of Israel, at the time of the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonian armies in 607 B.C.E. He likened Jehovah to a bowman in the war and said: “He has trodden his bow [for his use], and he sets me up as the target for the arrow. He [by then shooting] has brought into my kidneys the sons of his quiver.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977805/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Lam. 3:12, 13</a>) Barbed arrows, shot at a person in flight and plunging deeply into the kidneys, spelled death for the one trying to escape. Such a deadly wound for the people represented by Jeremiah meant death for the kingdom of Judah as an independent nation with a Davidic king at Jerusalem. How sad!</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">11.

For us now to avoid, as it were, the arrows of Jehovah in the coming “great tribulation,” we must take heed to our “kidneys.” We must consider seriously the examination of these vital organs by Jehovah as the Examiner thereof. What does he find our moral, spiritual condition to be deep down inside us, as it were, at the kidneys? Is it bad, or does it favor our gaining eternal life? This figurative seat of what we really are​—we want to keep it functioning healthily. To do so, we need to watch what we eat and drink. Such a thing is true with respect to the literal kidneys. It also applies in a spiritual way.</p>

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page219" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="219" data-before-text="219"></span><strong>The Kidneys—Why Used Symbolically</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THROUGHOUT the Bible, even as in everyday usage, the various parts of the human body are used in a symbolic or figurative way. Among these are the hands, the shoulders and the heart. Such figurative use of words not only is expressive and adds force to speech but often is quite enlightening. In particular is the heart used in a figurative way both in the Bible and in everyday language.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">However, there are certain figurative expressions found in the Bible that have no counterpart in modern usage, at least not in English. Among these are the kidneys. In Biblical Hebrew the word for kidneys is <em>kelayoth.</em> Of the some thirty times it occurs in the Hebrew Scriptures about one-third of the times the reference is to kidneys in a figurative sense. Thus we read: “Examine me, O Jehovah, and put me to the test; refine my kidneys and my heart.” “Jehovah of armies is judging with righteousness; he is examining the kidneys and the heart.” “I, Jehovah, am searching the heart, examining the kidneys, even to give to each one according to his ways, according to the fruitage of his dealings.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 26:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Jer. 11:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 17:10</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Why do the Scripture writers use the kidneys in a symbolic sense? For more than one reason. In cutting up animals for sacrifice—the kidneys are repeatedly mentioned in the Levitical code of sacrifices—the Israelites could not help noting that they came upon the kidneys last; they were buried the deepest. The kidneys would therefore well stand for or represent the deepest part of man, his inmost or deepest thoughts and feelings. That is why we read at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jeremiah 12:2</a>: “They keep going ahead; they have also produced fruit. You are near in their mouth, but far away from their kidneys,” far away from the inmost thoughts and feelings of such wicked ones.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">No doubt the kidneys were associated with the deepest emotions also because these emotions affect the kidneys. Thus authorities on psychosomatic medicine tell us that sustained emotional strain can well cause such disturbances as <em>diabetes insipidous,</em> in which the kidneys fail to function properly. (This should not be confused with <em>diabetes mellitus</em> or “sugar” diabetes.)—<em>Emotions and Bodily Changes,</em> Dunbar.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Because of this we find that various Bible dictionaries and commentaries have the following to say about the symbolic use of “kidneys”: “The kidneys were considered the seat of affections and emotions and the most vital and sensitive part of man.” “The kidneys, from the sensitiveness of that part of the person, were believed to be the seat of longing and desire.” “The Orientals regarded the kidneys as the seat of the desires and affections, and hence under them spoke of the soul in respect to its inmost purposes or cravings.” “The most secret workings and affections of the heart.”</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In keeping with all the foregoing we note that in the <em>New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures,</em> First Edition, whenever “kidneys” is used with this symbolic or figurative sense there is a footnote reading, “deepest emotions.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 7:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 16:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 26:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/3" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> Prov. 23:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/4" data-bid="3-5" class="b"> Jer. 11:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/5" data-bid="3-6" class="b"> 12:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/6" data-bid="3-7" class="b"> 17:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/7" data-bid="3-8" class="b"> 20:12</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">As for the use of “kidneys” in the Christian Greek Scriptures, the Greek word for “kidneys,” <em>nephros,</em> is found only once, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 2:23</a>. There, in the <em>New World Translation</em> it is freely rendered “inmost thoughts.” “Her children I will kill with deadly plague, so that all the congregations will know that I am he who searches the <em>inmost thoughts</em> and hearts, and I will give to you individually according to your deeds.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The word “kidneys” when used figuratively in the Scriptures has but the one meaning, that of deepest or inmost emotions or thoughts. Many modern translators render the Hebrew and Greek words for “kidneys” as “heart.” However, strictly speaking, “kidneys” used in a symbolic sense goes deeper than does “heart” when applied to the emotions, feelings. Thus both Job and Jeremiah spoke of being wounded in the kidneys, meaning a very deep wound.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 16:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Lam. 3:13</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Whenever we ask Jehovah God, as did David, to examine our “kidneys” we mean for him to make a most searching examination, one that takes in the deepest emotions, thoughts, feelings. Being omniscient and omnipotent, Jehovah God has no difficulty at all in making such an examination. “All things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Heb. 4:13</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"></p>

Among the Israelites they were generally made of seasoned wood and sometimes of horn, though “a bow of copper” is mentioned. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">2 Sam. 22:35</a>) Egyptian bows found at Thebes are about five feet (1.5 meters) long and are round pieces of wood that are nearly straight, though tapering to a point at both ends. Others, as depicted on tomb paintings, curved inward at the center. Assyrian warriors carried two bows: one long and somewhat curved, the other short and nearly angular.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The expression ‘to bend the bow’ (literally, ‘to tread the bow’) refers to stringing the bow. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps. 7:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 37:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/25/2" data-bid="26-3" class="b"> Jer. 50:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/25/3" data-bid="26-4" class="b"> 29</a>) This might be done by firmly planting the foot against the middle of the bow; or one end of the bow with the string attached might be held to the ground by the foot while the other end was bent to receive the free end of the string.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Arrow shafts were generally made of reed or light wood. Some Egyptian arrows were winged with feathers, as are modern arrows. Feathers would enable the arrow to maintain smooth flight on a straight course. A bundle of thin iron rods found at Nimrud may have been the shafts of arrows. Arrows tipped with metal or flint were widely used by the Egyptians. Persians and other Eastern peoples at times simply used stone-tipped arrows in battle. Sometimes arrows were barbed, were dipped in poison (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Job 6:4</a>), or were dressed with combustible material. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ps. 7:13</a>) Such an incendiary arrow was found at Shechem. Oil-soaked tow was placed into holes along the edge of its metal head, to be ignited when the arrow was used.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Arrows were carried in quivers on chariots (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Isa. 22:6</a>) or were hung on the back or at the warrior’s left side. The Egyptians carried their quiver in a nearly horizontal position, drawing the arrows from it under the arm, while the Assyrians slung it on the back, thus drawing the arrows from behind, over the shoulder.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>BATTERING RAM</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">An instrument of warfare used by besiegers to breach or break down the gates and walls of a city or fortress. In its simplest form, it was a heavy beam of timber with an iron tip resembling the head of a ram. Perhaps due to this or because of its butting action when in use, it is designated by the same Hebrew word (<em>kar</em>) as the animal.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Besiegers would cast up a mound, or siege rampart, against the city walls to serve as an inclined plane on which battering rams and other engines of war might be brought against them. Towers as high as the city walls might be pushed up the rampart, thus placing attackers on the same level as defenders. The defending soldiers would endeavor to put the battering rams out of action by dropping firebrands on them or by catching them with chains or grapnels.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Joab and his men cast up a siege rampart against Abel of Beth-maacah and may have used a battering ram in an attempt to throw down its wall. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">2 Sam. 20:15</a>) Ezekiel was told to make a model of Jerusalem under siege, with battering rams set against it. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ezek. 4:1, 2</a>) Battering rams were part of the siege equipment the Babylonians possessed for use against Jerusalem.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ezek. 21:22</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The Egyptians and Assyrians were well acquainted with the battering ram. It often was long enough to require one or two hundred men to lift and wield it. In other cases it was suspended from a support allowing it to swing within a framework.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">A scene on a relief from the palace of Assyrian King Ashurnasirpal II in Nimrud shows him attacking a city and depicts a battering ram mounted in a heavy machine with six wheels. It has a “prefabricated” body consisting of many rectangular wicker shields and a domed turret, below which a metal-tipped battering pole protrudes. Also represented is a tall mobile assault tower, from which an archer covers the men operating the ram. He is protected by a shield bearer holding a wicker shield like those covering the battering-ram structure.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Tyre was forewarned that Nebuchadnezzar would direct “the strike of his attack engine” against her walls (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Ezek. 26:7-9</a>), apparently indicating the use of the battering ram. The Romans developed battering-ram engines 150 feet (c. 46 meters) in length. According to Josephus, they used one against Jerusalem that was so enormous that 300 oxen were needed to move it and 1,500 men were required to drive it against the walls.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong>BATTLE-AX</strong></p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">A weapon usually having a relatively short wooden or metal handle and a stone or metal head with a sharp blade. It was used for cutting and piercing in hand-to-hand combat, though besieging warriors might also employ it to split the doors of city gates or fell trees to construct assault engines. While the battle-ax was often used by the Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Elamites and others, it does not seem to have been of major importance to the Israelites.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Battle-axes of Biblical lands and times were of two basic types, though there were variations of these. <span id="page125" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="125" data-before-text="125"></span>One kind, having a long blade ending with a short sharp edge, was used for piercing. The other, with a short blade and wide edge, was for cutting. The cutting kind would be effective against foes not wearing armor, whereas against armored soldiers the piercing type would be useful. A kind used for cutting was the “epsilon ax,” so named because its semicircular blade with three “tangs” or projections that were fitted into the handle resembles the Greek letter <em>eʹpsi· lon</em> (or, from the other side, the figure 3). It seems that in Palestine and Syria this type underwent changes until, for increased effectiveness, the blade was lengthened and the edge narrowed, forming what has been called the “duck-bill ax,” given that name due to its elongated shape and general appearance. At times, the rear part of the battle-ax blade bore likenesses of animal heads, a horse’s mane or the extended fingers of a hand. Sometimes a figure such as that of an animal or a boat was inscribed on the Egyptian ax blade.</p>
