<strong>Are You Walking as in God’s Presence?</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span id="page356" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="356" data-before-text="356"></span>If we are walking in God’s presence it will keep us from getting into trouble with him, for it means that we will be fearful of displeasing him, knowing that there is no escaping his judgments. It will keep us from the course of the wicked one of whom it is written that “there is no dread of God in front of his eyes.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977440/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 36:1</a>) That the fear of God will keep us from yielding to temptation and so getting into trouble can be seen from the response that the young man Joseph, the favorite son of the patriarch Jacob, made when he was importuned by the wife of his Egyptian master Potiphar: “How could I commit this great badness and actually sin <em>against God?”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977440/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 39:9</a>) He walked as in God’s presence, as though God were watching him all the time, as though he at all times could see God. Doing so served as a safeguard for him.</p>

<strong>Life and Light Go Hand in Hand</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> We pause here to consider one of Satan’s chief tactics and how it operates. By subtle means, by deception, he tempts us to view things from a selfish viewpoint, as he did with Eve. If at heart we are, or become, governed by selfishness, then we readily fall into Satan’s snare and are easily blinded and deceived. We seek to justify ourselves, and put out of our mind the fear of God. See how clearly and forcefully this is expressed in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976363/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 36:1-3</a>: “The utterance of transgression to the wicked one is in the midst of his heart; there is no dread <span id="page305" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="305" data-before-text="305"></span>of God in front of his eyes. For he has acted too smoothly to himself in his own eyes to find out his error so as to hate it. The words of his mouth are hurtfulness and deception; he has ceased to have insight for doing good.” God’s judgment of such is well expressed by the prophet Isaiah: “Woe to those who are saying that good is bad and bad is good, those who are putting darkness for light and light for darkness . . . ! Woe to those wise in their own eyes and discreet even in front of their own faces!” We should certainly fear lest we “become hardened [and hence blinded] by the deceptive power of sin.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976363/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Isa. 5:20, 21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976363/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Heb. 3:13</a>.</p>

<strong>Beware of Sin’s Hardening Effects!</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Indeed, the heart searches for ways to rationalize the wrongdoing. One young man, after committing fornication with his girlfriend, restrained her from going to the elders for help by saying: “We’re going to get married! And you know, the Bible does say that when two people decide between themselves that they’re the ones for each other, then in Jehovah’s eyes they’re almost married.” What selfish, deceptive reasoning! Sadly, a practice of sin developed that, in turn, led to murder​—abortion! The young girl later admitted: “You start really getting very callous, and you start feeling that you can reprove yourself.” A young man who similarly fell into a practice of fornication confessed: “It’s like being an alcoholic who says, ‘I can stop anytime I want. Let me have just one more drink.’ So you keep putting off going to the elders.” The sinner becomes so adept at deceiving others that he begins to deceive himself. “For he has acted too smoothly to himself in his own eyes to find out his error so as to hate it.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986246/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Psalm 36:2</a>.</p>

<strong>Why Be Honest?</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><span id="page247" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="247" data-before-text="247"></span>If you lie to others, you generally wind up lying to yourself. You can begin to <em>live a lie,</em> making yourself think you are something you are not and that your life is really far better and happier than it honestly is. You can convince yourself of being very smart and wise, while really knowing very little. False reasoning helps to justify “pulling a fast one” or “feeding someone a line” with the idea that, after all, you are just getting what rightfully should be yours anyway, as something owed to you. Sooner or later, however, the person doing this meets up with circumstances that force him to face up to reality. He may then feel shocked to see himself as he really is, realizing what a fake his life has been​—like a building with nothing but slippery sand as a foundation.​—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974284/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 7:26, 27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974284/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Psalm 36:2</a>.</p>

<strong>Mount, Mountain</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><strong><em>Stability, permanence, or loftiness.</em></strong> Stability and permanence are ascribed to the mountains.

With reference to this choosing, David wrote: “The mountainous region of Bashan is a mountain of God [that is, created by God]; the mountainous region of Bashan is a mountain of peaks. Why do you, O you mountains of peaks, keep watching enviously the mountain that God has desired for himself to dwell in? Even Jehovah himself will reside there forever. . . . Jehovah himself has come from Sinai [where he first revealed his presence to the entire nation of Israel] into the holy place.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Ps. 68:15-17</a>) The mountainous region of Bashan may be said to reach its crest in Mount Hermon and, therefore, this mountain may be meant by the words the “mountain of God” and the “mountain of peaks.” Although Mount Hermon towers far above Mount Zion, Jehovah chose the less conspicuous location for his place of dwelling.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">After the temple was built on Mount Moriah, the term “Zion” came to include the temple site and therefore Zion remained God’s holy mountain.

There is no evidence that such a thing ever took place in connection with the literal temple at Jerusalem. But there is evidence of a fulfillment upon the Christian congregation of spiritual Israel, which is associated with the spiritual temple of Jehovah God. The invitation to become part of spiritual Israel began to be extended to non-Jews in the year 36 C.E.

The fact that the “mountain of the house of Jehovah” was to be above mountains and hills would point to the exalted position of true worship, for mountains and hills anciently served as sites for idolatrous worship and for sanctuaries of false deities.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/0" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Deut. 12:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/1" data-bid="68-2" class="b"> Jer. 3:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/2" data-bid="68-3" class="b"> Ezek. 18:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/3" data-bid="68-4" class="b"> 11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/4" data-bid="68-5" class="b"> 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/5" data-bid="68-6" class="b"> Hos. 4:13</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong><em>Obstacles</em></strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">At times mountains represent obstacles.

<strong>“Man” in the Hebrew Scriptures</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><em>Ish,</em> together with its plural form <em>anashím</em> (which at times also serves as the plural of <em>enósh</em>), has primarily the thought of “man,” or a person, an individual. It has no such overtones as human, mortal or able-bodied, although inherent in it is the thought of strength as of a male. The word <em>ish</em> does not appear in the Scriptures until after the word for woman, <em>ishsháh</em>—a man with a womb—appears, for in the <span id="page57" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="57" data-before-text="57"></span>strictest sense of the word only then did an <em>ish</em> become apparent; before that he was called the human, <em>adám.</em> When in the Hebrew Scriptures man is mentioned in relation to woman or sexual intercourse, invariably <em>ish</em> is used, some seventy times in all, although the word for “male” is <em>zakhár</em> and occurs seventy-nine times from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 1:27</a> onward. Typical is <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Leviticus, chapter 20</a>, dealing with God’s law regarding sex relations.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><em>Ish,</em> with its emphasis on the person, the individual, is the choice of Bible writers when writing about a “man of God,” and a “man of discernment.” When Nathan confronted King David with his sin, Nathan used this word. Did he say, “You yourself are the”—mortal? human? able-bodied man? No, but, “You yourself are [the one] the man!”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Josh. 14:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Prov. 10:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 2 Sam. 12:7</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">There are times when the other words for “man” simply would not be appropriate. Thus when the psalmist foretold that the names of those of the body of Christ who gain heavenly glory would be known he could use only <em>ish. “‘Each</em> and <em>every one</em> was born in her.’ . . . Jehovah himself will declare, when recording the peoples: ‘This is one who was born there.’” Also Moses, when exulting over Jehovah’s victory at the Red Sea, could not have referred to Jehovah as a weak mortal or a human earthling, and so had to use <em>ish</em> to convey his thought, even as rendered in the <em>New World Translation:</em> “Jehovah is a manly person of war.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 87:5, 6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Ex. 15:3</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss">“<strong>ADÁM”</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn"><em>Adám,</em> the human, the earthling, is the choice whenever Hebrew Scripture writers make reference to the creation of man: “I myself have made the earth and have created even man [the human] upon it.” <em>Adám</em> does not denote maleness any more than <em>human</em> does, and so we read that Adam, that is, the human, earthling man, called the first human pair, the <em>ish</em> and <em>ishsháh,</em> the man and the woman.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Isa. 45:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Gen. 5:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 6:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/7/3" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> Deut. 4:32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/7/4" data-bid="8-5" class="b"> Eccl. 7:29</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><em>Adám</em>, the human, is almost without exception also the word preferred when man is mentioned in the same breath with the lower animals or beasts. This coupling appears in the accounts of creation, the Deluge, the plagues of Egypt and the seventy-year desolation. The psalmist praises Jehovah God for preserving both <em>adám</em> (human) and beast. And it is the human that is shown to be like the beast by the Congregator: “For there is an eventuality as respects the sons of mankind [<em>adám</em>] and an eventuality as respects the beast, and they have the same eventuality. As the one dies, so the other dies; and they all have but one spirit, so that there is no superiority of the man [human, <em>adám</em>] over the beast, for everything is vanity.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Gen. 1:26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 6:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Ex. 8:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/8/3" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> Jer. 33:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/8/4" data-bid="9-5" class="b"> Ps. 36:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/8/5" data-bid="9-6" class="b"> Eccl. 3:19-21</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Fittingly, <em>adám</em>, the earthling, human, is also the choice when speaking of the general characteristics of humankind: “The inclination of the heart of <em>man</em> is bad from his youth up.” “There is no <em>man</em> that does not sin.” “<em>Man,</em> born of woman, is short-lived and glutted with agitation.” “Surely every earthling man . . . is nothing but an exhalation,” a breath. “There is no <em>man</em> having power over the spirit to restrain the spirit,” that is, to keep from dying. “I well know, O Jehovah, that to <em>earthling man</em> his way does not belong.

<strong>No Relief for the Rich, but Comfort for the Poor</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> But that “great chasm”! The rich man had not thought of that when pleading to Abraham for relief. The people where he is cannot cross it and force themselves into Abraham’s bosom. Nor can the Lazarus class leave Abraham’s bosom and cross over it to the relief of the “rich man” class. The chasm pictures God’s judgment, which cannot be reversed and which divides the two classes. It forbids any mercy or relief to Christendom. She is abandoned since making her decision following World War I. She then decided against God’s established kingdom and favored the international conspiracy for ruling the earth by human agents in defiance of His rightful sovereignty and in opposition to his King Jesus Christ, whom he put on the throne in 1914 to rule amidst his enemies. To the “rich man” class the King Jesus Christ says: “Serpents, offspring of vipers, how are you to flee from the judgment of Gehenna?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951166/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Matt. 23:33</a>, <em>NW</em>) The Kingdom is here to rule in triumph. Now this world, including Christendom and its religious powers, must be abandoned to destruction. Her “rich man” class are like Esau, who sold his birthright for selfishness and moved to Mount Seir. Afterward when he wanted to inherit the blessing he was rejected, for, “although he earnestly <span id="page152" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="152" data-before-text="152"></span>sought a change of mind [in Isaac] with tears, he found no place for it.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951166/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Heb. 12:16, 17</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951166/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Deut. 2:1-5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951166/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> Ezek. 35:1-15</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">13.

The Kingdom class of blessing is now about complete, only a remnant on earth being yet destined for it. The “rich man” has not met those theocratic terms and requirements but has chosen the wisdom of this world. The last ones from his standpoint are now first in their participation in the Kingdom interests, and the reputedly first ones are now last. There can be no fusion of the two classes, no fraternizing! “Come out of her, my people,” calls the divine voice from heaven, “touch not the unclean thing.” The Lazarus remnant have left the Babylonish world and its religious confusion that they might be clean to bear Jehovah’s vessels of worship. God is determined to keep the organization of his people clean now. Only the real thing is kept there; all hypocrites are thrown out. The rich man cannot be brought in contrary to Jehovah’s decree. But now in this short period of God’s patience before the world destruction at Armageddon the “other sheep” class hear the Right Shepherd’s voice sounding the divine call to come out of worldly Babylon. They do so, flee to the upraised Signal of Jehovah’s kingdom, and gain entrance to the one flock under his royal Shepherd. These sheep the Shepherd puts to his right and divides them off from the “goats”. The great unbridgeable chasm of divine judgment allows for no fellowship between faithful persons and those who unbelievingly reject the Kingdom.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1951166/0">a</a> “Thy judgments are a great deep.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951166/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 36:6</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>PLEA FOR THE FIVE BROTHERS</strong></p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">14.

<strong>Walking with God</strong><br/><p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[68]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"><sup>26</sup></span> To exercise justice we must not only love what is just and right but hate, abhor, what is bad. Jehovah does: “I, Jehovah, am loving justice, hating . . . unrighteousness.” And of Jesus it was written: “You have loved righteousness and you hate wickedness.” So we are commanded: <span id="page110" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="110" data-before-text="110"></span>“O you lovers of Jehovah, hate what is bad.” “Abhor what is wicked, cling to what is good.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Isa. 61:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Ps. 45:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/23/2" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> 97:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/23/3" data-bid="24-4" class="b"> Rom. 12:9</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[68]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"><sup>27</sup></span> We all must be careful that we keep on walking with God by exercising justice, not only loving what is right, but also hating what is bad, what is wicked. At times what is bad may be very temptingly presented to us, even as was the forbidden fruit to Eve; and so unless we have cultivated a loathing for what is bad, an abhorrence and hatred for it, in a moment of weakness we may succumb to temptation, to our lasting shame and regret. No one may take for granted that because of his many years as a dedicated Christian he has a firm position. Not even the apostle Paul had such confidence in himself!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Cor. 9:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 10:12</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[68]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="28"><sup>28</sup></span> We know what our individual weaknesses are. We may not pamper ourselves but must manifest a righteous zeal in opposing them at all times. If love of money is our chief weakness, we dare not indulge in sharp practices, for sooner or later we will go too far and come in for punishment. If we are fond of alcoholic beverages to the extent of not being able to control that fondness, we must exercise a tight rein when in the presence of those indulging in them, preferably staying away from such places, or we may bring dishonor to the Christian congregation and deserve to be chastised. If our weakness is along the lines of sex, whether married or single, then we must wage a strong fight against that weakness, avoiding unclean thoughts, pornographic literature and sensual moving pictures. Remember, “there is nothing . . . secret that will not become known.” We must keep “bringing every thought into captivity to make it obedient to the Christ.” We must ‘keep ourselves clean as carriers of Jehovah’s utensils’ if we would keep on walking with God, ‘exercising justice.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Matt. 10:26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 10:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/25/2" data-bid="26-3" class="b"> Isa. 52:11</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="ss"><strong>“LOVE KINDNESS”</strong></p><p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="qu">29.

The Hebrew word here rendered “kindness” is the same that is elsewhere translated “loving-kindness.” Time and again we read of Jehovah’s loving-kindness. “How precious your loving-kindness is, O God!” “I am Jehovah, the One exercising loving-kindness.” “It is the acts of loving-kindness of Jehovah that we have not come to our finish, because his mercies will certainly not come to an end. They are new each morning. Your faithfulness is abundant.” “Jehovah is very tender in affection and merciful.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ps. 36:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> Jer. 9:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/27/2" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> Lam. 3:22, 23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/27/3" data-bid="28-4" class="b"> Jas. 5:11</a>.</p><p id="p70" data-pid="70" class="qu">30.

Loving-kindness will make us understanding, considerate, gentle and helpful. To be kind we must have empathy. Empathy goes farther than sympathy, for in empathy we put ourselves in the other’s place, we actually feel what he feels. Jehovah God, great as he is, is not beyond exercising empathy regarding his creatures. He not only has pity, compassion, sympathy for us, remembering that we are but dust, but he puts himself in our place so that what hurts us hurts him. Thus we read regarding his nation of Israel: “During all their distress it was distressing to him.” Yes, when they suffered, he suffered.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Isa. 63:9</a>.</p><p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="qu">31.

When Saul of Tarsus was <span id="page111" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="111" data-before-text="111"></span>persecuting the Christians Jesus said to him: “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.” Jesus Christ, now the exact representation of God’s very being, put himself in the place of his followers; what hurt them hurt him. And once becoming a follower of Jesus Christ himself, Paul also imitated his Master in this matter of empathy. He put himself in the others’ place, that he might win them to Christ: To the Jew he became as a Jew, to those under the law, as under the law, to those without the law, as without law. “To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak. I have become all things to people of all sorts . . . for the sake of the good news.” And once these had become his brothers Paul continued to manifest empathy: “Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is stumbled, and I am not incensed?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Acts 9:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 9:20-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963122/29/2" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> 2 Cor. 11:29</a>.</p>

Happily, our celestial “power station”​—the sun—​is totally reliable. And thanks to light from the sun, we can see, eat, breathe, and live.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Since light is essential for life, we should not be surprised to read in Genesis that light appeared on the first creative day. “God proceeded to say: ‘Let light come to be.’ Then there came to be light.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001888/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 1:3</a>) Reverent men like King David have always recognized Jehovah as the source of life and light. “With you is the source of life,” David wrote. “By light from you we can see light.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001888/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 36:9</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">David’s words apply both literally and figuratively. The <em>Encyclopædia Britannica</em> points out: “Light, certainly, is responsible for the sensation of sight.” It then adds: “More information reaches the human brain through the eyes than through any other sense organ.” Since much of what we learn depends on the gift of sight​—which needs light to function properly—​light is also used in the Scriptures in a figurative way.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Thus, Jesus told his disciples: “I am the light of the world. He that follows me will by no means walk in darkness, but will possess the light of life.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001888/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 8:12</a>) The figurative light referred to by Jesus was the message of truth he preached, which could illuminate the minds and hearts of his listeners. After years of spiritual darkness, Jesus’ disciples could finally understand God’s purpose for mankind and the hope of the Kingdom. This was truly “light of life,” since that knowledge could lead to eternal life. “This means everlasting life,” Jesus said in prayer to his heavenly Father, “their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001888/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) May we never take for granted this spiritual light!</p>

<strong>Respect for the Gift of Life</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> Respect for life is a sacred obligation to the Giver of life, Jehovah God. Of him the psalmist said: “With you is the source of life.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101986044/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 36:9</a>) We owe our lives to God, not only because he created man but also because he has allowed mankind to continue until now and has provided the means for sustaining life. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101986044/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 14:16, 17</a>) More than that, he arranged for his Son to become the Repurchaser, or Redeemer, of the human family, buying it with his lifeblood. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101986044/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Romans 5:6-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101986044/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ephesians 1:7</a>) As a result, he now extends to all who will accept it an opportunity to live forever in his righteous New Order. In view of all of this, how can we show our deep respect and appreciation for God’s gift of life?</p>

After saying that Jehovah is “the source of life,” he adds: “By light from you we can see light.” In other words, it is only by learning how to look at things, including ourselves, from <em>his</em> viewpoint, that we can be turned from darkness to light and can come to see and appreciate the steps we must take to gain eternal life under God’s authority. Happy are we if we walk hand in hand with that light, with truth and righteousness, for “the path of the righteous ones is like the bright light that is getting lighter and lighter until the day is firmly established.” Then we can join with David in his prayer: “Continue your loving-kindness to those knowing you, and your righteousness to those upright in heart.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976363/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ps. 36:5-10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976363/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> Prov. 4:18</a>.</p>

<strong>The Bible and Creation in the Light of Modern Science</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> In spite of this evidence, evolutionists who are atheists still believe that a living cell arose by accident. But even the most capable scientists with all their elaborate equipment have not succeeded in creating one tiny living cell! As one “distinguished authority on evolution” admitted: “No living chemist can shape a dinosaur, no living hand can start the dreaming tentacular extensions that characterize the life of the simplest ameboid cell.” (<em>Harper’s Magazine,</em> March 1964) If this cannot be done <span id="page587" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="587" data-before-text="587"></span>under the best of experimental conditions, it could hardly have happened by accident.

Also, there are trillions of cells in just one adult human body! And we are asked to believe that this all came about by accident! No, nothing organized can ever come about by accident. If a housewife wanted to bake an apple pie, would she wait for some apples to fall off a tree accidentally into her oven, which accidentally happened to have flour, eggs and other ingredients in it, and then hope these would accidentally arrange themselves into a pie, which would accidentally cook itself just the right length of time?

<strong>Sound Basis for Optimism Today</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">“Do not show yourself heated up because of the evildoers,” King David declared. “Do not be envious of those doing unrighteousness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998081/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 37:1</a>) That is, indeed, wise counsel, for today injustice and crookedness are all around us.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998081/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Even if we do not envy the unrighteous, however, it is easy to feel frustrated when we see innocent people suffer at the hands of the wicked or when we ourselves are being dealt with unjustly. Such experiences may even cause us to develop a despondent or pessimistic attitude. When we feel that way, what should we do? First, we can keep in mind that the wicked cannot complacently assume that retribution will never come. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998081/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 37</a> goes on to assure us in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998081/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps 37 verse 2</a>: “Like grass they [evildoers] will speedily wither, and like green new grass they will fade away.”</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">In addition, we can continue to do what is good, remain optimistic, and wait upon Jehovah. “Turn away from what is bad and do what is good, and so reside to time indefinite,” continued the psalmist. “For Jehovah is a lover of justice, and he will not leave his loyal ones.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998081/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Psalm 37:27, 28</a>.</p>

<strong>Are You Disturbed?</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">FROM many lands the reports are much the same. Dishonesty has become a plague. Many people are shoplifting. Employers find that they are experiencing heavy losses from employee theft. Bribery has become common in the business world. Fraud, extortion and embezzlement abound. By far the majority seem to be getting away with their dishonesty. Even among those who are caught, few are punished to the extent that their crimes merit.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">How is this moral breakdown affecting you? Many are inclined to say, “What’s the use of being honest?” They begin to look with envy at the prosperity of lawless men. But is the success of dishonest persons to be envied?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Many centuries ago an inspired answer was given to this question. And rightly so, for moral corruption is not something new. It has been the source of disturbance to righteously inclined persons throughout many centuries of human existence. Over 3,000 years ago, God-fearing King David, for example, witnessed lawlessness among his own people, the Israelites. Under inspiration, he set forth excellent admonition as to how to maintain a proper course when seeing wrongdoers prosper.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">David urged: “Do not show yourself heated up because of the evildoers. Do not be envious of those doing unrighteousness. For like grass they will speedily wither, and like green new grass they will fade away.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979286/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 37:1, 2</a>) Yes, what really is to be gained by becoming unduly upset about the way lawless men seem to escape punishment? If we envy the wealth they get, what will that change? Nothing really, but we may well be making ourselves unhappy and discontented. So the wiser course is to keep in mind that the material prosperity of evildoers is but temporary. Even if justice does not catch up with them, they cannot extend their lifespan indefinitely. Because of the shortness of human life, the wicked are like grass that, when cut, quickly withers. They are like lush green grass that fades away when it dries up. As evildoers come to their finish, so does their ill-gotten gain.</p>

<strong>Learning to Live with the Unchangeable</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The same applies to one’s attitude toward world conditions, which are unchangeable as to getting any better. Should we be disturbed because of the increasing corruption in high places and the worsening violence and crime on city streets? The Bible gives good advice: “Do not show yourself heated up because of the evildoers.” Why not? Because in God’s due time they will be no more. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978201/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 37:1-13</a>) Until then a person can learn to live with such conditions by being extremely cautious, not venturing out into the streets alone late at night, valuing his life more <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>than the money he may have on his person, and so forth.</p>

<strong>Questions That Disturb You—What Should You Do?</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Accordingly, in applying a passage that has prophetic import, it is good to recognize these facts. For example, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972604/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 37:10</a>, David stated: “Just a little while longer, and the wicked one will be no more; and you will certainly give attention to his place, and he will not be.” For whose benefit was this written? Does it have application only in this “time of the end,” when wickedness will be destroyed forever? This would be some three thousand years after the psalm was written and was read by the people of Israel. Did these words mean nothing to those reading them except a promise for the distant future?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">No. These words concerning the wicked had a meaning and message for the people <em>then.</em> In fact, they found a fulfillment in David’s own time. It was David’s observation and experience that the wicked, though they seemed to flourish for a while, did not last long. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972604/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps 37 Verses 35, 36</a>) For this very reason he counseled, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972604/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps 37 verses one and two</a>, not to be heated up because of <span id="page500" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="500" data-before-text="500"></span>evildoers. So he was stating a principle of life. In David’s time the “earth,” that is, the portion of the earth assigned by God to Israel, was brought under peaceful domination by David, and during his son Solomon’s rule the people had peace from wicked enemies.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972604/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 37:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972604/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 1 Ki. 4:20,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972604/13/2" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 25</a>.</p>

<strong>Children, Do You Obey Jehovah?</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> You children have just begun to live, but from the taste of life you have had you can see that life is most desirable. It is something to hold on to with all your might. By being obedient to Jehovah it is possible to have life always, for it is written: “This is the promised thing that he himself promised us, the life everlasting.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962603/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 John 2:25</a>) But he has promised it only to those that love and obey him, not to those that disobey. He can no more be expected to give the gift of life to children <span id="page491" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="491" data-before-text="491"></span>that disobey him than can good parents be expected to give a promised gift to disobedient children. Instead of giving a gift the parents would punish disobedient children. Jehovah is not different. “He will render to each one according to his works: everlasting life to those who are seeking glory and honor and incorruptibleness by endurance in work that is good; however, for those who are contentious and who disobey the truth but obey unrighteousness there will be wrath and anger, tribulation and distress.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962603/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rom. 2:6-9</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Look at what happened to Adam and Eve because of their disobedience. They thought they could decide for themselves what was good and bad, with the result that they disobeyed God and brought suffering upon themselves and lost their lives. Think also about the people of Noah’s day, the people in the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and the rebellious ones in the nation of Israel. Disobedience to Jehovah was their downfall. There are good reasons, therefore, for obeying Jehovah.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>OBSTACLES TO OBEDIENCE</strong></p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">10. What attitude toward Scriptural restrictions could be an obstacle to obedience, and why is it wrong?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Because you children within the Christian organization see those outside it doing things that are forbidden to you, you may at times feel that the Scriptural restrictions on you are confining. You may be tempted to disregard them when you see that those outside are not struck down by lightning or swallowed up by the earth for doing what is Scripturally wrong. To conclude that you too can do what is wrong without harm to yourselves would be a serious mistake. Because wrongdoing is not punished immediately, that does not mean wrongdoers will not be punished. Notice what God’s Word says: “Because sentence against a bad work has not been executed speedily, that is why the heart of the sons of men has become fully set in them to do bad. But it will not turn out well at all with the wicked one, neither will he prolong his days.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962603/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Eccl. 8:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962603/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 13</a>) Another scripture says: “Do not be envious of those doing unrighteousness. For like grass they will speedily wither, and like green new grass they will fade away.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962603/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 37:1, 2</a>) The Scriptural restrictions God has placed upon you form certain bounds that it would be detrimental for you to exceed. Since he has given you immense freedom within those bounds or limits, it is a mistake to think they are confining. Such a view is an obstacle to obedience.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">11, 12. (a) What force constantly pulls children toward disobedience to God, and how do dedicated parents combat it? (b) Why should companionship with children that do not love God be avoided?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Because you must, for the present, live in a wicked world you cannot avoid contact with children and adults that violate God’s laws and thus go beyond the legal bounds he has placed upon mankind. This bad influence is another obstacle to your obedience to Jehovah. It is a force that constantly tugs at you, trying to turn you away from doing what is Scripturally right. The older you become the more frequent will be your contact with bad influence. Since your parents cannot prevent such contacts, they have tried to build up your defenses, not only by teaching you God’s Word and its high moral standards and righteous laws, but by taking you to congregational meetings and by encouraging you to seek companions within the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> It is with good reason that the Bible says: “Bad associations spoil useful habits.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962603/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:33</a>) When children seek as companions other children that have no love for God or respect for what is Scripturally right, they are inviting trouble for themselves. That bad influence will not help them to stay within the Scriptural bounds that are a protection to their lives. <span id="page492" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="492" data-before-text="492"></span>They need as companions children that want to obey Jehovah, not disobey him.</p>

Why should we trust in Jehovah?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> “Trust in Jehovah and do good,” the psalmist urges us. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003883/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 37:3a</a>) When we are beset by anxieties or even by doubts, our confidence needs to be firmly placed in Jehovah. He is the One who offers complete spiritual security. “Anyone dwelling in the secret place of the Most High,” wrote Moses, “will procure himself lodging under the very shadow of the Almighty One.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003883/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 91:1</a>) When unsettled by the increase of lawlessness in this system of things, we need all the more to lean on Jehovah. If we sprain an ankle, we are pleased to have the arm of a friend for support. Likewise, when we endeavor to walk in faithfulness, we need Jehovah’s support.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003883/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Isaiah 50:10</a>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 8.

In the face of increasing wickedness, we need to be fully occupied with helping others. “Do not forget the doing of good and the sharing of things with others,” said the apostle Paul, “for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.” The greatest “good” we can do is to share with others the glorious good news of God’s Kingdom. Our public preaching truly is “a sacrifice of praise.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003883/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:15, 16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003883/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Galatians 6:10</a>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 9.

During Solomon’s reign its boundaries reached from Dan in the north to Beer-sheba in the south. This was Israel’s residence. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003883/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Kings 4:25</a>) Today, wherever we live on earth, we look forward to the time when the whole planet will become a paradise in the new world of righteousness. <span id="page11" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>In the meantime, we reside in spiritual security.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003883/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:13, 14</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">10.

The inspired proverb reminds us: “A man of faithful acts will get many blessings.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003883/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Proverbs 28:20</a>) Our faithfully persevering in preaching the good news wherever we live and to whomever we can certainly brings rewards from Jehovah. For example, Frank and his wife, Rose, took up a pioneer assignment 40 years ago in a town in northern Scotland. The few who had shown interest in the truth there had drifted away. Undeterred, this pioneer couple set about the work of preaching and making disciples. Now there is a flourishing congregation in that town. This couple’s faithfulness has truly had Jehovah’s blessing. “The greatest blessing,” Frank humbly explains, “is simply that we are still in the truth and are useful to Jehovah.” Yes, when we “deal with faithfulness,” we receive and appreciate many blessings.</p>

<strong>Are You Disturbed?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Another thing that will prevent us from envying wrongdoers is our recognizing that the Most High can and will correct matters in his due time. The psalmist continued: “Trust in Jehovah and do good; reside in the earth, and deal with faithfulness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979286/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 37:3</a>) Confident that Jehovah God will right matters, we should continue to do what is good and not let the seeming success of lawless persons cause us to deviate from a right course. The psalmist also recommends that we “reside in the earth” (evidently referring here to the land that was David’s home and, hence, in our case, meaning the land <span id="page23" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>of our residence). While continuing to live among lawless persons, we should trust in divine help and prove ourselves faithful or upright in all that we do.</p>

Rather than being preoccupied with our own situation, difficult though it may be, we make Jehovah our concern. One way to do this is to take time to read his Word. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003883/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Psalm 1:1, 2</a>) Does your Bible reading bring you delight? It will when you read with the goal of learning more about Jehovah. Why not pause after reading a portion and ask yourself, ‘What did this passage teach me about Jehovah?’ You may find it helpful to have a notebook or some paper handy when you read the Bible. Each time you stop to reflect on the meaning of what you have read, jot down a phrase that reminds you of one of God’s endearing attributes. In another psalm, David sang: “Let the sayings of my mouth and the meditation of my heart become pleasurable before you, O Jehovah my Rock and my Redeemer.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003883/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Psalm 19:14</a>) This concentrated attention to God’s Word on our part is “pleasurable” to Jehovah and delightful to us.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> How can we derive happiness from our study and meditation?

Further, if we know he hears us respecting whatever we are asking, we know we are to have the things asked since we have asked them of him.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003883/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 John 5:14, 15</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">13.

We eagerly look forward to seeing what further freedom may develop before the end of this system. Many of Jehovah’s servants living in western countries have a vigorous share in preaching to students, refugees, and others who temporarily reside in the west and enjoy freedom of worship. It is our earnest wish that as these individuals return home, they continue to let the light of truth shine in even apparently impenetrable darkness.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003883/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Matthew 5:14-16</a>.</p>

Why not speak to ones you know and ask how Jehovah has helped them? You will undoubtedly hear many experiences showing that even during difficult times, Jehovah’s hand is never short. He always provides life’s necessities.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003883/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 37:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2003883/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> Matthew 6:25-34</a>.</p>

<strong>Is God Real to You?</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">The psalmist urges: “Roll upon Jehovah your way, and rely upon him, and he himself will act.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998685/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 37:5</a>) Never fail to roll upon God whatever burdens or cares you have. Always look to him for help and guidance. If you prayerfully rely on Jehovah God and always trust him implicitly, you will feel secure because you know that he will not fail to act in your behalf. Are you confident when approaching Jehovah with your personal concerns? You will be—if God is real to you.</p>

<strong>Can You Wait?</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The principle that waiting enhances the value of something can be applied to marriage. <span id="page644" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="644" data-before-text="644"></span>Those persons who have a long engagement are more likely to have a happier marriage than those who do not. Marriage will mean more to them. How can a couple who have been acquainted with each other for only a few hours, a few days or even a few months have the same regard for their marriage as the couple that have known each other at least a year or two?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Hasty marriages are just another way in which some adults manifest their immaturity. They believe a decision to marry must be carried out at once. They even hate to wait the few days required by law in some places. But as a child quickly loses interest in the toy it cried for, so do these people lose interest in the marriage they jumped into. More often than not they soon want a divorce.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>A DIVINE REQUIREMENT</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">It may seem strange to say that waiting is a divine requirement, but yet it is. For ages God has required humans to wait. In the days of Noah He promised the destruction of that wicked world 120 years in advance. Even though that promised day seemed a long way off Noah waited for it. Time was not standing still. It continued to move at its unchanging pace, and finally the fateful day arrived.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">After the Flood time continued to move on, with many other occasions arising when God required people to wait for something. Abraham was required to wait until he was one hundred years old before being blessed with a son from his wife Sarah. Abraham’s seed had to wait over four hundred years before receiving the land promised by God. After their land was desolated the Israelites had to wait seventy years before receiving their promised return to Jerusalem. And after the rebuilding of Jerusalem’s walls the people had to wait 483 years for the coming of the Messiah. But these are only a few of many instances in which God required men to wait for what he had promised. He knew that waiting is beneficial for man.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">There are divine promises that we today are expected to wait for. Some of them are the coming destruction of the present world or system of things, the righteous rule of earth by God’s kingdom, eternal peace, a paradise earth, the resurrecting of the dead and the gift of eternal life. These are dependable promises that will be fulfilled at God’s appointed time in his righteous new world. To those who think God slow his Word states: “Jehovah is not slow respecting his promise, as some people consider slowness, but he is patient with you because he does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance. Yet Jehovah’s day will come.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957800/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:9, 10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957800/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 13</a>) By waiting our integrity and trust in God is tested, our desire is increased, our need is more firmly impressed upon us.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The end of the present system of things that was once far off in the stream of time has now drawn near. We are now in its last days. This generation will see its destruction at the battle of Armageddon. God’s long-promised new world will then be ushered in. The blessings that world will bring are worth waiting for.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">What about you? Can you wait? Can you “quietly wait for the salvation of Jehovah,” as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957800/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Lamentations 3:26</a> (<em>AS</em>) tells us? Can you “rest in Jehovah, and wait patiently for him,” as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957800/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 37:7</a> (<em>AS</em>) admonishes us? Or do you have the mark of immaturity by being unable to wait for what God has promised? The apostle Paul recommends endurance in waiting for these things we hope for. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957800/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rom. 8:25</a>) Can you show that endurance? There has been no other time in history when the ability to wait has meant more than it does today. Your very life depends upon it.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"></p>

<strong>“He Gives Power to the Tired One”</strong><br/><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>14.</strong><strong> What spiritual and physical benefits can we derive by ‘letting go’ of anger?</strong></p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> Here is another example. Few people have been treated as badly as David was. Still, that friend of God did not allow resentment to gnaw away at him. Rather, he wrote: <em>“Let go</em> of anger and abandon rage; do not become upset and turn to doing evil.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018242/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ps. 37:8</a>) The most important reason to “let go” of anger is to imitate Jehovah, who “has not dealt with us according to our sins.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018242/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 103:10</a>) But there are also practical benefits to ‘letting go’ of anger. Anger can cause such physical problems as high blood pressure and respiratory trouble. It can affect the liver and the pancreas, and it can cause digestive problems. When we are angry, we do not always think clearly. And at times a fit of anger may be followed by a prolonged period of depression. On the other hand, “a calm heart gives life to the body,” says the Bible. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018242/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Prov. 14:30</a>) How, then, can we deal with hurt feelings and gain our brother? We can do so successfully by applying the Bible’s wise advice.</p>

<strong>Keeping Anger Under Control</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>“Let Anger Alone”</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The idea of controlling your anger is beautifully expressed by the Bible psalmist David. He said: “Let anger alone and leave rage; do not show yourself heated up only to do evil.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102012083/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 37:8</a>) The way to avoid saying or doing something that you may later regret is to keep from getting “heated up” in the first place. Of course, that is much easier said than done. But it can be done! Let’s consider three ways that you can get your anger under control.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>Reduce Anger’s Intensity</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">To reduce anger, slow down and relax. Try to avoid saying the first thing that comes to mind. If you feel yourself getting overly excited and feel you are in danger of losing control of your emotions, apply the Bible’s counsel: “The beginning of contention is as one letting out waters; so before the quarrel has burst forth, take your leave.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102012083/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:14</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">That is what helped a man named Jack to gain mastery over his violent temper. Jack’s father was given to bouts of drunkenness and anger. While growing up, Jack developed a violent personality as well. He says: “When I became angry, I would feel as if I was on fire. And I would lash out violently with words and fists.”</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">However, things started to change when Jack began a study of the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses. He came to understand that with God’s help, he could change and learn to control his anger. And change he did! Jack relates how he reacted when a fellow workmate swore at him in anger: “I felt the surge of anger blaze through my body. My first inclination was to grab him and throw him down.”</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">What eventually helped Jack to remain calm? He explains: “I remember praying, ‘Please Jehovah, help me to calm down!’ Then, for the very first time, I felt a peace come over me, and I was able to walk away.” Jack continued his study of the Bible. He spent much time in prayer and meditation on such scriptures as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102012083/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 26:20</a>, which states: “Where there is no wood the fire goes out.” Afterward, Jack was finally able to gain mastery over his anger.</p>

<strong>What Is Provoking the Age of Rage?</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Bertram Rothschild, writing in the journal <em>The Humanist,</em> states: “Anger . . . is primarily one’s personal responsibility. The reasons to become angry exist in our heads. . . . The few times anger worked for you pale in comparison to the multitude of times it made things worse. It is far better not to produce the anger than to experience it.”</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102002089/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 37:8</strong></a> “Let anger alone and leave rage; do not show yourself heated up only to do evil.”</p>

Some, however, thrust themselves into such a situation in a figurative way. How so? The 17th-century English author Thomas Fuller said: “Act nothing in a furious passion. It’s putting to sea in a storm.”</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Pursuing a course of action while in a state of unrestrained anger can have tragic consequences. This is borne out by an event recorded in the Bible. Simeon and Levi, sons of the ancient patriarch Jacob, reacted to the violation of their sister Dinah by storming forth in a vengeful rage.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983603/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 37:8</a>) For years, popular human wisdom disagreed. “Let it all hang out,” was the motto. “It’s healthy to vent anger,” prescribed many psychotherapists. But now scientific research is highlighting the value of controlling anger. For example, social psychologist Carol Tavris states in her new book <em>Anger: The Misunderstood Emotion:</em> “Expressing anger makes you angrier, solidifies an angry attitude, and establishes a hostile habit.” Therefore, she advises: “If you keep quiet about momentary irritations and distract yourself with pleasant activity until your fury simmers down, chances are that you will feel better, and feel better faster, than if you let yourself go in a shouting match.”</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Duke University Medical Center, after a seven-year study, concluded that people who anger more quickly may die sooner than those who do not. Excessive hostility is linked to heart damage as much as smoking and high blood pressure are, their studies suggest. Therefore, since statistics show little evidence that spouting anger like an exploding Roman candle is healthy, would it not be better to heed what <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983603/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 14:29</a> says: “If you stay calm, you are wise, but if you have a hot temper, you only show how stupid you are”?​—<em>Today’s English Version.</em></p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sn">◆ A housewife in Okazaki City, Japan, recently displayed an explosive temper, with tragic results. As a subcontractor for a fireworks company, she made and packaged fireworks in her home. Now, her home and family are no more. As she explained from her hospital bed: “I was doing my part-time fireworks job in a room off the kitchen when my husband and I got to quarreling. I picked up a large box of kitchen matches and threw it at him. Somehow they ignited and fell into an apple box of fireworks I had made.” A tremendous explosion resulted, in which she saw her husband and five-year-old son engulfed in flames. The temper explosion also cost the lives of her three daughters, aged eight to 13. How wise and true is the Bible’s counsel: “Let anger alone and leave rage; do not show yourself heated up only to do evil”!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101978171/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 37:8</a>.</p>

The experience of <span id="page5" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>a man in the Fiji Islands​—a person who violently opposed his wife’s studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses—​gives an affirmative answer.

He said:</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="si">“I was in great trepidation as to what reception the Witnesses would give me due to my treating them so shamefully before. This struck me: These people were kind to me without resentment. . . . the brother whom I had treated the worst of all offered me [a personal Bible study] and I accepted.

Yet under these very circumstances the Bible urges: “Let anger alone and leave rage; do not show yourself heated up only to do evil.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975801/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 37:8</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">There is wisdom in ‘letting anger alone.’ Anger can be a very damaging emotion. When a person gives vent to anger, his blood pressure rises and the pulse and respiratory rates increase. When anger passes, generally everything returns to normal. But repeated outbursts of anger are obviously hard on the body. On the other hand, a person may be given to anger but keep things ‘bottled up’ inside himself. Outwardly he may seem very calm, but inwardly he may be in a state of turmoil. When that is the case, he may begin to experience bodily ailments and still deny that emotional disturbances are the cause of his affliction. Anger can thus contribute toward or aggravate a host of ills, including cardiovascular disorders, respiratory ailments, skin diseases, dental and digestive troubles, and headaches.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Besides physical problems, anger can lead to great spiritual harm by causing a person to violate God’s law. Calling attention to this danger, the Bible says: “He that is quick to anger will commit foolishness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975801/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 14:17</a>) “As a city broken through, without a wall, is the man that has no restraint for his spirit.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975801/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Prov. 25:28</a>) In ancient times a city with a breached wall was defenseless, open to the invasion of enemy forces. Similarly, the person given to anger makes himself vulnerable to the invasion of improper thoughts, leading to foolish acts.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Just how dangerous anger can be is illustrated in the case of Cain. When he saw God’s favor manifested upon his brother Abel, but not upon himself, Cain became enraged. Though given divine warning, Cain yielded to wrong thinking and murdered his brother.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975801/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 4:4-8</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>HOW ANGER CAN BE CONTROLLED</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Certainly none of us would want to become like Cain, either in attitude or action. So we should strive to keep anger in check. This does not mean mere outward control of emotions. Control of anger starts with one’s being able to respond reasonably​—without undue external or internal disturbance—​when confronted with unfavorable situations.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Take the case of a person who is corrected because of being guilty of some neglect or wrong. If he lets pride get in the way, he may become very angry about this. That is what happened to Judean King Asa. When corrected by the prophet Hanani for having shown a lack of faith, Asa became very angry. He put Hanani in “the house of the stocks” and also began oppressing others of his subjects. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975801/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Chron. 16:7-10</a>) Instead of giving vent to anger, Asa should have taken the reasonable view of the situation. He should have kept in mind that Hanani was speaking, not of his <span id="page648" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="648" data-before-text="648"></span>own originality, but as Jehovah’s messenger. It was a time for Asa to acknowledge his wrong and to express sincere repentance. Humility could have helped Asa to keep anger in check. So if we are going to heed the Bible’s counsel to “let anger alone,” we, too, need to cultivate humility.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">At times people do and say things to us that are entirely uncalled for. This may upset us very much. What can we do? We do well to consider the motivations of those disturbing us.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Are they deliberately trying to get us angry? If so, we would only be playing into their hands if we were to give way to a fit of anger. Far better it would be to ignore cutting remarks or actions intended to provoke us. The counsel of Jesus Christ would then apply: “Whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other also to him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975801/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 5:39</a>) A slap on the cheek would not be intended to injure physically but to insult or provoke a fight. Hence, by reacting in kind, a person would only worsen the situation.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">But what if the things disturbing us were not said or done with any intent to incite us to anger? In that case, we might reason with ourselves. Are we perhaps making an issue over trifles? Might it not be more loving just to cover over the minor offense?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">On the other hand, we may have real basis for being incensed. But should not love move us to want to help the individual involved to avoid giving offense in the future? Christians are counseled: “Be wrathful, and yet do not sin; let the sun not set with you in a provoked state, neither allow place for the Devil.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975801/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Eph. 4:26, 27</a>) If our main objective is to help the person who wronged us to overcome his weakness, we will not harbor anger against him and go beyond the bounds of proper indignation. We will not leave an opening for the Devil to take advantage of our provoked state and incite us to retaliate.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Of course, there are things about which we can do very little. In this imperfect system, many injustices occur. To get all upset about these, perhaps to the point of ruining our health, would certainly benefit no one. Rather, we can take comfort in the Bible-based assurance that Jehovah God, by means of his kingdom, will end all injustices and oppression. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975801/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Dan. 2:44</a>) Meanwhile we can depend upon him to sustain us so as to endure any trial we might face.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975801/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Jas. 1:2-5</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Besides having a balanced view of things that can give rise to anger, our avoiding the company of those given to anger will aid us to maintain self-control. The Bible admonishes: “Do not have companionship with anyone given to anger; and with a man having fits of rage you must not enter in, that you may not get familiar with his paths and certainly take a snare for your soul.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975801/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Prov. 22:24, 25</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">On the other hand, associating with persons of calm and even temper will surely have a wholesome effect on us. Such persons do not incite others to anger by cutting remarks. Their mildness has tremendous power in putting an end to bitter disputing and overcoming stiff opposition. In their case the words of the Bible prove true: “An answer, when mild, turns away rage.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975801/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Prov. 15:1</a>) “One that is slow to anger quiets down quarreling.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975801/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Prov. 15:18</a>) “A mild tongue itself can break a bone.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975801/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Prov. 25:15</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Truly there are sound reasons for ‘letting anger alone.’ We are benefited both physically and spiritually. May we, therefore, strive not to give occasion for others to get angry, and may we ourselves watch our associations, cultivate humility and continue to take a reasonable, balanced view toward what fellow humans may do or say.</p>

<strong>Being Slow About Wrath</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Since man’s anger does not bear fruit that is acceptable to God, overseers of God’s people must set the right example. They must be slow about wrath, slow to take offense. The quick temper is a sign of weakness. It is the kind of weakness that disqualifies one from overseer privileges in God’s congregation. One could hardly be trusted as an overseer of Jehovah’s flock if such a person had not learned how to rule his temper. “An overseer must be free from accusation as God’s steward, not self-willed, not prone to wrath, . . . [but] self-controlled.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960163/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Titus 1:7, 8</a>) If an overseer were prone to wrath, he could bring trouble and discord upon a congregation, even ruin. So God’s Word disqualifies <span id="page147" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="147" data-before-text="147"></span>those persons who are quick about wrath; they are too weak to be overseers!</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">17, 18.

This is false. What if some worldly psychiatrists believe that it may be good to blow off steam in this manner? Christians should let God’s Word direct their conduct, not the theories of men. Jehovah’s Word has no good thing to say about those who give full vent to anger, nor does it say that such actions accomplish any good.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Even looking at it from the physical standpoint, there is no good arising from fits of anger. Man’s Creator says: “A heart that is joyful does good as a curer, but a spirit that is stricken makes the bones dry.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960163/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Prov. 17:22</a>) A person stricken by the emotions of anger and resentment and revenge is only injuring himself. More and more doctors are learning of this injuriousness. In <em>Your Body and Your Mind</em> Dr. Frank G. Slaughter writes: “Studies by Drs. B. Mittelman and H. G. Wolff showed that in patients with ulcer, resentment and anger caused increased secretion of highly acid gastric juice, marked increase in stomach contractions, and a generalized increase in the flow of blood through the mucous membrane lining of the stomach and duodenum. . . . Since these changes are usually associated with a heightening of ulcer symptoms, resentment thus actually caused acute pain. . . . stomach mucous membrane is delicate and easily injured, and normally is covered with a protective layer of mucus, keeping the stomach lining from being digested by the hydrochloric acid which continually bathes it. In studies of the normal stomach, much of the mucus layer was seen to be washed away when increased acid secretion occurred from emotional causes. Also small hemorrhages and actual breaks in the mucous membrane lining of the stomach and duodenum were common. We have here, then, all the necessary factors to bring about ulceration; if repeated often enough they undoubtedly do just that.”</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">19. What wisdom have heart experts found in the Bible command: “Let anger alone and leave rage”?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> But the effects of anger and rage can be far more serious than the harm that may be done to one’s stomach. “A calm heart is the life of the fleshly organism,” says the Bible. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960163/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Prov. 14:30</a>) Recently seven heart experts offered advice on how to avoid sudden heart attacks. They advised a calm heart, the avoiding of anger and rage. One of the doctors, Dr. Harry Gold, professor of Clinical Pharmacology at the Cornell University Medical College, said, as reported by the New York <em>Times</em> of December 1, 1955: “We must convince our patients that in rage and anger, when they are endeavoring to kill someone else, they are actually accomplishing just the opposite—they are killing themselves.” These heart experts who warned against anger and rage may have had in mind the case of the famous Scottish surgeon, John Hunter. He had a heart attack that nearly killed him. Being a doctor, he knew the importance of emotions in affecting the heart. When he recovered, he said: “My life is in the hands of any rascal who chooses to annoy and tease me!” He was unable to keep his temper under control, however, and one day he lost control in a fit of rage when contradicted by another doctor; he had a heart attack that killed him. How wise it is to follow the counsel of man’s Creator: “Let anger alone and leave rage; do not show yourself heated up only to do evil”!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960163/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ps. 37:8</a>.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">20.

Temper explosions do not cleanse the atmosphere; they poison it. The poison may contaminate others, so Jehovah warns: “Do not have companionship with anyone given to anger, and with a man having fits of rage you must not enter in, that you may not get familiar with his paths and certainly take a snare for your soul.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960163/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Prov. 22:24, 25</a>.</p>

<strong>Are You Disturbed?</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">But before such vindication comes, what should we do? The psalmist answers: “Keep silent before Jehovah and wait longingly for him. Do not show yourself heated up at anyone making his way successful, at the man carrying out his ideas. Let anger alone and leave rage; do not show yourself heated up only to do evil. For evildoers themselves will be cut off, but those hoping in Jehovah are the ones that will possess the earth.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979286/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 37:7-9</a>.</p>

The mountains, hills, stream beds and valleys of the land of Judah are cleansed of all the polluting idolatry and idolatrous spiritual fornicators by being left a desolation. Why, the desolate waste is worse than the wilderness that stretches “toward Diblah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971007/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ezekiel 6:14</a>, <em>NW; LXX; Vg; Aramaic; Syriac; Arabic</em>) By lying desolate for seventy years, without man or domestic animal, the land would be considered cleansed and rested up from its pollution, according to the decree of Jehovah. He was obliged to vindicate his unbreakable word. He had to uphold the reality of his own Godship. Said he, in connection with those covenant breakers, those spiritual fornicators: “And they will have to know that I am Jehovah.”</p><p id="p98" data-pid="98" class="qu">21.

Christendom will be uprooted from where she has been deeply entrenched for sixteen centuries. Her realm will be desolated, without her hypocritically Christian clergymen and church institutions. Men will look at the place where she used to exist and to flourish, and she will be no more. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971007/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 37:9, 10</a>) Like her ancient type, she will have to feel the full force of the words of the God whom she has misrepresented: “And they will have to know that I am Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971007/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ezekiel 6:14</a>) His pure worship will survive Christendom’s destruction everlastingly from the earth.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong>THE END OF HER IS NEAR!</strong></p><p id="p99" data-pid="99" class="qu">22.

The great oppression and the blinding and misguidance of the people that have resulted from such false religion keep the lovers of truth and righteousness from feeling sorry. To the contrary, they rejoice at the clearing of the way for the prevalence of pure and true worship throughout the whole earth. The approaching end of Christendom does not fill these with sorrow or dismay.

<strong>Will Peace Ever Come to Earth?</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">The sad record, preserved for us in the only reliable history of those ancient times, the Bible, shows that Adam and Eve, father and mother of the entire human family, broke the bounds set for them. <span id="page359" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="359" data-before-text="359"></span>They wanted what they were not entitled to. They desired total independence from God and his laws, demonstrating this by breaking the law. As a result, the penalty was executed—they would die in due course of time. No longer would their bodies be maintained in perfection, but they would begin to degenerate, until death overtook them. Their minds would also degenerate. Not being guided by God and his ways, they would come into conflict with others, with the animal realm, and even with their own bodies. Casting off God, they began man’s downward plunge as surely as a stone moves downward when thrown from a high place.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965441/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 3:17-19</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Not only did degeneration and death now enter the human family, but so did peace breaking. Men began to contend with men. Hatred and suspicion, violence and bloodshed engulfed human society, until, more than 1,600 years later, the condition was as the Bible describes: “The earth came to be ruined in the sight of the true God and the earth became filled with violence. So God saw the earth and, look! it was ruined, because all flesh had ruined its way on the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965441/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 6:11, 12</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">A peaceful world turned quickly into an unpeaceful one. But none of this could be blamed on God. It resulted when man sought independence from God. And since God made man a free moral agent, He would permit man this experiment, temporarily. Observe the results! Would you say that the human experience over the last 6,000 years has been a peaceful, happy, successful one? Of course not! Pain, misery, sadness, tears and death have been man’s lot down through the centuries, until today thinking persons wonder about the very survival of humanity as a whole!</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="ss"><strong>WILL PEACE RETURN?</strong></p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">God has tolerated man’s rebellious course, but only for a temporary season. As a loving God, he could not permit his earth and creatures on it to be abused forever. That is why wickedness will not go on much longer. God, through his prophets and his written Word, has repeatedly warned that the disobedience of men and nations would come to an end.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965441/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Thess. 1:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965441/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Heb. 5:9</a>.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">The insane plunge of nations toward nuclear annihilation will be cut short by God. He has promised: “Evildoers themselves will be cut off . . . And just a little while longer, and the wicked one will be no more; and you will certainly give attention to his place, and he will not be. But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, and they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965441/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 37:9-11</a>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">God has tolerated man’s experiment in independence from Him long enough so that no one can accuse God of not having given men the chance to work out their own solutions. They have had that chance. They have failed miserably. Therefore, as Bible prophecy clearly shows, it is now time for God to step in, squash wickedness and take over complete control of men’s affairs. Jesus Christ himself, as did the apostle Paul, foretold that the distress of nations so evident today would be an evidence that we are indeed in the “last days” of this world. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965441/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 24:3-14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965441/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 2 Tim. 3:1-5</a>) Hence, God’s anger against this chaotic world will be expressed soon, as his favor will be extended to those who love him. As it is written concerning our day: “Your own wrath came, and the appointed time for the dead to be judged, and to give their reward to your slaves the prophets and to the holy ones and to those fearing your name, the small and the great, and to bring to ruin those ruining the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965441/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Rev. 11:18</a>.</p>

Though Buddha, Brahma, Confucius and Christendom’s triune “God” had not yet appeared to add confusion to the religious scene, there were a host of gods to be worshiped in the religions of Philistia, Assyria, Babylon and other nations surrounding Israel. As they went out to war, these nations carried images of their gods on staves, from which also fluttered their national pendants. Some of these gods, such as Molech of Ammon and Chemosh of Moab, were known as “fire gods,” and exacted human sacrifices. Baal of Peor was worshiped with lewd sex rites. David not only maintained separateness from this cruel, immoral world of confused religionists, but he removed their contaminating influence by driving them right out from the God-given land of Israel.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Deut. 11:22-25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2 Sam. 8:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 14</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 5.

The gods of worldly nations had left no such record; indeed, they had accomplished nothing worthy of praise or record. It is Jehovah alone, “the grand King” and who is “great and very much to be praised,” that has caused to be written down the record of his wondrous works and eternal purposes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ex. 17:14</a>) David exulted, not only in the divine promise of an everlasting Kingdom, but in all the other glorious prophecies looking down to our day.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 6.

It is the day to which David looked forward with joy. It is the day in which prophecy upon prophecy is coming to grand fulfillment. In the modern year of 1914 Jehovah established the everlasting kingdom of heaven in the hands of one greater than David, his Son Jesus Christ. In 1919 he brought forth on this earth a New World society to preach “this good news of the kingdom . . . for the purpose of a witness to all the nations.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>) As the nucleus of this New World society, the faithful remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses serve “as signs and as wonders,” to be seen by all men. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa. 8:18</a>) And now, in their hundreds of thousands, men of good will, “the precious things of all nations,” are flocking to the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses, for they see in it a peace and joy that contrast sharply with the old world’s divisions and hatreds.

After the Flood, wicked people once again made life miserable for everyone. Soon, though, God will bring an end to wickedness. As the psalmist said: “The wicked will be no more.” God will put an end to wickedness by means of his Kingdom​—a world government that rules from heaven over a righteous human society.</p>

During that time, he and his 144,000 corulers will help humans on earth to become perfect and sinless. By the end of that period, the earth will be turned into a beautiful paradise, filled with happy people who benefit from obeying Jehovah’s laws.

Let’s go back to that psalm. This time, we’ll read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012569/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">verses 10 and 11</a>.

Looking at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012569/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">verse 11</a>, where will “the meek ones,” or good people, live?</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sb"><strong>Robert:</strong> It says they “will possess the earth.” However, I feel that this verse applies right now; after all, good people live on earth today.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="sb"><strong>Marcus:</strong> That’s true. However, notice that the verse also says that good people will enjoy an “abundance of peace.” We don’t see much peace in the world today, do we?</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sb"><strong>Robert:</strong> No, we don’t.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="sb"><strong>Marcus:</strong> So how will the promise be fulfilled? Maybe I could use this comparison: Imagine you own an apartment building. Some of the tenants are good people​—they take care of their apartment and try to be good neighbors. You’re glad to rent an apartment to them. But others are bad tenants; they damage the property and make life miserable for their neighbors around them. Now, if those bad tenants refused to clean up their act, what would you do?</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sb"><strong>Robert:</strong> I’d evict them.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sb"><strong>Marcus:</strong> That’s exactly what God is going to do to the bad people around us today. Look again at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012569/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">verse 10</a>. It says: “The wicked one will be no more.” In other words, God will “evict” the people who make trouble for others. Then good people will be able to enjoy life on earth in peace. I realize that this idea of good people living forever on earth may be somewhat different from what you’ve been taught in the past.</p>

Whatever kind of government or authority has been devised by man has failed miserably.

<strong>Removing the Stain of Sin</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Finally, those who demonstrate that, in spite of their imperfect flesh, they truly wish to escape slavery to sin have an even more wonderful prospect. They are promised the opportunity of living in a new order where sin will be a thing of the past. It will have been completely eliminated from God’s creation. At that time, “they will not do any harm or cause any ruin in all my holy mountain; because the earth will certainly be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters are covering the very sea.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980803/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Isa. 11:9</a>) The inspired psalmist promises us that “the wicked [or, deliberately sinful] one will be no more.” On the contrary, “the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, and they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980803/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ps. 37:10, 11</a>.</p>

<strong>Questions That Disturb You—What Should You Do?</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Accordingly, in applying a passage that has prophetic import, it is good to recognize these facts. For example, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972604/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 37:10</a>, David stated: “Just a little while longer, and the wicked one will be no more; and you will certainly give attention to his place, and he will not be.” For whose benefit was this written? Does it have application only in this “time of the end,” when wickedness will be destroyed forever?

<strong>How We Know that God Will Put an End to Wickedness</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">True, we are living in days when wickedness is rampant and evildoers multiply, but Jehovah’s promises point to a complete end of wickedness. To the meek ones, for example, he gives this strong assurance: “Do not show yourself heated up because of the evildoers. Do not be envious of those doing unrighteousness. For evildoers themselves will be cut off, but those hoping in Jehovah are the ones that will possess the earth. And just a little while longer, and the wicked one will be no more; and you will certainly give attention to his place, and he will not be. But the <span id="page134" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="134" data-before-text="134"></span>meek ones themselves will possess the earth, and they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967161/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 37:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967161/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 9-11</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Notice how thorough the cleanup that Jehovah will conduct on this earth. Even though the meek make diligent search they will not be able to find even one wicked person to mar the happy and tranquil scene. Gone will be the wicked, but the meek will survive.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Another promise of God that he will ease righteously disposed persons of the terrible burden of living indefinitely among the wicked was expressed by the patriarch Enoch. So realistic was the vision that God granted him, he was moved to exclaim about its future fulfillment: “Look! Jehovah came with his holy myriads, to execute judgment against all, and to convict all the ungodly concerning all their ungodly deeds that they did in an ungodly way, and concerning all the shocking things that ungodly sinners spoke against him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967161/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jude 14, 15</a>) The magnitude of that final execution work is indicated by the fact that myriads of angels are involved and by the fact that <em>“all</em> the ungodly” are to have execution visited upon them.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Still another promise that points unmistakably to the end of the wicked on an international scale was voiced by God’s prophet Zephaniah: “‘Keep yourselves in expectation of me,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘till the day of my rising up to the booty, for my judicial decision is to gather nations, for me to collect together kingdoms, in order to pour out upon them my denunciation, all my burning anger; for by the fire of my zeal all the earth will be devoured.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967161/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Zeph. 3:8</a>) At the same time God offers protection and survival for those meek ones of all nations who seek him and his ways of righteousness.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967161/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Zeph. 2:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">That Jehovah and his appointed Executioner, Christ Jesus, will also strike directly at the root of all wickedness is made certain by the words of Jesus in his illustration about the symbolic sheep and goats: “Then he will say, in turn, to those on his left, ‘Be on your way from me, you who have been cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his angels.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967161/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 25:41</a>) Annihilation, represented by “everlasting fire,” is the destiny of the beginner and leader in all wickedness, for the apostle John so describes the action in the prophetic vision given him by God: “The Devil who was misleading [men] was hurled into the lake of fire and sulphur.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967161/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rev. 20:10</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Thus the promises of God furnish ample basis for anticipating an end of all wickedness, and the putting out of action of the very leader in evildoing.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>THE PATTERN OF ACTION GOD FOLLOWS</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">In addition to these and many other promises to rid the universe of wicked ones, the pattern of action God has followed in his past dealings with evildoers offers some guide to us on how he will deal with them now. Consider, for example, the conditions that developed in the days of Noah. Angel sons of God forsook their proper places in heaven, materialized as men and mated with the beautiful daughters of men to produce a hybrid race of giants or bullies. An era of violence and immorality resulted. The sacred Record tells that “Jehovah saw that the badness of man was abundant in the earth and every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only bad all the time.” And what was God’s determination? “I am going to wipe men whom I have created off the surface of the ground.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967161/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gen. 6:1-7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967161/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 2 Pet. 2:5</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">As Noah resolutely built the ark for the saving of his family, we can imagine the shouts of ridicule and derision of the multitude: <span id="page135" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="135" data-before-text="135"></span>‘It will never come in our day, Noah. You are wasting your time.’ But the ark came to its completion, its precious cargo was loaded and the door was shut. Then came the downpour. People rushed for shelter. The water level mounted steadily hour after hour, day after day. The people fled to higher ground, frantic, disorganized. Mountains were transformed into islands as the rising waters separated families. People on the highest mountains could hear the cries and shrieks of trapped multitudes as the lower heights became engulfed by swirling waters. The crazed scramble of crowds to occupy the topmost peaks was attended by great loss of life. Eventually, not one peak was left, and the only sound​—the swish of waters piled high above the tallest mountains. The last vain shouts for help were silenced.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967161/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Gen. 7:17-24</a>.</p>

What should you do about them?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">TIME is running out! Running out for what? Running out for the present generation, for the present wicked system of things, for the way things are being done today. In other words, time is running out for the rule of this planet by selfishness, wickedness, injustice and violence. Why can we be certain of this?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">We can be certain of it because the Creator, Jehovah God, is a just, wise and loving God. Although he has seen fit to tolerate these unrighteous conditions for more than 4,000 years, he will not always tolerate them, for “there is an appointed time, even a time for every affair under the heavens.” There is a time for him to tolerate such conditions and a time for him to put an end to them, and that time will be soon, even as we read: “Just a little while longer, and the wicked one will be no more.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966401/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966401/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ps. 37:10</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">What will that mean? It will mean a cataclysm as destructive as the global flood of Noah’s day, concerning which the apostle Peter wrote: “By the same word the heavens and the earth that are now are stored up for fire and are being reserved to the day of judgment and of destruction of the ungodly men.” That will mean the end of the world empire of false religion, known as “Babylon the great” in the Scriptures, and the end of all its supporters. It will mean the end of national entities with their militarism and corrupt politics and the end of ruthless and greedy commercialism. Will there be any human survivors? Yes, but comparatively few, even as was the case in Noah’s day.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966401/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:6, 7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966401/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Rev. 18:2</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">But perhaps someone will object, saying, Those words about a little while and then the wicked being no more were written about three thousand years ago, so how do we know that the end of this wicked system of things is at hand? We can be certain of this because of the fulfillment of certain Bible prophecies; for example, the prophecy by Jesus Christ concerning the end of this very system of things.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>LAST GENERATION FOR THIS SYSTEM OF THINGS</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Yes, Jesus Christ, in replying to questions as to when he would return and when this present system of things would end, told that this very generation would be the last under this present system of things. In this prophecy he foretold the outbreak of world wars. He also told of famines, of earthquakes, of the increase of lawlessness and the preaching of the good news of God’s established kingdom, all of which have taken place on an unprecedented scale only since 1914, clearly marking that year as the beginning of the fulfillment of his words. He further said that “this generation will by no means pass away until all these things happen.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966401/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mark 13:30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966401/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Matt. 24:7-14</a>.</p>

Of the more than three thousand million persons living today, few have any desire to serve the true God. Like past generations, they prefer to serve the false gods of religious imaginations, of political ideologies or of materialism. Regarding such gods a prophet of Jehovah the true God wrote: “For all the gods of the peoples are valueless gods. As for Jehovah, he made the heavens.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966403/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chron. 16:26</a>) Few <span id="page336" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="336" data-before-text="336"></span>have been the people to experience the joy of serving this great Creator.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> Following the flood of Noah’s day the percentage of those humans serving Jehovah God, the Preserver of the Flood survivors, diminished rapidly as mankind multiplied, until they became a nonconforming minority in the ancient world. They were the ones that refused to participate with the majority in building the Tower of Babel. They were the exceptional ones that refused to go along with the nation of Israel when that nation turned from serving the true God to the worship of false gods. They were the stalwart few that held fast to Christianity although the majority of the people in the first century spoke evilly of them and persecuted them. Regarding the world’s attitude toward them, one of the apostles of Jesus Christ wrote: “We have become as the refuse of the world, the offscouring of all things.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966403/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Cor. 4:13</a>) Nevertheless, they had a good condition of the heart because they were doing what was right in the eyes of God.

This is what Jehovah has promised, and his promises do not return to him unfulfilled. “Just a little while longer, and the wicked one will be no more; and you will certainly give attention to his place, and he will not be.

But little can be known about him personally by studying such creations. To supply man with further information he has provided his written Word, the Holy Bible. Here he has given us a great amount of information about himself, his great works in the past and his purposes for mankind. This fund of information provides sound reasons for joyfully serving him rather than the false gods of the nations. It is truth, and just the possessing of it can be a cause of joy, especially since it contributes to a good condition of the heart. Spiritual freedom it brings to those who hungrily reach out for it, and length of days to those who embrace it. Certainly freedom from thought-twisting falsehoods is unquestionably a reason for joy, and it is promised to those who serve Jehovah God. Regarding it Jesus Christ said: “You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966403/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 8:32</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Upon the rare persons that serve the true God, Jehovah, he has placed his name, blessing them by identifying them as his people.

Realizing what a grand blessing it is to have the name of the Almighty God associated with him, the prophet Jeremiah said: “Your word becomes to me the exultation and the rejoicing of my heart; for your name has been called upon me, O Jehovah God of armies.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966403/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jer. 15:16</a>) Maintaining an awareness of this favorable relationship with the great Life-giver is important to finding joy in his service.</p>

<strong>Will Peace Ever Come to Earth?</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">The sad record, preserved for us in the only reliable history of those ancient times, the Bible, shows that Adam and Eve, father and mother of the entire human family, broke the bounds set for them. <span id="page359" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="359" data-before-text="359"></span>They wanted what they were not entitled to. They desired total independence from God and his laws, demonstrating this by breaking the law. As a result, the penalty was executed—they would die in due course of time. No longer would their bodies be maintained in perfection, but they would begin to degenerate, until death overtook them. Their minds would also degenerate. Not being guided by God and his ways, they would come into conflict with others, with the animal realm, and even with their own bodies. Casting off God, they began man’s downward plunge as surely as a stone moves downward when thrown from a high place.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965441/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 3:17-19</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Not only did degeneration and death now enter the human family, but so did peace breaking. Men began to contend with men. Hatred and suspicion, violence and bloodshed engulfed human society, until, more than 1,600 years later, the condition was as the Bible describes: “The earth came to be ruined in the sight of the true God and the earth became filled with violence. So God saw the earth and, look! it was ruined, because all flesh had ruined its way on the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965441/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 6:11, 12</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">A peaceful world turned quickly into an unpeaceful one. But none of this could be blamed on God. It resulted when man sought independence from God. And since God made man a free moral agent, He would permit man this experiment, temporarily. Observe the results! Would you say that the human experience over the last 6,000 years has been a peaceful, happy, successful one? Of course not! Pain, misery, sadness, tears and death have been man’s lot down through the centuries, until today thinking persons wonder about the very survival of humanity as a whole!</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="ss"><strong>WILL PEACE RETURN?</strong></p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">God has tolerated man’s rebellious course, but only for a temporary season.

God, through his prophets and his written Word, has repeatedly warned that the disobedience of men and nations would come to an end.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965441/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Thess. 1:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965441/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Heb. 5:9</a>.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">The insane plunge of nations toward nuclear annihilation will be cut short by God. He has promised: “Evildoers themselves will be cut off . . . And just a little while longer, and the wicked one will be no more; and you will certainly give attention to his place, and he will not be. But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, and they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965441/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 37:9-11</a>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">God has tolerated man’s experiment in independence from Him long enough so that no one can accuse God of not having given men the chance to work out their own solutions. They have had that chance. They have failed miserably. Therefore, as Bible prophecy clearly shows, it is now time for God to step in, squash wickedness and take over complete control of men’s affairs. Jesus Christ himself, as did the apostle Paul, foretold that the distress of nations so evident today would be an evidence that we are indeed in the “last days” of this world. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965441/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 24:3-14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965441/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 2 Tim. 3:1-5</a>) Hence, God’s anger against this chaotic world will be expressed soon, as his favor will be extended to those who love him. As it is written concerning our day: “Your own wrath came, and the appointed time for the dead to be judged, and to give their reward to your slaves the prophets and to the holy ones and to those fearing your name, the small and the great, and to bring to ruin those ruining the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965441/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Rev. 11:18</a>.</p>

<strong>Meeting Today’s Problems with Courage</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> It is one thing to recognize the causes of fear, such as international communism, <span id="page426" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="426" data-before-text="426"></span>crooked politicians, disease and even death. But it is another thing to recognize and understand the source or instigator of fear. According to the Bible, the real source of fear and of mankind’s momentous problems today is Satan the Devil, who challenged the supremacy of Almighty God, Jehovah. He is condemned to death by God, but has been allowed to remain temporarily to show that his challenge against God has failed, proving once and for all eternity that Jehovah, the Almighty Creator, is the Supreme Sovereign.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 1:9-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ex. 9:16</a>.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 7. Give reasons to prove Satan is an actual creature and not just the personification of evil.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> To many persons, however, Satan’s existence is just legendary. Even in the minds of many who profess to believe the Bible he simply does not exist. Some believe Satan to be merely the personification of evil. It may be that some of you have felt that way about it. In any event we invite you to consider what the apostle Paul said on this matter: “The god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers.” Peter tells us who that “god” is, saying: “Your adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone.” And, please, note now the account of Jesus’ temptations: “The Tempter came and said to him: ‘ . . . tell these stones to become loaves of bread.’ . . . Then the Devil took him along into the holy city . . . Again the Devil took him along to an unusually high mountain . . . and he [the Devil] said to him [Jesus]: ‘All these things I will give you if you fall down and do an act of worship to me.’ Then Jesus said to him: ‘Go away, Satan!’” Jesus knew Satan ruled this system of things! It is because of Satan’s wicked rule over the earth that Jesus said: “My kingdom is no part of this world.” Thus the Scriptures give adequate testimony that Satan is an actual creature and in his efforts to turn men away from God he is promoting wickedness and multiplying the fear that exists today.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 5:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Matt. 4:1-11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> John 18:36</a>.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 8, 9. (a) What hope exists for deliverance from such fear?

The Bible assures us that this is so—and is this not a comforting thought? Jesus himself showed that just before Satan’s rule would end, fear and perplexity would increase and that all these troubles would be “a beginning of pangs of distress.” Their increase is at Satan’s instigation: “Woe for the earth and for the sea, because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing he has a short period of time.” Should this add to one’s fear? No. “As these things start to occur, raise yourselves erect and lift your heads up, because your deliverance is getting near.” Deliverance? Yes, for just as the fig tree’s putting forth leaves indicates summer is near, so the fearful conditions Jesus described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew chapter 24 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Luke chapter 21</a> indicate Satan’s destruction is at hand and that this generation that sees the present woes will by no means pass away until all these things, including the end of Satan’s system, occur.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 24:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Rev. 12:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Luke 21:28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/5/3" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> Matt. 24:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/5/4" data-bid="6-5" class="b"> 34</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> What a valid cause for courage this is and therefore how important it is for all Christians to study God’s Word and learn of the time, shortly to come, when the real source of worldly fear will be eliminated for all time! How do we know this? Pick up your Bible and read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 37:10 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964522/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Revelation 20:1-3</a> and see what it says.

And he seized the dragon, the original serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years. And he hurled him into the abyss and shut it and sealed it over him, that he might not mislead the nations any more until the thousand years were ended. After these things he must be let loose for a little while.”</p>

The meek are those who humbly accept Jehovah’s teaching and guidance; the righteous are those who love doing what is right in the eyes of Jehovah God. In today’s world, righteous people are greatly outnumbered by the wicked. But in the new world to come, the meek and the righteous will be neither a minority nor a majority; they will be the <em>only</em> people alive.

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span><strong>“As in Heaven, Also Upon Earth”</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“Catholic belief specifies Four Last Things: Death, Judgment, Hell, Heaven.”​—<em>Catholicism,</em> edited by George Brantl.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">NOTE that in this list of possibilities for mankind, the earth is absent. That is hardly surprising because the Catholic Church, like a number of other religions, adheres to the notion that the earth will one day be destroyed. The <em>Dictionnaire de Théologie Catholique</em> makes this clear under the entry “End of the World”: “The Catholic Church believes and teaches that the present world, as God created it and as it exists, will not last eternally.” A recent Catholic catechism also takes up this idea: “Our world . . . is destined to disappear.” But if our planet is going to disappear, what of the Bible’s promises of an earthly paradise?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Bible clearly speaks of a future paradise on earth. For example, the prophet Isaiah described the earth and its inhabitants in this way: “They will certainly build houses and have occupancy; and they will certainly <span id="page5" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>plant vineyards and eat their fruitage. They will not build and someone else have occupancy; they will not plant and someone else do the eating. For like the days of a tree will the days of my people be; and the work of their own hands my chosen ones will use to the full.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:21, 22</a>) The Jews, to whom God gave these promises, were certain that their land​—indeed, the whole earth—​would one day become a paradise for mankind’s everlasting benefit.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 37</a> confirms this hope. “The meek ones themselves will possess the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 37:11</a>) This verse is not talking about just a temporary restoration of the nation of Israel to the Promised Land. The same psalm specifies: “The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 37:29</a>)<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2006601/0">a</a> Note that this psalm says that everlasting life on earth is to be a reward for “the meek.” In a French Bible, a comment on this verse says that the word “meek” “has a far wider meaning than is apparent in translations; it includes the unfortunate, those afflicted or persecuted for Yahweh’s sake, humble hearts that are submissive to God.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>On Earth or in Heaven?</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus made a promise that reminds us of the scriptures quoted above: “Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 5:5</a>, <em>Revised Standard Version</em>) Once again, the earth is to be a lasting reward for the faithful. However, Jesus made it clear to his apostles that he was preparing a place for them “in the house of [his] Father” and that they would be in heaven with him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 14:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Luke 12:32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 1 Peter 1:3, 4</a>) How, then, should we understand promises of earthly blessings? Are they relevant today, and to whom do they apply?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Various Bible scholars say that “the earth” mentioned in Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount and even in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 37</a> is merely symbolic. In his comments in the <em>Bible de Glaire,</em> F. Vigouroux saw in these verses “a figure of heaven and of the Church.” To M. Lagrange, a French Bible researcher, this blessing “is, not a promise that the meek shall possess the earth on which they live, neither under the present system nor under a more perfect order, but the place, wherever it might be, which is the kingdom of the heavens.” For another, it is a “symbolic use of earthly values to speak of heaven.” For still others, “the land of promise, Canaan, is taken in a spiritual sense and represents the homeland above, the kingdom of God, the possession of which is guaranteed to those who are meek. That is also the meaning of this image in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 37</a> and elsewhere.” But should we be quick to exclude the physical earth from God’s promises?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>An Eternal Purpose for the Earth</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">In the beginning, the earth was directly linked to God’s purpose for humans. “As regards the heavens, to Jehovah the heavens belong, but the earth he has given to the sons of men,” wrote the psalmist. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 115:16</a>) God’s original purpose for mankind was thus connected with the earth, not with heaven. Jehovah gave the first human couple the commission to expand the garden in Eden to cover the earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Genesis 1:28</a>) This purpose was not temporary. Jehovah affirms <span id="page6" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>in his Word that the earth will last forever: “A generation is going, and a generation is coming; but the earth is standing even to time indefinite.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 1:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 1 Chronicles 16:30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Isaiah 45:18</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">God’s promises never sink into oblivion, for he is the Most High, and he ensures their fulfillment. Using the natural water cycle as an illustration, the Bible explains that the fulfillment of God’s promises is inevitable: “Just as the pouring rain descends, and the snow, from the heavens and does not return to that place, unless it actually saturates the earth and makes it produce and sprout, . . . so my word [God’s word] that goes forth from my mouth will prove to be. It will not return to me without results, but it will certainly do that in which I have delighted, and it will have certain success in that for which I have sent it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:10, 11</a>) God makes promises to humans. A certain amount of time may pass before those promises are realized, but they do not fall by the wayside. They “return” to him having accomplished all that was uttered.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Jehovah certainly “delighted” in creating the earth for mankind. At the end of the sixth creative day, he declared that everything was “very good.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Genesis 1:31</a>) The transformation of the earth into a lasting paradise is part of the divine purpose that has not yet been accomplished. Nevertheless, God’s promises ‘will not return to him without results.’ All the promises of perfect life on earth, where humans will live eternally in peace and security, will be fulfilled.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 135:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Isaiah 46:10</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>God’s Purpose Achieved Without Fail</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The sin of our first parents, Adam and Eve, temporarily disturbed God’s original purpose of making the earth a paradise. After their disobedience, they were expelled from the garden. They thus lost the privilege of sharing in the fulfillment of the divine purpose of having perfect humans reside on a paradise earth. Still, God arranged things to accomplish his purpose. How?​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Genesis 3:17-19,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 23</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The situation in Eden was similar to that of a man who starts to build a house on an excellent plot of land. Just as he lays the foundation, someone comes along and destroys what has been laid. Rather than abandon his project, the man takes steps to ensure the completion of the house. Even if this additional work entails extra cost, it does not call into question the advisability of the initial project.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Likewise, God made arrangements to ensure the accomplishment of his purpose. Soon after the sin of our first parents, he announced a hope for their descendants​—a “seed” who would undo the damage done. In fulfilling this prophecy, the primary part of the seed proved to be God’s Son, Jesus, who came to earth and offered his life as a sacrifice to repurchase mankind. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Galatians 3:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Matthew 20:28</a>) Once resurrected to heaven, Jesus would become the King of the Kingdom. Primarily, he is the meek one who inherits the earth together with selected faithful ones who are resurrected to heaven to become corulers in this Kingdom. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 2:6-9</a>) In time, this government will take earth’s affairs in hand in order to accomplish God’s original purpose and transform the earth into a paradise. Countless millions of meek ones “inherit the earth” in the sense that they benefit from the rule of this Kingdom by Jesus Christ and his corulers.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Daniel 2:44;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/17/2" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> Acts 2:32, 33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/17/3" data-bid="18-4" class="b"> Revelation 20:5, 6</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>“As in Heaven, Also Upon Earth”</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">This salvation with two destinies, heavenly and earthly, is mentioned in a vision seen <span id="page7" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>by the apostle John. He saw kings on heavenly thrones who had been chosen from among Christ’s faithful disciples. The Bible specifically states regarding these associates of Christ that “they are to rule as kings over the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Revelation 5:9, 10</a>) Note the dual aspect in the accomplishing of God’s purpose​—a restored earth under the direction of a heavenly Kingdom made up of Jesus Christ and his joint heirs. All these divine arrangements make possible the final restoration of the earthly Paradise in accord with God’s original purpose.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">In his model prayer, Jesus invited his disciples to pray for God’s will to take place “as in heaven, also upon earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9, 10</a>) Would these words make sense if the earth disappeared or was merely a symbol of heaven? Similarly, would they make sense if all the righteous went to heaven? God’s will for the earth is clearly evident in the Scriptures, from the account of the creation right up to the visions of the book of Revelation. The earth is to become what God purposed​—a paradise. This is the will that God promises to accomplish. The faithful on earth pray for the fulfillment of that will.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Everlasting life on earth is what the Creator, the God who ‘has not changed,’ originally purposed. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Malachi 3:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> John 17:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006601/20/2" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> James 1:17</a>) For more than a century, this magazine, <em>The Watchtower,</em> has explained these two aspects in the accomplishing of the divine purpose. This allows us to understand the promises of an earthly restoration that are found in the Scriptures.

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page3" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="3" data-before-text="3"></span><strong>An Inheritance You Can Count On</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“IF YOU receive a notification in the mail from an ‘estate locator’ saying that there is an unclaimed inheritance waiting for you, beware. You could be the target of a slick con artist.”</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">That is a warning that the United States Postal Inspection Service posted on its Web site. Why? Because thousands of people received a notice in the mail saying, ‘A relative of yours has died and left you an inheritance.’ As a result, many mailed in a fee of $30 or more for an ‘estate report’ that supposedly would explain where the inheritance was located and how it could be claimed. They were sadly disappointed. All respondents received the same report​—and the chance of anyone inheriting anything was practically nil.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Such schemes prey on people’s natural desire to receive an inheritance. Yet, the Bible speaks approvingly of those who provide an inheritance when it says: “One who is good will leave an inheritance to sons of sons.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004720/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 13:22</a>) As a matter of fact, none other than Jesus Christ himself made this well-known and much-loved statement in his Sermon on the Mount: “Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004720/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 5:5</a>, <em>King James Version.</em></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jesus’ words bring to mind what King David of ancient Israel was inspired to write centuries earlier: “The meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004720/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 37:11</a>, <em>KJ.</em></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“Inherit the earth”​—what an exciting prospect! But can we be sure that this is not just another crafty scheme designed to deprive people of something? Yes, we can. Since the earth is part of Jehovah’s marvelous creation, he as the Maker and Owner has the legal right to bequeath it to whomever he chooses. Through King David, Jehovah made this prophetic promise to His beloved Son, Jesus Christ: “Ask of me, that I may give nations as your inheritance and the ends of the earth as your own possession.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004720/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 2:8</a>) For this reason, the apostle Paul described Jesus as the one “whom [God] appointed heir of all things.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004720/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:2</a>) We can, therefore, have full confidence that when Jesus said that the meek “shall inherit the earth,” he did so in good faith, and he has the proper authority to fulfill his promise.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004720/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 28:18</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The crucial question, then, is, How will that promise come true? Everywhere we look today, it seems that the aggressive and the high-minded are gaining the upper hand and are taking what they want. Where <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>do the meek come into the picture? In addition, the earth is plagued by serious problems with pollution, and its resources are being exploited by the greedy and the shortsighted. Will there even be an earth worth inheriting? We invite you to read the next article to find the answer to these and other important questions.</p>

At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997724/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 37:11</a>, a number of versions read that the humble will possess “the land.” “Land” is a possible rendering of <span id="page20" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>the word (<em>ʼeʹrets</em>) used in the Hebrew text. However, <em>Today’s English Version</em> (which has provided the basis for translations into many other languages) goes further. Although this version renders the Greek word <em>ge</em> as “earth” 17 times in the Gospel of Matthew, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1997724/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matthew 5:5</a> it replaces “earth” with the phrase “what God has promised.” Church members naturally think of heaven.

Meek people are weak people!

It was a word used of a wild beast that was tamed but still powerful.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><em>Vine’s</em> dictionary of Greek words defines meek: “It is an inwrought grace of the soul; and the exercises of it are first and chiefly towards God. It is that temper of spirit in which we accept His dealings with us as good, and therefore without disputing or resisting.” The meek do not add to, subtract from, water down, or twist God’s Word​—as some do today to accommodate their immoralities.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101989044/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 4:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101989044/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2 Peter 3:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101989044/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Revelation 22:18, 19</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Moses was by far the meekest of all the men who were upon the surface of the ground.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101989044/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Numbers 12:3</a>) But was he weak?

And contrary to the theorizings of scientists and the teachings of false religion, the earth will remain “to time indefinite, or forever.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101989044/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 104:5</a>) Jehovah “did not create it simply for nothing.” He “formed it even to be inhabited.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101989044/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isaiah 45:18</a>) And how sublime life will then be! God “will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101989044/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Revelation 21:4</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Gone then all the polluters that made the earth sick! Then, “the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, and they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101989044/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:21, 22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101989044/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Psalm 37:11</a>) You too may enjoy everlasting life in that Paradise earth if you are strong enough to qualify as one of those who are Scripturally meek.</p>

The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it.” In saying this he evidently drew upon what <em>should</em> have been the case with regard to the Promised Land in his days and in the following generations. According to God’s covenant with Abraham, the wicked pagans who had lived in the land should be cleared out. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974446/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Gen. 15:18-21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974446/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 17:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974446/22/2" data-bid="23-3" class="b"> Deut. 7:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974446/22/3" data-bid="23-4" class="b"> Josh. 21:43-45</a>) Thus each successive generation of righteous worshipers making up the nation of Israel could have resided on the land, the portion of the earth that God gave to them.

That David’s words had a broader, large-scale application to the Kingdom rule of the entire earth is seen in the fact that at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974446/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Matthew 5:5</a> Jesus quoted from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974446/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Psalm 37</a>.

So, the earth itself will be populated by “righteous” ones who will “reside forever upon it.” Thus, by inspiration, David had described what the finale will be when Jehovah carries out his purpose for our earth. Christians can rejoice that the things of which David saw just glimmerings, and could personally share in only by means of a future resurrection, they can experience. Those whom the Lord puts on his right hand as “sheep” have the opportunity to “reside forever” on a paradise earth governed forever from heaven.</p>

He will put his inheritance in perfect repair.</p>

It was David’s observation and experience that the wicked, though they seemed to flourish for a while, did not last long.

We can study and ponder over them with much profit to mind and heart, for they are literally loaded with divine wisdom, inspired prophecy and right principles. All such is true, for example, of the third of these felicities, “Happy are the mild-tempered ones, since they will inherit the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966560/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 5:5</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What does it mean to be mild-tempered, and who are the mild-tempered ones that will inherit the earth? To be mild-tempered is to exercise gentleness in conduct or action, not being harsh or unfeeling. The Greek word here rendered “mild-tempered” is <em>praús.</em> It has the meaning of gentleness coupled with power; strength under control. It is a word that is also used to describe a wild animal that has been tamed.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Who are the mild-tempered that will inherit the earth? Certainly they would include Jesus Christ himself, for, above all men that ever lived on this earth, he was mild-tempered. As he himself said: “Come to me, . . . for I am mild-tempered.” Concerning him and his triumphal ride into Jerusalem, it was written: “Look! Your King is coming to you, mild-tempered.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966560/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 11:28, 29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966560/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 21:5</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">That Jesus Christ, as the preeminent mild-tempered one, will inherit the earth other scriptures make clear. Jehovah God has appointed him to be “heir of all things,” including this earth. In fact, ‘the nations are to be his inheritance, and the ends of the earth his possession.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966560/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb. 1:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966560/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ps. 2:7, 8</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">This inheritance Jesus Christ shares, even as he does his Kingdom rule, with his anointed footstep followers, for they are to be “heirs indeed of God, but joint heirs with Christ.” These are the ones the apostle John saw in vision standing upon heavenly Mount Zion and who number 144,000.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966560/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rom. 8:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966560/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Rev. 14:1</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">While the statement “happy are the mild-tempered ones” is thus seen to have specific and primary application to Jesus Christ and his Kingdom associates, it, nevertheless, states a principle that has wider application. As the psalmist David wrote: “Just a little while longer, and the wicked one will be no more; and you will certainly give attention to his place, and he will not be. But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966560/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 37:10, 11</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Why does the <em>New World Translation</em> at</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963651/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 5:5</strong></a> <strong>read, “Happy are the mild</strong>-<strong>tempered ones,” while at</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963651/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 37:11</strong></a> <strong>it reads, “the meek ones”?—D. B., United States.</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The reason why <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963651/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 37:11</a>, in the <em>New World Translation,</em> reads “the meek ones” is because the Hebrew word <em>‛anáv,</em> there rendered “meek,” has the thought of “poor, humble, meek,” rather than mild tempered. <em>‛Anáv</em> is therefore consistently rendered “meek” throughout the Hebrew Scriptures of the <em>New World Translation.</em> According to the <em>American College Dictionary,</em> one who is meek is “one humbly patient or submissive, as under provocation from others.”</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Now as to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963651/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 5:5</a>, it should be noted that Jesus was not reading or quoting directly from a Hebrew scroll of the Psalms. As to the <em>New World Translation</em> rendering, it is true that the expression “mild-tempered ones” might have been rendered another way, such as “meek ones.” Why, then, “mild-tempered ones”?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Many persons are familiar with the <em>King James Version</em> rendering of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963651/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 5:5</a>, “Blessed are the meek.” Many have also got the idea that what Jesus meant was ‘blessed are the teachable.’ So the expression has often been made that to be meek is to be teachable. True, he who is meek is teachable, but being teachable is only one of the qualities a meek person has. Moreover, the basic meaning of the original Greek word at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963651/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 5:5</a> is not “teachable.” According to the two-volume Greek-English <em>Lexicon</em> by Liddell and Scott the Greek word in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963651/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 5:5</a> means, respecting persons, “mild, gentle, meek,” and the adverbial form of it means “mildly, gently.” Interestingly, <em>The New English Bible,</em> at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963651/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 5:5</a>, reads: “How blest are those of a gentle spirit.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Also the Greek-English <em>Lexicon</em> by Westcott and Hort states regarding this Greek word, <em>praús</em> or <em>práos:</em> “Mild temper, and, of animals, tame, gentle. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963651/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matthew 5:5</a> (Here the <em>AV</em> and <em>AS</em> render it meek, but the words never did, at any time, or in any passage of any other author signify <em>meek.</em>)”</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><em>The New World</em> Translation Committee, by rendering the Greek word “mild-tempered,” believes it has attained a far superior rendering than “meek.” The <em>New World Translation</em> rendering defines the Greek word and does not leave it up to any reader to attach an arbitrary meaning to the word, such as saying that “meek” means “teachable.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn"><strong>● Does the scripture at</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963651/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 34:7</strong></a><strong>, “The angel of Jehovah is camping all around those fearing him, and he rescues them,” have application to rescue from natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes?—R. E., United States.</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">This scripture must be understood in the light of its context. The superscription to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963651/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 34 sup</a> says: “Of David, at the time of his disguising his sanity before Abimelech, so that he drove him out, and he went away.” So David is speaking against a background of his being in enemy territory, where he had to disguise himself by pretending to be insane before King Abimelech (also called Achish) in order not to be executed by this Philistine king, who might otherwise have viewed David as an intelligent, scheming, spying Israelite. Under such circumstances Jehovah’s angel preserved David and rescued him. This is very different from rescuing one from a flood or an earthquake. The circumstances are entirely different, and they have no relationship to each other.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963651/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Sam. 21:10-15</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">When it comes to floods and storms, Jehovah’s people have to heed storm warnings just like everyone else. True, the tendency of many persons is to ignore warnings, as some have done regarding hurricanes and floods, so losing their lives. Those who choose to ignore warnings, thinking ‘it cannot happen to me,’ must accept the consequences.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Protection after Armageddon is something else. Even Armageddon may not end earthquakes. We cannot be dogmatic and say that Armageddon will immediately bring the entire globe, internally and externally, to its finished condition and hence there will not need to be any alterations in the interior or on the surface of the earth. But should these be necessary during the progress of the thousand years, God can direct the course of these, and he can bring about the protection of his people from any harm or loss, in harmony with the promise at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963651/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Revelation 21:4</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"></p>

<strong>The Gift of Immortality</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Speaking of this only rightful Potentate who has been anointed by God as King, <span id="page733" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="733" data-before-text="733"></span>Paul states: “This manifestation the happy and only Potentate will show in its own appointed times, he the King of those who rule as kings and Lord of those who rule as lords, the one alone having immortality, who dwells in unapproachable light, whom not one of men has seen or can see.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963886/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:15, 16</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">That some of Jesus’ faithful followers would also be given the gift of immortality is made clear in the Scriptures. The apostle John wrote: “Beloved ones, now we are children of God, but as yet it has not been made manifest what we shall be. We do know that whenever he is made manifest we shall be like him, because we shall see him just as he is.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963886/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 John 3:2</a>) It has not been possible for these followers of Jesus to visualize what they will look like when they become immortal spirit creatures like the resurrected Christ. The physical eye cannot register the appearance of spirit creatures. Their glory is beyond the range of visible light as well as other radiations in the electromagnetic spectrum.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">How these faithful followers will receive immortality will be by the same means Jesus received it. They must first die and then be resurrected as spirit creatures. The apostle Paul speaks of this in his letter to the Corinthians. “So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised up in incorruption. It is sown a physical body, it is raised up a spiritual body. For this which is corruptible must put on incorruption, and this which is mortal must put on immortality.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963886/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:42,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963886/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 44,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963886/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 53</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">What Paul said about the gift of immortality was directed, not to the world of mankind, but to the members of Christ’s congregation who had been anointed with holy spirit to be kings with him. “If we go on enduring, we shall also rule together as kings.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963886/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Tim. 2:12</a>) As would reasonably be expected, this kingly group is limited in size. Not all who exercise faith in Jehovah and in Jesus Christ are divinely chosen to be members of it, and therefore only a comparatively small number are resurrected to spirit life, as Paul describes, and given the gift of immortality.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The vast majority of faithful Christians can look forward to being earthly subjects of that heavenly body of kings. They are the meek who will “possess the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963886/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 37:11</a>) Their reward for maintaining integrity to Jehovah will be, not the gift of immortality, but the gift of eternal life in human perfection. They will receive what the first man Adam could have had if he had been obedient.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Although they will enjoy human perfection, they will still be corruptible because they will still be made of flesh that is capable of decaying or of being destroyed by another creature. They will have the power to live indefinitely, but for them to continue living they will have to keep their bodies supplied with food and water. Without these necessities they would waste away. Such is not the case with the few who are made incorruptible by being given the gift of immortality. Their continued existence is not dependent upon outside sources of energy. God has given them the power to be self-sustaining, just as he is. This is one of the factors that contributes to their being superior to the angels. Their superiority is revealed by Paul’s statement to them: “Do you not know that we shall judge angels?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963886/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Cor. 6:3</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The angels have the power of an indefinite life, but their life force is not self-sustaining and indestructible. Immortality was never given to them. This is evident from the fact that the resurrected Jesus was the only one of Jehovah’s creatures <span id="page734" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="734" data-before-text="734"></span>who possessed it in the days of the apostle Paul, although angels had been living for a very long time before then.</p>

<strong>“Shepherd My Little Sheep”</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Symbolic sheep must also flock together and be willing to follow the leading of the Good Shepherd and their appointed overseers. In fact, they are commanded not to forsake the gathering of themselves together. If one fails to do this, the undershepherds of the congregation know that <span id="page219" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="219" data-before-text="219"></span>he is spiritually sick and needs help. If his feelings have been injured, the soothing oil of God’s Word, when applied with loving-kindness, can often heal his injury.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Because a shepherd in the Near East keeps calling to his sheep as he leads them and also calls them by name, they become familiar with his voice and will respond to it. Jesus referred to this on an occasion when speaking about God’s people: “The doorkeeper opens to this one, and the sheep listen to his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has got all his own out, he travels before them, and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice. A stranger they will by no means follow but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">John 10:3-5</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">The shepherd has a very fatiguing job that calls for much love for his charges. He has to keep them together, find the lost and strayed ones, nurse the sick, care for the injured, keep newly born lambs warm and dry, carry wearied lambs, draw water for the flock, move them to fresh pastures and protect them. Persons who are appointed to positions of oversight in the Christian congregation are expected to show the same loving care for the congregation.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">When Jesus was on earth he began the gathering of a select group of persons who would be privileged to rule with him in the heavens. They are symbolized as a little flock of sheep who follow the Lamb, Jesus Christ. “Have no fear, little flock, because your Father has approved of giving you the kingdom.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Luke 12:32</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">In addition to this small group there is another group of symbolic sheep of undetermined number who will inhabit the earth under the rule of the little flock. Although they are not in the fold of the little flock who inherit the heavenly kingdom with Christ, those now living are gathered to form, with the little flock, one great flock under the watchful care of the Lamb of God. “I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; those also I must bring, and they will listen to my voice, and they will become one flock, one shepherd.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">John 10:16</a>) These meek ones will possess the earth.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 37:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 29</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">There is a style of sheepfold that has been used in Palestine with a partition built across it. When a shepherd has a mixed flock of sheep and goats, he divides the sheep from the goats as they enter the sheepfold in the evening, sending the sheep into one section of the fold and the goats into the other. Jesus referred to this practice in a prophecy pertaining to the last days when he would, as a shepherd, separate the peoples of all nations. “All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. And he will put the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 25:32, 33</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">These are only a few of many Scriptural references that use docile sheep to picture God’s people. From all over the world people who manifest sheeplike characteristics are being gathered into a New World society of dedicated servants of God over whom appointed overseers are obeying Jesus’ command to Peter: “Shepherd my little sheep.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">John 21:16</a>) Because of the good care they receive, they can truthfully say: “Jehovah is my Shepherd. I shall lack nothing.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 23:1</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"></p>

Though Buddha, Brahma, Confucius and Christendom’s triune “God” had not yet appeared to add confusion to the religious scene, there were a host of gods to be worshiped in the religions of Philistia, Assyria, Babylon and other nations surrounding Israel. As they went out to war, these nations carried images of their gods on staves, from which also fluttered their national pendants. Some of these gods, such as Molech of Ammon and Chemosh of Moab, were known as “fire gods,” and exacted human sacrifices. Baal of Peor was worshiped with lewd sex rites. David not only maintained separateness from this cruel, immoral world of confused religionists, but he removed their contaminating influence by driving them right out from the God-given land of Israel.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Deut. 11:22-25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2 Sam. 8:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 14</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 5.

The gods of worldly nations had left no such record; indeed, they had accomplished nothing worthy of praise or record. It is Jehovah alone, “the grand King” and who is “great and very much to be praised,” that has caused to be written down the record of his wondrous works and eternal purposes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ex. 17:14</a>) David exulted, not only in the divine promise of an everlasting Kingdom, but in all the other glorious prophecies looking down to our day.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 6.

It is the day to which David looked forward with joy. It is the day in which prophecy upon prophecy is coming to grand fulfillment. In the modern year of 1914 Jehovah established the everlasting kingdom of heaven in the hands of one greater than David, his Son Jesus Christ. In 1919 he brought forth on this earth a New World society to preach “this good news of the kingdom . . . for the purpose of a witness to all the nations.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>) As the nucleus of this New World society, the faithful remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses serve “as signs and as wonders,” to be seen by all men. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa. 8:18</a>) And now, in their hundreds of thousands, men of good will, “the precious things of all nations,” are flocking to the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses, for they see in it a peace and joy that contrast sharply with the old world’s divisions and hatreds.

Among the Israelites they were generally made of seasoned wood and sometimes of horn, though “a bow of copper” is mentioned. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">2 Sam. 22:35</a>) Egyptian bows found at Thebes are about five feet (1.5 meters) long and are round pieces of wood that are nearly straight, though tapering to a point at both ends. Others, as depicted on tomb paintings, curved inward at the center. Assyrian warriors carried two bows: one long and somewhat curved, the other short and nearly angular.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The expression ‘to bend the bow’ (literally, ‘to tread the bow’) refers to stringing the bow. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps. 7:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 37:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/25/2" data-bid="26-3" class="b"> Jer. 50:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/25/3" data-bid="26-4" class="b"> 29</a>) This might be done by firmly planting the foot against the middle of the bow; or one end of the bow with the string attached might be held to the ground by the foot while the other end was bent to receive the free end of the string.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Arrow shafts were generally made of reed or light wood. Some Egyptian arrows were winged with feathers, as are modern arrows. Feathers would enable the arrow to maintain smooth flight on a straight course. A bundle of thin iron rods found at Nimrud may have been the shafts of arrows. Arrows tipped with metal or flint were widely used by the Egyptians. Persians and other Eastern peoples at times simply used stone-tipped arrows in battle. Sometimes arrows were barbed, were dipped in poison (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Job 6:4</a>), or were dressed with combustible material. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ps. 7:13</a>) Such an incendiary arrow was found at Shechem. Oil-soaked tow was placed into holes along the edge of its metal head, to be ignited when the arrow was used.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Arrows were carried in quivers on chariots (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Isa. 22:6</a>) or were hung on the back or at the warrior’s left side. The Egyptians carried their quiver in a nearly horizontal position, drawing the arrows from it under the arm, while the Assyrians slung it on the back, thus drawing the arrows from behind, over the shoulder.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>BATTERING RAM</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">An instrument of warfare used by besiegers to breach or break down the gates and walls of a city or fortress. In its simplest form, it was a heavy beam of timber with an iron tip resembling the head of a ram. Perhaps due to this or because of its butting action when in use, it is designated by the same Hebrew word (<em>kar</em>) as the animal.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Besiegers would cast up a mound, or siege rampart, against the city walls to serve as an inclined plane on which battering rams and other engines of war might be brought against them. Towers as high as the city walls might be pushed up the rampart, thus placing attackers on the same level as defenders. The defending soldiers would endeavor to put the battering rams out of action by dropping firebrands on them or by catching them with chains or grapnels.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Joab and his men cast up a siege rampart against Abel of Beth-maacah and may have used a battering ram in an attempt to throw down its wall. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">2 Sam. 20:15</a>) Ezekiel was told to make a model of Jerusalem under siege, with battering rams set against it. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ezek. 4:1, 2</a>) Battering rams were part of the siege equipment the Babylonians possessed for use against Jerusalem.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ezek. 21:22</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The Egyptians and Assyrians were well acquainted with the battering ram. It often was long enough to require one or two hundred men to lift and wield it. In other cases it was suspended from a support allowing it to swing within a framework.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">A scene on a relief from the palace of Assyrian King Ashurnasirpal II in Nimrud shows him attacking a city and depicts a battering ram mounted in a heavy machine with six wheels. It has a “prefabricated” body consisting of many rectangular wicker shields and a domed turret, below which a metal-tipped battering pole protrudes. Also represented is a tall mobile assault tower, from which an archer covers the men operating the ram. He is protected by a shield bearer holding a wicker shield like those covering the battering-ram structure.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Tyre was forewarned that Nebuchadnezzar would direct “the strike of his attack engine” against her walls (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010376/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Ezek. 26:7-9</a>), apparently indicating the use of the battering ram. The Romans developed battering-ram engines 150 feet (c. 46 meters) in length. According to Josephus, they used one against Jerusalem that was so enormous that 300 oxen were needed to move it and 1,500 men were required to drive it against the walls.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong>BATTLE-AX</strong></p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">A weapon usually having a relatively short wooden or metal handle and a stone or metal head with a sharp blade. It was used for cutting and piercing in hand-to-hand combat, though besieging warriors might also employ it to split the doors of city gates or fell trees to construct assault engines. While the battle-ax was often used by the Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Elamites and others, it does not seem to have been of major importance to the Israelites.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Battle-axes of Biblical lands and times were of two basic types, though there were variations of these. <span id="page125" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="125" data-before-text="125"></span>One kind, having a long blade ending with a short sharp edge, was used for piercing. The other, with a short blade and wide edge, was for cutting. The cutting kind would be effective against foes not wearing armor, whereas against armored soldiers the piercing type would be useful. A kind used for cutting was the “epsilon ax,” so named because its semicircular blade with three “tangs” or projections that were fitted into the handle resembles the Greek letter <em>eʹpsi· lon</em> (or, from the other side, the figure 3). It seems that in Palestine and Syria this type underwent changes until, for increased effectiveness, the blade was lengthened and the edge narrowed, forming what has been called the “duck-bill ax,” given that name due to its elongated shape and general appearance. At times, the rear part of the battle-ax blade bore likenesses of animal heads, a horse’s mane or the extended fingers of a hand. Sometimes a figure such as that of an animal or a boat was inscribed on the Egyptian ax blade.</p>

<strong>Drawing Courage from the Word of God</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Certainly, then, it behooves all men to listen to what God has to say. We cannot expect him to approve our course if we turn a deaf ear to his counsel, nor is he pleased with those whose lips profess the love of God but whose hearts are alienated from him. The Scriptures offer no reason for courage to people of that sort. The ones who find cause for courage when they study God’s Word are those whose attitude is like that of the psalmist who wrote: “Instruct me, O Jehovah, in the way of your regulations, that I may observe it down to the last. Make me understand, that I may observe your law and <span id="page557" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="557" data-before-text="557"></span>that I may keep it with the whole heart.

Not only are they courageous in the face of opposition, but they have the courage to order their lives in harmony with the high moral standards set out by God.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">17. In what way is courage needed to remain morally clean, and how can that courage be strengthened?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Courage is needed to do that, because even when one exercises care to avoid bad associations, he still comes in touch with immoral people. They may be persons with whom he is secularly employed, neighbors or classmates in school. It is not easy to refuse to go along with the crowd. But Jesus said that his followers are not part of the world. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963682/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">John 17:11-14</a>) They must be on the watch. They dare not let down their guard by feeding their minds on the immoral literature and lewd entertainment of this sex-crazy world. They must courageously show their hatred for what is bad and their love for what is right. Delighting in Jehovah’s commandments, making them our meditation, fortifies us against the immoral conduct of the world; and keeping always in mind that “all things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of him with whom we have an accounting” further strengthens that determination to do what is right.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963682/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Heb. 4:13</a>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">18.

They live what they consider to be moral lives, but when adherence to high moral standards seems to put them at a disadvantage they often lack the courage to do what they know to be right. For example, when they find their economic security threatened by dishonest practices of worldly business competitors, they may feel that the only way to handle the situation is to adopt their methods, much as they dislike them. Or they may conclude that, if their employer demands that they deal dishonestly with customers, there is nothing else they can do. Not so with a true Christian. He does not allow himself to be overcome by the evil practices of the world. He does not become envious of those doing unrighteousness. He believes as did God-fearing David: “Better is the little of the righteous one than the abundance of the many wicked ones. For the very arms of the wicked ones will be broken, but Jehovah will be supporting the righteous ones. Jehovah is aware of the days of the faultless ones, and their very inheritance will continue even to time indefinite.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963682/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ps. 37:16-18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963682/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 119:36</a>) Because of strong faith in God, they are courageous. They do not grow fainthearted because of anxiety over what they will eat or drink or the clothing they will wear. They know that if they keep on seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, Jehovah God will see that the other things are added.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963682/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Job 2:4, 5</a>) Job was not that sort of person, but many are. They will give anything in exchange for their lives. They will forfeit virtue, honesty and a clean conscience in order to avert death. They are willing to live a lie, professing to support ideologies they hate and performing vile deeds against their will, in order to pacify those in power. For fear of death they are in slavery all through their lives.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963682/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Heb. 2:15</a>.</p>

They will give anything in exchange for their lives. They will forfeit virtue, honesty and a clean conscience in order to avert death. They are willing to live a lie, professing to support ideologies they hate and performing vile deeds against their will, in order to pacify those in power. For fear of death they are in slavery all through their lives.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963682/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Heb. 2:15</a>.</p>

The inspired psalmist declared: “The wicked one is borrowing and does not pay back.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977250/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 37:21</a>) Setting forth the Christian position, the apostle Paul urged: “Do not you people be owing anybody a single thing, except to love one another.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977250/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rom. 13:8</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The person who desires God’s approval <span id="page222" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="222" data-before-text="222"></span>must, therefore, be conscientious about paying back borrowed money and making prompt payment for goods and services received. To this end, he should exercise care in taking on greater financial burdens than he already has. Otherwise he might come into a situation where he cannot meet his obligations. Furthermore, the payment of debts should not be delayed. It would be most unreasonable and thankless for a person to postpone payment and to use a sizable part of his earnings for lavish entertainment, luxuries or expensive vacations.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Some people may reason that the responsibility is not so great when one is in debt to a relative or a friend. But is not such a lack of conscientiousness, a taking of selfish advantage on the basis of family relationship or friendship?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Really, the person who is negligent about paying others what he owes is failing to show love. He is depriving them of the opportunity to use the money to which they are entitled. This may even work to their injury. Consider, for example, the situation of self-employed persons​—doctors, lawyers, electricians, carpenters and the like. In doing their work, they incur expenses. Payments for their services must cover these expenses, as well as be large enough for them to make a living. Now, if many people fail to pay them, these professional men may be unable to meet their bills, and things may come to the point where they have to give up their business. Obviously persons who deprive others of their livelihood are not showing love.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">This is a very serious matter. The apostle John made this clear when he wrote to Christians: “Everyone who hates his brother is a manslayer, and you know that no manslayer has everlasting life remaining in him. By this we have come to know love, because that one surrendered his soul for us; and we are under obligation to surrender our souls for our brothers. But whoever has this world’s means for supporting life and beholds his brother having need and yet shuts the door of his tender compassions upon him, in what way does the love of God remain in him?”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977250/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 John 3:15-17</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">If that needy brother could not get help from any other source, he would die if deprived of necessities for too long a period. Hence, the one claiming to be a Christian who refuses to come to his aid would be guilty of a form of criminal negligence. Similarly, if Christians were to take advantage of a fellow believer by unduly postponing payments of their debts, they could become guilty of forcing him out of business. This could create serious financial problems for him and could reduce him to a needy state. Should that happen, could we not say that those who refused to pay their debts did a very hateful thing toward their brother?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Conscientious Christians do not try to gain advantages for themselves on the basis of spiritual relationships. They recognize that this would be ‘greed for dishonest gain.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977250/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Tim. 3:8</a>) From the Scriptures we learn that such greediness can jeopardize one’s standing with Jehovah God. This is well illustrated in the case of Elisha’s attendant Gehazi. Through Elisha, the Syrian army chief Naaman had been healed of loathsome leprosy. In appreciation for the cure, Naaman wanted to present a gift to the prophet. But Elisha refused to accept it, as he did not want to profit from his God-given prophetic office and the powers associated therewith. Gehazi, however, greedily coveted what Elisha had refused and obtained a gift from Naaman under false pretenses. As a result, in expression of Jehovah’s judgment, Gehazi was stricken with leprosy.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977250/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Ki. 5:15,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977250/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 20-23,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977250/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 27</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Accordingly, if greediness is responsible for a person’s failure to pay off his debts, <span id="page223" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="223" data-before-text="223"></span>he can bring adverse judgment upon himself. The Bible warns us that ‘greedy persons will not inherit God’s kingdom.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977250/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Cor. 6:10</a>) Yes, such greediness could mean losing out on the gift of everlasting life. What a high price to pay!</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">As Christians, then, we want to be honest in our dealings with everyone. We should be guided by the following principles: “All things . . . that you want men to do to you, you also must likewise do to them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977250/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 7:12</a>) “As long as we have time favorable for it, let us work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977250/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gal. 6:10</a>) So, if we desire others to be conscientious in caring for their debts, should we not be setting the right example ourselves? Especially should we be concerned about doing good toward our Christian brothers, not imposing on their kindness when it comes to paying what we owe them.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">It would be wrong for Christians to feel that, in business matters, fellow believers are obligated to give them special rates and favors. But if any special consideration is shown it should be regarded with appreciation. Christians should want their brothers to get whatever they are entitled to receive. The apostle Paul’s counsel to Christian slaves sets forth a fine guideline: “Let those having believing owners not look down on them, because they are brothers. On the contrary, let them the more readily be slaves, because those receiving the benefit of their good service are believers and beloved.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977250/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:2</a>) A Christian’s conscientiousness in paying his debts to fellow believers would certainly be in harmony with this admonition.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">May our handling of debts reveal that we are conducting our affairs in harmony with Bible principles. We should never lose sight of the fact that a deliberate failure to pay what we owe others is wicked. The Most High will never look with approval upon those who, because of greediness or selfishness, do not care for their obligations. Only by making sure that ‘we are not owing anybody a single thing, except love,’ can we expect Jehovah’s blessing.</p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● What is the Christian view of the payment of bills?​—L. D., U.S.A.</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">While there are countless situations covered by this question, the basic answer is quite simple. The counsel at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971126/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Romans 13:8</a> definitely applies to this matter: “Do not you people be owing anybody a single thing, except to love one another.” Surely it would be unloving for a person to avoid paying money owed to another, whether it was owed because of having borrowed it or because of having received goods or services. In this vein the inspired psalmist wrote: “The wicked one is borrowing and does not pay back, but the righteous one is showing favor and is making gifts.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971126/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 37:21</a>.</p>

<strong>Be Honest in Everything</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">At times, stores allow their employees to purchase goods at reduced rates for personal use only. Some employees feel they <span id="page670" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="670" data-before-text="670"></span>can resell this merchandise at the reduced price to friends or relatives to help them save money. However, this is not honest, because it is not complying with the arrangement specified by the company. They have the right to set the rules. The Christian must comply.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Some have an expense account in connection with their secular work. Here the Christian exercises care not to round off figures to the next higher one, or include items that are really personal and not meant to be covered by the company. The Christian includes on his expense account only what he has actually spent and only what the company allows for, nothing more.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Consider, too, the matter of lying to one’s employer to get time off from work. What same persons may consider a good reason for lying still cannot be justified by God’s standard of honesty. Perhaps they think it would be all right if they wanted to attend a Christian assembly and did not think their employer would give them time off. But how could the Christian justify lying to an employer to attend an assembly where God’s Word is taught and Christian conduct, including honesty, promoted? Such reasoning is inconsistent, even hypocritical. In most cases an employer will respect your honesty in regard to wanting time off for an assembly. But even if it results in the loss of your job because you seek first the Kingdom, God is not going to forsake you when you do what is right.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964806/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 6:33</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Often, Christians are employed in domestic work, doing housecleaning, cooking and other chores in a home. While they may know it is wrong to take clothing, dishes, silverware, and other such items, do they realize that it is just as wrong to take things that may not be as readily missed? Taking flour, sugar, fruits or vegetables is just as much stealing, is just as dishonest, as if one walked off with a more valuable item. If the employer specifically gives his employee some of these items, that is different. But one must be careful not to interpret an employer’s generosity on an occasion or two to mean that pilfering is justified. It is not.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>HONESTY IN ALL THINGS</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">There are many other ways in which honesty is displayed. It is involved even when borrowing things from others. You should return what you borrow at the time specified, or before. It may be a small item and you may not consider keeping it to be of any consequence, but what would happen if you tried borrowing even a little money from a bank and not paying it back on time?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964806/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 37:21</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">In the Christian congregations there are certain ones assigned to handle monies needed for paying expenses. Using any of this money for oneself, however briefly, would be dishonest. Even if a person is completely without funds he must never consider using money that does not belong to him without the owner’s consent. It is no small matter. Judas Iscariot misused money entrusted to him and was branded “a thief.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964806/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 12:6</a>) He met an untimely death out of God’s favor.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Sometimes a person does a thing of which he is ashamed. He feels others would look down on him if they knew about it. While we certainly are not under obligation to divulge the private affairs of our life to everyone, the Christian still is not free to lie to save face if a matter comes before the congregation judicial committee and he is requested to tell the truth.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Appreciate that dishonesty in little things leads to dishonesty in big things. The process starts small, ends up big. The mind is gradually conditioned for larger transgressions each time smaller ones are <span id="page671" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="671" data-before-text="671"></span>not resisted. Jesus said: “The person faithful in what is least is faithful also in much, and the person unrighteous in what is least is unrighteous also in much. Therefore, if you have not proved yourselves faithful in connection with the unrighteous riches, who will entrust you with what is true? And if you have not proved yourselves faithful in connection with what is another’s, who will give you what is for yourselves?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964806/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Luke 16:10-12</a>.</p>

<strong>Conduct Showing Practical ‘Love of Neighbor’</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> These words of the apostle Paul lead on to another form of stealing or dishonesty, that is, in the way we spend our time. Yes, it is possible to steal time. How? For example, a person who has entered into a contract of employment to work a certain number of hours per day at an agreed wage would be stealing the time of his employer if he used his employer’s time for his own personal affairs, neglecting his work. The apostle says that the Christian should do “good work,” yes, “hard work.” That is, he must give honest work, being a conscientious and reliable workman, as <span id="page81" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="81" data-before-text="81"></span>though he was rendering his service to Jehovah. The apostle Paul wrote, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963083/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Colossians 3:22</a>: “Be obedient in everything to those who are your masters in a fleshly sense, not with acts of eyeservice, as men pleasers, but with sincerity of heart, with fear of Jehovah.” Likewise, an employer should be honest in his dealings with his employees, being fair to them. “You masters, keep dealing out what is righteous and what is fair to your slaves, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963083/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Col. 4:1</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 8. How is doing reliable and honest work an expression of love of neighbor?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> This course shows practical love. How? If one, claiming to be a Christian witness of Jehovah, proved to be a worker who was unreliable and dishonest, would that not make it difficult for his employer to listen to the “good news” preached to him by other witnesses of Jehovah? Without a doubt it would. So the one who truly loves his neighbor avoids “every form of wickedness,” so that he puts no stumbling block in the way of his neighbor’s accepting the truth. “Love does not work evil to one’s neighbor,” wrote the apostle Paul.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963083/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rom. 13:9, 10</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 9. What counsel is given on borrowing?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> To borrow money without the sincere determination to pay it back according to the agreement made is also dishonest and is similar to stealing. To sponge on the good nature and kindness of others with no intention of paying back what is borrowed is really wicked. For “the wicked one is borrowing and does not pay back.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963083/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 37:21</a>) This matter of borrowing and not paying back is a source of many difficulties. Indeed it is better, whenever possible, never to be a borrower; but if one is forced by circumstances to ask for a loan from his Christian brother or a neighbor, then he should work diligently to repay what is borrowed within a reasonable time.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>SPEECH THAT IS UPBUILDING</strong></p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu">10, 11.

This world is full of harshness and bitterness. People try to show that they are superior and stronger than others by speaking abusively to them. We often see people lose their tempers, becoming very angry, even to the point of screaming at one another. Surely, such kind of conduct does not express ‘love of neighbor.’ When you read about Christ Jesus in the Bible, ‘you do not learn the Christ to be like that,’ do you? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963083/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Eph. 4:20</a>) While he was very courageous and strong in support of God’s kingdom, and at times gave strong reproof to those who opposed the truth, he never lost his temper or his self-control. Always he was calm and, when dealing with his followers, kind, considerate and patient, even when having to correct them. So, then, the followers of Jesus are counseled: “Let a rotten saying not proceed out of your mouth, but whatever saying is good for building up as the need may be, that it may impart what is favorable to the hearers. Let all malicious bitterness and anger and wrath and screaming and abusive speech be taken away from you along with all injuriousness. But become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate, freely forgiving one another just as God also by Christ freely forgave you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963083/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Eph. 4:29,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963083/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 31, 32</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> What a difference in speech and conduct between the old world and the standard God sets for those who will gain life in his new world!

<strong>Proving Ourselves God’s Friends</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> God holds us back from presumptuous acts by means of his Word and by means of prayer. We can study God’s written Word, the Holy Bible, and learn the principles by which Jehovah wants us to walk. We must consult his Book of wisdom. Prayer holds us back from presumptuous acts, for by means of it we can take notice of Jehovah in whatever we do. God holds <span id="page115" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="115" data-before-text="115"></span>us back from presumptuous acts, too, by counsel from his organization. When a dispute arose over the matter of circumcision for Gentiles, Paul and Barnabas did not push ahead presumptuously. Paul knew what was the right decision in the matter, but he did not push it! He went to Jerusalem, and there a counsel of apostles and older men examined the matter. A decision was reached, one having the approval of the holy spirit. An organizational letter was prepared and this authoritative pronouncement could be read to the congregation. Paul proceeded only after getting organizational authority. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962123/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Acts 15:1-31</a>) So the Christian today is held back from presumptuous acts not only by prayer and by God’s Word but also by counsel from God’s organization. When in doubt as to which way to go at a crucial moment in life, let there be no going ahead solely by human wisdom; refrain from such action, awaiting clarification from Jehovah God by studying his Word. Then we will advance in straight paths and be constant in walking faultlessly.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>PRACTICING RIGHTEOUSNESS AND SPEAKING THE TRUTH</strong></p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">17.

To practice righteousness one cannot deal dishonestly with his friends or defraud them, nor can he slander them with his tongue. “For you are not a God taking delight in wickedness; no one bad may reside for any time with you. No boasters may take their stand in front of your eyes. You do hate all those practicing what is hurtful; you will destroy those speaking a lie.

<strong>Christians Live the Truth</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> It is not always a good practice for brothers to borrow money from brothers. At times it shows love to lend money, but often it leads to trouble in congregations. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954723/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Luke 6:35</a>) If brothers do business together, make agreements to pay money or make certain payments of goods, they should keep their promises, tell the truth and avoid dishonesty. In view of the possibilities of memory failure and to help avoid disputes, it is advisable to make a proper written record of all such transactions. <span id="page594" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="594" data-before-text="594"></span>Swindling, cheating and dishonesty are sins in God’s sight. Among the people of ancient Israel Jehovah made provision for atonement for these sins. It was necessary for the offending individual to straighten himself out with his brother and before Jehovah. “In case a soul should sin in that he has behaved unfaithfully toward Jehovah and has deceived his associate about something in his charge or a deposit in hand or a robbery or he has defrauded his associate, or he has found something lost and has lied about it and has sworn falsely over any of all the things that the man might do to sin by them; then it must occur that in case he should sin and indeed become guilty, he must return the robbed thing which he has robbed or the extorted thing which he has taken by fraud or the thing in his charge which was put in his charge or the thing lost which he has found, or anything at all over which he might swear falsely, and he must make compensation for it in its full amount and he will add to it a fifth of it. To the one whose it is he will give it on the day his guilt is proved. And as his guilt offering he will bring to Jehovah a sound ram from the flock according to the estimated value, for a guilt offering, to the priest. And the priest must make an atonement for him before Jehovah, and so it must be forgiven him regarding any of all the things that he might do resulting in guiltiness by it.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954723/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Lev. 6:2-7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954723/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 19:11-13</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">13. Has Jehovah’s principle of honesty changed to this day?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> While we Christians today do not live under the same priestly arrangement as did ancient Israel, nevertheless we are under obligation to be honest and upright and to settle all debts and pledges properly. We do not defraud brothers, but should make things right with the brothers and ask Jehovah’s forgiveness for any wrong that has been committed. Brothers will deal justly with one another in all business and keep lies, dishonesty and fraud out of their midst.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">14. What is the proper action for a Christian to take when he desires to have something that was borrowed from him returned?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Occasionally reports come to the Society from individual brothers or from congregations showing that some dishonest, immoral persons have slipped into the congregation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954723/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Jude 4</a>) It is clear how to deal with immoral ones, but what about people who go around preying on their brothers, or who appear to be brothers merely for the purpose of taking money, who are as the psalmist says: “The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again”? <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954723/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ps (37:21</a>) What can be done about them? If a brother in his love and kindness allows another who appears to be a brother to have some of his money or material things for a time and then the borrowing individual, after the time agreed upon has elapsed, refuses to pay back, the brother who made the loan can go to the one who took the money or materials and ask him to make full return. It is proper to go to your brother when you have anything against him and speak to him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954723/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matt. 18:15-17</a>) If he will not make proper settlement, then the brother involved can speak to the congregation servant and arrange to have a hearing before the committee, with the offender present. At a time like this one will find it to his advantage to have a signed written agreement and it will not be a case of the word of one person against another. If guilt is established, the committee may set a limited but reasonable time for the offender to settle his debts or right the wrongs done.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">15. (a) What can be done by a congregation if a brother refuses or fails to make proper restoration of something borrowed? (b) Is it ever proper to go before a worldly court in order to have a debt settled? (c) Before one goes into court, what should be considered?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> If the offender refuses to make a just and proper settlement, then is it proper for the brother who made the loan to take the <span id="page595" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="595" data-before-text="595"></span>debtor brother into court and sue him? The Scriptures advise us that we should bring such matters before the mature brothers in the congregation and not take a brother before the courts. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954723/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Cor. 6:1-10</a>) But he may be disfellowshiped from the congregation if he is an extortioner. He should be avoided from then on. Being disfellowshiped by the congregation is the greatest punishment that can come upon such a person at the hands of men, for when mature brothers act according to the advice of the Scriptures they are in fact acting for Jehovah and the judgment is from his Word. Whether or not a defrauded person wishes to take a disfellowshiped person into a court is for him to decide. The disfellowshiped person is no longer a brother and the congregation has exhausted its powers in the case, so the only recourse would be to the law courts of the land. But it is a good thing to consider the costs involved in time and money. Legal suits are expensive and sometimes the result is that the lawyers get everything through their fees. It is also necessary to think of any reproach that might come upon the work through such public action. That is why a brother may not take his brother into court; there is reproach upon the organization. Paul’s argument is that it is better to be defrauded than to bring reproach upon the congregation. But with a disfellowshiped person the position is different, although the people in general may not realize that the one sued has been disfellowshiped. If legal action is taken, restitution of what was taken should be the goal, and not revenge. Anyone who would go that far to have a debt paid should have the agreement in writing from the start. Or if the wronged brother chooses to drop the matter it can be left in the hands of Jehovah, who searches the hearts of all men and knows their motives and who rewards those who do right with life.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954723/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Rom. 12:17-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954723/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 5:11-13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954723/24/2" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> Heb. 10:26-31</a>.</p>

<strong>This Is a Time of Judgment</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">After mentioning the world destroyed by the Flood and the cities of Sodom and <span id="page53" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="53" data-before-text="53"></span>Gomorrah that were destroyed by fire, Peter states: “Jehovah knows how to deliver people of godly devotion out of trial, but to reserve unrighteous people for the day of judgment to be cut off.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Pet. 2:9</a>) These two outstanding judgment periods were proofs of this. The wicked people in each period were reserved, or allowed to remain, throughout their judgment periods until the day of their execution. But persons of godly devotion who had received a favorable judgment were preserved.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">These judgment periods are examples for us. They are prophetic pictures of the great judgment period in which we now live. Jesus himself pointed this out when he said: “Just as it occurred in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the Son of man . . . Likewise, just as it occurred in the days of Lot.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 17:26,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 28</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Throughout the centuries Jehovah God has permitted the wicked to remain and to dominate the earth, and they continue to do so in the present period of judgment. Those who are judged unrighteous will not survive the end of this period, whereas persons of godly devotion shall. “For those being blessed by him will themselves possess the earth, but those upon whom evil is called by him will be cut off.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 37:22</a>) They will be cut off from existence.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>DIVINE JUDGMENTS ARE FINAL</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Since the supreme Judge never makes a mistake, there is no need for him to take under review any judgment that he has passed. His judgments are final. That means the people who perished in the flood of Noah’s day will never be resurrected to stand trial again. The same is true with the people of Sodom and Gomorrah as well as Adam and Eve. All had their judgment day before the great Judge of the universe and all were sentenced to destruction. They will never have a conscious existence again. The same will be true of those in the present judgment period whom God will destroy at its conclusion.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Jehovah God’s infallible judgment of the unrighteous in the present judgment period will be just as final as it was for the people he sentenced to death in past judgment periods. They will not stand before him after death for another judgment. The promise at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Hebrews 9:27</a> does not apply to them. It says: “It is reserved for men to die once for all time, but after this a judgment.” The persons referred to here are those who die because of Adam’s sin, not because they have been judged adversely by God after death and then executed by him. Such persons can die only once because of Adam’s sin, but during the 1,000-year reign of Christ they will be resurrected and judged as to their worthiness for continued life on the basis of the course of action they take toward God’s principles and purposes then.—See <em>The Watchtower</em> as of June 15, 1947, pages 180-182.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">What you are faced with today is a judgment for survival through the coming war of the great day of God the Almighty when he will carry out his long-standing promise to destroy this wicked world or system of things. You are in a position similar to that of the people who lived in the judgment period before the Flood. Like them you are under divine surveillance, with your conduct toward God’s purposes and his kingdom ministers determining your judgment. Jesus pointed this out in a long-range prophecy recorded in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">the twenty-fifth chapter of Matthew</a>. He there likened the present judging of mankind to a shepherd’s separating sheep from goats.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Because the great Judge, Jehovah God, selected Christ to represent him in this judicial work, Jesus speaks of himself as the <span id="page54" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="54" data-before-text="54"></span>one doing the actual judging. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">the fifth chapter of John</a> he points out that he had received this authority from the great Judge, saying: “For the Father judges no one at all, but he has committed all the judging to the Son. And he has given him authority to do judging, because Son of man he is.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 5:22,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 27</a>) This was foretold by the prophet Isaiah: “And there must go forth a twig out of the stump of Jesse, and out of his roots a sprout will be fruitful. . . . And he will not judge by any mere appearance to his eyes, nor reprove simply according to the thing heard by his ears. And with righteousness he must judge the lowly ones.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa. 11:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 3, 4</a>.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"> David wrote that he had “not seen anyone righteous abandoned, nor his children looking for bread.” He thus made a general statement based on his own experience. He well knew God’s consistent care. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2014685/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 37:25</a>) David’s words, however, do not mean that no worshipper ever suffered want or ever will.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">There were times when David himself experienced trying circumstances. One such time was when he was fleeing from Saul. David’s provisions were low, and he asked for bread for himself and those who were with him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2014685/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Sam. 21:1-6</a>) So in that instance, David was “looking for bread.” Yet, in that critical situation, he knew that Jehovah had not forsaken him. The fact is, we nowhere read that David had to beg in order to obtain the food he needed to survive.</p>

Was the psalmist right? I had to prove it for myself. I needed to change from my outlook of self-pity. So I said to my companion: “From next week on I shall no longer go begging for alms.” She was stunned. “How are we going to live? We’ll die of hunger!”</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">“I have confidence that Jehovah will somehow provide for our necessities,” I answered. “He knows what we need even before we ask him.” I thought of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101980326/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 6:31-34</a>​—the promise that God will bless our efforts to obtain material needs if we seek first his kingdom and his righteousness.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Jehovah has been very good to us since then. Never again have I held out a hand to ask for bread! I’ve managed to provide our necessities by work. The psalmist <em>was</em> right. What happened? The Witnesses in the local congregation gave me further advice and help in obtaining raw materials for confectionery, which I continue to sell. Additionally, several times a week I would gather up old paper in the city and sell it. A little later, the Witnesses assisted me in applying for a small monthly invalid’s pension. Indeed, Jehovah has proved to be a loving provider, through the assistance of the Christian congregation.</p>

<strong>Beggar, Begging</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">While the English word “begging” may mean simply to implore or plead, the discussion here deals primarily with begging in the <span id="page208" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="208" data-before-text="208"></span>sense of the habitual practice of publicly asking for charity.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The patriarchal arrangement, which the Bible indicates existed prior to and after the global flood of Noah’s day, doubtless served greatly to prevent situations where individuals would find themselves isolated, in dire straits, and dependent upon public charity, and thus it worked against the development of a pauper class. From ancient times hospitality to strangers or travelers seems to have been quite freely practiced; such hospitality is at least reflected in the Biblical accounts, with rare exceptions. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 19:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ex. 2:18-20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Judg. 19:15-21</a>) The development of cities is considered to have contributed to the weakening of the patriarchal arrangement and possibly this, together with a selfish tendency to take undue advantage of the hospitality or charity of others, led to the development of begging among humankind.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Begging or mendicancy is apparently of very ancient origin in the lands of the Orient. This makes all the more notable the fact that in the Hebrew Scriptures there is no indication that begging existed to any degree or constituted a particular problem in the nation of Israel from the time of its formation until its going into exile in Babylon. When moving out of Egypt and their slavery in that land, the Israelites “went asking [a form of the Hebrew verb <em>sha·ʼalʹ</em>] from the Egyptians articles of silver and articles of gold and mantles. . . . and they stripped the Egyptians.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ex. 12:35, 36</a>) This, however, was in accord with God’s command and prophecy and was evidently viewed as just compensation for their long years of slave labor and the injustices endured by them at the hands of the Egyptians. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex. 3:21, 22</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 15:12-15</a>.) It set no precedent for the practice of begging.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Mosaic law contained forceful legislation on behalf of the poor, which, when observed, removed all cause for begging. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Lev. 19:9, 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Deut. 15:7-10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 24:19-21</a>; see GIFTS OF MERCY.) The Hebrew Scriptures strongly express trust in God’s providence for those adhering to righteousness, even as David in his old age exclaimed: “I have not seen anyone righteous left entirely, nor his offspring looking for [“begging,” <em>AV;</em> a form of the Hebrew <em>ba·qashʹ</em>] bread,” even though such righteous ones themselves are shown to be openhanded in their generosity. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 37:25, 26</a>; contrast with the experience of apostate Jerusalem at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Lamentations 1:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 4:4</a>.) On the other hand, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs (20:4</a>) portrays the lazy man as “begging in reaping time,” and the psalmist (109:10) describes the execution of punishment on the wicked as obliging “his sons [to] go wandering about; and they must do begging, and they must look for food from their desolate places.” In these two latter texts the word “begging” translates the Hebrew <em>sha·ʼalʹ</em>, which term basically means simply to ask or request (as at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Exodus 3:22</a>); however, in these two cases the implication is that the asking is done in the active, and perhaps public, manner characterizing begging.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">It appears that, during the period from the time of the Jews’ return from exile (537 B.C.E.) down to the time of Jesus’ appearance on the earthly scene, the concept developed among the Jews that the act of giving “alms” or gifts of charity had merit in itself toward salvation. This is evidenced by the statement contained in the apocryphal book of Ecclesiasticus (3:30) (believed to have been written about the second century B.C.E.) that “almsgiving atones for sins.” Such view undoubtedly served to encourage begging. (Compare the much publicized giving denounced by Jesus in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 6:2</a>.)</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Domination by the foreign powers brought oppression to the Jewish people and doubtless caused considerable disruption of the application of the Mosaic law concerning ancestral land rights and similar provisions. This, together with false religious philosophies, which failed to inculcate a genuine and principled love of neighbor (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 23:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Luke 10:29-31</a>), also likely shared responsibility for the growth of begging in Palestine.

<strong>Gleaning</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span id="page662" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="662" data-before-text="662"></span>The account of Ruth provides an outstanding example of the application of this loving provision of God’s law. Although having the right to glean, Ruth asked the one in charge of the harvesters for permission to do so, and this may have been the general practice of the gleaners. Ruth was treated kindly, Boaz even instructing his harvesters to pull out some of the ears from the bundles and leave them behind for her to glean. While this made it easier for Ruth, nevertheless it required effort on her part. She kept right on busily gleaning behind Boaz’ harvesters from morning to evening, sitting down in the house only a little while and taking time out to eat.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011675/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ruth 2:5-7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011675/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 14-17</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It is evident that this fine arrangement for the poor of the land, while encouraging generosity, unselfishness and reliance on Jehovah’s blessing, in no way fostered laziness. It throws light on David’s statement: “I have not seen anyone righteous left entirely, nor his offspring looking for bread.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011675/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 37:25</a>) By availing themselves of the provision made for them by the Law, even the poor, by virtue of their hard work, would not go hungry, and neither they nor their children would have to beg for bread.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>FIGURATIVE AND ILLUSTRATIVE USES</strong></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">When the Ephraimites accused Gideon of not calling them to the fight at the start of the battle against Midian, Gideon said: “Are not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the grape gathering of Abi-ezer [the house to which Gideon belonged]?” He interpreted his illustration by pointing out that Ephraim’s part (though it followed the initial battle) in capturing Midian’s princes Oreb and Zeeb was far greater than all that Gideon himself had done.

<strong>Sacrifices That Are Acceptable to God</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> This warm, personal concern for others is something that we will never want to lose. It is a quality that God approves of very highly. Our having this Godlike quality means that we are interested in lives, not merely from a humanitarian standpoint, but from God’s standpoint. We will have in mind his higher purposes as they relate to man. It is not good to allow <span id="page436" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="436" data-before-text="436"></span>oneself to become indifferent to the problems of our brothers, and others, or distant in our relationship to them. Jesus said: “By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969523/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">John 13:35</a>) The psalmist appreciated this need and said: “A partner I am of all those who do fear you, and of those keeping your orders.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969523/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 119:63</a>) The apostle Paul says: “Do not forget the doing of good and the sharing of things with others, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969523/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Heb. 13:16</a>) The apostle Peter appreciated the need to be lovingly concerned for others, especially our brothers. But he also warned against letting a wrong motive creep into the matter when he said, “Be hospitable to one another without grumbling.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969523/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:9</a>) Yes, cultivating a personal interest in others is something God approves.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">18.

It means endurance. Do you want to know what has helped many faithful servants of God to maintain this position over a long period of time? They committed themselves to a life course of service to God that kept them fully immersed or involved in Kingdom interests. Individual acts of self-sacrifice from day to day are fine. But obligating oneself to serve Jehovah full time, if that be his will, is much better. In fact, it is much easier. Ask any full-time preacher. There is no longer any question in the minds of most of these persons as to what they are going to do. Theirs is a life course of self-sacrifice. Not that continued application and determination are not still necessary. They are. But the schedule or routine that they have intelligently and willingly obligated themselves to follow means that the decision has been made and the work is now there ahead for them to do, outlined in advance for them to accomplish. When Isaiah said: “Here I am! Send me,” we can be sure that he was volunteering to commit himself to a life course of service to do as God would direct. We can be sure, also, that thereafter it was easier for him to follow this course that God approved.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">19. (a) Why do the right kind of sacrifices make one happy? (b) How is this shown in the case of David and others?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> Sacrifices that please God are, in a sense, like no sacrifices at all. Why? Because the sacrificer finds joy in it even though some deprivation or hardship is involved. Anything, after all, that is accomplished that is worth while, takes work. We are not to think that King David’s life was all smooth sailing. In his earlier years he was on the battlefield with his soldiers and at all times he bore the heavy responsibilities of his office as king. Yet, when he had gotten old he looked back on his life in Jehovah’s service with satisfaction and contentment. It was with reference not only to his own life of dedication but to that of others of God’s servants that he said: “A young man I used to be, I have also grown old, and yet I have not seen anyone righteous left entirely, nor his offspring looking for bread.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969523/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ps. 37:25</a>) There was no evidence of regret on David’s part for the sacrifices that he had made in his lifetime in God’s service. Having done what was right, he was happy, just as the proverb says: “It is a rejoicing for the righteous one to do justice.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969523/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Prov. 21:15</a>.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">20.

It is the one that has spent his lifetime in God’s service that has contentment. This is true of those who have spent twenty, thirty, forty <span id="page437" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="437" data-before-text="437"></span>or more years at Brooklyn Bethel. Has it all been easy? Not really. Here at the Watch Tower Society’s headquarters you are tested as you become just one of about a thousand others, each one of them with an assignment that sometimes does not constitute the easiest nor the most pleasant work. But here is an opportunity to devote yourself unselfishly all of your waking hours for the highest good of others. You will be furnished with the necessities of life so that you can apply yourself wholly to the Kingdom interests. You will associate with mature Christians who know where they are going and have known it for many years. One who had spent many years in that service and still rejoices in it put it this way: “Even if there were no new order after Armageddon I wouldn’t have wanted to miss serving God here because just being here now is a sufficient reward in itself.” That does not sound like making a sacrifice, does it?</p>

Otherwise he would not have said: “I find, then, this law in my case: that when I wish to do what is right, what is bad is present with me. I really delight in the law of God according to the man I am within, but I behold in my members another law warring against the law of my mind and leading me captive to sin’s law that is in my members.” So down to the day of his death this great Christian warrior admitted that it was necessary to put <span id="page531" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="531" data-before-text="531"></span>up a hard fight. “I browbeat my body and lead it as a slave, that, after I have preached to others, I myself should not become disapproved somehow.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964643/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Rom. 7:21-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964643/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 9:27</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> As in the apostle Paul’s case, so in ours, if we fail to browbeat the sinful tendencies of the fallen fleshly body and lead it as a slave to the dictates of a new personality, if we fail to display the fruitage of Jehovah’s spirit, we too will be disapproved by Jehovah, and that would be most tragic.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">20, 21.

Shortly before Jesus was taken captive that last night he warned his disciples of the terrible consequence that would come upon his anointed followers if they were disapproved because of not bearing the fruitage of Jehovah’s spirit. “I am the true vine,” said Jesus, “and my Father is the cultivator. Every branch in me not bearing fruit he takes away, and every one bearing fruit he cleans, that it may bear more fruit. . . . Just as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it remains in the vine, in the same way neither can you, unless you remain in union with me. . . . If anyone does not remain in union with me, he is cast out as a branch and is dried up; and men gather those branches up and pitch them into the fire and they are burned.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964643/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">John 15:1-6</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> Jehovah is a productive cultivator, and he will see to it that everyone in his lush theocratic organization produces and displays the pleasant fruitage of His spirit. Make no mistake about it, if you fail to produce the fruitage of a Christian personality you will have no place in the theocratic society of Jehovah’s Christian witnesses! All the fruitless, wild and lawless suckers in his cultivated organization are quickly lopped off, cast out, dried up and eventually are pitched into the fire of everlasting destruction! “It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964643/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Heb. 10:31</a>.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">22.

It is true, as Paul wrote to the Hebrews, that such corrective discipline and cleaning of our personalities is painful, “yet afterward to those who have been trained by it it yields peaceable fruit, namely, righteousness.” So “do not belittle the discipline from Jehovah, neither give out when you are corrected by him; for whom Jehovah loves he disciplines.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964643/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Heb. 12:5-11</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="ss"><strong>START COUNTING YOUR BLESSINGS</strong></p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">23.

Materialism is made to appeal to these fallen tendencies by those who stand to profit by our succumbing to materialism, those who offer entertainment or who have fine homes, fine autos or fine furnishings and clothes to sell.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963646/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 8:21</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">But materialism is deceptive. The more you have the more you want. Besides, it plays havoc with the Christian’s spiritual interests and his relationship with his God. ‘The deceptive power of riches chokes the word.’ Not without good reason therefore did the apostle Paul warn: “Let your manner of life be free of the love of money, while you are content with the present things.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963646/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 13:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963646/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Heb. 13:5</a>.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1963646/0">a</a></p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Materialism is also deceptive because it is temporary, as we are reminded by the apostle John: “Everything in the world—the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one’s means of life—does not originate with the Father, but originates with the world. Furthermore, the world is passing away and so is its desire, but [only] he that does the will of God remains forever.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963646/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 John 2:16, 17</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">We cannot serve two masters. The question is, What comes first in our lives? We must earn a living and provide for our own or we are worse than an unbeliever. But that does not mean that we cannot keep on seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness. It is a matter of emphasis and priority. If we find ourselves neglecting the spiritual things, then we are being taken in by materialism’s deceptions.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963646/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Tim. 5:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963646/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Matt. 6:33</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">To avoid being ensnared by materialism’s deceptions we must have a strong faith.

They miss meetings and often field service. They deprive themselves of the fellowship and association of their faithful brothers, which is so essential and encouraging at this time of the end. They argue: “We are married, we have children, we must work to provide for our families.” Very true. According to Paul, one must ‘provide for those who are his own, otherwise he has disowned the faith and he is worse than a person without faith.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962404/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">1 Tim. 5:8</a>) But what about the prophets Isaiah, Ezekiel and Hosea and the apostle Peter? What about thousands of others today who are married and have many children and yet who are hard workers in Jehovah’s service? How do they manage to carry on? Where is the faith of the lax brothers? Without doubt they treat lightly the words of Jesus, the Master Worker: “Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962404/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Matt. 6:33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962404/43/1" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> Ps. 37:25</a>) These brothers put the proverbial cart before the horse, and that is why they do not have the joy of their Master.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">20.

Enter into the joy of your master,” we must accept and discharge our responsibility. If we envision the Messianic King conquering in the midst of his enemies and if we are in harmony with the righteous war he is waging against Satan and his wicked forces, we must offer ourselves willingly in this day of his military force. Otherwise we will lose out. What will the victorious King think about the one who does not even come to the Bible study, where the weak “sheep” come for the study of God’s Word, to render his aid to them, and who excuses himself, saying that his home is quite a few yards away? What will this brother say about the African witnesses in Nyasaland who, in order to attend the congregational meetings, have to ‘walk seven to fifteen miles in the rain and swim a river or two infested with crocodiles’? The flimsy argument, ‘I am tired,’ will not help him. The Master Worker does not want lazy people in his army. He will vomit him out of his mouth as an unworthy soldier and worker.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962404/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Rev. 3:16</a>.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">21.

The influx of “the desirable things of all the nations” is under way and is speeded up. What shall we do? As mature Christians, whether we are of the anointed ones, those who will make up Jehovah’s palace in the heavens, or from the earthly “other sheep,” we have accepted responsibility to work <span id="page342" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="342" data-before-text="342"></span>in the gathering of other meek people and making loyal worshipers of Jehovah and teachers out of them. This responsibility we must lovingly discharge. Why so? First, because to be fellow workers of the Most High God in this grand work is an inestimable privilege and honor; and, second, because there is life for the teacher as well as for the ones who are taught. This the inspired apostle Paul makes very plain when he writes to Timothy: “Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching. Stay by these things.” Why? “For by doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962404/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:16</a>.</p>

Jesus advised us to pray for “our bread for this day,” not for our needs five or ten years from now.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 6:11</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">12.

So, never be anxious about the next day, for the next day will have its own anxieties.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 6:24-34</a>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">13.

The young man assured him that he kept all these. Then Jesus said to him: “If you want to be perfect, go sell your belongings and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven, and come be my follower.” However, when the young man heard this he was grieved because he had more interest in the many material possessions he enjoyed than in the service of his Creator. As in this case, many with great material wealth find that their money talks. In fact, their money does their thinking too, because they give it first consideration instead of keeping a proper spiritual balance on life. So Jesus told his disciples: “Truly I say to you that it will be a difficult thing for a rich man to get into the kingdom of the heavens.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 19:16-26</a>.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">15.

If we find that we are letting material anxieties choke off our service to God, perhaps it is because we are not exercising faith. What is the remedy? Strengthen that faith. Study God’s Word; attend meetings where faith may be revived by good association and by receiving a generous share of God’s spirit. Build up a spiritual reserve by home Bible study with your family and by teaching others the truths you know, thereby demonstrating your faith. Never let your secular employment keep you from attending congregational meetings for Bible study or from attending conventions devoted to pure worship. There are other Jobs for a man of faith, and “your heavenly Father knows you need all these things.” <span id="page435" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="435" data-before-text="435"></span>The more material riches a man has the harder it is for him to accept the Scriptural truths and apply them. Such a man has a big stake in the old world; and the bigger the stake is, the harder it is to pull it up. Jesus illustrated this, saying: “It is easier for a camel to get through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to get into the kingdom of God.” Only with faith can such a person pull through.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 19:24</a>.</p>

She took me to the cinema one Sunday to see the Photo-Drama of Creation—motion pictures and slides that depicted God’s purpose for the earth and mankind, from the time of earth’s preparation right into the millennial reign of Christ. It was very impressive. Some years later when we went to live in Edinburgh she arranged for me to see the Photo-Drama again, so I went along with some of my schoolmates. Yet it was not until after my grandmother’s death that the Bible Students came in touch with my mother. Soon both she and I were attending their meetings.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">At that time they were distributing resolutions telling Christendom of her failure, and I shared in the distribution. As I regularly attended the meetings I gradually grew in knowledge of Jehovah’s goodness and appreciation of his loving-kindness toward his creatures. The desire within me to serve Jehovah grew strong, and in the spring of 1923 I made my dedication to Jehovah and symbolized it by water baptism. I wanted to use my life to “serve Jehovah with rejoicing.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">What an inestimable privilege it has been to serve in Jehovah’s courts! And how the years have flown! It seems like only a few years ago that I knocked on my first door to offer the Bible-study booklet <em>Millions Now Living Will Never Die.</em> Shy, but praying to Jehovah for strength, I knocked once, twice, but no answer. What a relief! But the initial step had been taken, and soon I was anxious to find the people at home.

Bicycles were our mode of transport during seven years together as pioneers of the good news. We never had much of this world’s goods, but we had great cause for rejoicing. With our hearts in the ministry, we had no doubt that Jehovah would provide for us what was necessary; and how true this proved to be. As the psalmist said: “A young man I used to be, I have also grown old, and yet I have not seen anyone righteous left entirely, nor his offspring looking for bread.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962528/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 37:25</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">When the March 1, 1925, issue of <em>The</em> <span id="page444" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="444" data-before-text="444"></span><em>Watch Tower</em> was studied in the congregations, we were called back to Edinburgh to benefit from the study of that article “Birth of the Nation” with the others.

They must resist the heat of old-world opposition that might dry up the tender plant of their newborn faith. In trial, and even in persecution, they must keep the vision of Jehovah’s glorious promises shining brightly before their eyes, so that they may never, never stray from the radiant path that it lights before them.

They think they must take in extra work at home to supplement the family budget, that they must enlarge a business, or seek promotion to a more lucrative but more time-consuming job. Some have all kinds of worries about what <em>might</em> happen in the future. They fail to heed Jesus’ advice: “So, never be anxious about the next day, for the next day will have its own anxieties.

They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be full of sap and green: to show that Jehovah is upright.” While those words have particular application to those ‘planted as cedars in the house of Jehovah,’ the “little flock,” they undoubtedly enunciate a principle that applies to all Jehovah’s faithful servants, including the other sheep being gathered to the Right Shepherd today.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954602/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 92:12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954602/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 14, 15</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Among the faithful servants of Jehovah in times past of whom those words were true was Moses, whose active service to Jehovah began when he was eighty years old. Then for forty years he was used by Jehovah to bring honor to his name and miraculously to deliver, guide, instruct, protect and provide for God’s people, and we are told that at the age of 120 years, when he rehearsed Jehovah’s righteous acts and his requirements for his people before the Israelites on the plains of Moab, “his eye had not grown dim and his vital strength had not fled.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954602/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deut. 34:7</a>, <em>NW</em>) Yes, in a most literal sense the psalmist’s words proved true in Moses’ case. That Moses was indeed “old” at the age of eighty is apparent from the words of his psalm: “The years of our life are threescore and ten, or even by reason of strength fourscore.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954602/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 90:10</a>, <em>RS.</em></p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The poet-king David was another who kept bearing fruit in his old age, supervising the gathering of material for the temple, working out its details of construction and its extensive and elaborate form of worship, and singing Jehovah’s praise and giving instructions to his people. “I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.” Truly Jehovah’s goodness and loving-kindness did follow David all the days of his life.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954602/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 37:25</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Bearing fruit in old age was true also of Daniel. He, no doubt, was in his nineties when he fearlessly stood before Belshazzar and his wanton revelers and interpreted the ominous handwriting on the wall; and when, later, he defied the law of the Medes and the Persians to worship his God Jehovah and was delivered from the den of lions, at about which time he also wrote the book bearing his name.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Nor are such examples of fruit-bearing in old age limited to the Hebrew Scripture record. Does not Luke tell us about the faithful priest Zechariah, who in his old age was blessed not only with a son, John the Baptist, but also with the gift of prophecy? And what about the apostle Paul? Although “an aged man” and a prisoner, did he not keep on writing letter after letter, eight of them, of instructions to his brothers on the outside, at the same time making use of every opportunity to preach by word of mouth, thereby proving that the Word of God was not bound, making his last contribution to the Christian Greek <span id="page490" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="490" data-before-text="490"></span>Scripture canon, 2 Timothy, just shortly before his death?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954602/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Philem. 9</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954602/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 1:5-7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954602/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Acts 28:31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954602/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 2 Tim. 4:6</a>.</p>

<strong>The Deceptive Power of Wealth</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> However, you may take the viewpoint that you are just trying to provide things needful for your family, not becoming materialistic due to a lack of faith; and this is entirely proper. In fact, the man who <span id="page434" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="434" data-before-text="434"></span>claims to serve God and does not provide for his family has disowned the faith and is worse than a person without faith. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Tim. 5:8</a>) At the same time, by putting faith in the prayer to God to provide our daily bread, we may find we can devote less time to secular pursuits and more to the ministry. In lands where the people live more simply they do not spend long hours watching television, or Saturday afternoon polishing the car or keeping the home in repair, and so can truly put the Kingdom interests first in their lives. Jesus advised us to pray for “our bread for this day,” not for our needs five or ten years from now.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 6:11</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">12.

You cannot slave for God and for Riches. On this account I say to you: Stop being anxious about your souls as to what you will eat or what you will drink, or about your bodies as to what you will wear.” Just because the nations keep on eagerly pursuing material goals in life, should we show so little faith? “Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you. So, never be anxious about the next day, for the next day will have its own anxieties.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 6:24-34</a>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">13.

Even the birds and animals search for what they need. But if we do our part we should have faith that God will provide our needs.

This should be a wholehearted service, putting first things first; and certainly the privilege of serving our Creator, the One who can give us life, should be given our first consideration.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">14. Why did Jesus say it would be difficult for the rich to enter the Kingdom?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> On one occasion a young man inquired of Jesus: “Teacher, what good must I do in order to get everlasting life?” Jesus advised him that the first thing to do would be to bring his life into line with God’s commandments by obeying his law. The young man assured him that he kept all these. Then Jesus said to him: “If you want to be perfect, go sell your belongings and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven, and come be my follower.” However, when the young man heard this he was grieved because he had more interest in the many material possessions he enjoyed than in the service of his Creator. As in this case, many with great material wealth find that their money talks. In fact, their money does their thinking too, because they give it first consideration instead of keeping a proper spiritual balance on life. So Jesus told his disciples: “Truly I say to you that it will be a difficult thing for a rich man to get into the kingdom of the heavens.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 19:16-26</a>.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">15. If our faith is weak, how can it be strengthened?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> Everyone must put up a constant battle to keep a good spiritual balance. If we find that we are letting material anxieties choke off our service to God, perhaps it is because we are not exercising faith. What is the remedy? Strengthen that faith. Study God’s Word; attend meetings where faith may be revived by good association and by receiving a generous share of God’s spirit. Build up a spiritual reserve by home Bible study with your family and by teaching others the truths you know, thereby demonstrating your faith. Never let your secular employment keep you from attending congregational meetings for Bible study or from attending conventions devoted to pure worship. There are other Jobs for a man of faith, and “your heavenly Father knows you need all these things.” <span id="page435" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="435" data-before-text="435"></span>The more material riches a man has the harder it is for him to accept the Scriptural truths and apply them. Such a man has a big stake in the old world; and the bigger the stake is, the harder it is to pull it up. Jesus illustrated this, saying: “It is easier for a camel to get through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to get into the kingdom of God.” Only with faith can such a person pull through.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 19:24</a>.</p>

<strong>Hold Fast Your Joy!</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> There is someone, however, who does not want mankind to be happy. That “someone” is “the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan, who is misleading the entire inhabited earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rev. 12:9</a>) He it is who oversowed “weeds” of sectarianism <span id="page111" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="111" data-before-text="111"></span>in the true religion of life. His subtle ways are further described by Jesus Christ in his parable recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 8:4-15</a>. As the Great Sower sows the “right seed,” “the word of God,” receptive hearts “receive the word with joy.” However, the Devil tries to prevent the seed’s taking root, or he tries to choke it off before it grows into “a tree of life.” All who are desirous of holding fast to their initial joy must cultivate the good soil of their hearts by forming regular habits of study. They must resist the heat of old-world opposition that might dry up the tender plant of their newborn faith. In trial, and even in persecution, they must keep the vision of Jehovah’s glorious promises shining brightly before their eyes, so that they may never, never stray from the radiant path that it lights before them. They must study to participate in the conquest of faith. “Everything that has been born from God conquers the world. And this is the conquest that has conquered the world, our faith.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 John 5:4</a>.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 8.

He warns of “the ones that have heard, but, by being carried away by anxieties and wealth and pleasures of this life, they are completely choked and bring nothing to perfection.” Anxieties? Yes, some become anxious about tomorrow. They think they must take in extra work at home to supplement the family budget, that they must enlarge a business, or seek promotion to a more lucrative but more time-consuming job. Some have all kinds of worries about what <em>might</em> happen in the future. They fail to heed Jesus’ advice: “So, never be anxious about the next day, for the next day will have its own anxieties. Sufficient for each day is its own evil.” If they would carefully plan to let God’s new-world interests have first place in their lives, their anxieties would vanish like the morning mist. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 6:33, 34</a>) Jehovah will never forsake those who keep him first in their thoughts and lives.

Since we are living in the last days, near the end of this wicked system of things, the statement of the psalmist takes on added significance: “But the transgressors themselves will certainly be annihilated together.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964000/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 37:38</a>) Violators of God’s laws, even though sincere, will be cut off in death at this system’s end.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">What are the benefits for those who sincerely obey God’s commandments? <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964000/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 37:27</a> promises: “Turn away from what is bad and do what is good, and so reside to time indefinite.” Lovers of what God considers good will live through the end of this system into a new system of things where the earth will be brought back to a paradise condition. There they will indeed “reside to time indefinite” and enjoy the delights of this beautiful earth. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964000/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 37:29</a> helps us to understand how long this “time indefinite” will be for lovers of what is right when it says: “The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it.”</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">Peace and perfect life in a restored paradise will be the lot of those who love God and sincerely follow <em>his</em> ways. Life in that paradise will fulfill all their righteous desires, for of God’s promises the psalmist said: “You are opening your hand and satisfying the desire of every living thing.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964000/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 145:16</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">“Not everyone saying to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will. Many will say to me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and expel demons in your name, and perform many powerful works in your name?’ And yet then I will confess to them: I never knew you!

Since Jehovah is perfectly consistent, the loyalty he shows toward his faithful servants never wanes. The psalmist wrote: “I was once young and now I am old, but I have not seen anyone righteous abandoned, nor his children looking for bread. For Jehovah loves justice, and he will not abandon his loyal ones.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002053/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Psalm 37:25,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002053/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 28</a>) True, as the Creator, Jehovah deserves our worship. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002053/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Revelation 4:11</a>) Still, because he is loyal, Jehovah treasures our faithful acts.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002053/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Malachi 3:16, 17</a>.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">15. Explain how Jehovah’s dealings with Israel highlight his loyalty.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> In his loyal love, Jehovah repeatedly comes to the aid of his people when they are in distress. The psalmist tells us: “He is guarding the lives of his loyal ones; he rescues them from the hand of the wicked.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002053/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Psalm 97:10</a>) Consider his dealings with the nation of Israel. After their miraculous deliverance through the Red Sea, the Israelites proclaimed in song to Jehovah: “In your loyal love you have led the people whom you have redeemed.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002053/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Exodus 15:13</a>) The deliverance at the Red Sea certainly was an act of loyal love on Jehovah’s part. Moses therefore told the Israelites: “It was not because you were the most numerous of all the peoples that Jehovah showed affection for you and chose you, for you were the smallest of all the peoples. Rather, it was because of Jehovah’s love for you and because he kept the oath that he had sworn to your forefathers that Jehovah brought you out with a mighty hand, to redeem you from the house of slavery, from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002053/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 7:7, 8</a>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">16, 17. (a) What shocking lack of appreciation did the Israelites display, yet how did Jehovah show compassion toward them? (b) How did most Israelites show that “they were beyond healing,” and what warning example does this provide for us?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span id="page286" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="286" data-before-text="286"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> Of course, as a nation the Israelites failed to demonstrate appreciation for Jehovah’s loyal love, for after their deliverance “they continued to sin against [Jehovah] by rebelling against the Most High.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002053/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalm 78:17</a>) Over the centuries, they rebelled again and again, leaving Jehovah and turning to false gods and pagan practices that brought nothing but defilement. Still, Jehovah did not break his covenant. Instead, through the prophet Jeremiah, Jehovah implored his people: “Return, O renegade Israel . . . I will not look down angrily on you, for I am loyal.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002053/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Jeremiah 3:12</a>) As noted in <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1102002053/1">Chapter 25</a>, however, most of the Israelites were not moved. Indeed, “they kept ridiculing the messengers of the true God, and they despised his words and mocked his prophets.” With what result? Finally, “the rage of Jehovah came up against his people, until they were beyond healing.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002053/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 36:15, 16</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> What do we learn from this? That Jehovah’s loyalty is neither blind nor gullible. True, Jehovah is “abundant in loyal love,” and he delights to show mercy when there is a basis for it. But what happens when a wrongdoer proves to be incorrigibly wicked? In such a case, Jehovah adheres to his own righteous standards and renders adverse judgment. As Moses was told, Jehovah “will by no means leave the guilty unpunished.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002053/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Exodus 34:6, 7</a>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">18, 19. (a) How is Jehovah’s punishment of the wicked in itself an act of loyalty? (b) In what way will Jehovah demonstrate his loyalty to those of his servants who have been persecuted to the point of death?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><strong><sup>18</sup></strong></span> God’s punishment of the wicked is in itself an act of loyalty. How? One indication is found in the book of Revelation in the commands that Jehovah issues to seven angels: “Go and pour out the seven bowls of the anger of God <span id="page287" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="287" data-before-text="287"></span>on the earth.” When the third angel pours his bowl “into the rivers and the springs of water,” they become blood. Then the angel says to Jehovah: “You, the One who is and who was, <em>the loyal One,</em> are righteous, for you have issued these judgments, because they poured out the blood of holy ones and of prophets, and you have given them blood to drink; they deserve it.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002053/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Revelation 16:1-6</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></span> Note that in the midst of delivering that message of judgment, the angel refers to Jehovah as “the loyal One.” Why? Because by destroying the wicked, Jehovah is displaying loyalty to his servants, many of whom have been persecuted to the point of death. Loyally, Jehovah keeps such ones very much alive in his memory. He longs to see these departed faithful ones again, and the Bible confirms that his purpose is to reward them with a resurrection. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002053/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Job 14:14, 15</a>) Jehovah does not forget his loyal servants simply because they are no longer alive. On the contrary, “they are all living to him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102002053/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Luke 20:37, 38</a>) Jehovah’s purpose to bring back to life those who are in his memory is powerful evidence of his loyalty.</p>

<strong>Does the God of Justice Care?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">This gives us confidence that Jehovah God has an “appointed time” for taking action. Even if there should appear to be a “delay” from the human standpoint, this does not mean that God does not care about us, that he has forgotten us and changed his purpose. Since “Jehovah is a lover of justice, . . . he will not leave his loyal ones.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973240/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 37:28</a>) His prophetic word, including his promise to end injustices, oppression and pain, is “panting” or eagerly moving forward to its fulfillment.

<strong>Tempering Justice with Mercy</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The great God of justice, however, is just at all times and weighs everyone accurately in his true scales of justice. Regarding this Job says: “He will weigh me in accurate scales and God will get to know <span id="page414" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="414" data-before-text="414"></span>my integrity.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965488/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 31:6</a>) The judgment he renders and the punishment he measures out always are just and right, for he is a lover of justice.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965488/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 37:28</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Belshazzar, who ruled Babylon in the days of Daniel, came under God’s judgment, and he failed to balance the scales of justice. In the year 539 B.C.E., a strange handwriting appeared on the wall of his banquet room while he and his royalty were having a feast, in which they defiled the sacred vessels that Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jehovah’s temple in Jerusalem sixty-eight years earlier. The handwriting warned him: “God has numbered the days of your kingdom and has finished it. . . . you have been weighed in the balances and have been found deficient. . . . your kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and the Persians.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965488/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Dan. 5:26-28</a>) The scales of justice were balanced by his violent death that very night.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>LONG-SUFFERING</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">In the exercising of divine justice, Jehovah does not move to balance the scales of justice until the errors of the guilty come to their full. Warnings are given and time is allowed for repentance, but none can escape his judgment. Showing that he is long-suffering in order that violators of his laws might repent, he states: “I take delight, not in the death of the wicked one, but in that someone wicked turns back from his way and actually keeps living. Turn back, turn back from your bad ways, for why is it that you should die, O house of Israel?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965488/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ezek. 33:11</a>) But in due time he will “pay back to earthling man according to his activity.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965488/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Prov. 24:12</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The Amorites, for example, that were living in the land of Canaan during Abraham’s time had not developed their error to the point that required divine punishment, but Jehovah saw that their bent of badness was putting the scales of justice off balance. Abraham’s descendants were used by God to balance the scales by their acting as executioners of the Amorites. “He began to say to Abram: ‘You may know for sure that your seed will become an alien resident in a land not theirs, and they will have to serve them, and these will certainly afflict them for four hundred years. But the nation that they will serve I am judging, and after that they will go out with many goods. But in the fourth generation they will return here, because the error of the Amorites has not yet come to completion.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965488/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Gen. 15:13, 14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965488/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 16</a>) By means of the Israelite armies, divine justice was executed on them.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>TEMPERING JUSTICE</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">In the case of the first man, Adam, who disobeyed God by eating a fruit that was forbidden to him, justice was executed when he died, which would not have happened if he had been obedient. His offspring inherited his sin and passed it down to all mankind. God has shown compassionate mercy to Adam’s descendants by providing a redemptive sacrifice that can free them from the execution of cold justice because of their sinful condition. It opens the way for them to escape from the permanent death sentence that came upon Adam, but they must manifest their repentance and their faith. They must furnish grounds for having God’s mercy extended to them. “For God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965488/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Jehovah also tempered his justice in the days of Noah. The Biblical record tells us that about 120 years before the great Flood “the badness of man was abundant in the earth and every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only bad all the time.” The violating by man of what was <span id="page415" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="415" data-before-text="415"></span>righteous in the eyes of God threw the scales of justice off balance. Jehovah God judged the world of that time and sentenced it to destruction. “Jehovah said: ‘I am going to wipe men whom I have created off the surface of the ground.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965488/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Gen. 6:3-7</a>) But this judgment decree was tempered when Jehovah showed the guilty undeserved kindness by staying the execution decree for 120 years. He was long-suffering with them. This gave men the opportunity to produce grounds for Jehovah to extend mercy to them on the basis of their repentance, which would mean the preservation of their lives through the Flood. All who failed to take advantage of those 120 years to build up legal grounds for mercy to be shown them were swept from the surface of the ground by the floodwaters. Their destruction balanced the scales of justice.</p>

That is certainly justified because Jesus quoted that text in his Sermon on the Mount, indicating that it will have a future fulfillment.

When Solomon ruled Israel, God’s people enjoyed special peace and prosperity in a land “flowing with milk and honey.” God had said: “If you continue walking in my statutes . . . , I will put peace in the land, and you will lie down with no one making you afraid.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022681/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Lev. 20:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022681/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 26:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2022681/18/2" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> 6</a>) Those promises came true during Solomon’s reign.

<strong>Do All Good People Go to Heaven?</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><strong>Marcus:</strong> I raise the question because of what we read at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012569/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 37:29</a>. Would you please read this verse?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"><strong>Robert:</strong> OK. It says: “The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it.”</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"><strong>Marcus:</strong> Thank you. Did you notice where many good people will live?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb"><strong>Robert:</strong> The verse says they’ll reside on the earth.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"><strong>Marcus:</strong> Precisely​—and not just for a short time. Notice that the verse says: “They will reside <em>forever</em> upon it.”</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"><strong>Robert:</strong> Maybe that just means that there will always be good people on earth. When we die and go to heaven, we’re replaced by other good people who have been born.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb"><strong>Marcus:</strong> Many would probably interpret the verse that way. But is it possible that the verse means something else altogether? Could it be saying that good people themselves will live forever on earth?</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"><strong>Robert:</strong> I’m not sure I follow you.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="ss"><strong>A Future Earthly Paradise</strong></p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb"><strong>Marcus:</strong> Well, consider what another portion of the Bible says about life on earth in the future. Let’s read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012569/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 21:4</a>. Concerning people who will live at that future time, the verse says: “He [God] will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.” Isn’t that an appealing prospect?</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb"><strong>Robert:</strong> Yes. But I think that’s talking about what life will be like in heaven.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb"><strong>Marcus:</strong> Well, it’s true that those who go to heaven will experience similar blessings. But look at the verse again. What does it say will happen to death?</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb"><strong>Robert:</strong> It says that “death will be no more.”</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb"><strong>Marcus:</strong> Exactly. Now, I’m sure you would agree that for something to be no more, it had to exist in the first place.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb"><strong>Robert:</strong> Of course.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb"><strong>Marcus:</strong> But there has never been death in heaven, has there? It’s only here on earth that people die.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb"><strong>Robert:</strong> Hmm. I’ll have to think about that.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb"><strong>Marcus:</strong> You see, Robert, the Bible teaches that some good people will go to heaven but that many others will live forever here on earth. In fact, I’m sure you’ve heard the famous words: “Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012569/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 5:5</a>, <em>King James Version.</em></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb"><strong>Robert:</strong> Yes, I’ve heard that passage read at church many times.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb"><strong>Marcus:</strong> If the meek inherit the earth, doesn’t that imply that people will be living on the earth? Those who live on the earth will enjoy the benefits foretold here in Revelation. They will see our world completely change because God will do away with everything bad​—even death.</p>

<strong>Trust Jehovah to Fulfill His Purpose</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> Some six centuries after Job and about a thousand years before Jesus came to the earth, David expressed his confidence in a new world. He said in the psalms: “Those hoping in Jehovah are the ones that will possess the earth. And just a little while longer, and the wicked one will be no more . . . But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, and they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace. The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it.” Because of his unwavering hope, David urged: “Trust in Jehovah . . . Also take exquisite delight in Jehovah, and he will give you the requests of your heart.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994204/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Psalm 37:3, 4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994204/33/1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 9-11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994204/33/2" data-bid="34-3" class="b"> 29</a>.</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986007/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Revelation 5:10</a>) Similarly, mild-tempered ones gaining everlasting life as humans will help to restore Paradise conditions over the entire earth.

The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it.” In saying this he evidently drew upon what <em>should</em> have been the case with regard to the Promised Land in his days and in the following generations. According to God’s covenant with Abraham, the wicked pagans who had lived in the land should be cleared out. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974446/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Gen. 15:18-21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974446/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 17:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974446/22/2" data-bid="23-3" class="b"> Deut. 7:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974446/22/3" data-bid="23-4" class="b"> Josh. 21:43-45</a>) Thus each successive generation of righteous worshipers making up the nation of Israel could have resided on the land, the portion of the earth that God gave to them.

In fact, finally God let the Assyrians and Babylonians conquer and depopulate the land temporarily.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">14. Jesus showed that <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974446/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Psalm 37:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974446/43/1" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> 29</a> had what further, grander significance?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> What David wrote in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974446/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Psalm 37</a>, though, was also a glimmering of the prospect that Christians today can have. That David’s words had a broader, large-scale application to the Kingdom rule of the entire earth is seen in the fact that at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974446/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Matthew 5:5</a> Jesus quoted from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974446/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Psalm 37</a>. Did Christ say that its fulfillment was all in the past? No, for he projected it into the future, saying that the ‘mild-tempered <em>will</em> inherit the earth.’ Yes, those mild-tempered <span id="page378" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="378" data-before-text="378"></span>ones who are to be with Christ in his heavenly kingdom will rule over this earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974446/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Rev. 5:9, 10</a>) Jesus knew that the Kingdom would rule the earth in righteousness forever. So, the earth itself will be populated by “righteous” ones who will “reside forever upon it.” Thus, by inspiration, David had described what the finale will be when Jehovah carries out his purpose for our earth. Christians can rejoice that the things of which David saw just glimmerings, and could personally share in only by means of a future resurrection, they can experience. Those whom the Lord puts on his right hand as “sheep” have the opportunity to “reside forever” on a paradise earth governed forever from heaven.</p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The point being emphasized is this: Never again will it be necessary for God’s Son to die sacrificially to recover living creatures from sin and death. Never again will it be necessary for Jehovah God to vindicate himself as Universal Sovereign. These things will have been accomplished once and for all time at the earth. Even if the Creator should at some future time populate other planets—which is something that we do not know—there still would be no need for repetition of Jesus’ sacrifice and the vindication of Jehovah’s <span id="page704" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="704" data-before-text="704"></span>sovereignty. The issues involved will already have been settled forever.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965847/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Heb. 9:28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965847/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 10:12</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">There has been much speculation by worldly scientists and others as to whether there is life on other planets at the present time. Little is known for sure. The Bible is definite in showing that there are vast numbers of spirit creatures in existence, but it does not reveal whether there are physical creatures on other planets.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965847/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rev. 5:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965847/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Matt. 26:53</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Christians, though, have no need to be disturbed over the speculations about present or future life on other planets. Man was placed on the earth, and we are told in the Bible that righteous men will continue to live here throughout eternity. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965847/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 37:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965847/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 115:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965847/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Eccl. 1:4</a>) We can rest assured of that fact, no matter what God may reveal in the future about life on other planets.—See <em>The Photo-Drama of Creation,</em> page 96, paragraph 3, as published in 1914.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>● According to</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965847/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>Leviticus 25:11, 12</strong></a><strong>, the Israelites were not to “sow seed nor reap the land’s growth from spilled kernels” during the Jubilee year, yet they could “eat what the land produces.” How is this seeming inconsistency resolved?—A.K., U.S.A.</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The statutes for the Jubilee were very similar to those for the regular seventh-year sabbath. Jehovah promised to bless the harvest on the sixth year so the Israelites would have sufficient food stored to last until the harvest of crops sowed in the eighth year. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965847/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Lev. 25:20-22</a>) When the land was left uncultivated it would produce some grain from kernels spilled at the previous harvest. During the sabbath and Jubilee years the farmers were to eat from what they had stored, and not to reap and collect into their storehouses what grew from spilled kernels. It was to be left in the field.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">However, a loving provision had been made in the Law allowing the afflicted of the land to glean what remained in the fields after a normal harvest. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965847/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Lev. 19:9, 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965847/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Ruth 2:2, 3</a>) But what were the poor and the alien residents to do during the seventh-year sabbath and the Jubilee? Then they could glean in the fields what grew from grain spilled during the last harvest. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965847/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Lev. 25:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965847/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Ex. 23:11</a>) So, while there would be no harvesting during the Jubilee, Jehovah’s law made provisions for both the farmer with stored food and the poor who would live directly off the land.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Will Sincerity Alone Please God?</strong><br/><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Even among dedicated Christians, however, the individual must not delude himself into thinking that by merely going through the motions he pleases God. Those who are dedicated to God must be whole-souled, <span id="page6" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>obedient from the heart. They must keep his commandments. Their association with other Christians who have respect for all of God’s commandments is no assurance that they are individually pleasing God. They please him if they obey him. If they do not obey him, then their claims of sincerity and their association with other dedicated Christians will not suffice to please God.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">God is not to be mocked. His purposes will stand. What he says he will accomplish, he will certainly do. When he commands humans to worship in a certain way, they should. Yes, sincerity coupled with the performance of God’s will is the way to please him. Sincerity alone, if it is not accompanied by the performance of God’s will, cannot please him.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="ss"><strong>WHY PLEASE?</strong></p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">When a person breaks civil laws, he incurs a penalty. By obeying those laws, he enjoys the benefits of the society that made them. When a person breaks God’s laws, he incurs a penalty. By obeying God’s laws, the benefits that come from God are enjoyed.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">What is the penalty for violations of God’s laws in our time? Since we are living in the last days, near the end of this wicked system of things, the statement of the psalmist takes on added significance: “But the transgressors themselves will certainly be annihilated together.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964000/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 37:38</a>) Violators of God’s laws, even though sincere, will be cut off in death at this system’s end.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">What are the benefits for those who sincerely obey God’s commandments? <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964000/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 37:27</a> promises: “Turn away from what is bad and do what is good, and so reside to time indefinite.” Lovers of what God considers good will live through the end of this system into a new system of things where the earth will be brought back to a paradise condition. There they will indeed “reside to time indefinite” and enjoy the delights of this beautiful earth. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964000/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 37:29</a> helps us to understand how long this “time indefinite” will be for lovers of what is right when it says: “The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it.”</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">Peace and perfect life in a restored paradise will be the lot of those who love God and sincerely follow <em>his</em> ways. Life in that paradise will fulfill all their righteous desires, for of God’s promises the psalmist said: “You are opening your hand and satisfying the desire of every living thing.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964000/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 145:16</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">“Not everyone saying to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will.

Would you not build up hope if you also discovered that he was a powerful ruler?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">If you inquired further and found that this person had established a lifelong reputation of being absolutely trustworthy and had never lied, would you not begin to believe his promise? Then, would you not act on his offer if he actually turned over the title to this land by giving you a deed that had been searched out and was legally binding?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Certainly, at this point, you could be confident that you had actually inherited something of great value. This confidence would enable you to act on the promise, since that promise was assured by your having the deed to the property.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">However, even though you had the assurance and confidence needed, you must still actually work the property, or build upon it, to have it be of use to you.

What does he promise? “The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963326/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 37:29</a>) Can we believe this? “It is impossible for God to lie.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963326/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Heb. 6:18</a>) Does God have it to give? “To Jehovah belong the earth and that which fills it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963326/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 24:1</a>) Does he have the power to fulfill this promise? “Jehovah your God is the God of gods and the Lord of lords, the God great, mighty and fear-inspiring.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963326/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Deut. 10:17</a>) Does his past record show that he can be depended upon to fulfill his promise? “You well know with all your hearts and with all your souls that not one word out of all the good words that Jehovah your God has spoken to you has failed. They have all come true for you. Not one word of them has failed.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963326/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Josh. 23:14</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Because of Jehovah’s authority, power and reliability, we can have an assurance, or confidence, similar to <span id="page281" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="281" data-before-text="281"></span>that of a person who has the title deed to property. Having faith in God’s promises because of his integrity is like having faith that we own property because of possessing a deed to it. It is an assurance that comes because Jehovah has promised it and because he has proved himself completely reliable in fulfilling his promises. This faith in God is best defined for us in the Bible at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963326/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:1</a> in these words: “Faith is the assured expectation of things hoped for.” In the book <em>Word Pictures in the New Testament</em> A. T. Robertson says of this scripture: “We venture to suggest the translation ‘Faith is the title-deed of things hoped for.’” He points out that the Greek word for “assured expectation” has the meaning of what stands under anything, a contract, or a promise. See <em>The Watchtower</em> as of December 15, 1962, page 749, ¶5, 6.</p>

<strong>“Shepherd My Little Sheep”</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Symbolic sheep must also flock together and be willing to follow the leading of the Good Shepherd and their appointed overseers. In fact, they are commanded not to forsake the gathering of themselves together. If one fails to do this, the undershepherds of the congregation know that <span id="page219" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="219" data-before-text="219"></span>he is spiritually sick and needs help. If his feelings have been injured, the soothing oil of God’s Word, when applied with loving-kindness, can often heal his injury.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Because a shepherd in the Near East keeps calling to his sheep as he leads them and also calls them by name, they become familiar with his voice and will respond to it. Jesus referred to this on an occasion when speaking about God’s people: “The doorkeeper opens to this one, and the sheep listen to his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has got all his own out, he travels before them, and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice. A stranger they will by no means follow but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">John 10:3-5</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">The shepherd has a very fatiguing job that calls for much love for his charges. He has to keep them together, find the lost and strayed ones, nurse the sick, care for the injured, keep newly born lambs warm and dry, carry wearied lambs, draw water for the flock, move them to fresh pastures and protect them. Persons who are appointed to positions of oversight in the Christian congregation are expected to show the same loving care for the congregation.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">When Jesus was on earth he began the gathering of a select group of persons who would be privileged to rule with him in the heavens. They are symbolized as a little flock of sheep who follow the Lamb, Jesus Christ. “Have no fear, little flock, because your Father has approved of giving you the kingdom.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Luke 12:32</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">In addition to this small group there is another group of symbolic sheep of undetermined number who will inhabit the earth under the rule of the little flock. Although they are not in the fold of the little flock who inherit the heavenly kingdom with Christ, those now living are gathered to form, with the little flock, one great flock under the watchful care of the Lamb of God. “I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; those also I must bring, and they will listen to my voice, and they will become one flock, one shepherd.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">John 10:16</a>) These meek ones will possess the earth.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 37:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 29</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">There is a style of sheepfold that has been used in Palestine with a partition built across it. When a shepherd has a mixed flock of sheep and goats, he divides the sheep from the goats as they enter the sheepfold in the evening, sending the sheep into one section of the fold and the goats into the other. Jesus referred to this practice in a prophecy pertaining to the last days when he would, as a shepherd, separate the peoples of all nations. “All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. And he will put the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 25:32, 33</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">These are only a few of many Scriptural references that use docile sheep to picture God’s people. From all over the world people who manifest sheeplike characteristics are being gathered into a New World society of dedicated servants of God over whom appointed overseers are obeying Jesus’ command to Peter: “Shepherd my little sheep.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">John 21:16</a>) Because of the good care they receive, they can truthfully say: “Jehovah is my Shepherd. I shall lack nothing.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961248/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 23:1</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Meditation That Is Beneficial</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The psalmist David recognized the role that meditation plays in pleasing God. He stated: “The mouth of the righteous is the one that utters wisdom in an undertone.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102000649/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 37:30</a>) Yes, meditation is an identifying mark of a faithful worshiper. To be considered righteous by God is a real blessing, and it brings spiritual benefits. For example, the Bible says that “the path of the righteous ones is like the bright light that is getting lighter and lighter until the day is firmly established.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102000649/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Proverbs 4:18</a>) Hence, the obedient Christian who “utters wisdom in an undertone” can expect to grow in understanding of the Bible.</p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the generations after Jehovah God brought the nation of Israel into a covenant, individual Israelites came into this covenant relationship by birth. They did not have to make a personal decision to be servants of Jehovah God. Accordingly, heart appreciation was not a prerequisite for being one of God’s covenant people. Yet throughout the course of history many individuals in the nation of Israel not only knew God’s law but also cultivated heart appreciation for it. Regarding the righteous one, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973488/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 37:31</a> says: “The law of his God is in his heart.”</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Nevertheless, there were features of the Law, including the sacrifices and cleansing procedures, that were not fully understood by the Israelites. This was because such features were pictorial of far greater things. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973488/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Colossians 2:17</a> tells us: “Those things are a shadow of the <span id="page416" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="416" data-before-text="416"></span>things to come, but the reality belongs to the Christ.” The Israelites carried out the ceremonial features of the Law primarily because they were commanded to do so and because of the strict penalties imposed for disobedience. Since they did not have the full understanding of these things, their heart appreciation was of necessity limited. Thus it can be seen that God’s law was not inscribed on the mind and heart of every Israelite.</p>

<strong>May God Write on Your Heart?</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> Christ summarized Jehovah’s law as follows: “You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind and with your whole strength,” and, “You must love your neighbor as yourself.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957085/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Mark 12:30, 31</a>, <em>NW</em>) <span id="page84" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="84" data-before-text="84"></span>If we get the love for Jehovah and the love for neighbor in our heart, the seat of motive and affection, then out of that heart we shall say and do what pleases Jehovah. But if we do not have love in our heart, right words and works will be unacceptable, will be hypocritical and doublehearted. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957085/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ps. 12:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957085/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Rom. 13:8-10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957085/16/2" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 1 Cor. 13:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957085/16/3" data-bid="17-4" class="b"> 2 Cor. 9:7</a>) But if Jehovah’s law of love is written in our heart it is a part of us, a part of our personality, an integral part of our seat of motive and hence it will be the source of our motives and the thing that will always move us to act properly.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> “The law of his God is in his heart; his steps do not slip.” Steps directed from a heart inscribed with Jehovah’s law are carefully, surely and firmly placed on solid footing and there will be no slipping or backsliding, no falling from the path of integrity. This world reeks with sin because it has God’s word only in a book, not in its heart: “I have laid up thy word in my heart, that I might not sin against thee.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957085/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 37:31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957085/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 119:11</a>, <em>RS</em>) So a heart filled with Jehovah’s law is a safeguard against sinning and backsliding. This world stresses mental brilliance, but Jehovah looks on the heart. What good is the world’s wisdom when out of a wicked heart it is moved to misuse it and make it foolish in Jehovah’s sight? Is it not better to have an average mind directed into right uses by a good heart than to have a brilliant one misdirected into harmful channels by an evil heart? Do not world leaders even now admit that it is the world’s morals rather than its brains that cry for improvement? But this wicked system refuses the change of heart it needs for survival of Jehovah’s war of Armageddon, though many individuals are abandoning it in order to get the heart change required for preservation, namely, the erasing of wrong precepts from the figurative heart and getting Jehovah’s law written there in their place. How is this done? Please read the next article for the answer.</p>

He should first of all call to mind the reason why such persecution comes. Then he should guard against becoming overconfident in his own strength or in the strength of other persons. Where physical persecution is involved, one’s own physical strength can soon run out.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">The Christian’s strongest defense is his love for God and his complete reliance on Him. Even after his own physical resources have run out, his mental resources will not be exhausted if he leans upon Jehovah. God will give him strength beyond his own capacity in times of stress. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963406/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 46:1, 2</a> promises: “God is for us a refuge and strength, a help that is readily to be found during distresses. That is why we shall not fear.”</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Continually meditate upon God and his purposes. Dwell on his Word in your mind, even though all Bibles and Bible literature are taken away from you. Keep the vision of God’s new world always before your eyes. Most important, “pray incessantly.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963406/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:17</a>) This communication with God is indispensable, otherwise you might think only about the discomfort of the moment and give in to the inclinations of the flesh. If your heart is right, Jehovah will assist you to withstand this persecution, because “God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear, but along with the temptation he will also make the way out in order for you to be able to endure it.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963406/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:13</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="ss"><strong>PREPARE BEFORE PERSECUTION COMES</strong></p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">It is necessary to prepare in advance for persecution. It is good to think now about why persecution is permitted and what our course of action should be, so that when it comes we will be mentally prepared for it.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">We need to build up our faith, courage and integrity day by day. We will endure in proportion to our faith. Faith will be in proportion to our love of God, which, in turn, grows with knowledge. Strong conviction based on Bible reading, study, and association with other Christians is needed. In addition, we must live the truth. It must become part of our lives. In this way we will be put in the way of smaller tests day by day. As we overcome them we will be strengthened to endure the more severe ones that may come later. However, if we shrink back from doing God’s will in our daily lives now, then we will not be prepared to stand the more difficult tests later.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">Learn all you can of God and his purposes now. Let that knowledge reach down into your heart and motivate your entire course of life. Remember, the person who knows God best will trust him the most in time of test.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">We have reached the time of the greatest crisis in the world’s history, a time of shaking and testing for God’s people. Shortly, Satan the Devil will make his final, all-out assault against Jehovah’s worshipers. With complete confidence and reliance on God, Christians will meet this brutal persecution and come off victorious. They will maintain integrity, to God’s honor and glory and to their own salvation. “Hope in Jehovah and keep his way, and he will exalt you to take possession of the earth.

<strong>The Gathering Storm of Armageddon</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">For these reasons, then, symbolic Armageddon, or Har–Magedon, can properly be associated with the “war of the great day <span id="page423" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="423" data-before-text="423"></span>of God the Almighty.” At Armageddon Jehovah God inflicts on his enemies a decisive, crushing defeat that affects all nations and peoples.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>HOW THE STORM BEGINS</strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">The kings of the earth are not spiritually-minded. Their gathering for the final battle cannot mean they challenge God’s heavenly forces. The forces they challenge must be visible.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">The deeper meaning behind the Hebrew expression <em>Har Megiddo,</em> meaning “Mount of Megiddo,” helps us to determine who these forces are. The name Megiddo means “rendezvous or assembly of troops.” Since Megiddo was in the land of Jehovah’s people, the people or troops assembled there now, at this time of the end, must be Jehovah’s modern people. These are engaged in spiritual warfare, preaching the good news of the established kingdom of God, and of the impending doom of this corrupt old system of things.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Because of the spiritual prosperity and growth of these peaceful witnesses of Jehovah, Satan the Devil becomes infuriated and is lured into an all-out attack on these seemingly defenseless Christians. Under his influence the nations march to attack these troops already assembled and gathered out from all nations, not to a literal place, but to Jehovah’s visible organization. Because they are the ones assembled there, they are represented by the place, the symbolic Armageddon, the mountain of Megiddo. The symbolic Armageddon, then, represents in effect the assembled, gathered witnesses of Jehovah now on earth who are engaged in spiritual warfare, preaching Kingdom truths.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">The name of a battle is frequently known by the name of the place where it is fought. Hence, the battle fought by God in defense of his people can be called by that name: the battle of Armageddon. The world-wide assault on Jehovah’s people, described in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960521/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ezekiel, chapters 38 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960521/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 39</a>, provokes that war called Armageddon, “the war of the great day of God the Almighty,” “the day of vengeance on the part of our God.” “And it shall come to pass in that day . . . , saith the Lord Jehovah, that my wrath shall come up into my nostrils.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960521/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Isa. 61:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960521/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Ezek. 38:18</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="ss"><strong>THE RESULTS</strong></p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Jehovah, rising up to defend his people, brings terror to the hearts of the wicked. The battle at Armageddon is on! Governments collapse, fiery showers strike the earth, tidal waves, upheavals of earth, cloudbursts, electrical storms, burning missiles all strike down Satan’s visible hordes. In sheer horror, every man’s hand is turned against his neighbor in a frenzied, selfish fight for survival, all in vain; for Jeremiah long ago declared: “And those slain by Jehovah will certainly come to be in that day from one end of the earth clear to the other end of the earth. They will not be bewailed, neither will they be gathered up or be buried. As manure on the surface of the ground they will become.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960521/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Zech. 14:12, 13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960521/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Jer. 25:33</a>.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">With the destruction of Satan, his demons and earthly organization, the way is cleared for the battle’s survivors, Jehovah’s people, to begin reconstruction that will transform earth into a paradise, free from sorrow, sickness, pain and death.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960521/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Rev. 21:4</a>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">As with a hurricane, those heeding the warning now being sounded of Armageddon’s approach will take steps for safety and survival, for the devastating storm is certain to follow shortly. “Hope in Jehovah and keep his way, and he will exalt you to take possession of the earth. When the wicked ones are cut off you will see it.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960521/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 37:34</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Are You Disturbed?</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">From his own experience in life, the psalmist David came to appreciate that in the long run it is always best to conform to God’s righteous commands. He stated: “A young man I used to be, I have also grown old, and yet I have not seen anyone righteous left entirely, nor his offspring looking for bread. Watch the blameless one and keep the upright one in sight, for the future of that man will be peaceful. But the transgressors themselves will certainly be annihilated together; the future of wicked people will indeed be cut off.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979286/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 37:25,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979286/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 37, 38</a>.</p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">This marking or noting of certain ones as poor examples may be illustrated by contrast with the <em>favorable</em> marking called for at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973369/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 37:37</a>. There the psalmist exhorts: “Watch the blameless one [“mark the man of integrity” (footnote: “take note of”), <em>Jewish Publication Society</em>] and keep the upright one in sight, for the future of that man will be peaceful.” Christians also are urged to ‘keep their eye’ on those setting a fine example among them, observing their conduct and imitating their faith. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973369/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Phil. 3:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973369/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Heb. 13:7</a>) This, of course, does not call for any public naming of such good examples. Their good conduct speaks for itself and becomes known to observers. So, too, does the poor conduct of these disorderly ones, and the congregation members <em>individually</em> ‘mark’ them by taking note of them as persons <em>not</em> to be imitated.</p>

We can answer that question with everlasting benefit if we heed the inspired advice given concerning this old world and if, in doing so, we live for the new world of righteousness: “Do not be loving either the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him; because everything in the world—the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one’s means of life—does not originate with the Father, but originates with the world. Furthermore, the world is passing away and so is its desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963364/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 John 2:15-17</a>) What a contrast with the passing world: Remaining forever!</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>FIRM UNDER PERSECUTION AND BANS</strong></p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 6. What is certain regarding persecution today and in the future?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Today there are a number of countries where the governments are very much opposed to Jehovah’s witnesses because they are preaching the good news of God’s kingdom. When you refer to the 1963 <em>Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses</em> you will find that in the English edition on page 289 there is a report from places where Jehovah’s witnesses work under great difficulties today. Tomorrow? We can say with certainty that increase and extension of persecution and bans will come upon those who do not worship the State and do not herald it as their savior. Wherever there is totalitarian rule it is an easy matter for government officials to arrest Jehovah’s witnesses, throw them into concentration camps and prisons, ban their work, seize their homes, their assembly places and literature, and even burn their Bibles.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 7.

Primarily it is a matter of maintaining the right mental attitude. How is this possible? It is possible because of the clear insight received from Jehovah through his Word. Jehovah’s witnesses are not in doubt as to the situation. They are alerted so that even the great attack by Gog does not come upon them as a surprise without foreknowledge, forewarning and forearming on their part. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963364/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezekiel, chaps. 38 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963364/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 39</a>) Even now in advance, and during that attack, blameless ones who are steadfast under vicious persecution may know that their future will be peaceful. “Watch the blameless one and keep the upright one in sight, for the future of that man will be peaceful. But the transgressors themselves will certainly be annihilated together; the future of wicked people will indeed be cut off.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963364/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 37:37, 38</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 8.

Each one knows that God’s Word says: “Preach the Word, be at it urgently in favorable season, in troublesome season, reprove, reprimand, exhort, with all long-suffering and art of teaching.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963364/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Tim. 4:2</a>) Discharging the responsibility that each individual knows he has in conforming to the solemn charge to preach “in troublesome season,” his plans are made carefully. Under ban smaller groups of preachers are less conspicuous. Individual activity is sometimes hardly noticed.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 9.

To assist in this, overseers can keep ministers informed on effective ways for starting conversations with strangers, tactfully finding out if they are sheeplike. By this means, even under ban, search out who is worthy. Those who are proved to be interested can be called on regularly, and thus the backcall work be continued. In this way in various lands Bible studies are established and held, and people are helped even to the point of dedication to God and baptism despite bans.</p>

All of this bespeaks their energeticalness and courageousness in preaching the good news of God’s kingdom in all parts of the world. All of this was done in spite of opposition, persecution and many hardships. Jesus would be doing the same thing today if he were on the earth. Jehovah’s witnesses are imitators of Christ because they have faith in him. This faith keeps them on the move. Peter, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, had such faith too and he said: “According to his great mercy he gave us a new birth to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962003/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:3</a>) Jehovah’s witnesses would like all people to have that hope, and that is why they have become imitators of Christ Jesus and show courage <span id="page27" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span>in preaching the good news in these last days of this wicked system of things.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">23.

Life in that paradise will fulfill all their righteous desires, for of God’s promises the psalmist said: “You are opening your hand and satisfying the desire of every living thing.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964000/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 145:16</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">“Not everyone saying to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will. Many will say to me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and expel demons in your name, and perform many powerful works in your name?’ And yet then I will confess to them: I never knew you! Get away from me, you workers of lawlessness.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964000/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 7:21-23</a>.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Jehovah, Our ‘Fortress in Times of Distress’</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> In harmony with Jesus’ prayer, Jehovah is indeed watching over us. He is our “fortress <span id="page18" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>in the time of distress.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004604/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 37:39</a>) The book of Proverbs uses similar language when it says: “The name of Jehovah is a strong tower. Into it the righteous runs and is given protection.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004604/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Proverbs 18:10</a>) This scripture reveals a basic truth about Jehovah’s tender concern for his creatures. God offers protection especially to righteous ones who actively seek him, as if we were running into a strong tower for shelter.</p>
