Hence, the term “horn” figuratively denotes power, or strength. Jehovah raises up the horns of his people, causing them to be exalted, whereas he ‘cuts down the horns of the wicked ones.’ We are warned against ‘exalting our horn on high’ in that we should not take on a proud or arrogant attitude. Since Jehovah does the exalting, assignments of responsibility in the congregation are to be viewed as coming from him.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006523/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Psalm 75:7</a>.</p>

<strong>The Calamity Facing All Religionists of the World</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> As in the case of Jerusalem’s destruction earlier in 607 B.C.E., destruction was to come upon Babylon from out of the “north.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980367/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ezek. 1:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980367/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 9:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980367/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Jer. 50:41;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980367/10/3" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 51:48</a>) As respects direction, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980367/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 75:6, 7</a> apparently associates God with the north when saying: “Neither from the east nor from the west, nor from the south is there <span id="page23" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>an exalting. For God is the judge. This one he abases, and that one he exalts.” By way of the northern route, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came in 609 B.C.E. against Jerusalem and her rebellious king, Zedekiah. Two years later “the inhabitress of Zion” could exclaim: “Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon . . . has swallowed me down like a big snake [or, dragon].” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980367/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Jer. 51:34, 35</a>) As to Jehovah God’s connection with Jerusalem’s destruction, Jeremiah quotes him as saying back in 614 B.C.E. the following words regarding Nebuchadnezzar as his executional tool: “You are a club for me, as weapons of war, and by you I shall certainly dash nations [Judah, Egypt, Moab, Ammon, Edom, and others] to pieces, and by you I will bring kingdoms to ruin. . . . and by you I will dash governors and deputy rulers to pieces.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980367/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Jer. 51:20-23</a>.</p>

<strong>Enlarging Your Privileges of Service</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> As you progress you may find that you are privileged to oversee a part of the congregation’s service meeting program. Many regularly are called on to do this. How should this be viewed? Paul answers: “He that presides, let him do it in real earnest.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961564/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Rom. 12:8</a>) When given this privilege, even if it should be every week, do not put off preparation for the last minute and then hastily gather some ideas just to fill the assigned time. You have been entrusted with serving to the congregation of God’s people spiritual food and counsel from His table; never treat it as something common. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961564/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Mal. 1:12</a>) Carefully study your assignment well in advance. Give consideration to presenting the material in such a way that it will be directly applicable to the circumstances of those in the congregation. Your assignment is not merely to present information, but to put it across in such a way that all will appreciate its value, remember it and use it. Your effectiveness will be reflected in their effectiveness in the field ministry, and, in <span id="page467" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="467" data-before-text="467"></span>turn, in the lives of those to whom they minister.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 9. What service opportunities have opened up as a result of the increase in the number of congregations?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Productive field ministry has resulted in an amazing increase in the number of congregations, and this too opens opportunities for enlarged service. Just think: During the last two years 3,130 new congregations of Jehovah’s people were formed world-wide! This means that during that time 3,130 new congregation overseers were needed, besides over 21,000 ministerial servants and more than 160 circuit and district servants to visit at regular intervals. Yet this is not all. In nearly every congregation there are openings for mature brothers to enlarge their privileges by taking on servant responsibilities, for many of those now assigned hold two and three positions.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu">10. (a) How does one reach out for the office of overseer? (b) Why is this the right course to pursue?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Paul commends those who are reaching out for such service, saying: “If any man is reaching out for an office of overseer, he is desirous of a right kind of work.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961564/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Tim. 3:1</a>) It is not honor that they seek; they are desirous of work, the right kind of work; they want to do more in Jehovah’s service and to be of greater service to their Christian brothers. As we have already seen in the parable of the minas, someone reaches out for the office of overseer, he shows himself worthy of being entrusted with greater responsibility, by proving himself faithful and showing increase in caring for what has already been put into his care. If he is diligent and acquires skill in the house-to-house ministry, makes back-calls, conducts progressive home Bible studies, is regular in all the features of the service, handles each assignment on the congregation meetings in an upbuilding manner, and manifests in all that he does the fruits of God’s spirit, he is showing by his faithful course that he qualifies to be used as an overseer. Overseers are such, not because they have gained the attention of some prominent brother, but because they have won the approval of God. Having proved themselves faithful in little things, they are blessed by God with greater responsibilities. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961564/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ps. 75:5-7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961564/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Luke 16:10</a>) Are you pursuing such a course of faithfulness in caring for the Kingdom interests entrusted to your care?</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu">11. What is it that motivates one to take up pioneer service, and what arrangement makes it possible for many to share in this service?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Thousands of forward-looking ministers in the New World society, knowing that nothing this old world has compares in value with God’s service, have organized their affairs to devote more time to the actual preaching and teaching work as full-time pioneer ministers. Tens of thousands more, although they have responsibilities that make it impossible to be regular pioneers, also have their eyes on enlarged service privileges. Through careful planning they are able to buy out the opportune time to the extent of two weeks or a month or more each year for vacation pioneer service. Their heart is in Jehovah’s service, and they are constantly on the watch for opportunities to share more fully in it. They keep testing whether they are pursuing the course of true faith, and they are moved to exert themselves to make opportunities thus to enlarge their service.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961564/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Eph. 5:15, 16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961564/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 13:5</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">12.

Why? It is not that they had no family obligations or other responsibilities or had an abundance of money they did not know how else to use. Rather, they are keenly aware of the will of God for our day; they have faith in God <span id="page468" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="468" data-before-text="468"></span>that this work of Witnessing that is now being done is the most important for our day. Having heard the call for help in the ministry from these other places, they felt as did Paul and his companions when Paul had a vision of a Macedonian man who was beseeching him and saying: “Step over into Macedonia and help us.” “Now as soon as he had seen the vision,” the account continues, “we sought to go forth into Macedonia, drawing the conclusion that <em>God had summoned us</em> to declare the good news to them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961564/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Acts 16:9, 10</a>) So, today, those who have responded to the call feel that it is God who has summoned them, that he is the one who has showed them this open door of service, and, like Isaiah, they respond: “Here I am! Send me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961564/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Isa. 6:8</a>) Their faith is being richly rewarded as they aid those who hunger and thirst for righteousness to take hold of the service of the true God with them.</p>

But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.” The visible headquarters of God’s typical theocratic organization of Israel was spoken of as being in or on “the sides of the north”. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952083/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 48:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952083/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Isa. 14:13</a>) So not from east or west or south but from Jehovah through his channel was proper promotion to come. He worked through that one theocratic organization, not several. In time it was replaced by a new system, and for a new, visible theocratic organization Christ “gave gifts in men”, which men served in various capacities in the one theocratic arrangement. They were promoted to their positions by Jehovah, and all were united in just the one hope, one faith, one baptism. Nothing interfaith about this visible theocratic organization. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952083/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Eph. 4:4-13</a>, <em>NW</em>) As foretold, after the death of the apostles and their co-workers wolfish ones scattered and split the flock into divisive sects and disrupted the visible organization. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952083/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 20:29, 30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952083/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 2 Pet. 2:1</a>) In our present time the visible theocratic organization has been restored by the setting up of “the faithful and discreet slave”.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>“THE FAITHFUL AND DISCREET SLAVE”</strong></p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="qu"> 5.

Under the term “slave” Christ’s anointed followers of today are viewed as a class, a composite slave or composite servant. God himself so interprets matters: “Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952083/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa. 43:10</a>, <em>AS</em>) Note that many witnesses are called one servant. Under the term “domestics” those making up the slave class are viewed as individuals. They are spoken of as “body of attendants” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952083/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 12:42</a> (<em>NW</em>).

S. Lewis, renders it “companions”, that is, companion slaves. They are domestic slaves in the household of God and, as a united class or society, are termed “the faithful and discreet slave”. Similarly, when a number of domestics turn wicked and start to beat their <span id="page78" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="78" data-before-text="78"></span>fellow slaves these evildoers become the foretold “evil slave” class.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952083/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 24:48-51</a>, <em>NW.</em></p>

<strong>Humility</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">All, men and women, should be submissive to those taking the lead and should wait on Jehovah for any appointments or assignments to responsibility, for it is from him that promotion comes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002102/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Ps 75:6, 7</a>) As some of the Levite sons of Korah said: “I have chosen to stand at the threshold in the house of my God rather than to move around in the tents of wickedness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002102/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Ps 84:10</a>) Such true humility takes time to develop.

<strong>Enlarging Your Privileges of Service</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> As you progress you may find that you are privileged to oversee a part of the congregation’s service meeting program. Many regularly are called on to do this. How should this be viewed? Paul answers: “He that presides, let him do it in real earnest.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961564/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Rom. 12:8</a>) When given this privilege, even if it should be every week, do not put off preparation for the last minute and then hastily gather some ideas just to fill the assigned time. You have been entrusted with serving to the congregation of God’s people spiritual food and counsel from His table; never treat it as something common. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961564/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Mal. 1:12</a>) Carefully study your assignment well in advance. Give consideration to presenting the material in such a way that it will be directly applicable to the circumstances of those in the congregation. Your assignment is not merely to present information, but to put it across in such a way that all will appreciate its value, remember it and use it. Your effectiveness will be reflected in their effectiveness in the field ministry, and, in <span id="page467" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="467" data-before-text="467"></span>turn, in the lives of those to whom they minister.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 9. What service opportunities have opened up as a result of the increase in the number of congregations?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Productive field ministry has resulted in an amazing increase in the number of congregations, and this too opens opportunities for enlarged service. Just think: During the last two years 3,130 new congregations of Jehovah’s people were formed world-wide! This means that during that time 3,130 new congregation overseers were needed, besides over 21,000 ministerial servants and more than 160 circuit and district servants to visit at regular intervals. Yet this is not all. In nearly every congregation there are openings for mature brothers to enlarge their privileges by taking on servant responsibilities, for many of those now assigned hold two and three positions.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu">10. (a) How does one reach out for the office of overseer? (b) Why is this the right course to pursue?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Paul commends those who are reaching out for such service, saying: “If any man is reaching out for an office of overseer, he is desirous of a right kind of work.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961564/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Tim. 3:1</a>) It is not honor that they seek; they are desirous of work, the right kind of work; they want to do more in Jehovah’s service and to be of greater service to their Christian brothers. As we have already seen in the parable of the minas, someone reaches out for the office of overseer, he shows himself worthy of being entrusted with greater responsibility, by proving himself faithful and showing increase in caring for what has already been put into his care. If he is diligent and acquires skill in the house-to-house ministry, makes back-calls, conducts progressive home Bible studies, is regular in all the features of the service, handles each assignment on the congregation meetings in an upbuilding manner, and manifests in all that he does the fruits of God’s spirit, he is showing by his faithful course that he qualifies to be used as an overseer. Overseers are such, not because they have gained the attention of some prominent brother, but because they have won the approval of God. Having proved themselves faithful in little things, they are blessed by God with greater responsibilities. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961564/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ps. 75:5-7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961564/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Luke 16:10</a>) Are you pursuing such a course of faithfulness in caring for the Kingdom interests entrusted to your care?</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu">11. What is it that motivates one to take up pioneer service, and what arrangement makes it possible for many to share in this service?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Thousands of forward-looking ministers in the New World society, knowing that nothing this old world has compares in value with God’s service, have organized their affairs to devote more time to the actual preaching and teaching work as full-time pioneer ministers. Tens of thousands more, although they have responsibilities that make it impossible to be regular pioneers, also have their eyes on enlarged service privileges. Through careful planning they are able to buy out the opportune time to the extent of two weeks or a month or more each year for vacation pioneer service. Their heart is in Jehovah’s service, and they are constantly on the watch for opportunities to share more fully in it. They keep testing whether they are pursuing the course of true faith, and they are moved to exert themselves to make opportunities thus to enlarge their service.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961564/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Eph. 5:15, 16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961564/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 13:5</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">12. Why are individuals and families moving out to serve where the need for Kingdom witnesses is great?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Other stronghearted individuals and family groups have pulled up stakes and moved out to new localities and even to foreign countries where the need for Kingdom witnesses is great. Why? It is not that they had no family obligations or other responsibilities or had an abundance of money they did not know how else to use. Rather, they are keenly aware of the will of God for our day; they have faith in God <span id="page468" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="468" data-before-text="468"></span>that this work of Witnessing that is now being done is the most important for our day. Having heard the call for help in the ministry from these other places, they felt as did Paul and his companions when Paul had a vision of a Macedonian man who was beseeching him and saying: “Step over into Macedonia and help us.” “Now as soon as he had seen the vision,” the account continues, “we sought to go forth into Macedonia, drawing the conclusion that <em>God had summoned us</em> to declare the good news to them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961564/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Acts 16:9, 10</a>) So, today, those who have responded to the call feel that it is God who has summoned them, that he is the one who has showed them this open door of service, and, like Isaiah, they respond: “Here I am! Send me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961564/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Isa. 6:8</a>) Their faith is being richly rewarded as they aid those who hunger and thirst for righteousness to take hold of the service of the true God with them.</p>

The lessons that we can draw from history ancient and modern indicate that. The fact that all the nations are bound to drink such a gagging potion makes it certain that God, the “King of the nations,” judges them to be “wicked.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979687/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 75:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979687/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Jer. 10:7</a>) So, at his hand, they will be forced to drink the very dregs out of the “cup” of the foaming, heavily spiced wine. But what about us who hope for a future that turns out happy? How can we escape from drinking along with the doomed nations that death-dealing potion out of the “cup”? Logically, we need to listen to whatever counsel is given by the One who will hold out that “cup” to the nations at his due time and then act promptly in line with that counsel. Will we do so?</p>

<strong>A Pattern of Action for Pleasing God</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Abraham was living in a place called Mamre, near Hebron. On being informed of Lot’s capture, Abraham, who had left Shinar for good, certainly did not intend to let Lot be taken back if he could help it. So he mustered his 318 trained slaves and went in pursuit, accompanied by three confederates. This was no short pursuit of a few miles, but a long forced march up to <span id="page412" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="412" data-before-text="412"></span>Dan, more than a hundred miles north of Jerusalem and less than forty miles from Damascus. He was outnumbered, but with heavenly wisdom he divided his forces, defeated them and pursued them clear beyond Damascus, recovering all the goods and especially Lot his kinsman.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964485/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Gen. 14:13-16</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>WORSHIPERS OF THE MOST HIGH GOD</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Who was responsible for that victory? <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964485/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Genesis 14:18-20</a> tells us that, as Abraham marched back victorious toward Jerusalem, “Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine, and he was priest of the Most High God. Then he blessed him and said: ‘Blessed be Abram of the Most High God, Producer of heaven and earth; and blessed be the Most High God, who has delivered your oppressors into your hand!’ At that Abram gave him a tenth of everything.”</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">So true worship had not been introduced into the land by Abraham, for here we find a very important worshiper of Jehovah already there, in fact, the first priest or <em>cohén</em> mentioned in the Bible, this one being a priest of the one living and true God, at the same time being a king, with appointment from the Most High God himself. He was king of Salem. According to ancient Jewish and Christian understanding, Salem was the original part of what became Jerusalem. Thus at this ancient city Abraham met the <em>cohén</em> or priest of Jehovah sometime before 1933 B.C.E.—See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964485/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 76:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964485/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 147:12</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Melchizedek was a descendant of the Flood-survivor Noah, a human worshiper of the Most High God, not a materialized angel. But the Bible does not plainly say that he was Noah’s son Shem, who was still alive. It purposely leaves out all information as to his ancestry, his descendants and his death so that he might serve as a prophetic picture or type of the promised Seed of God’s woman, who becomes the everlasting High Priest of the Most High God, to give the sacrifice that results in eternal salvation for mankind.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The greatness of this man is described by the apostle Paul at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964485/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Hebrews 6:20 to 7:7</a>, in which he says: “In being fatherless, motherless, without genealogy, having neither a beginning of days nor an end of life [in the written record], but having been made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually. Behold, then, how great this man was . . . the man [Melchizedek] who did not trace his genealogy from [the Levite priests] took tithes from Abraham [from whom the Levites descended] and blessed him who had the promises [from Jehovah God]. Now without any dispute, the less is blessed by the greater.”</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">King David of Jerusalem wrote under inspiration showing that this coming one, who would be the greater High Priest like Melchizedek, would be a heavenly High Priest, when he said: “The utterance of Jehovah to my <em>Lord</em> is: ‘Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.’ The rod of your strength Jehovah will send out of Zion, . . . Jehovah has sworn (and he will feel no regret): ‘You are a priest to time indefinite according to the manner of Melchizedek!’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964485/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964485/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 4</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Melchizedek, king of this city that later became Jerusalem, proved to be against Babylon, for he blessed Abraham for having routed and despoiled the king of Shinar and his allies. This proves that God’s servants from the beginning were enemies of Babylon, for not only did Abraham get out of Babylon at God’s call, but he also fought against the king of Babylonia (Shinar) when the need arose. Abraham attributed the victory to God in giving Melchizedek, God’s priest, a tenth of the spoils while refusing to take anything for himself.</p>

Give thanks to Jehovah, you people, for he is good, for to time indefinite is his loving-kindness.” To this song the people said Amen.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Chron. 15:1 to 16:36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 13:1-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 2 Sam. 6:1-19</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">David did not take the glory and credit to himself as Israel’s real king, but <em>he recognized that he ruled in the name of Jehovah on “Jehovah’s throne.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:23</a>) And <em>the people were encouraged to recognize this</em> in the psalm of Korah’s sons:</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="si">“Jehovah is great and much to be praised in the city of our God, in his holy mountain.

Jehovah responded in appreciation through his prophet Nathan:</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="si">“I shall prove to be with you wherever you do go, and I will cut off all your enemies from before you; and I shall certainly make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones that are in the earth. . . . ‘And Jehovah has told you that a house is what Jehovah will make for you. . . .

Wrote the psalmist: “Let the mountains carry peace to the people, also the hills, through righteousness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Ps. 72:3</a>) In harmony with this psalm, the blessings that are spoken of in connection with God’s mountain, such as Jehovah’s banquet for all the peoples, would be experienced on earth.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Isa. 25:6</a>; see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/53/1" data-bid="54-2" class="b"> 65:25</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong><em>Associated with worship</em></strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Mount Zion became a holy mountain when David brought the sacred Ark to the tent that he had pitched there.

With reference to this choosing, David wrote: “The mountainous region of Bashan is a mountain of God [that is, created by God]; the mountainous region of Bashan is a mountain of peaks. Why do you, O you mountains of peaks, keep watching enviously the mountain that God has desired for himself to dwell in? Even Jehovah himself will reside there forever. . . . Jehovah himself has come from Sinai [where he first revealed his presence to the entire nation of Israel] into the holy place.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Ps. 68:15-17</a>) The mountainous region of Bashan may be said to reach its crest in Mount Hermon and, therefore, this mountain may be meant by the words the “mountain of God” and the “mountain of peaks.” Although Mount Hermon towers far above Mount Zion, Jehovah chose the less conspicuous location for his place of dwelling.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">After the temple was built on Mount Moriah, the term “Zion” came to include the temple site and therefore Zion remained God’s holy mountain.

There is no evidence that such a thing ever took place in connection with the literal temple at Jerusalem. But there is evidence of a fulfillment upon the Christian congregation of spiritual Israel, which is associated with the spiritual temple of Jehovah God. The invitation to become part of spiritual Israel began to be extended to non-Jews in the year 36 C.E.

The fact that the “mountain of the house of Jehovah” was to be above mountains and hills would point to the exalted position of true worship, for mountains and hills anciently served as sites for idolatrous worship and for sanctuaries of false deities.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/0" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Deut. 12:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/1" data-bid="68-2" class="b"> Jer. 3:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/2" data-bid="68-3" class="b"> Ezek. 18:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/3" data-bid="68-4" class="b"> 11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/4" data-bid="68-5" class="b"> 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/67/5" data-bid="68-6" class="b"> Hos. 4:13</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong><em>Obstacles</em></strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">At times mountains represent obstacles.

Therefore, when the psalmist spoke of Jehovah’s righteousness as being like “mountains of God” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013054/72/0" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Ps. 36:6</a>) he may have meant that Jehovah’s righteousness is immovable.

<strong>Sleep</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>Death Compared With Sleep.</strong> There is evidence that people sleep in cycles. Each cycle is made up of a deep sleep followed by a lighter sleep. During periods of deep sleep it is very difficult to awaken a person. He is completely unaware of his surroundings and the things that may be occurring about him. There is no conscious activity. Similarly, the dead are “conscious of nothing at all.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004162/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ec 9:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004162/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004162/19/2" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> Ps 146:4</a>) Therefore death, whether that of a man or of an animal, is like sleep.

<strong>The Price for Breaking God’s Law</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Why is this so? Because man alone was created in God’s likeness, being endowed with a measure of those attributes that his Creator has in their infinity and perfection, namely, love, justice, wisdom and power. These qualities make man accountable to God, and so when man violates any of God’s laws he pays a price therefor in one or more ways. Thus when man breaks God’s law it makes for bad relations with his Creator, with his fellowman, with himself <span id="page358" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="358" data-before-text="358"></span>and even with the lower animals. Further, breaking God’s law results in pain, mental, physical or emotional; it results in harm to his personality and eventually it brings about his death.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">For an initial illustration let us take the very first instance, that of the first human pair, Adam and Eve. Some may object on the ground that the record is based on a myth. But note that Genesis is not the only Bible book that presents Adam as the primogenitor of the human race. The writer of the book of First Chronicles likewise gives him that distinction, even as do both the Gospel writer Luke and the apostle Paul. The disciple Jude implies the same thing in speaking of Enoch as “the seventh man in line from Adam.” And the Lord Jesus himself referred to the Genesis account concerning Adam and Eve as authoritative.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 3:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 1:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Luke 3:38;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/2/3" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 1 Cor. 15:45;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/2/4" data-bid="3-5" class="b"> 1 Tim. 2:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/2/5" data-bid="3-6" class="b"> Jude 14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/2/6" data-bid="3-7" class="b"> Matt. 19:4, 5</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>BAD RELATIONS WITH GOD AND WITH FELLOWMEN</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">What happened in the case of that first human couple?

This is apparent from the very tone of the words God addressed to Adam and Eve upon their transgression: “From the tree from which I commanded you not to eat have you [Adam] eaten?” And, “What is this you [Eve] have done?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 3:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 13</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">We cannot escape it. Breaking God’s laws brings with it bad relations with our Maker, Jehovah God, and especially so when there is negligence or even willfulness, as in the case of Adam and Eve. Well did the psalmist state: “You—fear-inspiring you are, and who can stand before you because of the strength of your anger?” It is the utmost folly to incur God’s anger, for “we are not stronger than he is, are we?” Wisdom dictates that we guard against breaking God’s law, so that we might be the recipients of his loving-kindness, his favor, which “is better than life.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 76:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 10:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Ps. 63:3</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Secondly, breaking God’s laws makes for bad relations with our fellowmen. How did Adam feel when he saw that Eve had taken from the fruit that was forbidden and was now forcing him to make a decision by offering him some of it? Evidently not very lovingly, as can be seen from his later remarks, referring to her as “the woman” and blaming her—”she gave me fruit from the tree and so I ate it.” And how must Eve have felt when she heard these words blaming her instead of hearing Adam stand up like a man and shoulder his own blame? Truly their mutual transgression had resulted in poor relations with each other.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Gen. 3:12</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">So it has been ever since. Transgressors of God’s laws often pay the price of bad relations with their fellowmen in that they get on one another’s nerves, or become bitter toward one another. Also, society or their particular group may take action against them as when they are fined, put in prison or are excommunicated. If not always such extreme penalties, there invariably is dishonor, shame or disgrace. The one breaking God’s laws may try to keep it secret, but in vain, for “there is nothing . . . secret that will not become known.” “Honor is what the wise ones,” who keep God’s law, “will come to possess, but the stupid ones are exalting dishonor.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 10:26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Prov. 3:35</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>BAD RELATIONS WITH ONESELF AND WITH BEASTS</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Bad relations with oneself in the form of a guilty conscience are a further price paid by the one breaking God’s law. Both Adam and Eve immediately had guilty <span id="page359" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="359" data-before-text="359"></span>consciences upon breaking God’s law; that is why they hid themselves. “All things are clean to clean persons,” but they no longer felt clean, due to their sin. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Titus 1:15</a>) When man knowingly breaks God’s laws he, in effect, rebels at the degree of freedom God grants him and goes beyond that, only to become a slave to a bad conscience, so having less freedom than before.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Gen. 3:7</a>.</p>

<strong>“Your Plans Will Be Firmly Established”</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Jehovah can also make circumstances work out in such a way that the wicked unknowingly serve his purpose. The psalmist said: “The very rage of man will laud you; the remainder of raging you [Jehovah] will gird upon yourself.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007365/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Psalm 76:10</a>) Jehovah may allow his enemies to express their rage toward his servants​—but only to the extent necessary to discipline his people and thus train them. What is in excess of this, God takes upon himself.</p>

Any hardship we may experience can discipline us in some way. Jehovah permits suffering only to the extent that it provides such training. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006523/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:10</a>) ‘The remainder of raging by man, God girds upon himself.’ What if we suffer to the point of death? This too can laud Jehovah because those who see us faithfully endure may also begin to glorify God.</p>

Moreover, the suffering is for a relatively short time and will come to an end.</p>

<strong>Jeduthun</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Three of the psalms mention Jeduthun in their superscriptions. Two of them (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002360/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps 39,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002360/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 62</a>) read “To the director <em>of</em> Jeduthun” (“after the manner of [the choir of] Jeduthun,” <em>Ro</em> ftn on <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002360/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">superscription of Ps 39</a>), while the third (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002360/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps 77</a>) reads “To the director <em>on</em> Jeduthun.” (<em>NW; Ro;</em> “upon,” <em>AT</em>) In each case the composition of the psalm is attributed to someone else, the first two to David and the third to Asaph; so there is no suggestion that Jeduthun composed them, though he is elsewhere called <span id="page1264" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1264" data-before-text="1264"></span>“the visionary of the king” and it is also said that he “was prophesying with the harp.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002360/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2Ch 35:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002360/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 1Ch 25:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002360/13/2" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 3</a>) Therefore, the superscriptions of these three psalms are evidently instructions for their performance, perhaps identifying a style or even a musical instrument that was somehow associated with Jeduthun, or that he or his sons may have invented, introduced, developed, or made common through usage.</p>

<strong>Do You Value Your Privacy?</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">The psalmist Asaph resolved: “With my heart I will show concern, and my spirit will carefully search.” “I meditate in my heart,” “wonder to myself in the night,” “my spirit will carefully search,” “I muse and make mental explorations,” “musing in my inward quest.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978129/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 77:6</a>, as rendered by different translations.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">“Ponder over these things; be absorbed in them,” the apostle Paul stressed in counseling young Timothy.

<strong>Will You Get to Live on Earth Forever?</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[27]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> How can you keep from being vomited out of the land then? By separating from “those ruining the earth.” Fit into God’s purpose for the cleansed earth by reflecting God’s praise along with the earth. Start doing that now. Do it, not in the way that you think is right, but in the way that God says is right. Learn his way by studying his Word. It is by such study of <span id="page468" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="468" data-before-text="468"></span>the Bible that you will “quit being fashioned after this system of things, but be transformed by making your mind over, that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and complete will of God.” By this study “you should put away the old personality which conforms to your former course of conduct” and “you should be made new in the force actuating your mind, and should put on the new personality which was created according to God’s will in true righteousness and loving-kindness.” Then you will live “no more for the desires of men, but for God’s will. For the time that has passed by is sufficient for you to have worked out the will of the nations when you proceeded in deeds of loose conduct, lusts, excesses with wine, revelries, drinking matches, and idolatries that are without legal restraint. Because you do not continue running with them in this course to the same low sink of debauchery, they are puzzled and go on speaking abusively of you. But these people will render an account to the one ready to judge those living and those dead.” However, your study and changed way of thinking and acting will deliver you from Jehovah’s destructive judgments at Armageddon.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rom. 12:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Eph. 4:22-24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 1 Pet. 4:2-5</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="qu"> 5.

The Bible frequently counsels us to do it. Joshua was told to take the book of the law and “meditate therein day and night,” or, more accurately expressed, “in an undertone read in it day and night.” This reading in an undertone is like talking to yourself, an audible musing, and since it is slower than reading to yourself it keeps the idea on the mind longer to soak in and be absorbed more. Moreover, it enters the mind in two ways, through both the eye and the ear, which impresses it on the mind with greater force. It is said of the happy man: “In the law of Jehovah is his delight, and in his law doth he talk with himself [soliloquise, <em>margin</em>] day and night. So doth he become like a tree planted beside channels of waters, that yieldeth its fruit in its season.” Taking in Jehovah’s waters of truth will enable us to bring forth Christian fruitage. We should copy this psalmist’s example: “I commune with my heart in the night; I meditate and search my spirit.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Josh. 1:8</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 1:2, 3</a>, <em>RoPss;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957565/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps 77:6</a>, <em>RS</em>.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="qu"> 6.

This will impress the truths on our own mind for the guidance of our tongue. Such meditation and self-preparation was done by Christ Jesus, the Greater David: “Of the glorious splendor of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works, I will meditate,” or, “soliloquise.” During Jesus’ forty-day fast and isolation in the wilderness after his baptism he meditated, trying to take in the full meaning of the things that the opened heavens had bared to his view. This meditation fortified him for what was ahead. The Bible shows that from time to time Jesus sought solitude for meditation and prayer: “He went up into the mountain by himself,” and, “He continued in retirement in the deserts and praying.” But it was difficult for Jesus to get the solitude he needed for meditation and prayer: “He went out and proceeded to a lonely place. But the crowds began hunting about for him and came out as far as he was,” and, “Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he rose up and went outside and left for a lonely place,” but “those with him hunted him down and found him.” To avoid city crowds “he continued outside in lonely places.

<strong>Mercy</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><strong><em>Mankind’s need.</em></strong> Obviously, mankind’s basic and greatest disability comes from sin, inherited from their forefather Adam. Thus, all are in dire need, in a pitiable state. Jehovah God has acted mercifully toward mankind as a whole by providing the means for them to become free from this great disability and its consequences of sickness and death.

His exercise of mercy is always in harmony with his other qualities and righteous standards, including his justice and holiness. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974605/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hos. 2:19</a>) Anyone presuming upon God’s mercy, thinking that God will continue his mercy toward that one no matter what he does, is doomed to bitter disappointment.

<strong>Has God Forgotten Man?</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong><em>The Question of Human Suffering</em></strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Yet human suffering has been so prevalent that even a righteous man was once moved to ask: “Has God forgotten to be favorable?” This man, however, rather than jumping to a conclusion, made a careful search, which led him to exclaim: “O God, your way is in the holy place. . . . You are the true God, doing marvelously. . . . You have led your people just like a flock.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101972762/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 77:9-14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101972762/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 20</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">But in the face of all the wickedness and human suffering on earth, some persons may wonder how anyone could reach such a conclusion. ‘How could a good God who is Almighty allow this suffering?’ they ask.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Think about that for a moment. If God really has irresponsibly abandoned his earthly children, he is no longer good, is he? Yet it is obvious, as we have seen, that God has done and continues to do tremendous good for man! So, does this not indicate that God has very good reasons for temporarily permitting human suffering?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">One may at first think that nothing could warrant permission of the suffering that mankind has experienced over the centuries. But is it right to jump to such a conclusion? Why, circumstances can arise where a good parent may permit a beloved child to undergo suffering temporarily. A painful operation, for instance, may be permitted because it is considered necessary.</p>

What solution does the Bible offer?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">IN THE privacy of their modest home a serious-faced railroad man and his wife discussed life’s problems with a visiting minister. They had experienced their share of sickness, worry and the struggle to make a living, but they were not complaining. Yet the man of the house did have a question that had often puzzled him: “How is it that a man who tries to live right has such a hard time, while bad people seem to have it good?” This situation made him wonder if God had forgotten. How would you explain it?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The minister had been asked that question before. In fact, people were asking just about the same thing in the days of the prophet Malachi. Here is what the prophet told his countrymen: “You have said, ‘It is of no value to serve God. And what profit is there in that we have kept the obligation to him, and that we have walked dejectedly on account of Jehovah of armies? And at present we are pronouncing presumptuous people happy. Also, the doers of wickedness have been built up. Also, they have tested God out and keep getting away.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963000/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mal. 3:14, 15</a>) Even men who loved God and served him faithfully sometimes asked: “Has God forgotten to be favorable, or has he shut off his mercies in anger?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963000/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 77:9</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Today lawbreakers still echo the insolence of the wicked men who boasted: “God has forgotten. He has concealed his face. He will certainly never see it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963000/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 10:11</a>) Yes, the railroad man asked a common question. Both good and bad people have imagined that God has forgotten man. In our day some arrive at that conclusion, not only because of personal problems, but due to the condition of the world in general.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">For example, they reflect on the fact that in spite of many prayers for peace, our century has seen two world wars. They hear of prayer campaigns to convert atheist Russia, but the dangerous cold war continues. Compounding the risk is the ever-present threat of nuclear war. Even that problem may have stiff competition in a few years, according to Dr. Firuz Kazemzadeh, <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>professor of history at Yale University, who says that overpopulation “in fifteen years will be as serious a problem as A-bombs.”</p>

<strong>Why Meditate?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Besides thus contributing toward the preservation of good relationships with fellow humans, meditation plays a vital role in maintaining a fine standing before the Creator. Like the inspired psalmists, we, therefore, do well to use times of quiet and solitude for meditating on the qualities and activities of Jehovah God. The psalmist David stated: “When I have remembered you upon my lounge, during the night watches I meditate on you. For you have proved to be of assistance to me, and in the shadow of your wings I cry out <span id="page166" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="166" data-before-text="166"></span>joyfully.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977201/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 63:6, 7</a>) Another psalmist declared: “I shall certainly meditate on all your activity, and with your dealings I will concern myself.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977201/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 77:12</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">All who desire to be God’s approved servants might ask themselves: Do I, like the psalmists, take time for meditating on the Creator and his activity? Do I reflect appreciatively on what he has done in my behalf​—providing his Son as a ransom, opening my heart to respond to his truth, helping me to cope with daily problems of life, giving me a solid hope for the future, and much more? Do I think about his past dealings with mankind and the way he demonstrated love, mercy, justice, wisdom and so many other admirable qualities?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Such wholesome meditation can deepen our love for Jehovah God. As a consequence, our relationship will be like that of a child that trusts and loves its father and wants to please him. Our relationship with our heavenly Father will be a personal one, that is, we will really know him and his Son whom he gave in our behalf. When that is the case, it will be an impossibility for us to become willful practicers of sin. The apostle John pointed this out when he wrote regarding the effect of knowing and of not knowing Jesus Christ: “Everyone remaining in union with him does not practice sin; no one that practices sin has either seen him or come to know him.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977201/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 John 3:6</a>.</p>

<strong>You Are Never Alone</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> But when a person is thrust into isolation, just what can he do? Well, he can review the Holy Scriptures in his mind, think upon God’s dealings and his work. He can think of Bible examples of endurance and faithfulness. There is Joseph, who spent years in prison, and yet he was not really alone, for God was with him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972642/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Gen. 39:20-23</a>) There is Samson, who, in the prison house, seemed all alone, but Jehovah did not forsake him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972642/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Judg. 16:21-30</a>) There are the apostles, who were often in prison, and yet they kept integrity. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972642/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Acts 5:17-21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972642/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 12:3-17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972642/19/2" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 16:19-34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972642/19/3" data-bid="20-4" class="b"> 2 Cor. 6:3-5</a>) A Christian in isolation due to persecution can do as the psalmist Asaph did when he was in great distress. This “visionary” who did ‘prophesying with the harp’ writes at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972642/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Psalm 77:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972642/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 12</a>: “In the day of my distress I have searched for Jehovah himself. . . . I shall certainly meditate on all your activity, and with your dealings I will concern myself.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972642/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Chron. 25:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972642/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 29:30</a>) That is what one of the Watch Tower Society’s zone overseers did when under restraint and when undergoing both verbal and physical abuse due to keeping integrity. <span id="page524" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="524" data-before-text="524"></span>Telling of his experience afterward, he said: “We did a lot of praying; in such a situation a person does a lot of thinking.”</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Similarly, the psalmist Asaph did a lot of thinking when he was in a difficult situation. He appeared to be forsaken by God, and the situation looked black. But what did he do to sustain himself and hold fast to Jehovah God? As already cited, he said: “I shall certainly <em>meditate</em> on all your activity, and with your dealings I will concern myself.” He concerned himself with God’s past activities and dealings, how Jehovah had delivered his people in the past. Asaph knew that God does not change, just as it is written: “For I am Jehovah; I have not changed. And you are sons of Jacob; you have not come to your finish.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972642/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Mal. 3:6</a>) Certainly, then, Jehovah will not allow his people, if faithful, to be consumed or finished off.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">17, 18. What can the Christian do to prepare himself to face a difficult situation?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> So, there is good reason to familiarize ourselves with God’s activities, past and present, on behalf of his people as well as what he has done for his organization. Now is the time to store up all this information in our hearts and minds. To this end we have God’s Word and various publications of the Watch Tower Society to help us. Then if we are ever in a difficult situation, such as Asaph was, we can do the right kind of thinking so that we can stand firm. We will have good things, noble things, praiseworthy things, lovable things in our mind upon which we can meditate.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972642/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Phil. 4:8</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> So, it is a good pattern that the psalmist sets for us here​—to meditate on Jehovah God’s activities and dealings. Then it will stand us in good stead in time of need.</p>

<strong>Gaining Maturity Through Personal Study Is Joyful</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> In any endeavor, it is the wish of an individual to be successful. Joshua was <span id="page393" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="393" data-before-text="393"></span>told regarding the “book of the law” that he should “read in it day and night, in order that you may take care to do according to all that is written in it; for then you will make your way successful and then you will act wisely.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966482/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Josh. 1:8</a>) Christian success is gained by doing that which is in accord with God’s will. So, then, if one takes in knowledge regularly, he can expect to have that inward satisfaction that brings deep joy. It is most vital, then, that we highly treasure the commandments that Jehovah has given; ‘we should treasure them and continue living.’ Permitting our minds to dwell on this Scriptural expression brings our thoughts right back to study: “A wise person will listen and take in more instruction, and a man of understanding is the one who acquires skillful direction, to understand a proverb.” To listen does not mean only to hear the voice of an individual and to take in knowledge through our sense of hearing. The same is true when we read and study the words from the printed page, information taken in through the sense of sight. In this way, too, we are “listening” to the author of the words and being taught. Thus we gradually gain understanding and progress toward maturity.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966482/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Prov. 7:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966482/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1:5, 6</a>.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 6.

We should feel inwardly as did the disciples of Jesus during the seven-and-a-half-mile walk to Emmaus after Jesus had “interpreted to them things pertaining to himself in all the Scriptures.” They could not help but express themselves: “Were not our hearts burning as he was speaking to us on the road, as he was fully opening up the Scriptures to us?” This same burning or desire can be ours too, as we are brought into unity with God’s congregation through study; and a keen awareness of pleasing God on our part certainly contributes to our joy.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966482/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Prov. 2:4, 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966482/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Luke 24:13,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966482/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 27,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966482/4/3" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966482/4/4" data-bid="5-5" class="b"> Rom. 11:33</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>MEDITATION</strong></p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 7. (a) What is meditation, and how may it be employed?

Would not this come within the scope of the words of Paul: “Ponder over these things; be absorbed in them, that your advancement may be manifest to all persons. Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching”? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966482/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:15, 16</a>) Meditation is not daydreaming or letting the mind just wander aimlessly, but, rather, it is bridled thought upon a specific subject. For instance, by considering prophecies that point to the all-important date of 1914, one might catalog in his mind the scriptures that point to it and call to mind all that he possibly can. This would be rewarding and stimulating and would all come within the category of personal study. David expressed it well in these words: “I shall certainly meditate on all your activity, and with your dealings I will concern myself.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966482/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 77:12</a>) Under certain circumstances, that may be the only manner in which one could carry on personal study if incarcerated and being denied a Bible or communication with others. Meditation under such circumstances <span id="page394" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="394" data-before-text="394"></span>would be vital to keep oneself healthy spiritually, and would lead to maturity.</p>

<strong>Reasonableness Leads to Peace</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span id="page78" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="78" data-before-text="78"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> In reasoning we relate principles to facts or problems in a deductive way to clarify specific details, or we compare facts with one another in an inductive way to reveal or clarify general principles. But is pure reasoning enough? No. Many thinkers and philosophers are confused and do not know the way of peace. Reasoning must be guided by the Scriptures, not by human standards or by philosophy. We are told to get the mind of Jehovah, to prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God. This requires study of God’s Word. We must have spiritual guidance: “But a physical man does not receive the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot get to know them, because they are examined spiritually.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962083/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Cor. 2:14</a>) We must also meditate. This does not mean to daydream on fanciful ideas of our own. No, our meditation has to be definitely guided by God. Our reasoning must be based directly on the Scriptures. Such meditation can be done even during periods of relaxation. Said the psalmist: “I shall certainly meditate on all your activity, and with your dealings I will concern myself.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962083/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 77:12</a>) Certainly the best meditation for us is on God’s dealings. In this way we can compare our life’s activity with the Bible standard and apply the spiritual words of Jehovah to spiritual matters affecting our lives. Then, when a difficult decision is to be made, we will be able to recall and to follow Jehovah’s excellent judicial decisions in such matters. By this kind of reasoning we can be sure our course will be guided by right principles.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>STUDY AND MEDITATION ESSENTIAL</strong></p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 5.

In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962083/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ro chapter 11</a> he portrays the wonderful opportunity that was offered to Israel of filling all the places in the heavenly Kingdom organization under Christ. He shows how and why they failed, but how Jehovah’s undeserved kindness and unsearchable wisdom provided a way to give people of the outside nations the opportunity to complete the filling up of this glorious governmental body. Then he appeals to Christians to consider not only God’s justice in condemning disobedience, but also his wondrous love, wisdom and power in making provisions for both Jews and Gentiles who want to serve him. He says that as a consequence of reasoning on this they should present their bodies as a living sacrifice, with all their reasoning power. It is really the only reasonable thing to do.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 6. (a) How may reasoning be used in preparing for meetings? (b) Give an example.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Reasoning is also involved in preparing properly for meetings where the Bible is studied. For example, you may be studying <em>The Watchtower</em> in preparation for the weekly study at Kingdom Hall. As you study the questions and prepare comments, reason as to how you can make your comments upbuilding to your fellow Christians. Consider the new ones present. Your comments should be clear, simple, understandable. Encourage others to reason by preparing to comment in your own words instead of merely reading the answer. As an example of meditation in study and preparation, say you are considering <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1962083/0/0">paragraph 21 on page 46 of the January 15, 1961, <em>Watchtower</em></a><em>.</em> There it states in substance that one may work hard to succeed in some worldly profession, but the highest profession, the most worthy aim, is to meet Jehovah God’s requirements as his minister. To enrich your understanding and your comment on this paragraph you could <span id="page79" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="79" data-before-text="79"></span>bring to mind all the study, sacrifices, determination and years of work that a person spends to be successful in any profession or career in the business or political world. Then you could think of the surpassing value of the ministry as a lifetime career and the impelling necessity of devoting even more concentrated energy, zeal and attention, in fact, your very life, to it.</p>
