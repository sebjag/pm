<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/1774/0">12/1/1993, p. 32</a> ]</strong></p>
	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page32" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="32" data-before-text="32"></span><strong>The Name of God</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“Unless Jehovah builds the house, the builders labor in vain.” So reads this Latin inscription. The words are based on <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993887/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 127:1</a> in the Bible, and they contain a profound truth: Any endeavor that does not have Jehovah’s blessing will ultimately be in vain.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The inscription, dated 1780, is found on a building in Colombo, Sri Lanka, and it is notable because it contains God’s name, Jehovah. (See photo.) In earlier centuries that name was widely used. It was often inscribed on secular buildings, churches, even coins. Missionaries used God’s name when they took the Bible to distant lands, which doubtless accounts for this inscription in Sri Lanka.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/1775/0">10/1/1989, pp. 27-29</a> ]</strong></p>
	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page27" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span><strong>‘Unless Jehovah Builds the House . . .’</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">NO MATTER where you live, there is some place that, for you, is home. Styles of dwellings and construction methods vary greatly. Mud-and-wattle huts, log cabins, prefabricated concrete houses​—the list seems endless. Some feel just as much at home in a grass hut as others do in more substantial abodes. Why is this so?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Feeling at ease, being content, depends largely on the company one keeps. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989728/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 18:24</a>) In spite of all the glitter and glamour the world has to offer, home is where one instinctively wants to turn for peace and solace. Yet, judging by reports about modern-day homelife, there is no guarantee that one will always find peace and solace at home. To a great extent, those who live with you​—your family—​can either share your peace or mar it. What, then, is the secret of building a happy, peaceful home?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>Building the House</strong></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Unless Jehovah himself builds the house, it is to no avail that its builders have worked hard on it,” says <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989728/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">the first verse of Psalm 127</a>. Those who share in constructing buildings for the worship of the true God, Jehovah, find this to be true. Though skilled workers volunteer their time and efforts for the quick erection of fine Kingdom Halls, it is Jehovah’s blessing that guarantees success. Even onlookers can often see that something extraordinary is at work. For example, a magazine reporting on one such project in Colchester, England, used the title “Jehovah Raises the Roof.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">However, success in endeavors other than literal building projects also depends upon Jehovah’s blessing. Consider Solomon’s words in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989728/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">the third verse of Psalm 127</a>: “Look! Sons are an inheritance from Jehovah; the fruitage of the belly is a reward.” Jehovah is also a Builder par excellence when it comes to families, and parents have the wonderful privilege of <span id="page28" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>being his fellow workers, or colaborers.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1989728/0">a</a> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989728/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:10</a>) How can Christian parents take advantage of this privileged partnership and successfully build a happy, peaceful family, one that brings honor to the Creator, Jehovah God?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>Successful Family-Building</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">An essential element in successful construction is a sound architectural plan, or blueprint. For building young praisers of God, there is no better blueprint than his inspired Word, the Bible. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989728/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16, 17</a>) “Train up a boy according to the way for him; even when he grows old he will not turn aside from it,” wrote Solomon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989728/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:6</a>) “The way for him” is Jehovah’s way, and when parents follow it, they offer their youngsters the prospect of developing into faithful servants of God.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">A sound building requires sound building material. One African visitor to Europe found it difficult to believe that some of the buildings he saw were hundreds of years old. It was a revelation to him to see the durable materials used in these buildings. On the other hand, when builders skimp on materials, the results frequently prove disastrous, even fatal. This can also be true in bringing up children.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">At conception, children receive a genetic legacy characterized by imperfection due to sin. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989728/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 51:5</a>) In other words, they are flawed right from the start. Christian parents must counteract this by endeavoring to build enduring, godly qualities into their offspring. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989728/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 3:10-15</a>) Unless this is done, no matter how hard the parents work in other areas, such as in providing their sons and daughters with the best of food, clothing, and shelter, their building efforts will be to no avail.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">That is why the divine admonition to parents, especially fathers, is: “Go on bringing them [children] up in the discipline and mental-regulating of Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989728/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:4</a>) The discipline and mental-regulating of Jehovah involve the best blueprints and building materials. Using them will result in everlasting benefits for the entire family.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>On-the-Job Training</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">In spite of the best-laid plans, there are always unexpected crises during the course of any construction. Similarly, parents must learn to anticipate unexpected problems in the day-to-day life of family members and be prepared to deal with them. How can this be done?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Good communication between the two parents is vital. When father and mother prayerfully discuss the young ones’ progress together, they will find some areas where commendation is due and others where more “building” is needed. Once such weaknesses are identified, the parents can act together and take appropriate steps to deal with them.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">But perhaps you have a large family, and you may wonder: ‘How can we tailor our efforts to the individual needs of our many children?’ Why not give on-the-job training so that your children can help one another? Apprentices serve for years in learning skills alongside master craftsmen. Perhaps at your family study, you can try asking your teenage children to explain certain matters to the younger ones. Honesty, choice of friends, resisting bad influences in school, and so on, are topics that both the older and the younger children can relate to very well. By assigning <span id="page29" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>the older children such real-life projects, you can help train them to develop their perceptive powers and teaching ability while teaching the younger ones what they need to know. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989728/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Hebrews 5:14</a>) This has the added benefit of cultivating a true kinship among siblings.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Perhaps your family is small, with only one child. Then, you have many opportunities to get to know and understand your youngster. Be aware, however, of the danger of spoiling your child by making him too much the center of attention. There are three of you, are there not? So do things together. This will teach him to communicate with others and turn his attention outward, thus preventing him from becoming self-centered.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>Aim for Family Togetherness</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">There is, of course, much more to building a family than conducting a Bible study and giving counsel and discipline. Solomon said: “With a man there is nothing better than that he should eat and indeed drink and cause his soul to see good because of his hard work.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989728/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>) No doubt your family enjoys its food when it is tastily prepared. Do you arrange to take your meals together as a family? This may not always be possible when different family members are away at work, at school, or on other business. Usually, though, there is at least one meal a day you can eat together as a family. What can contribute to a wholesome atmosphere at the family table?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">One brother uses the occasion to raise a Bible question for all present to discuss. Of course, he avoids embarrassing those who may not know the answer. Others relate field ministry experiences. By paying attention to spiritual matters, mealtimes become occasions for building up the whole family. (See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989728/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Romans 14:19</a>.) True, in some parts of the world, it is not the custom to converse much during the meal. Yet, a conscious effort to maintain a happy atmosphere is vital. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989728/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:17</a> says: “Better is a dish of vegetables where there is love than a manger-fed bull and hatred along with it.”</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Relaxation and a change of pace also have their place in Christian family life. Wise parents use such occasions to build a strong theocratic family unit. How?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">While it is easy to let the young ones go off and pursue their own interests, there is danger in this. For example, how unwise it can be to allow youngsters to become so heavily involved in sports that there is threat to life or limb! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989728/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Timothy 4:8</a>) To the extent possible, choose activities that involve every member of the family. Father can solicit their opinions and ideas and assign each one something to do in preparation.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Can you as a family widen out in your love and invite other members of the congregation to share your family joys? Older members of the congregation often enjoy sharing the family spirit, especially when their own families are not around or do not live according to Christian principles. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989728/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">James 1:27</a>) In many congregations, there are single-parent families. With due consideration to theocratic headship and with respect for Christian propriety, elders and others can offer spiritual shelter to members of such families. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989728/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isaiah 32:1</a>) Many a “fatherless boy” has blossomed into a balanced family head as a result of the loving interest shown by a mature Christian adult.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989728/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 82:3</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Building a Christian household is hard work. But with Jehovah’s help, you will truly come to appreciate that “sons are an inheritance from Jehovah; the fruitage of the belly is a reward.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989728/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 127:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989728/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 3</a>) They can be a source of praise not only to the Christian parents but also to their Creator, Jehovah God.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sf"><strong>[Footnotes]</strong></p>

Thus we read at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981486/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 127:1</a>: “Unless Jehovah himself builds the house, it is to no avail that its builders have worked hard on it. Unless Jehovah himself guards the city, it is to no avail that the guard has kept awake.” The long history of the nation of Israel bears out the truth of that principle. When Israel let God be in their affairs by giving him exclusive devotion, their efforts to protect themselves from their enemies were successful. But when they abandoned his pure worship to follow other gods, their guards watched over their cities in vain. The same principle applies to our making a success of marriage.</p>

<strong>Why Look to Jehovah in All You Undertake?</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">NOTHING that is contrary to God’s will can succeed. From a human standpoint, a particular undertaking may appear to have a bright future. Eventually, though, it will fail miserably. Therefore, we should make sure to consider the Creator in all our activity.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980211/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 127</a> forcefully reminds us of the importance of doing this. We read: “Unless Jehovah himself builds the house, it is to no avail that its builders have worked hard on it. Unless Jehovah himself guards the city, it is to no avail that the guard has kept awake. To no avail it is for you men that you are rising up early, that you are sitting down late, that you are eating food with pains. Just like this he gives sleep even to his beloved one.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980211/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 127:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">A man might build a house. But there is no guarantee that he will enjoy it. Sudden death, a disaster or an accident could result in his having worked in vain. A city might be well guarded and fortified. Still, it could be destroyed in warfare or by an earthquake or a fire. Men might rise early in the morning and labor until late in the evening before finally sitting down to rest and to eat. Yet, their work may bring them no satisfaction. Being too exhausted from their labor, they may not even enjoy their food. On the other hand, what such men gain from bitter toil, the servant of God gets without restless striving and struggling. His enjoyment of sleep or rest is really a gift from God.</p>

<strong>A City That Jehovah Guarded</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">On the other hand, however hard we may work, what we are doing will fail of <span id="page29" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>success if we rely on our own ability, or on men. King Solomon stated this truth in the Psalms: “Unless Jehovah himself guards the city, it is to no avail that the guard has kept awake.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979170/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 127:1</a>) This principle was demonstrated in the destruction and later the restoration of ancient Jerusalem.</p>

<strong>“Roll Your Works upon Jehovah”</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>GROWTH AND PROSPERITY COME FROM GOD</strong></p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 4.

If a Christian does not do this, he may begin relying too much on himself, thinking, perhaps not even consciously, of his own importance or ability. If his plans appear to succeed, he may take the credit to himself, only to find out later that his “success” was only temporary or superficial. Such success does not bring glory to God and does not truly help others. For, “unless Jehovah himself builds the house, it is to no avail that its builders have worked hard on it. Unless Jehovah himself guards the city, it is to no avail that the guard has kept awake.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978330/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 127:1</a>.</p>

<strong>What Did the Wise Man Mean?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Fortifying his point with a proverbial saying, Solomon continues: <em>“For a dream</em> <span id="page243" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="243" data-before-text="243"></span><em>certainly comes in because of abundance of occupation, and the voice of a stupid one because of the abundance of words.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977283/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eccl. 5:3</a>) When a person is needlessly preoccupied with materialistic or ambitious matters that leave the Creator out of the picture, selfish personal dreams result. Such “abundance of occupation” may prompt vain daydreaming and may also occupy the individual’s mind at night, putting him in a dreamy state and depriving him of peaceful sleep. As undue materialistic concerns can give rise to empty dreaming, so endless chattering also brings problems. It does not take long before the chatterer’s voice is shown up to be that of a fool. Very foolish, unbecoming things are almost bound to be said. Hence, there is a need to guard against thoughtless speaking and, as shown earlier, this is especially so in offering prayer.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The caution about thoughtless speaking would certainly apply in making vows. Solomon stated: <em>“Whenever you vow a vow to God, do not hesitate to pay it, for there is no delight in the stupid ones. What you vow, pay.</em> <em>Better is it that you vow not than that you vow and do not pay.</em> <em>Do not allow your mouth to cause your flesh to sin, neither say before the angel that it was a mistake. Why should the true God become indignant on account of your voice and have to wreck the work of your hands?”</em>​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977283/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Eccl. 5:4-6</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">No one is under any obligation to make a vow to God; it is a spontaneous act. That is why there is a need to be very careful not to speak rashly when making a solemn promise to God. Were a person to hesitate to fulfill his vow, he would be acting as a stupid one, that is, one who is morally defective, untrustworthy in word. Careless speaking with the mouth can put the body of flesh under obligation to do something that may be very difficult, leading to a failure to fulfill the vow and thus causing the flesh to sin. Careful forethought to one’s making a vow will prevent rash speaking. There will then be no desire for release from a vow, maintaining that it was a mistake.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Failure to fulfill a vow may have very serious consequences. Jehovah God may become “indignant,” withdrawing his favor and blessing, at least partially. As a result, what the individual may have built up is ‘torn down.’ The psalmist summed up the matter nicely: “Unless Jehovah himself builds the house, it is to no avail that its builders have worked hard on it. Unless Jehovah himself guards the city, it is to no avail that the guard has kept awake.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977283/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 127:1</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Highlighting what will prevent one’s making such rash vows, Solomon says: “Fear the true God himself.” This means to have an awesome regard for the Creator, not acting in any way to displease him. When such fear is missing, the following statement of King Solomon applies: <em>“For because of abundance of occupation there are dreams, and there are vanities and words in abundance.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977283/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Eccl. 5:7</a>) Yes, undue involvement with nonspiritual things brings about restless dreams of self-interest, disappointment and frustration, “vanities,” and thoughtless speaking before God that may lead to one’s making a rash vow and then failing to fulfill it. So we are wise indeed whenever we do all things out of a proper fear or awe of Jehovah God.</p>

But six years later, what? The nations were swept into the most ruinous war in all human history. The celebration of another Holy Year in 1950 did not improve the postwar period but marked the outbreak of the Korean conflict, the pistol shot for a terrific armaments race between East and West that threatens a third world war soon, with nuclear bombs thrown from both directions.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 3.

That explains the reason for their happiness, a happiness unequaled anywhere in this old world, a happiness that no turns for still worse or even the worst in this old world can dampen or wreck. Their happiness is not based on any material prosperity or any armed <span id="page722" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="722" data-before-text="722"></span>peace of this world. It is not dependent on having an abundance of the things of this world, such uncertain, vanishing things. It is a spiritual prosperity, a real, practical well-being that has transformed their lives and made them the happiest mortals on earth. It will never collapse. It is backed and guaranteed by the greatest and the only durable government in the universe, Jehovah’s kingdom established in the heavens in the year 1914 and with his Son Jesus Christ at his side.</p>

<strong>Why Look to Jehovah in All You Undertake?</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">NOTHING that is contrary to God’s will can succeed. From a human standpoint, a particular undertaking may appear to have a bright future. Eventually, though, it will fail miserably. Therefore, we should make sure to consider the Creator in all our activity.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980211/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 127</a> forcefully reminds us of the importance of doing this. We read: “Unless Jehovah himself builds the house, it is to no avail that its builders have worked hard on it. Unless Jehovah himself guards the city, it is to no avail that the guard has kept awake. To no avail it is for you men that you are rising up early, that you are sitting down late, that you are eating food with pains. Just like this he gives sleep even to his beloved one.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980211/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 127:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">A man might build a house. But there is no guarantee that he will enjoy it. Sudden death, a disaster or an accident could result in his having worked in vain. A city might be well guarded and fortified. Still, it could be destroyed in warfare or by an earthquake or a fire. Men might rise early in the morning and labor until late in the evening before finally sitting down to rest and to eat. Yet, their work may bring them no satisfaction. Being too exhausted from their labor, they may not even enjoy their food. On the other hand, what such men gain from bitter toil, the servant of God gets without restless striving and struggling. His enjoyment of sleep or rest is really a gift from God.</p>

When young ones come to us, how do we respond​—even when we are busy? As Jesus did? What children need, especially from their parents, is what Jesus was willing to give them​—his time and attention. True, such words as “I love you” are important. Yet, actions speak louder than words. Your love is manifest not only by what you say but even more so by what you do. It is shown by the time, attention, and care that you provide your little ones. Doing all of that, however, may not produce tangible results, at least not as quickly as you would hope. Patience is required. We can learn patience if we imitate the way Jesus dealt with his disciples.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>Jesus’ Patience and Affection</strong></p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">10.

Some six months later, James and John put their mother up to requesting from Jesus prominent positions in the Kingdom.

A parent should resist any inclination to put off an inquiring child with a gruff: “Go away! Can’t you see that I am busy?” If a parent really is busy, the child should be told that the matter will be discussed later. Parents must then make sure that it is discussed.

Evidently, they are the words that had just been mentioned, namely: “You must love Jehovah your God with all your heart and all your soul and all your vital force.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005242/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:5-7</a>) Jesus said that this is the most important of all God’s commandments.

You will notice that in the preceding chapter of Deuteronomy, Moses restates the laws that God wrote on tablets of stone​—the Ten Commandments. These laws include commands not to lie, not to steal, not to murder, and not to commit adultery. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005242/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 5:11-22</a>) So the need to impart moral values to their children was impressed upon parents of old.

Rather, the point is that parents should constantly keep the teachings of God before their children. Teaching their children should be done in such a regular, constant way that it is as though God’s teachings are right there before the children all the time.</p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">23.

<strong>Help Your Children to Thrive</strong><br/><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="se">  The Bible provided a lofty standard. It taught the Jews that children were precious​—actually to be viewed as an inheritance from God himself​—and were to be treated accordingly. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101997563/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalm 127:3</a>) Evidently many lived by such counsel. Even their language was revealing in this connection. Edersheim notes that besides the words for son and daughter, ancient Hebrew had nine words for children, each applying to a different stage of life. For example, there was a word for a child who was still breast-feeding and another for one who had been weaned. For slightly older children, there was a word implying that these were becoming firm and strong. And for older youths, there was a word that literally meant ‘to shake oneself free.’ Edersheim comments: “Assuredly, those who so keenly watched child-life as to give a pictorial designation to each advancing stage of its existence, must have been fondly attached to their children.”</p>

Twelve years later, the child was going to the meetings at the Kingdom Hall and enjoying the company of the youngsters there. The mother comments: “I am so grateful that Bible principles moved me to do what is right.

<strong>“Wonder Drug” for Infant Growth—Love</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">If parents were to take the view that children “are an inheritance from Jehovah,” as the Bible says, there would be no “lack of loving environment.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982083/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 127:3</a>) Surely, it takes time and effort to look after any inheritance and to make such assets grow.

<strong>Why Look to Jehovah in All You Undertake?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Accordingly, the psalmist regarded as divine blessings such things as the security of a home, the safety of a city and the enjoyment of life’s provisions. He viewed a man’s having a good family in the same light, saying: “Look! Sons are an inheritance from Jehovah; the fruitage of the belly is a reward. Like arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the sons of youth. Happy is the able-bodied man that has filled his quiver with them. They will not be ashamed, for they will speak with enemies in the gate.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980211/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 127:3-5</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">A man who fathered sons while himself still enjoying the strength and vigor of youth was rightly regarded as blessed. When his sons grew up, they were like arrows in his hand. They could defend their father before his adversaries at law. Since the city elders judged in the open area near the gates, it would be there that the sons would speak with opponents in a legal case, successfully putting to silence baseless accusations and false testimony.</p>

It is an everyday occurrence among humankind, true. Yet each birth is the result of amazingly intricate processes. When we understand something about these we can better appreciate why the inspired psalmist was moved to say: “Look! Sons are an inheritance from Jehovah; the fruitage of the belly is a reward.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101978007/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 127:3</a>) Consider what happens.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> A sperm cell from a man unites with an egg cell in a woman. The two cells become one, and the one starts to divide. It becomes two, the two become four, the four become eight, until eventually this one cell has become, in a grown person, an estimated 60,000,000,000,000 cells! At first the new cells were all the same, then they began changing into different kinds—bone cells, muscle cells, nerve cells, liver cells, eye cells, skin cells, and so on and on.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> Some of the mysteries of reproduction and differentiation have been uncovered, but many <span id="page82" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="82" data-before-text="82"></span>remain. What makes the original cell start to divide? As the dividing continues, what makes the cells start changing into many different kinds? What makes these different kinds group together in special shapes, sizes and functions, to become a liver, a nose, a little toe? These changes start taking place at preset times. What controls the timetables? Also, this growing embryo in the mother’s womb is a body with a genetic makeup different from hers. Normally her body rejects foreign tissues, such as skin grafts or organ transplants from other persons. Why doesn’t it reject this genetically foreign embryo, instead of nourishing it for some 280 days?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> All these amazing activities take place on schedule because Jehovah God programmed them into the one cell formed by the sperm and the egg. The psalmist indicates this when saying to the Creator: “Your eyes saw even the embryo of me, and in your book all its parts were down in writing, as regards the days when they were formed and there was not yet one among them.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101978007/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 139:16</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>DEVELOPMENT AND BIRTH</strong></p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 5-8. Between the fourth week of pregnancy and the birth of a baby, what are some of the things that happen in the womb?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> The embryo develops rapidly. By the fourth week it has a brain, a nervous system, and a circulatory system with a heart pumping blood through already placed vessels. Blood is manufactured by the yolk sac for six weeks; then the liver takes over this function, which is finally assumed by the bone marrow. In the fifth week arms and legs begin to form; in three more weeks fingers and toes appear. By the seventh week <span id="page83" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="83" data-before-text="83"></span>major muscle groups, along with eyes, ears, nose and mouth, have formed.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> “My bones,” the psalmist continues, speaking to Jehovah God, “were not hidden from you when I was made in secret.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101978007/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 139:15</a>) In the ninth week cartilage is turning into bone as the skeleton is formed, and the developing baby is now called a fetus instead of an embryo. “You yourself produced my kidneys.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101978007/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 139:13</a>) The divine processes governing this occur in the fourth month and the kidneys now filter the blood.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> By this time the developing baby moves and twists about, curls its fingers or its toes when the palm of its hand or the sole of its foot feels a tickling sensation. It grips things with finger and thumb, and sucks its thumb and thereby exercises muscles later to be used for feeding at its mother’s breasts. It hiccups, and the mother feels it jump. By the sixth month many organs are virtually complete. The nostrils have opened, eyebrows have appeared, soon the eyes will open, and ears will function so that even in the womb the infant can be startled by loud noises.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> At 40 weeks, labor starts. The mother’s uterine muscles contract and the baby is on its way out into the world. In the process its head is often pressed out of shape, but, since its skull bones have not yet fused together, after delivery the head resumes its normal shape. Up until now the mother has done everything for the baby: provided oxygen, food, protection, warmth and also for the removal of wastes. Now the baby must go to work for itself, quickly, or it will die.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> 9. For a baby to live outside the womb, what changes must take place quickly?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> It must start breathing in order for the lungs <span id="page84" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="84" data-before-text="84"></span>to put oxygen into the blood. But to do this another drastic conversion must take place instantaneously: the pathway of the circulating blood must change! While the fetus was in the womb, there was a hole in the wall of its heart. That wall separated the right and left chambers and kept much of the baby’s blood from ever going toward the lungs. Of the blood that did, a large vessel made most of it bypass the lungs. In the womb, only about 10 percent of the blood went through the lungs; after birth all of it must do so, and immediately! To accomplish this, within seconds after birth the big vessel that bypassed the lungs constricts and the blood that went through it now goes to the lungs. Meanwhile the hole in the wall of the heart closes, and all the blood pumped from the right side of the heart now goes to the lungs to be oxygenated. The baby breathes, the blood is oxygenated, dramatic changes have been made and the baby lives! As the inspired psalmist so beautifully sums it up: “You kept me screened off in the belly of my mother. I shall laud you because in a fear-inspiring way I am wonderfully made.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101978007/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 139:13, 14</a>.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">10.

What questions should those who are thinking about starting a family ask themselves, and why?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> It was more than morality that caused Jehovah God to establish the law that sex relations <span id="page85" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="85" data-before-text="85"></span>were to be limited to married couples. He also had in mind the arrival of children. A child needs both a father and a mother who love each other and who will love and cherish their offspring. The newborn child needs the warmth and security of a home, with a father and mother who want him and who will provide the environment needed for his growth and personality development. A husband and wife who are considering having a baby should ask themselves: Do we want a baby? Can we provide for its needs—not just physically, but emotionally and spiritually? Will we train it properly, set the right examples for it to follow? Are we willing to accept the responsibilities parenthood brings, accept the sacrifices involved? As children it may have seemed to us that our parents tied us down, but when we become parents we find what a time-consuming project rearing children really is. Yet with the responsibility of parenthood can come great joys.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">12-14. Once a woman is pregnant, how can she contribute toward the development of a healthy baby by (a) her diet? (b) what she does about alcohol, tobacco, drugs? (c) controlling her emotions?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> The decision has been made—whether by parents or by biological circumstances. You, the wife, are pregnant. Your care for this “inheritance from Jehovah” starts. Some things you must eat, and others you must avoid or limit. Foods rich in iron<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1101978007/0">a</a> are important, for in the womb the baby is storing up enough iron to last it for six months after its birth. You need more milk (cheese is also good) to supply the calcium your baby needs for building bones. And a balanced carbohydrate intake<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1101978007/1">b</a> will help to avoid excessive weight increase. <span id="page86" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="86" data-before-text="86"></span>True, you may be eating for two of you, but one of you is very, very tiny!</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> Other factors may or may not need to be considered, depending on the way you live. Alcoholic drinks send alcohol to the fetus, so caution is needed, as an excess could produce mental and physical retardation. Some babies have been born drunk because their mothers were heavy drinkers. Smoking puts nicotine into the bloodstream of the fetus, and also causes carbon monoxide to replace oxygen in its blood. Thus, the infant’s prospects for normal health may be irreparably damaged even before it is born. Spontaneous abortion and stillborn babies are much more frequent among women who smoke. Addictive drugs taken by the mother can cause the baby to be born an addict, and some nonaddictive drugs taken medicinally may also prove dangerous, possibly crippling the baby. Even the excessive drinking of coffee is suspected of causing some damage.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Additionally, emotional stress in the mother can change her hormone output and make the fetus overly active, thereby causing the newborn child to be restless and irritable. The growing baby may be ‘screened off in the belly of its mother,’ but it would be a mistake to think that it is totally cut off from the world around it. Through the mother it can be affected; she is its only connecting link with the outside world, and that puts her primarily “in the driver’s seat” as to whether the effect is good or bad. The way she cares for herself and how she reacts to circumstances will make the difference. It goes without saying that in this she needs the cooperation of those around her, and especially the love and care of her husband.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101978007/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Samuel 4:19</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><span id="page87" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="87" data-before-text="87"></span><strong>DECISIONS YOU MUST MAKE</strong></p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">15, 16.

In some cases there may be little choice. In many areas hospitals may not even be available. In other areas having a baby at home may be a rarity and may present risks due to lack of experienced help, such as that of a midwife. Wherever possible, it is always good to be examined during pregnancy by a doctor, to know whether you can expect a normal delivery or one accompanied by complications.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Will you have your baby under anesthesia or by natural childbirth? You and your husband must decide, after weighing advantages and disadvantages. Natural childbirth may involve the husband in the momentous event. The baby is immediately put with its mother. Some believe that these are advantages to be seriously considered, if examinations indicate that the birth will be without complications. Some researchers contend that babies born under the more peaceful conditions of natural childbirth have fewer emotional problems and psychosomatic illnesses.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">17-19. What has research revealed about the advisability of a baby’s being with the mother as soon as possible after birth?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> The magazine <em>Psychology Today,</em> December 1977 issue, states:</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="si"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"></span>“Psychologists have known for decades that the first year of a baby’s life can have an enduring impact on his later mental and physical development. It now appears that the baby’s first day—perhaps even his first 60 minutes—is just as crucial. The emotional bond that the mother forms toward the child, and the kind of care she begins to give him, are particularly important after delivery. <span id="page88" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="88" data-before-text="88"></span>Recent studies also demonstrate that the first hours may have a lot to do with shaping the mother’s attitude toward the child, the strength of her commitment to him, and her capacity for mothering.”</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> If the mother does not have general anesthesia during the birth, the baby will be alert, have its eyes open, look around, follow movements, turn toward human voices, and be especially aware of the higher-pitched female voice. Eye contact between mother and child can be quickly established. This seems to be important, and in some studies mothers reported that once their baby looked at them they felt much closer to it. Body contact, skin to skin, of mother and baby right after birth is considered advantageous to both.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> Researchers claim that the problems of babies treated by medical centers can sometimes be traced to the first few hours of life. Comparisons made between children given the standard hospital treatment at birth and others immediately put with their mothers indicate that after one month the babies delivered by natural childbirth were doing better. “Even more striking,” <em>Psychology Today</em> states, “at five years of age, the children of extended-contact mothers had significantly higher IQ’s [evidence of intelligence] and more advanced scores on language tests than children who were treated according to standard hospital procedure.”</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">20.

There are many advantages to both you and your baby. Mother’s milk is the perfect food for infants. It is easy to digest, and it protects against infection, intestinal disorders and respiratory problems. For the first few days the breasts secrete colostrum, a yellowish fluid especially good for infants because (1) it is low in fats and carbohydrates and hence easier to digest, (2) it is richer in immunity factors than the mother’s milk that will come in a few days, and (3) it has a slightly laxative effect that helps clear out the cells, mucus and bile that collected in the infant’s bowels before birth.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> Breast-feeding benefits the mother. It reduces bleeding in the mother because the baby’s sucking stimulates the uterus to contract. The sucking also stimulates the breasts to produce more milk, and mothers who feared they could not produce enough milk discover that there is no shortage. Regular breast-feeding <em>in some cases</em> postpones the resumption of ovulation and the menstrual cycle, and to that extent tends to be a natural contraceptive. The American Cancer Society says that “mothers who breast feed show less cases of cancer of the breast.” Breast-feeding also benefits the family budget!</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="ss"><span id="page90" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="90" data-before-text="90"></span><strong>CHILD DEVELOPMENT—HOW WILL YOU AIM THE ARROW?</strong></p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">23.

An arrow must be aimed with care and skill so that it will hit the target. In like manner, it is vital that, as parents, you wisely and prayerfully ponder on the kind of start in life you will give to your child. Will he or she on leaving your care become a balanced and mature adult, respected by others and an honor to God?</p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">24.

(b) Why is this important?</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> Decisions should be made before the baby’s arrival as to its care and training. The parents basically are the firstborn baby’s whole world. What will that world be like? Will it show that the parents have taken to heart this counsel from God’s Word: “Let all malicious bitterness and anger and wrath and screaming and abusive speech be taken away from you along with all badness. But become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate, freely forgiving one another just as God also by Christ freely forgave you”?

Strive to make your baby’s world one of peace and security, of warmth and love. The baby that is cherished will absorb these qualities and they will shape its emotions accordingly. Your feelings will be sensed, your examples followed. The genetic laws of our Creator made marvelous provisions for the baby’s <span id="page91" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="91" data-before-text="91"></span>development in the womb; how will you shape it outside the womb? So much depends on the home conditions you provide. This, as much as the genes, determines what kind of adult the baby will become. “Train up a boy according to the way for him; even when he grows old he will not turn aside from it.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101978007/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:6</a>.</p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">25, 26.

Your sons will be like slips of olive trees all around your table.” Trees may be shaped in different ways by training them. Some are made to grow flat against a wall. Others spread out low over the ground. Some are even made small and stunted by trimming their roots and cramping them, as in the case of a bonsai. An old saying emphasizes how early training will also shape a child: “The way the twig is bent is the way the tree will grow.” A sense of balance is needed here. On the one hand, the child needs guiding so that it will conform to righteous standards. At the same time it should not be expected to conform to some preconceived ideal the parents have as to the exact personality it should display. You cannot make an olive tree bear figs. Train your child in right ways but do not force it into a predetermined mold that will not allow its distinctive personality and inherited gifts to find normal expression. Give yourself time to come to know this child you have produced. Then, as with a tender young tree, give your child guidance that is strong enough to protect and support it in a right direction, yet gentle enough not to cramp the child’s development to its full capacity for good.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="ss"><strong>A REWARD FROM JEHOVAH</strong></p><p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu">28.

Let my lord, please, pass on ahead of his servant, but may I myself continue the journey at my leisure according to the pace of the livestock that is before me and according to the pace of the children.” When meeting his brother, Esau, earlier he was asked, “Who are these with you?” Jacob’s response was, “The children with whom God has favored your servant.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101978007/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Genesis 33:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101978007/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 13, 14</a>) Parents today should not only show merciful consideration to their children as Jacob did, but also view them as he did—as a favor from Jehovah.

Parents cannot direct or control the moment of conception nor the development of the child in the womb. They cannot even see or fully understand the marvelous processes involved.

As <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974085/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 127:3</a> reminds parents: “Look!

<strong>Is This the Time to Have Children?</strong><br/><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">The fact is, throughout the Bible parenthood is spoken of as being honorable. For example, it says: “Sons are an inheritance from Jehovah; the fruitage of the belly is a reward.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101974801/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 127:3-5</a>) Parenthood is a God-given privilege. And rearing children can be a wonderful joy to parents. Thus, regardless of the severity of present troubles or those that certainly lie ahead, some couples may desire to have children. The Bible says nothing to prohibit them from now enjoying this privilege and shouldering this responsibility. So it would be improper for anyone to criticize others for having children.</p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Some have contended, however, that absolutely anything done between husband and wife is permissible. However, that view is not supported in the Bible. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969926/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Romans 1:24-32</a>, where it speaks of both men and women who participated in immoral sex practices, including lesbian and sodomite acts, the Bible mentions a “natural use of the female.” Thus it shows that to indulge in such perverted use of the reproductive organs so as to satisfy a covetous desire for sexual excitement is not approved by God. <span id="page766" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="766" data-before-text="766"></span>This would also be true in connection with married couples; they should not pervert this “natural use of the female.” In many places even the law of the land backs this up, making certain acts between husband and wife illegal. For example, speaking about the United States, <em>Time</em> of August 8, 1969, observed: “Sodomy is illegal in nearly every state, even between spouses.” (Those who have not learned how such perversions are practiced ought to be grateful for that, for Jehovah God urges Christians to “be babes as to badness.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969926/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Cor. 14:20</a>.)</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In view of their mutual needs marital relations are a way for husband and wife to express tender love and deep affection for each other. Would it be consistent with that selfishly to ask one’s mate to share in a degradation of the reproductive organs, acting in a way that the mate found to be repulsive, just so as to gratify one’s own senses? Would that be the tender, loving course? No sane person would abuse his or her own human body, or force upon it a practice that was revolting. The Scriptures speak of husband and wife as one flesh. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969926/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Eph. 5:28-31</a>) So would a sane and loving husband or wife request sex acts that the other mate rightly regarded as unnatural and disgusting? Obviously authority over the body of one’s mate is not unlimited or unaffected by Bible principles.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969926/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:1-5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969926/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Prov. 5:15-19</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Sometimes individuals feel that self-control as to sex is necessary for a single person but that once one is married it is not needed. This view, however, is not correct. Self-control is a fruit of the spirit and it should be manifested in all of one’s dealings. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969926/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gal. 5:22, 23</a>) The fact that usually the male has the greater sexual desire suggests that he display a greater measure of self-control, even though his wife lovingly wants to satisfy him. He should assign her “honor as to a weaker vessel, the feminine one.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969926/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:7</a>) And in part he can do this by recognizing that her sexual nature is different from his. Dwelling with her “according to knowledge,” he ought not think only of quickly satisfying himself however and whenever he wants, but he should be considerate of her both physically and emotionally.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">However, beyond the above observations about conjugal acts we cannot go. With love, respect and unselfishness, marriage mates themselves must decide what they will do. They can keep in mind the importance of self-control and that “there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969926/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Related to this matter is the question of birth control. As we mentioned at the outset, reproduction is a prime purpose of marriage, according to the Bible. We firmly believe that children are a blessing, or as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969926/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 127:3</a> puts it: “The fruitage of the belly is a reward.” Does this mean, though, that all Christians are obliged to marry and produce children? Are God’s servants today responsible to apply personally the instruction God gave Noah and his sons, “Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth”?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969926/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Gen. 9:1</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">No, the Bible does not say that this is an obligation today. Jesus himself pointed out that certain disciples would avoid marrying “on account of the kingdom of the heavens.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969926/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 19:10-12</a>) And under inspiration the apostle Paul specifically explained that singleness affords greater freedom for serving the Lord. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969926/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:32-34,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969926/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 38</a>) Some married Christians, too, in order to enjoy greater freedom to serve God, or for health or economic reasons, have decided to limit the size of their families by practicing birth control. The Bible does not directly discuss birth control, and so each couple can consider the above points and reach their own conclusion. Those who seek to avoid having children now are not violating any command of God to Christians, but neither are those who do have offspring now acting improperly in doing so.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969926/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Gal. 6:5</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">There are numerous birth-control methods. It is not our place as a Bible society to recommend or endorse any of these. If a married couple want to practice birth control—and let us emphasize that this is entirely a personal decision—they have to conclude how to do that. There might be physical side effects from certain contraceptive methods. Hence, that should be considered. Another aspect to evaluate is whether a particular method might violate Christian principles in some way.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">For instance, scientists themselves are not sure of the mode of operation of the intrauterine device (IUD), sometimes called the “loop” or “coil.” A 1968 report from the United Nations World Health Organization stated: “Whether or not the presence of an IUD affects fertilization in the human female has not been conclusively demonstrated. . . . The findings in other species suggest that the prevention of egg-sperm union [conception] in the [fallopian] tube is not the explanation of the antifertility action of IUD’s in mammals.” (Technical Report Series No. 397, page 11) IF this device <span id="page767" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="767" data-before-text="767"></span>allows conception but interrupts the development of the fertilized ovum at some later state, it would amount to abortion from a Biblical standpoint. (Abortion will be considered later.) We as a Society have not performed experiments with IUD’s and so cannot say one way or the other. The individual couple must weigh the factors and be willing to shoulder before God the responsibility for their decision.</p>

<strong>Conduct “Worthy of the Good News”</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> After marriage is entered into, the couple must continue to show respect for the marriage arrangement. The Bible states concerning Christian marriage: “Let marriage be honorable among all, and the marriage bed be without defilement, for God will judge fornicators and adulterers.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963082/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Heb. 13:4</a>) Having in mind that Jehovah is the judge and that all our actions are open before him will help the married man and woman to avoid any unfaithfulness to their marriage partner. Also, their love for each other strengthens their loyalty to each other and helps avoid unfaithfulness. “In this way husbands ought to be loving their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself, for no man ever hated his own flesh; but he feeds and cherishes it, as the Christ also does the congregation, because we are members of his body. ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and he will stick to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.’” Certainly the husband would not be loving his wife if he committed adultery with another woman. <span id="page77" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="77" data-before-text="77"></span>Nor would he be loving the other woman, since he would be causing her to sin also and to come under judgment from God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963082/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Eph. 5:28-31</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> The man and woman were meant to “stick” to each other. That means to continue firmly united, both with the desire to make the marriage last. How can this be? Only if the quality of love is present. In many marriages this quality is often lacking. In some lands there is little or no companionship between the man and woman in marriage; they do not share their thoughts nor spend time in each other’s company, not even eating their meals together. Often the woman is looked upon more as a servant in the house than as a companion and partner in the marriage contract.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">18. (a) What example did Jesus set for Christian husbands? (b) In what practical ways does a husband show love for his wife?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> What, then, should be the attitude of the Christian man toward his wife? This is well illustrated at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963082/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:25 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963082/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 28</a>, which reads: “Husbands, continue loving your wives, <em>just as</em> the Christ also loved the congregation and delivered up himself for it. In <em>this way</em> husbands ought to be loving their wives as their own bodies.” Jesus was long-suffering, patient and kind to his Christian brothers in the congregation. He was happy to be with them and to talk with them about the wonderful things of God’s kingdom. Besides declaring the “good news” to the general public in Palestine he spent many hours with his faithful disciples explaining the truth to them. He showed the deep quality of his love in finally giving up his earthly life as a sacrifice in order that the congregation might be saved to eternal life. This is the kind of love a husband should have for his wife. He learns to enjoy her companionship. Because he wants her to gain eternal life, he gladly seeks opportunities to discuss with her the wonderful hope of life in a new world that he has learned by means of the “good news.” Even if both husband and wife have accepted the “good news,” they would continue to speak together of those things to build each other up in faith.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">19.

The Bible plainly states: “Certainly if anyone does not provide for those who are his own, and especially for those who are members of his household, he has disowned the faith and is worse than a person without faith.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963082/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Tim. 5:8</a>) But in addition to caring physically he must care even more for the spiritual needs of his family, just as Christ cared for the congregation.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">20.

Appreciating that marriage is from Jehovah, and that the fruit of marriage, children, is also a gift of Jehovah, parents who love Jehovah will want their children to grow up to serve Him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963082/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 127:3</a>) For this reason, Christian parents will train their children from an early age in wholesome conduct, in study of the Bible and in declaring the “good news” to others, all to God’s glory. “And you, fathers, do not be irritating your children, but go on bringing them up in the discipline and authoritative advice of Jehovah.” If this command is followed, the children will grow up strong spiritually and be able to resist the temptations of the world, and their faith and right works will be a glory to their parents as well as to Jehovah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963082/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Eph. 6:4</a>.</p>

What experience illustrates the value of a good example set by Christian children?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> To illustrate this, it is good to consider experiences that various youths properly trained by God-fearing parents have from time to time. For example, two youthful ministers recently were given an opportunity to explain how they shared in ministerial work during and after school hours. One of these children was asked by her teacher to describe how her ministerial work was done. The teacher was amazed to see how young people were trained to share the many wholesome and upbuilding things learned in personal Bible study as well as at congregational meetings. How different this was from most of the students under her charge! So impressed was this schoolteacher that she asked if she could accompany them in their Bible educational work. She was invited to do so, accepted the invitation, and even offered her own car to take her pupils from house to house so that they could participate in discussing Bible truths and offer Bible literature to those interested.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 8. Contrast this with the course of juvenile delinquency pursued by youths today.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> How much better this is than the course of delinquency followed by so many of the youths today! For example, the United States is facing an emergency and its very future is being threatened because of juvenile delinquency. Throughout this nation an estimated 740,000 youngsters under eighteen years of age were arrested in 1957. J. Edgar Hoover, head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, says, “Since 1952 our juvenile population has increased approximately 22 percent. Juvenile arrests in the same period have risen 55 percent!” “By 1962 one million of our teen-agers will be arrested every year at the present rate,” he said. He pointed out that “delinquency is a world-wide disease” and not just a situation peculiar to the United States.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 9. How can parents safeguard their children against juvenile delinquency?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Parents, do not say this cannot happen to your child. It can and often does, if close supervision is not kept over your children and real loving concern shown for them. That is why it is so necessary for Christian parents to keep their children close to them at congregational meetings and assemblies and thus aid them to keep their minds on what is being said. At assemblies they should not be allowed to mill around in the corridors in groups. This disrespectful, delinquent attitude on the part of some should be curbed. What an inspiration properly trained children are to both old and young alike and what a credit to the one who said: “Look! Sons are an inheritance from Jehovah; the fruitage of the belly is a reward”!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962563/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 127:3</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">10.

Begin at this point to formulate a series of instructions as thorough and complete as you possibly can devise. Be ready to teach your child how he must conduct himself in every step of life. When he begins to understand—yes, in early childhood—explain the future before him. Show him his duties and responsibilities. Give him instruction and direction on how to perform the duties, escape the dangers and secure the blessings, which all lie before him. Fix firmly the goal of everlasting life in the child’s mind by daily inculcation; then by example slowly lead him step by step in the way of life that you have outlined before him, until each step has become a strongly set habit. Pray without ceasing for Jehovah’s blessing on all this teaching and training. Then you have obeyed the injunction of Jehovah: “Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961204/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 22:6</a>, <em>RS</em>) We have God’s Word for it that such training of a child when he is young and impressionable will never be effaced and that such good habits will never be destroyed.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="qu"> 2.

Take mother deer and her little fawn, for an example. What does the baby deer know about the vicious mountain lion and how to escape becoming a meal for this powerful beast? Virtually nothing. But Jehovah has instilled in the mother deer wisdom concerning survival techniques. Instinctively the mother deer trains her little ones how to escape danger and survive. Her first rule is implicit obedience to instruction. When danger threatens, the mother deer commands her young to lie absolutely motionless. Being magnificently camouflaged and perfectly still, the fawn remains hid from its enemies. The lion roars to frighten the young to move and betray its position. It might appear <span id="page173" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="173" data-before-text="173"></span>wiser for the little deer to leap up and run for its life. But how far do you think it would get before the hungry lion would pounce on it? Not very far. The little one obeys its mother until danger is past. The mother then returns and indicates to its young that it is free to move. The little one hops about happy to be alive. The mother gives it an affectionate lick for having obeyed. Yes, obedience means life, disobedience means death. This vital lesson parents of humankind must drive home to their children.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● In view of the perilous last days in which we live, would it be proper for married couples to use contraceptives? Also, if conception occurs, would abortion be permissible?—Based on similar questions that have come to us from different readers.</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">We are not authorized either by the law of the land or by God’s Word to advise on contraceptives. The responsibility for their use must rest with those who decide that they can conscientiously use them, and their just judgment must rest with the God whom they serve, and not with us. Whether married couples in the truth want to have children or not is for them to decide, not us. Each couple must consider its own circumstances and its own purposes in view, and decide the matter and adopt a course and then take the responsibility before God for such course and its consequences. But we do unequivocally maintain that the purpose of marriage before God is the production of children, and hence if any married couples want children now, before Armageddon, that is perfectly proper and no one should criticize them for so doing, thereby meddling in their business. Neither should any be criticized for not having children, nor should we meddle in as to their reason why not. Private marital affairs are not the business of outsiders.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Children are not to be viewed as a hindrance to serving God and hence to be unwanted. Otherwise Paul would not have written, “She will be kept safe through childbearing.” Nor would he have advised women under certain circumstances “to bear children”. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951169/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951169/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 5:14</a>, <em>NW</em>) Under similar conditions his counsel applies today. If children come in the natural way according to which God instituted human marriage, then they are to be welcomed, even now, before the divine mandate is reissued to Armageddon survivors. You are grateful for having been brought into life, even within this present evil world, and so your children can be grateful for the same reason.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">For us to advise abortions would be a violation of the law of the land. Moreover, we take the position that abortions themselves are contrary to the Word of God. Individuals must shoulder the full weight of responsibility for such a course. We are obliged to say that according to God’s covenant with the Israelites the fruitfulness of the womb was a mark of his blessing, whereas unfruitfulness was a curse. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951169/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Lev. 26:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951169/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Deut. 28:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951169/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951169/1/3" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 18,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951169/1/4" data-bid="2-5" class="b"> 63;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951169/1/5" data-bid="2-6" class="b"> Ps. 127:3-5</a>) And we must note that God has great regard for the life of the unborn child and of the expectant mother. The heavy responsibility upon those endangering even accidentally the life of the unborn child or the life of the pregnant woman is shown in the Mosaic Law, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951169/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Exodus 21:22-25</a> (<em>AS</em>): “If men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart, and yet no harm follow; he shall be surely fined, according as the woman’s husband shall lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. But if any harm follow, then thou shalt give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The husband and prospective father was chiefly affected, and so the woman’s husband required a fine for temporary hurt; but where the child’s life or the woman’s life was lost, then the one responsible must pay with his life. Now if such accidental interference with the natural course of events with regard to a pregnant woman was a matter of such serious consequence, would you not view deliberate interference worthy of even greater condemnation? And while we are not under the Mosaic Law now, there is no reason to think that God’s mind has changed relative to the sanctity of the lives involved in such cases. In such matters Christian principles usually demand more rather than less.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951169/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 5:38-42</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">So the Watchtower Society cannot involve itself by giving advice where harm or loss of life is concerned, either to the unborn child or to the prospective mother. Abortions are accompanied by danger from hemorrhages and infection and can lead to the permanent injury or the death of the woman. It cuts short the growth of an embryo that would otherwise grow till normal birth as a human baby, according to God’s creative arrangement of things. We view as of no force and immaterial the arguments that the age of the embryo or fetus is a factor determining the rightness or wrongness of abortion, since God did not set any such qualifications or limitations upon his law expressed at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951169/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Exodus 21:22-25</a>. While under ancient law of man the offense of abortion was <span id="page160" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="160" data-before-text="160"></span>committed in the event there was a quickening in the mother’s womb, the modern law by statute is closer to the Scriptural rule. It “is usually made a felony whether committed before or after quickening”.—<em>Summary of American Law,</em> Clark, page 122.</p>

<strong>Parents—Train Your Children From Their Infancy</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013607/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 127:4</a> states: “Like arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the sons of youth.” Children are thus likened to arrows that should be accurately aimed at the target. An archer can never recall an arrow once it leaves his bow. Parents have “arrows”​—their children—​for only a comparatively brief period of time. That time should be used to instill godly principles in the mind and heart of their children.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/1784/0">4/1/2008, pp. 13-16</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Raising Children in a Permissive World</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>“Like Arrows in the Hand”</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The Bible illustrates the parent-child relationship in a way that highlights a child’s need for parental guidance. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 127:4, 5</a> says: “Like arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the sons of youth. Happy is the able-bodied man that has filled his quiver with them.” So children are likened to <span id="page14" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>arrows, and the parent is likened to a mighty warrior. Just as an archer knows that his arrows will not hit the target by chance, loving parents realize that child rearing cannot be a haphazard business. They want their children to reach a “target”​—a fulfilling life as happy, responsible adults. They want their children to make good choices, to be wise and avoid needless problems, and to achieve worthwhile goals. But wanting such things is not enough.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">If an arrow is to reach its target, what is needed? It must be thoroughly prepared, well protected, and powerfully directed toward its target. Likewise, children need to be prepared, protected, and directed if their journey toward adulthood is going to be successful. Let us consider these three aspects of child rearing one at a time.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>Thoroughly Preparing the Arrow</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The arrows used by archers in Bible times were prepared very carefully. The shaft, perhaps made of a lightweight wood, had to be carved by hand and made as straight as possible. The tip had to be sharp. At the other end of the shaft, feathers were attached to stabilize the arrow in flight, keeping it on course.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Parents want their children to be like those straight arrows​—upright, free from deviation. Therefore, if they are wise, they do not turn a blind eye to serious faults but lovingly help their children to work on these and overcome them. There will be plenty of such work to do with any child, for “foolishness is tied up with the heart of a boy.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:15</a>) The Bible thus exhorts parents to discipline their children. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:4</a>) Indeed, discipline plays a vital role in forming and straightening out a child’s mind and character.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">No wonder, then, that <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 13:24</a> says: “The one holding back his rod is hating his son, but the one loving him is he that does look for him with discipline.” In this context, the rod of discipline represents a means of correction, whatever form it may take. By administering loving discipline, a parent seeks to correct faults that if they were to become deeply rooted, would cause the child much misery in adult life. Truly, withholding such discipline amounts to hate; administering it is an act of love.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">A loving parent also helps the child to understand the reasons behind the rules. Discipline thus involves not only the giving of commands and the meting out of punishment but, more important, the imparting of understanding. The Bible notes: “An <em>understanding</em> son is observing the law.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 28:7</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The feathers, or fletching, that an archer attaches to his arrows help them to fly straight after they leave his bow. Likewise, Bible teachings from the Originator of the family arrangement can stay with children even after they leave home, benefiting them throughout life. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ephesians 3:14, 15</a>) How, though, can parents make sure that such teachings are really “attached” to their children?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Notice God’s counsel to Israelite parents in Moses’ time: “These words that I am commanding you today must prove to be on your heart; and you must inculcate them in your son.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:6, 7</a>) So parents need to do two things. First, they need to learn and apply God’s Word themselves, actually coming to love God’s laws. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 119:97</a>) Then they are in a position to apply the second part of the scripture​—to “inculcate” God’s laws in their children. That means impressing the value of such laws on their children’s hearts through effective teaching and frequent repetition.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Clearly, there is nothing old-fashioned or out-of-date about teaching Bible principles or using loving discipline to correct serious <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>faults. These are vital ways to prepare those precious “arrows” for a straight and steady flight toward adulthood.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>Protecting the Arrow</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Let us return to the illustration recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 127:4, 5</a>. Recall that the archer “filled his quiver” with his arrows. Once prepared, arrows had to be protected. Thus, the archer carried them in a quiver, where they would not be easily damaged or broken. Interestingly, the Bible speaks prophetically of the Messiah as a polished arrow that his Father “concealed . . . in his own quiver.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isaiah 49:2</a>) Jehovah God, the most loving Father imaginable, did indeed protect his beloved Son, Jesus, from all manner of harm until the appointed time came for the Messiah to be put to death as foretold. Even then, God protected his Son from being permanently harmed by death, bringing him safely back to heaven, to live eternally.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Likewise, good parents are concerned about protecting their children from the dangers of this degraded world. It may be that parents prohibit certain activities that would unnecessarily expose their children to dangerous influences. For example, wise parents take this principle seriously: “Bad associations spoil useful habits.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>) Protecting children from association with those who do not respect the moral standards of the Bible will likely keep young ones from making a number of costly, even deadly, mistakes.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Children may not always appreciate parental protection. In fact, they may well resent it at times, for protecting your children will often mean telling them no. A respected author of books on child rearing comments: “Though they don’t always show it and probably won’t thank you at that moment, children really do want parents to provide safe, predictable structure in their lives. We can do that by being an authoritative parent who sets limits on behavior.”</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Yes, protecting your children from anything that might rob them of their peace, <span id="page16" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>their innocence, or their clean standing before God is an essential way to show that you love them. In time, they will likely come to understand your motives, and they will appreciate your loving protection.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>Directing the Arrow</strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Note that <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 127:4, 5</a> likens the parent to “a mighty man.” Does this mean that only a father can be effective in the parental role? Not at all. In fact, the principle of this illustration applies to both fathers and mothers​—and to single parents as well. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Proverbs 1:8</a>) The phrase “mighty man” suggests that a considerable amount of strength was required to shoot an arrow from a bow. In Bible times, bows were sometimes mounted with copper, and a soldier was said to ‘tread the bow,’ perhaps bracing the bow with his foot so that he could string it. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Jeremiah 50:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 29</a>) Clearly, much energy and effort went into pulling that taut string back in order to shoot those arrows toward their mark!</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Similarly, raising children requires considerable effort. They do not simply rear themselves, any more than an arrow launches itself toward its target. Sadly, many parents today seem unwilling to expend the kind of effort that is needed. They take the easy way out. They let television, school, and peers teach their children about right and wrong, about morals, about sex. They let their children have whatever they want. And when saying no seems like too much work, they simply say yes​—often excusing their decision by saying that they do not want to hurt their children’s feelings. In reality, it is their permissiveness that will do their children real, lasting harm.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Raising children is hard work. Doing that work wholeheartedly with the guidance of God’s Word is certainly demanding, but the rewards are priceless. <em>Parents</em> magazine noted: “Studies . . . have found that children brought up by loving but authoritative parents​—those who are supportive of their children yet maintain firm limits—​excel academically, develop better social skills, feel good about themselves, and are happier overall than kids whose parents are either too lenient or excessively harsh.”</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">There is an even better reward. Earlier we considered the first part of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:6</a>: “Train up a boy according to the way for him.” The verse continues with these heartwarming words: “Even when he grows old he will not turn aside from it.” Does this inspired proverb offer a guarantee of success? Not necessarily. Your child has free will and will grow up to exercise it. But this verse offers parents a loving assurance. What is that?</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">If you train your children according to the Bible’s counsel, you are creating the most favorable circumstances to bring about a marvelous result​—seeing your children grow up to be happy, fulfilled, and responsible adults. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Proverbs 23:24</a>) By all means, then, prepare those precious “arrows,” protect them, and expend yourself in directing them. You will never regret it.</p>

He carefully places it against the bowstring, and with flexed muscles he bends his bow. Despite the strain, he takes time to aim the arrow. Then he lets it fly! Will the arrow hit the target? Several factors determine the answer, including the skill of the archer, the effect of the wind, and the condition of the arrow.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> King Solomon likened children to “arrows in the hand of a mighty man.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007646/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 127:4</a>) Consider how this illustration might be applied. An archer has the arrow in his bow for only a relatively short time. To hit the target, he must quickly let it go. Likewise, parents have only a relatively short period of time to develop in their children heartfelt love for Jehovah. After what seems to be just a few short years, the children grow up and leave home. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007646/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 19:5</a>) Will they hit the target​—that is, will the children continue to love and serve God after they leave home? Numerous factors influence the answer. Three of them are the skill of the parent, the environment in which the children are raised, and the way the ‘arrow,’ or child, responds to the training he or she receives. Let us examine each of these factors in more detail. First, we will consider some of the traits of a skillful parent.</p>

Although he may be skilled, he is unlikely to hit the target if the arrow he shoots has become bent or warped. Of course, parents will try hard to straighten the bent arrow, so to speak, by striving to adjust a child’s wrong thinking. But children must eventually decide for themselves whether to let this world bend them to its will or to allow Jehovah to make their “paths straight.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007646/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:5, 6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007646/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Romans 12:2</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">18.

<strong>A Future for Today’s Youth</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The Bible likens young children to “arrows in the hand of a mighty man.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982401/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 127:4</a>) If an arrow is to be useful and effective in time of need, it must be skillfully prepared. To keep an arrow on target, feathers are placed at the opposite end from the point, and at a slight angle, so that the arrow will spin while in flight. Otherwise it will easily be deflected from flying straight to the target.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Similarly, unless young people are given a strong sense of direction, they will be easily deflected from a right course. This is seen in a survey of nearly 5,000 youths between the ages of 10 and 18 in 160 schools throughout England. Of the 10-year-olds, 71 percent thought that everyone should pray to God, while only 34 percent of the 18-year-olds did.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Why the difference between the younger and the older children? Evidently, as they grew up, the teenagers had been affected by the cynicism and skepticism of the world around them. Or perhaps they had asked questions that no one had been able to answer.</p>

<strong>Why Look to Jehovah in All You Undertake?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Accordingly, the psalmist regarded as divine blessings such things as the security of a home, the safety of a city and the enjoyment of life’s provisions. He viewed a man’s having a good family in the same light, saying: “Look! Sons are an inheritance from Jehovah; the fruitage of the belly is a reward. Like arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the sons of youth. Happy is the able-bodied man that has filled his quiver with them. They will not be ashamed, for they will speak with enemies in the gate.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980211/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 127:3-5</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">A man who fathered sons while himself still enjoying the strength and vigor of youth was rightly regarded as blessed. When his sons grew up, they were like arrows in his hand. They could defend their father before his adversaries at law. Since the city elders judged in the open area near the gates, it would be there that the sons would speak with opponents in a legal case, successfully putting to silence baseless accusations and false testimony.</p>

<strong>Raising Children in a Permissive World</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>“Like Arrows in the Hand”</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The Bible illustrates the parent-child relationship in a way that highlights a child’s need for parental guidance. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 127:4, 5</a> says: “Like arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the sons of youth. Happy is the able-bodied man that has filled his quiver with them.” So children are likened to <span id="page14" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>arrows, and the parent is likened to a mighty warrior. Just as an archer knows that his arrows will not hit the target by chance, loving parents realize that child rearing cannot be a haphazard business. They want their children to reach a “target”​—a fulfilling life as happy, responsible adults. They want their children to make good choices, to be wise and avoid needless problems, and to achieve worthwhile goals. But wanting such things is not enough.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">If an arrow is to reach its target, what is needed? It must be thoroughly prepared, well protected, and powerfully directed toward its target. Likewise, children need to be prepared, protected, and directed if their journey toward adulthood is going to be successful. Let us consider these three aspects of child rearing one at a time.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>Thoroughly Preparing the Arrow</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The arrows used by archers in Bible times were prepared very carefully. The shaft, perhaps made of a lightweight wood, had to be carved by hand and made as straight as possible. The tip had to be sharp. At the other end of the shaft, feathers were attached to stabilize the arrow in flight, keeping it on course.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Parents want their children to be like those straight arrows​—upright, free from deviation. Therefore, if they are wise, they do not turn a blind eye to serious faults but lovingly help their children to work on these and overcome them. There will be plenty of such work to do with any child, for “foolishness is tied up with the heart of a boy.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:15</a>) The Bible thus exhorts parents to discipline their children. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:4</a>) Indeed, discipline plays a vital role in forming and straightening out a child’s mind and character.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">No wonder, then, that <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 13:24</a> says: “The one holding back his rod is hating his son, but the one loving him is he that does look for him with discipline.” In this context, the rod of discipline represents a means of correction, whatever form it may take. By administering loving discipline, a parent seeks to correct faults that if they were to become deeply rooted, would cause the child much misery in adult life. Truly, withholding such discipline amounts to hate; administering it is an act of love.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">A loving parent also helps the child to understand the reasons behind the rules. Discipline thus involves not only the giving of commands and the meting out of punishment but, more important, the imparting of understanding. The Bible notes: “An <em>understanding</em> son is observing the law.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 28:7</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The feathers, or fletching, that an archer attaches to his arrows help them to fly straight after they leave his bow. Likewise, Bible teachings from the Originator of the family arrangement can stay with children even after they leave home, benefiting them throughout life. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ephesians 3:14, 15</a>) How, though, can parents make sure that such teachings are really “attached” to their children?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Notice God’s counsel to Israelite parents in Moses’ time: “These words that I am commanding you today must prove to be on your heart; and you must inculcate them in your son.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:6, 7</a>) So parents need to do two things. First, they need to learn and apply God’s Word themselves, actually coming to love God’s laws. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 119:97</a>) Then they are in a position to apply the second part of the scripture​—to “inculcate” God’s laws in their children. That means impressing the value of such laws on their children’s hearts through effective teaching and frequent repetition.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Clearly, there is nothing old-fashioned or out-of-date about teaching Bible principles or using loving discipline to correct serious <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>faults. These are vital ways to prepare those precious “arrows” for a straight and steady flight toward adulthood.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>Protecting the Arrow</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Let us return to the illustration recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 127:4, 5</a>. Recall that the archer “filled his quiver” with his arrows. Once prepared, arrows had to be protected. Thus, the archer carried them in a quiver, where they would not be easily damaged or broken. Interestingly, the Bible speaks prophetically of the Messiah as a polished arrow that his Father “concealed . . . in his own quiver.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isaiah 49:2</a>) Jehovah God, the most loving Father imaginable, did indeed protect his beloved Son, Jesus, from all manner of harm until the appointed time came for the Messiah to be put to death as foretold. Even then, God protected his Son from being permanently harmed by death, bringing him safely back to heaven, to live eternally.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Likewise, good parents are concerned about protecting their children from the dangers of this degraded world. It may be that parents prohibit certain activities that would unnecessarily expose their children to dangerous influences. For example, wise parents take this principle seriously: “Bad associations spoil useful habits.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>) Protecting children from association with those who do not respect the moral standards of the Bible will likely keep young ones from making a number of costly, even deadly, mistakes.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Children may not always appreciate parental protection. In fact, they may well resent it at times, for protecting your children will often mean telling them no. A respected author of books on child rearing comments: “Though they don’t always show it and probably won’t thank you at that moment, children really do want parents to provide safe, predictable structure in their lives. We can do that by being an authoritative parent who sets limits on behavior.”</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Yes, protecting your children from anything that might rob them of their peace, <span id="page16" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>their innocence, or their clean standing before God is an essential way to show that you love them. In time, they will likely come to understand your motives, and they will appreciate your loving protection.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>Directing the Arrow</strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Note that <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 127:4, 5</a> likens the parent to “a mighty man.” Does this mean that only a father can be effective in the parental role? Not at all. In fact, the principle of this illustration applies to both fathers and mothers​—and to single parents as well. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Proverbs 1:8</a>) The phrase “mighty man” suggests that a considerable amount of strength was required to shoot an arrow from a bow. In Bible times, bows were sometimes mounted with copper, and a soldier was said to ‘tread the bow,’ perhaps bracing the bow with his foot so that he could string it. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Jeremiah 50:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 29</a>) Clearly, much energy and effort went into pulling that taut string back in order to shoot those arrows toward their mark!</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Similarly, raising children requires considerable effort. They do not simply rear themselves, any more than an arrow launches itself toward its target. Sadly, many parents today seem unwilling to expend the kind of effort that is needed. They take the easy way out. They let television, school, and peers teach their children about right and wrong, about morals, about sex. They let their children have whatever they want. And when saying no seems like too much work, they simply say yes​—often excusing their decision by saying that they do not want to hurt their children’s feelings. In reality, it is their permissiveness that will do their children real, lasting harm.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Raising children is hard work. Doing that work wholeheartedly with the guidance of God’s Word is certainly demanding, but the rewards are priceless. <em>Parents</em> magazine noted: “Studies . . . have found that children brought up by loving but authoritative parents​—those who are supportive of their children yet maintain firm limits—​excel academically, develop better social skills, feel good about themselves, and are happier overall than kids whose parents are either too lenient or excessively harsh.”</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">There is an even better reward. Earlier we considered the first part of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:6</a>: “Train up a boy according to the way for him.” The verse continues with these heartwarming words: “Even when he grows old he will not turn aside from it.” Does this inspired proverb offer a guarantee of success? Not necessarily. Your child has free will and will grow up to exercise it. But this verse offers parents a loving assurance. What is that?</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">If you train your children according to the Bible’s counsel, you are creating the most favorable circumstances to bring about a marvelous result​—seeing your children grow up to be happy, fulfilled, and responsible adults. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008244/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Proverbs 23:24</a>) By all means, then, prepare those precious “arrows,” protect them, and expend yourself in directing them. You will never regret it.</p>

<strong>Why Look to Jehovah in All You Undertake?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Accordingly, the psalmist regarded as divine blessings such things as the security of a home, the safety of a city and the enjoyment of life’s provisions. He viewed a man’s having a good family in the same light, saying: “Look! Sons are an inheritance from Jehovah; the fruitage of the belly is a reward. Like arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the sons of youth. Happy is the able-bodied man that has filled his quiver with them. They will not be ashamed, for they will speak with enemies in the gate.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980211/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 127:3-5</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">A man who fathered sons while himself still enjoying the strength and vigor of youth was rightly regarded as blessed. When his sons grew up, they were like arrows in his hand. They could defend their father before his adversaries at law. Since the city elders judged in the open area near the gates, it would be there that the sons would speak with opponents in a legal case, successfully putting to silence baseless accusations and false testimony.</p>

She had become involved in all types of illicit sex, as well as spiritism and stealing. She then began to study the Bible and saw the need to listen to and fear Jehovah. She says: “Knowing Jehovah is the best thing that has happened to me. Jehovah helped me so much in finding the truth and happiness. I feel I owe so much to him because he opened my eyes and gave me the chance really to think and find him. I now want to help other people find this happiness.”</p>

<strong>Plants of the Bible</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>The Bible psalmist alluded to some characteristics of the olive tree when he promised those fearing Jehovah: “Your sons will be like slips of olive trees all around your table.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001068/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps 128:1-3</a>) Cuttings, or slips, cut from a grown olive tree are often used for starting new trees. In addition, aged olive trees may send up shoots from their roots, thereby perpetuating themselves. Like such shoots, sons would surround a father, contributing their part to the happiness of the family.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/1790/0"><em>Insight,</em> Volume 2<em>,</em> p. 552</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Olive</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>The olive tree not only lives for centuries but, if cut down, will send up as many as six new shoots from its roots to develop into new trunks, and aged trees also will often perpetuate themselves in this way. New trees are frequently planted by using slips cut from a grown tree. Thus the psalmist’s illustration is very apt when likening the blessed man’s sons to “slips of olive trees all around your table.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003317/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps 128:3</a>.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">Often new shoots sprout from the base of the trunk of an olive tree. When the main trunk of an old tree no longer bears much fruit, new shoots may become vigorous trunks around it. Similarly, parents can rejoice to have fruit-bearing children serving Jehovah alongside them.​—5/15, page 27.</p>

How would a God-fearing man be rewarded? “Your wife will be like a fruit-bearing vine in the innermost parts of your house,” sang the psalmist. “Your sons will be like slips of olive trees all around your table.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000365/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 128:3</a>) What are these “slips of olive trees,” and why does the psalmist compare them to sons?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The olive tree is unusual in that new shoots constantly sprout from the base of its trunk.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2000365/0">a</a> When, because of old age, the main trunk no longer bears the fruit it once did, cultivators may allow several slips, or new shoots, to grow until they become an integral part of the tree. After a time, the original tree will have three or four young, vigorous trunks surrounding it, like sons around a table. These slips have the same rootstock, and they share in producing a good crop of olives.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">This characteristic of the olive tree aptly illustrates how sons and daughters can grow firm in faith, thanks to the strong spiritual roots of their parents. As offspring grow older, they also have a share in bearing fruit and supporting their parents, who rejoice to see their children serving Jehovah alongside them.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000365/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:20</a>.</p>

If you are going to train your children to be conformed to God’s ways, the best time to do it is from their infancy. “Train up a boy according to the way for him; even when he grows old he will not turn aside from it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101992681/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101992681/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 2 Timothy 3:15</a>) In infancy the brain is soaking up information at high speed, faster than it ever will again.

Your sons will be like slips of olive trees all around your table.” Trees may be shaped in different ways by training them. Some are made to grow flat against a wall. Others spread out low over the ground. Some are even made small and stunted by trimming their roots and cramping them, as in the case of a bonsai. An old saying emphasizes how early training will also shape a child: “The way the twig is bent is the way the tree will grow.” A sense of balance is needed here. On the one hand, the child needs guiding so that it will conform to righteous standards. At the same time it should not be expected to conform to some preconceived ideal the parents have as to the exact personality it should display. You cannot make an olive tree bear figs. Train your child in right ways but do not force it into a predetermined mold that will not allow its distinctive personality and inherited gifts to find normal expression. Give yourself time to come to know this child you have produced. Then, as with a tender young tree, give your child guidance that is strong enough to protect and support it in a right direction, yet gentle enough not to cramp the child’s development to its full capacity for good.</p>

The Law forbade seizing a widow’s garment as a pledge at all.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013431/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Deut. 24:17</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013431/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 24:3</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Also, one could not enter a man’s house to take a pledged item from him. The debtor was to bring the pledge out to his creditor. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013431/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Deut. 24:10, 11</a>) In this way the inviolability of the man’s home was upheld, and he could maintain self-respect, which would hardly be so if his creditor felt at liberty to enter the man’s home without invitation. Thus, in addition to compassion and generosity (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013431/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Deut. 15:8</a>), the laws about pledges encouraged respect for the person and rights of others.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>ILLUSTRATIVE USE</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013431/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 15:6</a> gave as a sign of God’s blessing the fact that the Jews would have sufficient means to “lend on pledge to many nations.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">If one “despised the word,” failing to repay a loan, he would forfeit what he put up as a pledge; in like manner the one obliged to obey God’s commandment but not carrying out his obligation would experience loss.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013431/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Prov. 13:13</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The Hebrew Scriptures repeatedly advised against going surety for a stranger, thereby promising to pay that one’s debt if he failed to do so.

This is in direct contrast to the sympathetic consideration to be shown the poor man who is obliged to become debtor to another due to his own misfortune, as set forth in texts considered earlier in this article. The one going surety for a stranger is not simply unfortunate but guilty of stupid action; the proverb evidently says to ‘let him suffer the consequences.’ The latter part of the verse calls for ‘seizing a pledge’ in the “instance of a foreign woman.” The man entering into relationship with such a woman may become impoverished (compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013431/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Proverbs 5:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013431/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 8-10</a>) and so he may have to pledge his remaining possessions as security for his debts. The proverb apparently says that he merits no pity, inasmuch as he acted contrary to all sound advice in having dealings with the “foreign woman.”</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"></p>

The roof rested on strong wooden beams laid from wall to wall. Smaller wooden rafters were placed across these beams and, in turn, were covered with branches, reeds, and the like. Next came a layer of earth several inches thick that was a thick plaster of clay or of clay and lime. An opening could easily be dug through such an earthen roof, as was done by men who were endeavoring to get a paralytic into Jesus’ presence so that he might be healed. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002095/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Mr 2:4</a>) The beams of the roof often were supported by a row of upright wooden posts resting on stone bases.

<strong>Keep Your Integrity!</strong><br/><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>4.</strong><strong> (a) Why can an imperfect person have integrity? (b) According to <a href="/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019281/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 103:12-14</a>, what does Jehovah expect of us?</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></span> Should we conclude that we must be perfect in order to have integrity? After all, we may feel that we are less than sound, or even very flawed. Consider two reasons why we need not fear. First, Jehovah does not focus on our flaws. His Word tells us: “If errors were what you watch, O Jah, then who, O Jehovah, could stand?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019281/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 130:3</a>) He knows that we are imperfect, sinful humans, and he forgives us generously.

<strong>What Draws You to God?</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">True Christians are grateful that this punishment-oriented approach to God is one of the things from which they have been set free by the truth of God’s Word. Yet there is the ever-present danger that any one of us could become infected with similar negative thoughts in a more subtle way. How so? Perhaps we could begin to allow our reason for serving God to be overly influenced with thoughts of punishment for our failures and shortcomings.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Hence, there is need to remind ourselves constantly that “we all stumble many times,” that ‘if errors were what Jehovah watched, who could stand?’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978362/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Jas. 3:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978362/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Ps. 130:3</a>) This will help us to keep a balanced view of ourselves and others as we continually work to “put on the new personality which was created according to God’s will in true righteousness and loyalty.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978362/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Eph. 4:24</a>) This balanced view enables us to realize that, although each of us should manifest progress in putting on the new personality, none of us reaches the stage where he does not sin and need forgiveness daily for his shortcomings.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978362/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 John 2:1, 2</a>.</p>

In some cases, Bible writers used a Hebrew word for forgiveness that is never used to describe human forgiveness.</p>

<strong>Humility—A Most Desirable Quality</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">However, if we desire Jehovah’s recognition, we do well to consider the example of his humble servants in ancient times. One of these was David. Though anointed as king, he did not seek to get the position by force but willingly endured humiliations and persecutions at the hands of King Saul. At heart David did not have a conceited opinion of himself. He did not look with envy upon those in superior positions nor did he look with disdain upon the lowly and afflicted. He recognized his limitations and did not reach out for things beyond his capacities. That is why he could say: “O Jehovah, my heart has not been haughty, nor have my eyes been lofty; nor have I walked in things too great, nor in things too wonderful for me.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977529/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 131:1</a>.</p>

<strong>Weaning</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>A weaned child, though no longer yearning for nourishment from its mother, still finds security and satisfaction in her arms. Comparably, David had soothed and quieted his soul “like a weanling upon his mother,” and his soul was ‘like a weanling upon him.’ Apparently it was soothed, quieted, and satisfied because he did not desire prominence, had manifested humility, avoided haughtiness, and refrained from walking in things too great for him. He urged Israel to act similarly, humbly ‘waiting for Jehovah to time indefinite.’​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004589/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps 131:1-3</a>.</p>

By not being haughty at heart and lofty in eyes and by not going after things that were too great for him. Rather than seeking prominence, David usually recognized his limitations and manifested humility. We are wise to imitate his attitude, particularly when reaching out for privileges in the congregation.</p>

Content to pursue a humble course (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1987206/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">verse 1 of Ps 131</a>), the psalmist felt “soothed and quieted,” like a weanling in his mother’s arms. Humbly waiting on Jehovah and doing his will bring security and rich blessings.</p>

<strong>Humility—A Most Desirable Quality</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Cultivating this humility required effort on David’s part, for he acknowledged under inspiration: “Surely I have soothed and quieted my soul like a weanling upon his mother.

Jehovah has sworn to David, truly he will not draw back from it: ‘Of the fruitage of your belly I shall set on your throne. If your sons will keep my covenant and my reminders that I shall teach them, their sons also forever will sit upon your throne.’ For Jehovah has chosen Zion; he has longed for it as a dwelling for himself: ‘ . . . There I shall cause the horn of David to grow. I have set in order a lamp for my anointed one. His enemies I shall clothe with shame, but upon him his diadem will flourish.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Ps. 132:10-18</a>) Since the Kingdom is the powerful means by which Jehovah has chosen to vindicate his universal sovereignty, how could we even think that Jehovah would draw back what he has solemnly sworn to King David even though it was thirty centuries ago! He is a God that faithfully keeps his covenant.</p><p id="p87" data-pid="87" class="qu">27.

This was why, on the night before he died as a witness to this kingdom, Jesus said to his faithful apostles: “You are the ones that have stuck with me in my trials; and I make a covenant with you, just as my Father has made a covenant with me, for a kingdom.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Luke 22:28, 29</a>) For this reason Jesus will have his congregation of brothers, anointed with the same spirit of God, as joint heirs in the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="qu">28.

In this way he, although David’s son, would become David’s Lord. He could become David’s Lord only by becoming a heavenly King, seated at God’s right hand in the heavens. He would become a priest for David, and since David was only a king but no priest, Jesus would again become more than David; he would become a King-Priest like ancient Melchizedek, king of Salem.</p><p id="p89" data-pid="89" class="qu">29. In what way did Jesus call attention to these facts to silence his enemies, and how did Peter also refer to those facts on the day of Pentecost?</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[89]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="29"><sup>29</sup></span> By calling attention to these facts Jesus silenced his enemies. He quoted to them from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Psalm 110</a>, in which King David prophetically called Jesus Christ his Lord, by saying: “The utterance of Jehovah to my Lord is: ‘Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.’ The rod of your strength Jehovah will send out of Zion: ‘Go subduing in the midst of your enemies.’ Jehovah has sworn (and he will not feel sorry): ‘You are a priest to time indefinite according to the manner of Melchizedek!’ Jehovah himself at your right hand will certainly break kings to pieces on the day of his anger.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/47/1" data-bid="48-2" class="b"> 4, 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/47/2" data-bid="48-3" class="b"> Matt. 22:41-45</a>) To carry out this invitation to Jesus to sit at his right hand and this sworn oath to make Jesus there seated an everlasting king like Melchizedek, Jehovah raised Jesus from the dead on the third day that he might enter the invisible heavens. On the fortieth day after that his disciples on the Mount of Olives saw him ascend heavenward to his Father. Ten days later on the day of Pentecost the apostle Peter preached to over 3,000 Jews and quoted <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Psalm 110</a> and gave them the proof that Jesus was then, that day, up in heaven at Jehovah’s right hand as David’s Lord and as Christ.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Acts 2:32-36</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="ss"><strong>THE KINGDOM IN ACTION</strong></p><p id="p90" data-pid="90" class="qu">30.

How could that affect us today in this age of hydrogen bombs and nuclear warfare? We humans should not think that all that is too far in the past to be of any concern or value to us today. Nineteen centuries ago seems like long, long ago to us, but to the beginningless, endless Jehovah God, to whom a thousand of our years are as but one day, nineteen hundred years ago is as less than two days ago. More than ever the actions of all the nations since the year 1914 call for the settling of the supreme issue, the vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty over earth as well as heaven. To that end there is the present need of the royal government of his King like Melchizedek.</p>

Hence in a time of persecution God’s people who depend upon him to carry out this kingdom covenant can well take up the words of the psalmist, not in any doubt about the covenant, but in an appeal to God concerning it, and say: “Where are your former acts of loving-kindness, O Jehovah, about which you swore to David in your faithfulness?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ps. 89:49</a>) Considerately God assures his people of his faithfulness to the covenant, saying: “I shall readily conclude with you people an indefinitely lasting covenant respecting <span id="page653" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="653" data-before-text="653"></span>the loving-kindnesses to David that are faithful.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Isa. 55:3</a>) Jesus Christ in particular could take consolation from this divine promise.</p><p id="p101" data-pid="101" class="qu">31. (a) So why was Jesus born in the royal family line of David? (b) How did Jehovah thus answer the prayer of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/81/0" data-bid="82-1" class="b">Psalm 132:1-18</a>?</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" data-rel-pid="[101]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="31"><sup>31</sup></span> So, to the end of making the kingdom covenant an everlasting truth, Jesus was born in the royal family line of David, to become David’s Permanent Heir. Thus Jehovah did not prove untrue to King David and did not draw back from giving to that anointed king a permanent heir. Jehovah answered the prayer made to him in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 132:1-18</a>: “On account of David your servant, do not turn back the face of your anointed one. Jehovah has sworn to David, truly he will not draw back from it: ‘Of the fruitage of your belly I shall set on your throne. . . . There I shall cause the horn of David to grow, I have set in order a lamp for my anointed one. His enemies I shall clothe with shame; but upon him his diadem will flourish.’”</p><p id="p102" data-pid="102" class="qu">32, 33.

On the day of the festival of Pentecost, fifty days after Jesus Christ was resurrected from the dead, Peter explained the outpouring of God’s holy spirit upon Christ’s disciples there in Jerusalem and said:</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" data-rel-pid="[102]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="33"><sup>33</sup></span> “Brothers, it is allowable to speak with freeness of speech to you concerning the family head David, that he both deceased and was buried and his tomb is among us to this day. Therefore, because he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn to him with an oath that he would seat one from the fruitage of his loins upon his throne, he saw beforehand and spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he forsaken in Haʹdes nor did his flesh see corruption. This Jesus God resurrected, of which fact we are all witnesses. Therefore because he was exalted to the right hand of God and received the promised holy spirit from the Father, he has poured out this which you see and hear. Actually David did not ascend to the heavens, but he himself says, ‘Jehovah said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand, until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.’” Therefore let all the house of Israel know for a certainty that God made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you impaled.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Acts 2:29-36</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="ss"><strong>“LORD” OF KING DAVID</strong></p><p id="p103" data-pid="103" class="qu">34.

The throne of King David had been merely an earthly one called “Jehovah’s throne”; but the position of Jesus Christ in a throne was a heavenly one, at God’s own right hand. He was to be a deathless, everlasting heavenly king. In the approaching future, when David is resurrected from the dead, he will learn of his descendant, Jesus Christ, and will acknowledge this exalted one as his Lord, the true Christ or Anointed One. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalm 110</a> King David foretold the lordship of Jesus Christ. The apostle Peter quoted the first verse of this psalm and applied it to Jesus Christ, as being fulfilled in him. Thus, in effect, the inspired Peter applied the entire psalm to Jesus Christ. The apostle Paul also applies it to him.</p><p id="p104" data-pid="104" class="qu">35.

Addressing itself to him, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">verse four of Psalm 110</a> announces: “Jehovah has sworn (and he will <span id="page654" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="654" data-before-text="654"></span>feel no regret): ‘You are a priest to time indefinite according to the manner of Melchizedek!’” Hence Jehovah thus swore to his Son, Jesus Christ.</p>

He is a God that faithfully keeps his covenant.</p><p id="p87" data-pid="87" class="qu">27.

This was why, on the night before he died as a witness to this kingdom, Jesus said to his faithful apostles: “You are the ones that have stuck with me in my trials; and I make a covenant with you, just as my Father has made a covenant with me, for a kingdom.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Luke 22:28, 29</a>) For this reason Jesus will have his congregation of brothers, anointed with the same spirit of God, as joint heirs in the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="qu">28.

In this way he, although David’s son, would become David’s Lord. He could become David’s Lord only by becoming a heavenly King, seated at God’s right hand in the heavens. He would become a priest for David, and since David was only a king but no priest, Jesus would again become more than David; he would become a King-Priest like ancient Melchizedek, king of Salem.</p><p id="p89" data-pid="89" class="qu">29.

He quoted to them from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Psalm 110</a>, in which King David prophetically called Jesus Christ his Lord, by saying: “The utterance of Jehovah to my Lord is: ‘Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.’ The rod of your strength Jehovah will send out of Zion: ‘Go subduing in the midst of your enemies.’ Jehovah has sworn (and he will not feel sorry): ‘You are a priest to time indefinite according to the manner of Melchizedek!’ Jehovah himself at your right hand will certainly break kings to pieces on the day of his anger.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/47/1" data-bid="48-2" class="b"> 4, 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/47/2" data-bid="48-3" class="b"> Matt. 22:41-45</a>) To carry out this invitation to Jesus to sit at his right hand and this sworn oath to make Jesus there seated an everlasting king like Melchizedek, Jehovah raised Jesus from the dead on the third day that he might enter the invisible heavens. On the fortieth day after that his disciples on the Mount of Olives saw him ascend heavenward to his Father. Ten days later on the day of Pentecost the apostle Peter preached to over 3,000 Jews and quoted <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Psalm 110</a> and gave them the proof that Jesus was then, that day, up in heaven at Jehovah’s right hand as David’s Lord and as Christ.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Acts 2:32-36</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="ss"><strong>THE KINGDOM IN ACTION</strong></p><p id="p90" data-pid="90" class="qu">30.

How could that affect us today in this age of hydrogen bombs and nuclear warfare? We humans should not think that all that is too far in the past to be of any concern or value to us today. Nineteen centuries ago seems like long, long ago to us, but to the beginningless, endless Jehovah God, to whom a thousand of our years are as but one day, nineteen hundred years ago is as less than two days ago. More than ever the actions of all the nations since the year 1914 call for the settling of the supreme issue, the vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty over earth as well as heaven. To that end there is the present need of the royal government of his King like Melchizedek.</p>

Jehovah himself would make a ruin of the kingdom of the royal family of David at Jerusalem. Things would not be the same as formerly. The Gentile ruling powers that had been low in God’s sight would be put on top, and the earthly kingdom of Jehovah’s chosen people would be brought low, in subjection to the Gentile world powers. The period of Gentile world supremacy without interference from a typical kingdom of God at Jerusalem would continue on until the coming of the one “who has the legal right,” that is to say, the promised true Messiah, and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah would give the kingdom to him. The Gentile world powers would then be no longer on top to dominate the earth. The Messianic kingdom would take world control. Thus, according to the covenant established toward David, his kingdom would be an everlasting government. His throne must stand forever!</p>

As for everybody, what was right in his own eyes he was accustomed to do.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012560/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Judg. 17:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012560/59/1" data-bid="60-2" class="b"> 21:25</a>) This does not imply that there was no judicial restraint. Every city had judges, older men, to handle legal questions and problems, meting out justice. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012560/60/0" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Deut. 16:18-20</a>; see COURT, JUDICIAL.) The Levitical priesthood functioned as a superior guiding force, educating the people in God’s law, the high priest having the Urim and Thummim by which to consult God on difficult matters. (See PRIEST; HIGH PRIEST.) So, the individual who availed himself of these provisions, who gained knowledge of God’s law and applied it, had a sound guide for his conscience. His doing “what was right in his own eyes” <em>in such case</em> would not result in bad. Jehovah allowed the people to show a willing or unwilling attitude and course. There was no human monarch over the nation supervising the work of the city judges or commanding the citizens to engage in particular projects or marshaling them for defense of the nation. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012560/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Judges 5:1-18</a>.) The bad conditions that developed, therefore, were chargeable to the unwillingness of the majority to heed the word and law of their heavenly King and to avail themselves of his provisions.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012560/62/0" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Judg. 2:11-23</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="ss"><strong>A HUMAN KING REQUESTED</strong></p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">Nearly four hundred years from the time of the Exodus and over eight hundred years from the making of God’s covenant with Abraham, the Israelites requested a human king to lead them, even as the other nations had human monarchs. Their request constituted a rejection of Jehovah’s own kingship over them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012560/63/0" data-bid="64-1" class="b">1 Sam. 8:4-8</a>) True, the people properly expected a kingdom to be established by God in harmony with his promise to Abraham and to Jacob, already cited. They had further basis for such hope in Jacob’s deathbed prophecy concerning Judah (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012560/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Gen. 49:8-10</a>), in Jehovah’s words to Israel after the Exodus (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012560/65/0" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Ex. 19:3-6</a>), in the terms of the Law covenant (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012560/66/0" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Deut. 17:14, 15</a>), and even in part of the message God caused the prophet Balaam to speak. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012560/67/0" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Num. 24:2-7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012560/67/1" data-bid="68-2" class="b"> 17</a>) Samuel’s faithful mother Hannah expressed this hope in prayer. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012560/68/0" data-bid="69-1" class="b">1 Sam. 2:7-10</a>) Nevertheless, Jehovah had not fully revealed his “sacred secret” regarding the Kingdom, had not indicated when his due time for its establishment would arrive or the structure and composition of that government, whether it would be earthly or heavenly. It was therefore presumptuous on the part of the people now to make demand for a human king.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">The menace of Philistine and Ammonite aggression evidently contributed to the Israelites’ desire for a visible royal commander-in-chief. They thus displayed a lack of faith in God’s ability to protect, guide and provide for them, as a nation or as individuals. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012560/69/0" data-bid="70-1" class="b">1 Sam. 8:4-8</a>) The people’s motive was wrong; yet Jehovah God granted their request, not for their sake primarily, but to accomplish his own good purpose in the progressive revelation of the “sacred secret” of his future kingdom by the “seed.” Human kingship would bring its problems and expense for Israel, however, and Jehovah laid the facts before the people.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012560/70/0" data-bid="71-1" class="b">1 Sam. 8:9-22</a>.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">The kings thereafter appointed by Jehovah were to serve as God’s earthly agents, not diminishing in the least Jehovah’s own sovereignty over the nation. The throne was actually Jehovah’s and they sat thereon as deputy kings. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012560/71/0" data-bid="72-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:23</a>) Jehovah commanded the anointing of the first king, Saul (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012560/72/0" data-bid="73-1" class="b">1 Sam. 9:15-17</a>), at the same time exposing the lack of faith the nation had displayed.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012560/73/0" data-bid="74-1" class="b">1 Sam. 10:17-25</a>.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">For the kingship to bring benefits, both king and nation must now respect God’s authority. If they unrealistically looked to other sources for direction and protection, they and their king would be swept away.

His kingship was to operate entirely within the framework of the Law covenant. He was under divine orders to write his own copy of that Law and read it daily, that he might keep a proper fear of the Sovereign Authority, stay humble and hold to a righteous course. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012560/75/0" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Deut. 17:16-20</a>) To the extent that he did this, loving God wholeheartedly and loving his neighbor as himself, his rule would bring blessings, with no real cause for complaint due to oppression or hardship. But, as with the people, so now with their kings, Jehovah allowed the rulers to demonstrate what their hearts contained, their willingness or unwillingness to recognize God’s own authority and will.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="ss"><strong>DAVID’S EXEMPLARY RULE</strong></p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">The Benjamite Saul’s disrespect for the superior authority and arrangements of the “Excellency of Israel” brought divine disfavor and cost his family line the throne.

At the time of receiving contributions for the temple construction, David prayed to God before the congregated people, saying: “Yours, O Jehovah, are the greatness and the mightiness and the beauty and the excellency and the dignity; for everything in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, O Jehovah, the One also lifting yourself up as head over all. The riches and the glory are on account of you, and you are dominating everything; and in your hand there are power and mightiness, and in your hand is ability to make great and to give strength to all.

What is remarkable among God’s people?</strong></h3><p id="p5" data-pid="5">If you attend a congregation meeting in another land, you may find that you cannot understand the language, but in many ways you will feel at home. Why? Because we study the Bible using the same publications everywhere. And we strive to show love for one another. No matter where we live, we all <strong>“call on the name of Jehovah, to worship him in unity.”</strong>​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021256/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Zephaniah 3:9</a>, footnote.</p><h3 class="du-color--purple-600 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>2.

Rather than focusing on the imperfections of others, look for their good qualities. Instead of associating with only those who share your interests, try to get to know brothers and sisters who come from different backgrounds. We can also work hard to root out any feelings of prejudice we may have.​—Read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021256/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:17</a>.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1102021256/0">a</a></p><h3 class="du-color--purple-600 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>3.</strong> <strong>What will you do when you have a disagreement with a fellow Christian?</strong></h3><p id="p9" data-pid="9">We are united, but we are also imperfect. Sometimes we disappoint or even hurt one another. So God’s Word tells us to <strong>“continue . . . forgiving one another,”</strong> adding: <strong>“Just as Jehovah freely forgave you, you must also do the same.”</strong> (Read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021256/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Colossians 3:13</a>.) We have hurt Jehovah countless times, and yet he has forgiven us. So he expects us to forgive our brothers. If you realize that you have hurt someone, take the initiative to settle matters.​—Read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021256/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 5:23, 24</a>.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1102021256/1">b</a></p><h2 class="du-color--coolGray-400 du-fontSize--basePlus1 du-letterSpacing--8 du-constrainStylesToTextWidth du-borderStyle-top--solid du-borderColor-top--coolGray-400 du-borderWidth-top--4 du-margin-top--12 du-padding-top--4" id="p10" data-pid="10"><span id="page234" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="234" data-before-text="234"></span><strong>DIG DEEPER</strong></h2><p id="p11" data-pid="11">Look for ways that you can contribute to the unity and peace of the congregation.</p><img src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/lff/2021/1958" data-img-small-src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/lff/2021/1957" alt="Collage: A brother making peace. 1. Another brother speaks harshly to him. 2. He thinks about what the other brother said. 3. He considers the Bible’s advice about what to do when offended. 4. He meets the other brother for coffee and makes peace." width="150" height="62" />

<strong>Brother</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"></span>“Brother” is also applied to those united in a general cause and having similar aims and purposes. For example, King Hiram of Tyre called King Solomon his brother, not simply because he was an equal in rank and position but also perhaps because of mutual interests in supplying timbers and other things for the temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000830/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1Ki 9:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000830/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 5:1-12</a>) “Look! How good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity!” David wrote, implying that it is not blood relations alone that make for peace and unity between fleshly brothers. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000830/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps 133:1</a>) In fact, mutual affection and interest, not common parentage, prompted David to call Jonathan his brother. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000830/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2Sa 1:26</a>) Companions having similar natures and dispositions, even when such are bad, are properly called brothers.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000830/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Pr 18:9</a>.</p>

Being together had a wholesome effect on them, like refreshing anointing oil with a pleasing aroma. When such oil was poured on Aaron’s head, it flowed down his beard and ran to the collar of his garment. For the Israelites, being together had a good influence that worked its way through the assembled people as a whole. Misunderstandings were cleared up, and unity was promoted. Similar unity exists in Jehovah’s global family today. Regularly associating has a wholesome spiritual effect on its members. Any misunderstandings or difficulties are removed as the counsel of God’s Word is applied.

<strong>The Blessing of Brotherly Unity</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">David wrote under inspiration about the blessing of brotherly unity. Since all the Israelites were descendants of the one man Jacob, David’s words at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980328/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 133</a> really applied to the whole nation. Today devoted Christians are members of a worldwide brotherhood and so should strive to maintain the delightful unity described by the psalmist. “Look! How good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity! It is like the good oil upon the head, that is running down upon the beard, Aaron’s beard, that is running down to the collar of his garments. It is like the dew of Hermon that is descending upon the mountains of Zion. For there Jehovah commanded the blessing to be, even life to time indefinite.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980328/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 133:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When all the tribes of Israel would come to Jerusalem for the three annual festivals, they had the opportunity to dwell together in unity. Though coming from various tribes, they were but one family of brothers. Their being together had a pleasing and wholesome influence. The effect of this dwelling together in unity was like good anointing oil​—a refreshing substance with a lingering and pleasing aroma. The oil poured upon Aaron’s head flowed down his long beard and ran down to the collar of his garment. Likewise, the wholesome effect of the Israelites’ being together had a permeating influence, working its way through the assembled people. This resulted in clearing up misunderstandings and in removing prejudices. It was as if the good oil had pervaded everything. The credit for this, of course, would go to Jehovah God from whom all blessings flow.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Similarly, when such brotherly unity as the psalmist describes exists among Christians, there is no quarreling, faultfinding or constant complaining. But their associating together is good, wholesome and beneficial. United in the bond of love, they are actively concerned about one another and enjoy being together. Their unity brings them delight or pleasure because of the mutual <span id="page29" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>encouragement and upbuilding that results. Any misunderstandings or difficulties can be removed as all unitedly approach Jehovah God in humility, desiring his guidance, help and forgiveness for their transgressions.</p>

<strong>Settling Difficulties in Christian Love</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> We cannot overemphasize at this point the need to exercise that greatest of all fruits of the spirit, Christian love, in order to attain success in applying Jesus’ formula for solving personal difficulties. “Love <span id="page302" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="302" data-before-text="302"></span>never fails. . . . Now, however, there remain faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965362/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965362/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 13</a>) Because this evil world does not have God’s spirit, it prevents those of the world from solving their many differences. It must be observed, too, that, when personal problems arise between individual Christians, God’s holy spirit is being obstructed in one way or another and so is unable to operate fully to produce its fruitage, which is “love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith, mildness, self-control.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965362/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Gal. 5:22, 23</a>) However, when Christian love is shown and is successful in removing that obstacle, then once again there is opportunity for the full flow of God’s spirit upon the ones involved, and they are able to feel and produce in a greater measure its fruitage in their lives. So now there is a feeling of unity and harmony as was so well expressed by the psalmist: “Look! How good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity! It is like the good oil upon the head, that is running down upon the beard, Aaron’s beard, that is running down to the collar of his garments.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965362/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ps. 133:1, 2</a>) This quality of unity is absolutely essential to the spiritual well-being of Jehovah’s New World society today. By maintaining it we will make our work more productive, for we will be able to work with our whole mind, soul and strength. It will make our living together a truly pleasant and happifying experience, which in itself will be a source of strength to us. It will also more definitely identify us as a truly New World society operating under God’s holy spirit. However, it cannot be maintained miraculously, but only by the individuals in the New World society cultivating love for one another. Remember that love is a fruitage. It can and must be cultivated. Nowhere is this more evident than in this matter of settling difficulties in Christian love.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">15. (a) Why is this direct, personal approach to the problem the best one? (b) What third, more serious step can in most instances be avoided?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> In view of the foregoing we can fully appreciate the divine wisdom manifested through Jesus Christ in giving us this simple but effective method of settling problems that arise. “O the depth of God’s riches and wisdom and knowledge! How unsearchable his judgments are and past tracing out his ways are! For ‘who has come to know Jehovah’s mind, or who has become his counselor?’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965362/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Rom. 11:33, 34</a>) Foreseeing the possibility of personal difficulties even among his dedicated servants, Jehovah saw fit to provide us with an effective remedy. It is certainly the course of divine wisdom, then, to avail ourselves of this remedy when such difficulties do arise. This direct, personal approach to solving personal problems is the most rapid and effective, for much time and effort may be saved for yourself and others if these problems are settled promptly and alone. If this fails, we can seek the aid of a more mature brother in the congregation. Seldom, however, should it be necessary to take the third, more serious step outlined by Jesus in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965362/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matthew 18:17</a>, that of taking the matter to the representative members of the congregation, calling in the wrongdoer before witnesses and proving beyond question his sin.

<strong>Bible-based Society of Kingdom Witnesses</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><strong>Public Talk.</strong> Most congregations take advantage of Sunday morning for house-to-house preaching. That is why the entire congregation usually assembles at the Kingdom Hall on Sunday afternoon or evening for the weekly public talk and <em>Watchtower</em> study. At the congregation meetings you can obtain attractive handbills to use for inviting others to attend the public talk, which is patterned after the Bible lectures given in early Christian times. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962762/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Matt. 5:1–7:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962762/33/1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 13:1-36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962762/33/2" data-bid="34-3" class="b"> Acts 5:42</a>) The speakers are local or visiting Witnesses who have qualified by training, maturity and zeal in the ministry. Each year the Watch Tower Society provides new talk topics and printed outlines that guide the speakers in working up informative, one-hour Bible lectures. In any one year, more than twenty-four different topics are scheduled. Each lecture helps you to get a better grasp of an important Bible subject. To accomplish this the speakers spend many hours researching, preparing and rehearsing their material for the upbuilding of the congregation and those persons of goodwill who are studying with Jehovah’s witnesses. The congregation appreciates the valuable efforts of these mature speakers “who work hard in speaking and teaching.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962762/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">1 Tim. 5:17</a>) Your presence at the <span id="page629" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="629" data-before-text="629"></span>one-hour public talk brings you the benefits of their many hours of careful Bible study—a precious bargain that is yours “without money and without price.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962762/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Isa. 55:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"><strong>“Watchtower” Study.</strong> The Sunday public talk is generally followed by the most important congregation meeting, the <em>Watchtower</em> study. This is a question-and-answer discussion resembling the congregation book study except that the material is found in the <em>Watchtower</em> magazine and the entire congregation meets in one place. The discussion differs from the book study in that the <em>Watchtower</em> study material usually is more personal. It deals with the application of Bible prophecies and Christian principles to your daily living and warns against the pitfalls of unchristian conduct. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962762/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Rom. 12:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962762/36/1" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 13:5</a>) Through the columns of <em>The Watchtower</em> comes increased light on God’s Word as Jehovah makes this known. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962762/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Prov. 4:18</a>) Some of the recent lessons were entitled: “Why Be Baptized?” “Children, Do You Obey Jehovah?” “Christian Conduct in a Divided Household,” “Be Courageous and Strong Through Faith,” “Respect for the Sanctity of Blood,” “Avoid the Pitfalls,” “Watch Your Associations in the Time of the End,” “Manifesting Christian Manners,” “Training Your Perceptive Powers,” “Patience and Endurance.” Because of the vital nature of these discussions the <em>Watchtower</em> study is a most important meeting for all of Jehovah’s witnesses and persons of goodwill. It enables all to be fitly united in the same line of thought. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962762/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">1 Cor. 1:10</a>) Come prepared to participate and you will find the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962762/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:23</a> true: “A man has rejoicing in the answer of his mouth, and a word at its right time is O how good!”</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong>CONVENTIONS OF JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES</strong></p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">The coming together of large numbers of Jehovah’s people has long been a feature of true worship.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962762/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Acts 2</a>) So today, conventions of Jehovah’s people afford an opportunity to give a witness to God’s kingdom in an impressive way. The very fact that so many Christian persons have come together makes people ask questions, as they did at Pentecost. Then, too, the effect of God’s holy spirit is seen on the congregated throngs who come from distant places and different lands and yet manifest Christian love and unity, free from the world’s prejudice and discord. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962762/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Ps. 133:1</a>) Further, the love that motivates these Witnesses to contribute their time and labor to serve their Christian brothers by operating the various assembly departments is a source of amazement to the world, resulting in an effective witness. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962762/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">John 13:34, 35</a>) Twice a year congregations tied together as a “circuit” meet for a three-day circuit assembly. In addition to special talks and demonstrations an opportunity is presented for those who have recently made a dedication to symbolize it by public baptism. At intervals many circuits come together for a district assembly. There are also national and international conventions. All these Christian conventions provide a fine witness to God’s kingdom and afford occasion for Jehovah’s ministers to “keep comforting one another and building one another up.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962762/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:11</a>.</p>

The spirit of the psalmist David surges through our very being and makes us cry out: “O magnify Jehovah with me, and let us exalt his name together.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960924/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Ps. 34:3</a>) Yes, together let us magnify him and exalt his worthy name, because he has broken the enemy’s hold and has collected us together and has set us as his witnesses together in unity, as his flock in his pen of security under Christ.

Do we want to be happy? We can be. How? There are twenty-four happinesses or beatitudes in the Psalms that tell us the secret of how to be happy with the happiness that will never end. It is instructive for us to hear some of these beatitudes! The very book of Psalms opens with a beatitude, “Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked ones, and in the way of sinners has not stood and in the seat of ridiculers has not sat. But his delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1, 2</a>) The beatitude in the Second Psalm is one that not only world rulers but all of us under the shadow of Armageddon ought to heed: “Serve Jehovah with fear and be joyful with trembling. Kiss the son, that He may not become incensed and you may not perish [from] the way, for his anger flares up easily.

In the same way the fragrance of the New World society’s unity makes us pleasantly conscious of an atmosphere of love such as no organization of this world exhales.

The dew thus falling was a saving factor for the vegetation of the Promised Land during the hot, rainless season from May to September. How so? Recently it has been discovered<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1954686/0">a</a> that when plants wilted from the dry heat they recovered from wilting more rapidly when dew formed on their leaves at night than when the ground was watered, and that so much dew was taken up that the plants functioned normally during the next day without any watering of the ground. It had not been suspected how large an amount of water was absorbed from dew and later excreted through the roots into the soil and stored there without loss by evaporation. The amount of water thus put into underground storage by the plant was found to be measured in milliliters even in the case of small plants and occasionally to equal the entire weight of the plant itself. Doubtless this was the way most of the vegetation of the earth was watered from the third creative day down till the flood of Noah’s day, when God had not yet made it rain upon the earth but a vapor went up continually from the earth and it watered the entire surface of the ground.

When such oil was poured on Aaron’s head, it flowed down his beard and ran to the collar of his garment. For the Israelites, being together had a good influence that worked its way through the assembled people as a whole. Misunderstandings were cleared up, and unity was promoted. Similar unity exists in Jehovah’s global family today. Regularly associating has a wholesome spiritual effect on its members. Any misunderstandings or difficulties are removed as the counsel of God’s Word is applied.

<strong>The Blessing of Brotherly Unity</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">David wrote under inspiration about the blessing of brotherly unity. Since all the Israelites were descendants of the one man Jacob, David’s words at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980328/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 133</a> really applied to the whole nation. Today devoted Christians are members of a worldwide brotherhood and so should strive to maintain the delightful unity described by the psalmist. “Look! How good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity! It is like the good oil upon the head, that is running down upon the beard, Aaron’s beard, that is running down to the collar of his garments. It is like the dew of Hermon that is descending upon the mountains of Zion. For there Jehovah commanded the blessing to be, even life to time indefinite.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980328/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 133:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When all the tribes of Israel would come to Jerusalem for the three annual festivals, they had the opportunity to dwell together in unity. Though coming from various tribes, they were but one family of brothers. Their being together had a pleasing and wholesome influence. The effect of this dwelling together in unity was like good anointing oil​—a refreshing substance with a lingering and pleasing aroma. The oil poured upon Aaron’s head flowed down his long beard and ran down to the collar of his garment. Likewise, the wholesome effect of the Israelites’ being together had a permeating influence, working its way through the assembled people. This resulted in clearing up misunderstandings and in removing prejudices. It was as if the good oil had pervaded everything. The credit for this, of course, would go to Jehovah God from whom all blessings flow.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Similarly, when such brotherly unity as the psalmist describes exists among Christians, there is no quarreling, faultfinding or constant complaining. But their associating together is good, wholesome and beneficial. United in the bond of love, they are actively concerned about one another and enjoy being together. Their unity brings them delight or pleasure because of the mutual <span id="page29" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>encouragement and upbuilding that results. Any misunderstandings or difficulties can be removed as all unitedly approach Jehovah God in humility, desiring his guidance, help and forgiveness for their transgressions.</p>

He died in 1474 B.C.E. at the age of 123 years.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010004/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Num. 33:39</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The first mention of Aaron occurs at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010004/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Exodus 4:14-16</a>. Owing to Moses’ reluctance because he found it difficult to speak fluently, Jehovah assigned Aaron to act as Moses’ spokesman before Pharaoh, saying of Aaron: “I do know that he can really speak.” Aaron went to meet Moses at Mount Sinai and was informed of the far-reaching proportions of the divinely outlined program of action involving Israel and Egypt, and the brothers then journeyed back to Egypt.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010004/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex. 4:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010004/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 27-30</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Aaron now began serving as “a mouth” to Moses, speaking for him to the older men of Israel and performing miraculous signs as proof of the divine origin of their messages. Came the time for their appearance at Pharaoh’s court, and the eighty-three-year-old Aaron, as Moses’ spokesman, had to face up to that arrogant ruler. As Jehovah thereafter told Moses: “See, I have made you God to Pharaoh, and Aaron your own brother will become your prophet.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010004/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ex. 7:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010004/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 7</a>) It was Aaron who performed the first miraculous sign before Pharaoh and his magic-practicing priests; and, later, it was Aaron who, at Moses’ order, stretched forth Moses’ rod and signaled the start of the ten plagues. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010004/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ex. 7:9-12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010004/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 19, 20</a>) He continued to work in united coordination with Moses and in obedience to God during the succeeding plagues, until liberation finally came. In this he was a good example for Christians who serve as “ambassadors substituting for Christ, as though God were making entreaty through us.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010004/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ex. 7:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010004/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 5:20</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Aaron’s activity as spokesman for Moses evidently diminished during the forty years of the exodus travels, since Moses appears to have done more of the speaking himself.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010004/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ex. 24:9-15</a>) In the Law covenant Aaron and his house received honorable mention, and God designated Aaron for the position of high priest.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010004/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ex. 28:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>HIGH PRIEST</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">By a seven-day installation ceremony Aaron was invested with his sacred duties by Moses as God’s agent, and his four sons were also installed as underpriests. Moses dressed Aaron in beautiful garments of gold, blue, purple and scarlet materials, including shoulder pieces and a breastpiece that were encrusted with precious gems of varied colors. On his head was placed a turban of fine linen with a plate of pure gold on it engraved with the words “Holiness belongs to Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010004/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Lev. 8:7-9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010004/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Ex. chap. 28</a>) Aaron was then anointed in the manner described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010004/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 133:2</a>, and could thereafter be called the <em>Ma·shiʹahh</em> or Messiah (LXX, <em>khri·stosʹ</em>), that is, the “anointed one.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010004/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Lev. 4:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010004/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010004/15/2" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 6:22</a>) He was not only placed over all the priesthood but was also divinely declared to be the one from whose line or house all future high priests must come. Yet Aaron himself had not received the priesthood by inheritance, and so the apostle Paul could say of him: “A man takes this honor, not of his own accord, but only when he is called by God, just as Aaron also was. So too the Christ did not glorify himself by becoming a high priest, but was glorified by him who spoke with reference to him: ‘You are my son; I, today, I have become your father.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010004/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Heb. 5:4, 5</a>) Paul thereafter demonstrates the way in which the priestly office, first filled by Aaron, was typical of that which Christ Jesus fills as a superior and heavenly high priest. This being so, the priestly functions of Aaron’s high office take on added meaning for us.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010004/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Heb. 8:1-6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010004/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 9:6-14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010004/17/2" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 23-28</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">As high priest, Aaron was responsible for directing all features of worship at the tabernacle and supervising the work of the thousands of Levites engaged in its service.

It was led by a Levite named Korah, together with Dathan and Abiram and On of the tribe of Reuben, who complained against their leadership. Jehovah caused the earth to open beneath the tents of the rebels and their households, swallowing them up, while Korah and 250 of his coconspirators were destroyed by fire.

Thereafter, the right of Aaron’s house to the priesthood was never seriously challenged. The budded rod of Aaron was placed in the ark of the covenant as a “sign to the sons of rebelliousness,” though it appears that after the death of these rebellious ones and the entry of the nation into the Land of Promise the rod was removed, having served its purpose.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010004/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Num. 17:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010004/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> Heb. 9:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010004/28/2" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> 2 Chron. 5:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010004/28/3" data-bid="29-4" class="b"> 1 Ki. 8:9</a>.</p>

In the same way the fragrance of the New World society’s unity makes us pleasantly conscious of an atmosphere of love such as no organization of this world exhales.

The dew thus falling was a saving factor for the vegetation of the Promised Land during the hot, rainless season from May to September. How so? Recently it has been discovered<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1954686/0">a</a> that when plants wilted from the dry heat they recovered from wilting more rapidly when dew formed on their leaves at night than when the ground was watered, and that so much dew was taken up that the plants functioned normally during the next day without any watering of the ground. It had not been suspected how large an amount of water was absorbed from dew and later excreted through the roots into the soil and stored there without loss by evaporation. The amount of water thus put into underground storage by the plant was found to be measured in milliliters even in the case of small plants and occasionally to equal the entire weight of the plant itself. Doubtless this was the way most of the vegetation of the earth was watered from the third creative day down till the flood of Noah’s day, when God had not yet made it rain upon the earth but a vapor went up continually from the earth and it watered the entire surface of the ground.

<strong>The Prayer of Faith During Sickness</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[26]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> The context makes it clear that James is here talking, not of physical, but of spiritual sickness. He first mentions suffering evil. That refers to “suffering evil for the good news according to the power of God”. It means enduring some hardships for serving as a Christian witness of God and keeping one’s integrity toward God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951322/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Tim. 1:8</a>, <em>NW</em>) So, if one is suffering thus, let him carry on prayer so as to be helped to continue faithful, advises James. But, James, what if anyone is in good spirits? “Let him sing psalms.” Doing so, he edifies himself and those hearing him. But what if anyone is not in good spirits? In other words, what if one is sick spiritually? The fact that James contrasts being sick with being in good spirits plainly indicates he is dealing with spiritual and not physical sickness. The course of treatment he now recommends also argues it is spiritual sickness. The older men of the congregation, who are full-grown in the faith and <span id="page269" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="269" data-before-text="269"></span>full of wisdom from above and acquainted with God’s instructions, are the proper ones for the spiritually sick one to call in. If he were ailing physically, he would call in a doctor, if he could afford it, or would resort to some medicinal remedy.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="qu"> 3. Why were the older brothers to pray over the sick?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[27]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> What are the older men of the congregation to do with the one sick spiritually? They are to pray over him, so that he can hear what they pray and can show he agrees, with his “Amen!” He has fallen into such a spiritual state that he cannot properly pray on his own accord any more. Not able to ask in faith and with an unwavering mind, he has no confidence in his own prayer. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951322/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jas. 1:6, 7</a>) Something has brought on this spiritual illness. The older men must ascertain what this is. Paul, too, refers to this kind of sickness and tells one cause, the improper celebration of the Lord’s evening meal or Memorial supper. “For he that eats and drinks eats and drinks judgment against himself if he does not discern the body. That is why many among you are weak and sickly and quite a few are sleeping in death. But if we would discern what we ourselves are, we would not be judged.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951322/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:29-31</a>, <em>NW</em>) Those in this condition were not keeping unity with the Christian congregation, the body of Christ. So Paul as an older brother wrote them for their help and spiritual cure.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="qu"> 4. In what way is it that they rub the sick with oil?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[28]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> The older men of the congregation are not merely to pray with the spiritually sick. They must also rub him with oil in the name of Jehovah. Not literal oil, like the so-called “extreme unction” of Catholics, or like that described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951322/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Mark 6:13</a>. The “oil” here is the soothing word of instruction from the Holy Scriptures and it restores the spiritually sick one to unity with the Christian congregation which is in God’s favor. As it is written: “Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! It is like the precious oil upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron’s beard; that came down upon the skirt of his garments.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951322/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 133:1, 2</a>, <em>AS</em>) Speaking of oil to symbolize refreshment and soothing, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951322/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 23:5</a> (<em>Mo</em>) says: “Thou hast poured oil upon my head, my cup is brimming over.” The healthful effect of God’s message is described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951322/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:30</a> in this way: “Good tidings make the bones fat.” (<em>AS</em>) And the correction which leads to spiritual health is described as soothing and curative by the psalmist when he says: “Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness; and let him reprove me, it shall be as oil upon the head; let not my head refuse it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951322/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 141:5</a>, <em>AS</em>) And that it denotes a means of healing is shown when the good Samaritan poured oil along with wine into the wounds of the man waylaid by robbers. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951322/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 10:34</a>) So the older men of the congregation are to rub the spiritually sick one with oil in the sense of stimulating him with the soothing, healing, comforting, corrective Word of God.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="qu"> 5. How do they do this “in the name of Jehovah”? And with what effect?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> In the name of Jehovah they are to do this. That is to say, in faithfulness to Jehovah God and according to his purpose, so as to aid the spiritually ill one to recover and have a part anew in vindicating God’s name and proving the Devil a false god and liar. Those older men must <span id="page270" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="270" data-before-text="270"></span>pray in faith, believing that God’s Word is right and has power to help the sick one to see the error of his way and to recognize the right way. Such a united prayer of faith, together with the invigorating application of God’s Word, will make the spiritually indisposed person well. It will build up his confidence in God’s promise and in the rightness of God’s Word and way, and will restore him to that way. Thus “Jehovah will raise him up”, giving him strength to go in the way of truth and righteousness, and lifting him up out of his despondency and a feeling of being abandoned by God. His spiritual illness may have been due to getting into the bad habit of neglecting to meet with God’s people or due to failing to feed regularly on God’s Word and active service. Or he may have committed some serious sins for which he has been put out of favorable relationship with God and his organization. But now if he responds to the prayer offered unitedly by older men of faith and to their healthful stimulation of reproof, correction and exhortation from God’s Word, and turns around and resumes the right way, what sins he has committed will then be forgiven him. This forgiveness is not on the basis of any self-righteousness in him, but is on the basis of Jesus’ righteous sacrifice for sins.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951322/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 John 1:7 to 2:2</a>.</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998608/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 27:28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998608/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Deuteronomy 33:13,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998608/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998608/1/3" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> Zechariah 8:12</a>) During Israel’s hot, rainless season, “the dew of Hermon” preserved the land’s vegetation, and therefore its people. Mount Hermon’s forested and snowy heights still produce night vapors that condense to form abundant dew. The psalmist David compared the refreshment brought by this dew to the pleasant experience of dwelling in unity with fellow worshipers of Jehovah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998608/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 133:3</a>.</p>

<strong>Jehovah’s Family Enjoys Precious Unity</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> The psalmist David deeply appreciated brotherly unity. He was even inspired to sing about it! Imagine him with his harp as he sang: “Look! How good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity! It is like the good oil upon the head, that is running down upon the beard, Aaron’s beard, that is running down to the collar of his garments. It is like the dew of Hermon that is descending upon the mountains of Zion.

<strong>The Blessing of Brotherly Unity</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">David wrote under inspiration about the blessing of brotherly unity. Since all the Israelites were descendants of the one man Jacob, David’s words at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980328/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 133</a> really applied to the whole nation. Today devoted Christians are members of a worldwide brotherhood and so should strive to maintain the delightful unity described by the psalmist. “Look! How good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity! It is like the good oil upon the head, that is running down upon the beard, Aaron’s beard, that is running down to the collar of his garments. It is like the dew of Hermon that is descending upon the mountains of Zion. For there Jehovah commanded the blessing to be, even life to time indefinite.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980328/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 133:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When all the tribes of Israel would come to Jerusalem for the three annual festivals, they had the opportunity to dwell together in unity. Though coming from various tribes, they were but one family of brothers. Their being together had a pleasing and wholesome influence. The effect of this dwelling together in unity was like good anointing oil​—a refreshing substance with a lingering and pleasing aroma. The oil poured upon Aaron’s head flowed down his long beard and ran down to the collar of his garment. Likewise, the wholesome effect of the Israelites’ being together had a permeating influence, working its way through the assembled people. This resulted in clearing up misunderstandings and in removing prejudices. It was as if the good oil had pervaded everything. The credit for this, of course, would go to Jehovah God from whom all blessings flow.</p>

<strong>Hermon</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Hermon has been identified with the highest mountain in the vicinity of Palestine, called Jebel el-Sheikh (“gray-haired mountain”) or Jebel el-Thalj (“mountain of the snow”) by the Arabs. These names evidently derive from the circumstance that Mount Hermon is snowcapped nearly the year around. Its snowy top might be said to resemble an old man’s crown of <span id="page755" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="755" data-before-text="755"></span>white hair. In ancient times, this mountain was known to the Sidonians as “Sirion” and to the Amorites as “Senir.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011949/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deut. 3:8, 9</a>) The latter name also seems to have been used to denote a part of the Hermon range. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011949/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Chron. 5:23</a>) “Sion” (not Zion) was still another name applied to this mountain. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011949/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Deut. 4:47, 48</a>) The psalmist mentioned Hermon along with Tabor as crying out joyfully in Jehovah’s name.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011949/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 89:12</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Forming the S end of the Anti—Lebanon range and separated from the latter by a deep depression, Mount Hermon rises over 9,000 feet (c. 2,743 meters) above sea level and extends almost twenty miles (32 kilometers) from N to S. Its several peaks are connected by a plateau. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011949/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 42:6</a>) Mount Hermon is composed of limestone, although having outcroppings of basalt on the eastern and western sides. Its upper portion is completely bare with the exception of low shrubs in places. But lower down there are firs, fruit trees, tragacanths and shrubs. Vineyards occupy the lower slopes of the western and southern sides.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">On a clear day, the top of Hermon affords a splendid view of much of Palestine. To the W can be seen the mountains of Lebanon, the plain of Tyre and the Mediterranean Sea; to the SW, Mount Carmel; to the S, the Jordan valley with the Huleh Basin and the Sea of Galilee, and to the E, the plain of Damascus.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Mount Hermon’s snowy head serves to condense the night vapors, thus producing abundant dew. “More copious dew,” observed the nineteenth-century naturalist H. B. Tristram, “we never experienced than that on Hermon. Everything was drenched with it, and the tents were small protection.” The refreshing dew of Hermon preserves vegetation during the long rainless season. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011949/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 133:3</a>; see DEW.) The melting snows of Mount Hermon are the main source of the river Jordan.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Anciently, Mount Hermon was a haunt for wild animals, such as lions and leopards. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011949/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Song of Sol. 4:8</a>) In recent times, foxes, wolves, leopards and Syrian bears have been reported there.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Mount Hermon became the northern limit of the Promised Land.

<strong>Courageous Ministers District Assemblies</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">And again, early Sunday morning, many sat on the edge of their seats as they listened intently to the series entitled: “‘The Word’ <span id="page606" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="606" data-before-text="606"></span>—Who Is He? According to John.” Copious notes were taken as speakers whittled away pet trinitarian arguments until the doctrine of the Trinity was exposed beyond denial to be what it is—false! When the chairman announced that this absorbing subject could be had in a sixty-four-page booklet, a burst of applause resounded and crowds rushed toward the attendants to get their copies.

<strong>Finding Joy for Everlasting Life</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> The typical Jerusalem of ancient Palestine has long since ceased to be “the exultation <span id="page102" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="102" data-before-text="102"></span>of the whole earth,” and certainly Jehovah finds no joy in the strife-torn Jerusalem of modern Jordan, which banned the activity of His witnesses. However, Jehovah finds joy without measure in the “New Jerusalem,” his administrative “new heavens” of a peaceful new world, through which he gathers “all things together again . . . , the things in the heavens and the things on the earth” under “the kingdom of the Son of his love.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961121/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eph. 1:7-10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961121/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Col. 1:13</a>) Under this kingdom of the heavens Jehovah has now planted a “new earth” organization, the New World society of his witnesses, embracing lovers of righteousness “out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961121/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rev. 7:9</a>) Since A.D. 1914 in the heavens and A.D. 1919 on earth, this glorious creation of God has been a source of joy and refreshment to all who reside within its boundaries.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 4.

Do these not point the finger of scorn at Jehovah’s witnesses, and say, <em>“You</em> are a new religion”? It should now be of interest to examine their claims in the light of history and of Bible truth. At the outset one thing is clear: The original religion cannot be a sectarian religion. It cannot be a religion of one family, one community, one tribe or even one nation. A man of God rightly stated a fundamental truth 1,900 years ago, when he said: “For a certainty I perceive that God is not partial, but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable <span id="page103" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="103" data-before-text="103"></span>to him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961121/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 10:34, 35</a>) To appreciate the original religion, man must lift himself out of his local environment, strip himself of the proud traditions that divide mankind and seek the one God and Father who “made out of one man every nation of men, to dwell upon the entire surface of the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961121/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 17:26, 27</a>) With such a broadened outlook, examine now the world’s religious systems.</p>

<strong>True Love Is Practical</strong><br/><p id="p41" data-pid="41" data-rel-pid="[80]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="35"><sup>35</sup></span> Let the perfect bond of union grow strong within the New World society. “Clothe yourselves with the tender affections of compassion, kindness, lowliness of mind, mildness, and long-suffering. Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely if anyone has a cause for complaint against another. Even as Jehovah freely forgave you, so do you also. But, besides all these things, clothe yourselves with love, for it is a perfect bond of union.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954686/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Col. 3:12-14</a>, <em>NW</em>) If it is a bond of union it must draw and hold us together, not separate us, not scatter us. Now in the antitypical ark of the new system of things that will ride out the Armageddon seas into the new world we must draw together, not avoid one another. Difficulties should not be of long continuance between brothers but should be ironed out at the earliest in the interest of everyone’s being of the same mind in the Lord. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954686/60/0" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Phil. 2:1-4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954686/60/1" data-bid="61-2" class="b"> 4:2</a>) God’s creation hangs together through power from him, like the “attractions of Kesil.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954686/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Job 38:31</a>, <em>Yg</em>) The new world of righteousness will also hang together. It is just ahead, so that a great crowd of this present generation may survive in the “ark” to enter into it from its start. What, then? Why, we must live together now, before the new world. Armageddon will not miraculously change our disposition toward our brothers, suddenly making us amiable. We must change it now. True, Armageddon can blot out dispositions, but the dispositions it blots out will be of those it destroys. One thing is <span id="page573" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="573" data-before-text="573"></span>certain: True love will survive Armageddon and so will those who practice it.</p><p id="p81" data-pid="81" class="qu">36.

It was a fragrance that no other ointment had, for God did not let anyone else make an anointing oil of its composition. In the same way the fragrance of the New World society’s unity makes us pleasantly conscious of an atmosphere of love such as no organization of this world exhales. We enjoy being in that atmosphere; it is good for us. It comes from God through his great High Priest Jesus Christ. It is the breath of His spirit.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954686/67/0" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Ex. 30:22-33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954686/67/1" data-bid="68-2" class="b"> Acts 10:38</a>.</p><p id="p83" data-pid="83" class="qu">38.

Hermon’s perpetually snow-streaked top caused the night vapors to condense upon Zion’s mountains far to the south, where Jehovah had placed his name. The dew thus falling was a saving factor for the vegetation of the Promised Land during the hot, rainless season from May to September. How so? Recently it has been discovered<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1954686/0">a</a> that when plants wilted from the dry heat they recovered from wilting more rapidly when dew formed on their leaves at night than when the ground was watered, and that so much dew was taken up that the plants functioned normally during the next day without any watering of the ground. It had not been suspected how large an amount of water was absorbed from dew and later excreted through the roots into the soil and stored there without loss by evaporation. The amount of water thus put into underground storage by the plant was found to be measured in milliliters even in the case of small plants and occasionally to equal the entire weight of the plant itself. Doubtless this was the way most of the vegetation of the earth was watered from the third creative day down till the flood of Noah’s day, when God had not yet made it rain upon the earth but a vapor went up continually from the earth and it watered the entire surface of the ground.

<strong>The 1,290 and 1,335 Days of Daniel’s Prophecy</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="si"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"></span>“The prophet indicates that many other peoples must yet hear, and that hearing they shall rejoice. Figuratively speaking, those thus hearing bear up in their arms and upon their shoulders these children who have been brought to a knowledge of God’s provision for giving them life. They thereby express their joy and approval. When a people are happy they find no better way to express it toward another than to carry upon their shoulders or in their arms the one who is favored. Great numbers of the people are providing themselves <span id="page437" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="437" data-before-text="437"></span>today with the books which teach God’s plan. Even greater numbers are hearing the message by radio. These are telling others about it. Many of these have become friends of those who love the Lord and his message; and while they give no evidence of being spirit begotten yet they rejoice in the truth and in its message of life and express this joy in their own way, illustrated by bearing children up in their arms and on their shoulders.”—<em>The Watchtower,</em> August 15, 1926.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">14. Why was it no longer a question of how long the Lord’s servants would have to continue on earth performing His service?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> No longer was it a question with the faithful anointed ones as to how long they would have to work on earth before entering heavenly glory. But rather, here present with us is Kingdom service, just as though the Kingdom had come down from heaven to the people of God, and they were living in it. No longer were they concerned, whether it meant remaining on earth one or many years, for they were so very happy. “Like the dew of Hermon, that cometh down upon the mountains of Zion: for there Jehovah commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ps. 133:3</a>, <em>AS</em>) Assurance and confidence became their blessed portion. “And a Redeemer will come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith Jehovah. And as for me, this is my covenant with them, saith Jehovah: my spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed’s seed, saith Jehovah, from henceforth and for ever.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Isa. 59:20, 21</a>, <em>AS</em>) “No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of Jehovah, and their righteousness which is of me, saith Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Isa. 54:17</a>, <em>AS</em>) “Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Isa. 52:1</a>, <em>AS</em>) The desolate places were to be filled, the tents stretched out, the wilderness become a pool. All her children were to come home to Zion. Oh, what a joyful time was now in store for children of Jehovah, and that forevermore!</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu">15. Why is it “he that waiteth” who is blessed at the end of the 1,335 days?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> Let us now see how this fits in with Daniel’s prophecy. Think of all the happenings from 1914 on, and now this comforting word: “Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951525/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Dan. 12:12</a>, <em>AS</em>) The word “waiteth” is from the Hebrew word meaning “to adhere, stick fast or remain steadfast and fixed”. During the many years since 1914 there had been many shakings, great tests of faith and numerous trials. Blessed are those who remained, who were steadfast and fixed, and who came to the 1,335 days. They would then understand the purpose of all these things, and be filled with gratitude. When, then, did the 1,335 days begin and end? According to Biblical reckoning, at 30 days to a month, it is a period of three years, eight and one-half months.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">16. What finally marks 1926 as the fulfillment of the 1,335-day period when the Lord’s servants enter into signal blessedness?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Keep in mind that the 1,290 days ended by seeing the “continual sacrifice” restored, and being assured that the sacrifice of offering praise would then continue though there would be many persecutions. On the service goes now, and blessed is the one who comes to the 1,335 days. So reckoning this period on from the termination of the 1,290 days would mean from September, 1922, to May, 1926,—three years, eight and one-half months—at which time a large international convention of Jehovah’s <span id="page438" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="438" data-before-text="438"></span>people was in session at London, England. It was a season most blessed, for there had been a great cleansing work done in God’s spiritual city, Zion. Many ecclesiastical and false religious ideas were disposed of, a great blow was being delivered against the great “abomination” of the League of Nations, and it was known now that God’s people were on the earth for the purpose of singing praises to Jehovah God, to really and truly be a people for his name. They knew why they were alive, what they were doing, and where they were going. The great joy of being in this condition was a daily source of comfort. Oh, the blessedness of those who came to the 1,335 days! We are now living in a day when these blessings are realized. It is not feasible or reasonable to compare the joys and favors of today with those blessed experiences in 1926, in order to get a proper and correct view of the application of this prophecy, but rather to compare, if one must, the great and wonderful position Jehovah’s people were in during 1926 with their condition in 1914 and 1918. Then the blessedness will be understood.</p>
