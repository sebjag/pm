He found “great delight” in the company of those who loved Jehovah. Described as “holy ones,” they were morally clean, upright. Another psalmist felt the same way about his choice of friends. He wrote: “I am a friend of all who fear you and of those who keep your orders.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018688/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 119:63</a>) As we saw in the preceding article, you too can find many good friends among those who fear and obey Jehovah. That includes, of course, those of various ages.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>12.</strong><strong> What was the basis for the friendship between David and Jonathan?</strong></p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> The psalmist David did not limit his circle of friends to just his peers. Can you recall the name of a “majestic” one who became his dear friend? His name was Jonathan. In fact, their friendship was one of the most beautiful recorded in the Scriptures. Did you know, however, that Jonathan was about 30 years older than David? What, then, was the basis for their friendship? Faith in God, mutual respect, and seeing each other’s courage as they fought God’s enemies.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018688/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Sam. 13:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018688/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 14:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018688/21/2" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> 17:48-50;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018688/21/3" data-bid="22-4" class="b"> 18:1</a>.</p>

Kiera, who has served God for years, says, “I’ve made friends with people from around the world, people of many different backgrounds and cultures.” When you broaden out in this way, you will see clear evidence of the uniting power of God’s Word and spirit.</p>

<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"><strong>17, 18.</strong><strong> (a) What did David observe about the consequences of false worship?

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018688/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Hos. 4:13, 14</a>) To be sure, that form of worship appealed to the sinful flesh. But it did not bring lasting happiness. To the contrary! ‘Those who pursued other gods multiplied their sorrows,’ said David. They also brought untold suffering to countless children. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018688/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Isa. 57:5</a>) Jehovah detested such cruelty!

But the end results of reveling in so-called moral freedom have not really changed since Bible times.

So young ones, listen to your heavenly Father. Be fully convinced that obedience to him is in your best interests. Impress on your heart that the harm caused by wrongdoing far outweighs any temporary pleasure. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018688/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Gal. 6:8</a>) Joshua, quoted earlier, said, “We can use our freedom any way we want, but misusing it isn’t satisfying.”</p>

<strong>Is the World Bloodguilty Before God?</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Not having learned the lesson not to trust in worldly sources for plans, schemes and propaganda, the world went on heedless <span id="page552" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="552" data-before-text="552"></span>of these warnings from Jehovah’s witnesses. Under German Nazism and Roman Fascism the blood of thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses was poured out as martyrs in the heart of Christendom. Then World War II came on with the greatest destruction of human life to date. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966681/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Rev. 12:13-16</a>) Because so many were wounded, blood transfusions increased.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">To clarify thoroughly what is God’s will on use of blood, Jehovah’s witnesses made a special Scriptural study, the results of which appeared in the July 1, 1945, issue of <em>The Watchtower Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom.</em> The leading article of this issue discussed <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966681/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 16</a>. On pages 198-201 it discussed the attitude of King David toward taking the blood of others into his human system when he said, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966681/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Psalm 16:4</a> (<em>AV</em>): “Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.” This article quoted page 113 of Volume 4 of <em>The Encyclopedia Americana</em> (1929 edition), which said:</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="si">Transfusion of blood dates as far back as the time of the ancient Egyptians. The earliest reported case is that practiced on Pope Innocent VIII in 1492. The operation cost the lives of three youths and the Pontiff’s life was not saved.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Disregarding what was clearly God’s law, medical men used transfusions on a mass scale during the Korean War, and now in Vietnam, and blood is used in some foods and other products. In fact, blood, which contains the life of the creature and which belongs to God, has been misused by men as though the life belonged to them. The religions of Christendom and Jewry completely reject what Jehovah’s witnesses clearly show is God’s viewpoint on blood. They make all kinds of excuses nullifying God’s law, to give a clean appearance to those who violate it. Until now the controversy rages, many of Jehovah’s witnesses suffering great persecution because they refuse to take blood in any form. They are often denied medical and surgical help. In some cases, through court orders, transfusions have been forced on them. Jehovah takes notice of all these atrocities committed against his people.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Jehovah’s witnesses are concerned primarily with what God’s law is on blood, not the medical aspect. However, it is true that a great spread of diseases, such as hepatitis, syphilis and malaria, and many deaths have resulted from the practice of transfusions—evidence of the practical wisdom of God’s law. To help reasonable persons to give full consideration to this vital subject, Jehovah’s witnesses circulate a 64-page booklet entitled “Blood, Medicine and the Law of God,” which was released on June 22, 1961, at the international assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in Yankee Stadium, New York city. It provides a well-documented treatment of the subject, highlighting what God’s Word says about it. If you want to avoid being bloodguilty with the world and becoming as the worldly ones are, “drunk with their own blood,” you will listen to the Source of the true waters of life and get away from the plague that is on all those drinking from the bloody, worldly fountains and rivers.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966681/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Isa. 49:26</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">For a discussion of the first and second plagues of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966681/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Revelation, chapter 16</a>, see the two preceding issues of this magazine.

<strong>“Gaze Upon the Pleasantness of Jehovah”</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">“Jehovah is my portion, my allotted share, and my cup,” sang David. “You safeguard my inheritance. Pleasant places have been measured out to me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2014128/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 16:5, 6</a>) David was thankful for his “portion,” that is, for having an approved relationship with Jehovah and the privilege of serving him. Like David, we may suffer hardships, but we have so many spiritual blessings! Let us therefore continue to take delight in true worship and always “look with appreciation” upon Jehovah’s spiritual temple.</p>

<strong>Our Spiritual Health and the Kidneys</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> For eternal salvation we must grow to Christian maturity, adulthood.

<strong>Meal</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The general Hebrew custom in the first century C.E. was for persons to wash their hands before eating a meal. This was a ritualistic practice among the <span id="page1126" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1126" data-before-text="1126"></span>scribes and Pharisees.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012877/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Mark 7:1-8</a>; see WASHING OF HANDS.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">At banquets or large feasts in the time of Jesus’ earthly ministry, couches of different heights were placed around three sides of a table. This left the fourth side free so that those serving the food could gain access to the table. The Roman arrangement of table and couches was such that the highest couch was to the right hand of those serving the meal as they approached the table. A somewhat lower couch was straight ahead of them and the lowest couch was to their left.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">At times four or five persons occupied one couch, but usually the number was three. Those partaking of the meal usually rested on the left elbow, probably on a cushion, with their heads toward the table. Food was normally taken with the right hand. The place of highest importance on a couch was that occupied by the person having no one behind him. To be in the “bosom position” in relation to someone else reclining at a meal meant being in front of him and would also signify having his favor. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012877/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">John 13:23</a>) The individual having a person in the bosom position could easily carry on a confidential conversation with him.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The customary three positions on each couch indicated that a person had the high, middle or low position on the couch. One having the low position on the third or lowest couch had the lowest position at the meal.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012877/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 23:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012877/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Luke 14:7-11</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">At least on certain festive occasions a large meal or banquet might be under the supervision of a director (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012877/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">John 2:9</a>) and could feature such entertainment as “a music concert and dancing.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012877/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Luke 15:25</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>PROPER VIEW OF MEALS</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">It is God’s will for man to enjoy food and drink.

Since partaking of meals in moderation can be most delightful, the condition of one who is joyful at heart is comparable to a continuous feast.

Because it had settled so deeply within, the “advice” was identified with the “kidneys,” and thus it could be said that the kidneys corrected David.</p>

God’s Word can mold us as we read it purposefully, meditate on it, and ask Jehovah to help us apply it. “I remember you while upon my bed,” wrote David. “I meditate on you during the watches of the night.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2016442/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ps. 63:6</a>) He also wrote: “I will praise Jehovah, who has given me advice.

How does Jehovah refine what we are on the inside? David sang: “I shall bless Jehovah, who has given me advice.

It means that divine counsel reached the deepest parts of David’s being and settled there, correcting his innermost thoughts and emotions. So it can be with us if we appreciatively reflect on the counsel that we receive through God’s Word, his representatives, and his organization and allow it to settle deep within us. Regularly praying to Jehovah to refine us in this way will help us walk in integrity.</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984641/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 16:7</a>) Surely our literal kidneys cannot correct us. To what was he referring?

It reads: “You have planted them; they have also taken root. They keep going ahead; they have also produced fruit. You are near in their mouth, but far away from their kidneys.” Does not “kidneys” here indicate the person’s deepest emotions?

I have placed Jehovah in front of me constantly. Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be made to totter.” How, in fact, did David’s kidneys correct him during the nights when he would be awake? Well, if David had had any misgivings as to Jehovah’s attitude toward him, what sort of person he really was, his figurative kidneys would give him a correct assessment of Jehovah’s purpose toward him. That is why David went on to say: “For you will not leave my soul in Sheol. You will not allow your loyal one to see the pit.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984644/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 16:10</a>.</p>

<strong>Do You Value Your Privacy?</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">When you awaken in the small hours at night, what do you think about? Do you drift into a reverie?

It might be true that deep and persistent “soul-searching” will help us better to understand our views, tendencies, attitudes, feelings, ambitions, longings and the like. But if we rely on the Bible as our guide, it will teach us that much of what we find within ourselves needs to be corrected, even discarded, yes, replaced with the makings of a new self. It informs us that we are inwardly more like a vessel or receptacle​—receptive but to a great extent empty and barren. We can receive, absorb, digest and exercise knowledge and wisdom, and grow in discernment. But all such building materials <span id="page29" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>of the intellect must come from a source outside ourselves. “When wisdom <em>enters into</em> your heart and knowledge itself becomes pleasant to your very soul, thinking ability itself will keep guard over you, discernment itself will safeguard you,” says one inspired proverb. And another points to the one sure, safe Source of outside knowledge: “Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding. In all your ways take notice of him, and he himself will make your paths straight.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978129/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Prov. 2:10, 11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978129/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 3:5, 6</a>.</p>

Being situated very deep in the body, the kidneys could be spoken of as being in the innermost recesses of a person. In the case of David, the advice of Jehovah had become a part of his personality. That advice was embedded deep inside him, as it were in the kidneys. So, his kidneys, that is, the advice of Jehovah embedded inside David, could correct him during the wakeful hours of the night.​—Pp. 664, 665.</p>

<strong>Our Spiritual Health and the Kidneys</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> For eternal salvation we must grow to Christian maturity, adulthood. To that end we must feed upon God’s Word as a whole, not limiting ourselves to the primary or elementary Bible teachings. We must feed upon its advanced teachings, its counsels, admonitions, instructions for full-grown Christians. This will benefit us to the very depth of our Christian being. King David referred to such divine advices when he wrote: “The measuring lines themselves have fallen for me in pleasant places. Really, my own possession [within these measuring lines] has proved agreeable to me. I shall bless Jehovah, who has given me advice. Really, during the nights my kidneys have corrected me.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977805/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ps. 16:6, 7</a>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">15.

Of themselves the literal kidneys did not correct David. The “advice” given by God did this. But this divine “advice” had got away down into David’s being, into the innermost recesses of David’s being as a worshiper of Jehovah. Being taken in so far down within him, the “advice” was there to stay. Being embedded and rooted so deeply inside him, it was there to be part of David. It could not be eradicated, taken away from him by other humans.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">16.

During the nights when he had wakeful hours upon his bed, such correction could take place, for he was all alone with his thoughts and God’s spirit could stir up the “advice” that Jehovah had given him during the day. In this way David got a good look at himself, for just what he was.</p>

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page219" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="219" data-before-text="219"></span><strong>The Kidneys—Why Used Symbolically</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THROUGHOUT the Bible, even as in everyday usage, the various parts of the human body are used in a symbolic or figurative way. Among these are the hands, the shoulders and the heart. Such figurative use of words not only is expressive and adds force to speech but often is quite enlightening. In particular is the heart used in a figurative way both in the Bible and in everyday language.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">However, there are certain figurative expressions found in the Bible that have no counterpart in modern usage, at least not in English. Among these are the kidneys. In Biblical Hebrew the word for kidneys is <em>kelayoth.</em> Of the some thirty times it occurs in the Hebrew Scriptures about one-third of the times the reference is to kidneys in a figurative sense. Thus we read: “Examine me, O Jehovah, and put me to the test; refine my kidneys and my heart.” “Jehovah of armies is judging with righteousness; he is examining the kidneys and the heart.” “I, Jehovah, am searching the heart, examining the kidneys, even to give to each one according to his ways, according to the fruitage of his dealings.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 26:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Jer. 11:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 17:10</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Why do the Scripture writers use the kidneys in a symbolic sense? For more than one reason. In cutting up animals for sacrifice—the kidneys are repeatedly mentioned in the Levitical code of sacrifices—the Israelites could not help noting that they came upon the kidneys last; they were buried the deepest. The kidneys would therefore well stand for or represent the deepest part of man, his inmost or deepest thoughts and feelings. That is why we read at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jeremiah 12:2</a>: “They keep going ahead; they have also produced fruit. You are near in their mouth, but far away from their kidneys,” far away from the inmost thoughts and feelings of such wicked ones.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">No doubt the kidneys were associated with the deepest emotions also because these emotions affect the kidneys. Thus authorities on psychosomatic medicine tell us that sustained emotional strain can well cause such disturbances as <em>diabetes insipidous,</em> in which the kidneys fail to function properly. (This should not be confused with <em>diabetes mellitus</em> or “sugar” diabetes.)—<em>Emotions and Bodily Changes,</em> Dunbar.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Because of this we find that various Bible dictionaries and commentaries have the following to say about the symbolic use of “kidneys”: “The kidneys were considered the seat of affections and emotions and the most vital and sensitive part of man.” “The kidneys, from the sensitiveness of that part of the person, were believed to be the seat of longing and desire.” “The Orientals regarded the kidneys as the seat of the desires and affections, and hence under them spoke of the soul in respect to its inmost purposes or cravings.” “The most secret workings and affections of the heart.”</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In keeping with all the foregoing we note that in the <em>New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures,</em> First Edition, whenever “kidneys” is used with this symbolic or figurative sense there is a footnote reading, “deepest emotions.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 7:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 16:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 26:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/3" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> Prov. 23:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/4" data-bid="3-5" class="b"> Jer. 11:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/5" data-bid="3-6" class="b"> 12:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/6" data-bid="3-7" class="b"> 17:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/7" data-bid="3-8" class="b"> 20:12</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">As for the use of “kidneys” in the Christian Greek Scriptures, the Greek word for “kidneys,” <em>nephros,</em> is found only once, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 2:23</a>. There, in the <em>New World Translation</em> it is freely rendered “inmost thoughts.” “Her children I will kill with deadly plague, so that all the congregations will know that I am he who searches the <em>inmost thoughts</em> and hearts, and I will give to you individually according to your deeds.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The word “kidneys” when used figuratively in the Scriptures has but the one meaning, that of deepest or inmost emotions or thoughts. Many modern translators render the Hebrew and Greek words for “kidneys” as “heart.” However, strictly speaking, “kidneys” used in a symbolic sense goes deeper than does “heart” when applied to the emotions, feelings. Thus both Job and Jeremiah spoke of being wounded in the kidneys, meaning a very deep wound.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 16:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Lam. 3:13</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Whenever we ask Jehovah God, as did David, to examine our “kidneys” we mean for him to make a most searching examination, one that takes in the deepest emotions, thoughts, feelings. Being omniscient and omnipotent, Jehovah God has no difficulty at all in making such an examination. “All things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Heb. 4:13</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"></p>

You too will enjoy a truly satisfying life if you keep service to Jehovah to the fore and set goals with him in mind. A brother named Steven said, “Working toward a goal, accomplishing it, and then looking back on the improvements I have made brings me satisfaction.” A young brother from Germany who now serves in another land stated, “When I’m old, I don’t want to look back on my life and see that everything I did was just about me.” We hope that you feel the same way. If you do, use your gifts to honor God and to do things for others. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018688/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Gal. 6:10</a>) Set spiritual goals for yourself, and ask Jehovah in prayer to help you to reach them.

<strong>Keep Jehovah Before You Constantly</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> All of us can learn much from the experiences of well-known Bible characters​—Abraham, Sarah, Moses, Ruth, David, Esther, the apostle Paul, and others. However, accounts about less prominent individuals can also benefit us. Meditating on Bible narratives can help us to act in harmony with the psalmist’s words: “I have placed Jehovah in front of me constantly. Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be made to totter.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008121/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 16:8</a>) How are we to understand these words?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> A soldier usually wielded his sword with his right hand, leaving that side unprotected by the shield held in his left hand. Yet, he was protected if a friend fought near him on his right. If we keep Jehovah in mind and do his will, he will protect us. So let us see how considering Bible accounts can strengthen our faith so that we “keep Jehovah always before [us].”​—<em>Byington.</em></p>

We do so in at least two ways. One, we let his Word guide us in every aspect of life; and two, we look to the glorious prize Jehovah has set before us. The psalmist Asaph sang: “I am constantly with you; you have taken hold of my right hand. With your counsel you will lead me, and afterward you will take me even to glory.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006726/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Psalm 73:23, 24</a>) With such assurance, we can truly face the future with confidence.</p>

For David says respecting him, ‘I had Jehovah constantly before my eyes; because he is at my right hand that I may never be shaken.”’​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972642/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Acts 2:24, 25</a>.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"><sup>30</sup></span> We can do the same as did David and the Lord Jesus Christ! We can mentally put Jehovah in front of us. As Jesus did, so we too can keep Jehovah in front of us constantly by trying always to please him. Be positive; know your God. By your keeping him at your right hand Jehovah can uphold you with his left hand as he fights for his people with his right hand. Yes, we know the prophetic promise given to the Lord Jesus Christ, the Melchizedekian king-priest, as foretold at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972642/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 110:4-6</a>: “Jehovah himself at your right hand will certainly break kings to pieces on the day of his anger. He will execute judgment among the nations; he will cause a fullness of dead bodies.” So, by following the example of Jesus Christ our Exemplar, and by placing Jehovah God in front of us constantly, keeping him at our right hand, we will never be alone; we will never totter.</p>

<strong>How Do You Make Decisions?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Take the matter of choosing one’s religion, one of the most important decisions and one which each one of us must make. Many automatically choose the religion of their fathers without questioning whether <span id="page676" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="676" data-before-text="676"></span>it is right or not. Some join a religion that seems to satisfy their needs or is profitable in their business contacts. Still others make their choice to please their marriage mate or because of the emotional pleadings of an evangelist. But right worship is a matter of what is pleasing to God, not to us. The apostle Paul, who had made a wise choice of religion and who is therefore well qualified to advise us, said: “Keep on making sure of what is acceptable to the Lord.” Yes, in religion God comes first. Showing that knowledge of Jehovah is essential in choosing the right religion, Jesus said: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” Study God’s Word and “be filled with the accurate knowledge of his will” so that you may make a wise choice of religion.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963840/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Eph. 5:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963840/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> John 17:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963840/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Col. 1:9</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">When making a decision it is always wise to consider the probable outcome, and not only immediate gain. Why throw away something valuable for a temporary pleasure? “There exists a way that is upright before a man, but the ways of death are the end of it afterward.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963840/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Prov. 16:25</a>) Impetuous youth, in particular, has to be on guard against making foolish snap decisions, which can only lead to shame and heartache afterward.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Many of our decisions have far-reaching effects on others and this must be considered, especially by family heads and spiritual overseers. King David failed to consider this when, headily, he numbered the fighting men of Israel contrary to Jehovah’s will, and brought untimely death on seventy thousand of his subjects. What a terrible penalty for one man’s rash decision! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963840/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Sam. 24:1-15</a>) Marriage partners may at times feel their marriage has reached the breaking point. But a hasty decision to break up might be avoided if they would consider the effect it would have upon their children.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">But our making decisions should be influenced chiefly by the knowledge that every single thing we do affects our relationship with God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963840/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963840/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Col. 3:17</a>) For this reason a mature Christian makes his decisions on the basis of not only whether it is right or wrong but whether it will draw him nearer to God or lead him farther away. As Paul expressed it: “All things are lawful; but not all things are advantageous. All things are lawful; but not all things build up.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963840/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:23</a>) The Christian’s close, personal relationship with God is his most treasured possession and he will not make any decision that might damage that bond. His attitude is expressed by the words of the psalmist: “I have placed Jehovah in front of me constantly. Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be made to totter.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963840/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 16:8</a>) One who stays as close as that to God will turn naturally to him in reaching decisions. No matter how hard the decision may be, the knowledge that this is God’s will is sure to strengthen him to go through with it to the end. Decisions made in this way result not simply in temporary pleasure but in real, lasting happiness and satisfaction, because they are pleasing to Jehovah.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">These are perilous days in which we have to make many hard decisions, and it calls for clear thinking abilities and a good understanding of God’s Word and its perfect standard. When faced with the need to make a decision, know the principles involved, consider the outcome of each possible course, both for yourself and others who may be affected; but, above all, consider how it will affect your relationship with God. Then you will be able to make right and upbuilding decisions.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"></p>

As <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Psalm 22:16</a> prophesied of Jesus: “Dogs have surrounded me; the assembly of evildoers themselves have enclosed me.

Let Him provide him with escape! Let him deliver him, since he has taken delight in him!” We can see the Roman soldiers who stripped Jesus of his clothing before nailing him up throwing dice for the ownership of his inner garment: “They apportion my clothing among themselves, and upon my garment they cast lots.” We can hear Jesus just before his death taking up the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 22:1</a>: “My God, my God, why have you left me? [Why are you] far from saving me, [from] the words of my roaring?” And as he finally breathes his last and a Roman soldier jabs his side with a spear and blood and water stream out, we see fulfilled the words: “Like water I have been poured out, and all my bones have been separated from one another. My heart has become like wax; it has melted deep in my inward parts. My power has dried up just like a fragment of earthenware, and my tongue is made to stick to my gums, and in the dust of death you are setting me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ps. 22:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 14, 15,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/29/2" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> 18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/29/3" data-bid="30-4" class="b"> Matt. 27:43,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/29/4" data-bid="30-5" class="b"> 46;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/29/5" data-bid="30-6" class="b"> John 19:23, 24</a>) Even the gall that they had tried to make him drink, and the vinegar with which the soldiers sponged his mouth to quench his thirst, were foretold: “Reproach itself has broken my heart and [the wound] is incurable.

Having this in mind, Jehovah in the Psalms foretold Jesus’ resurrection from the dead. The dead Jesus was buried in a nearby tomb in a rock and thus his soul, which he had poured out in death, went to Sheol or mankind’s common grave. But Jesus died with full hope of a resurrection, his hope being voiced in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 16:8-11</a>: “I have placed Jehovah in front of me constantly.

You will not allow your man of loving-kindness to see the pit. You will cause me to know the path of life. Rejoicing to the full is with your face; there is pleasantness at your right hand forever.” That this and other prophecies of the Psalms might be carried out, Jehovah God brushed aside the Devil’s preventive efforts and raised Jesus from the dead, delivering him from Sheol on the third day. God rewarded him with a spirit body in place of the sacrificed human body, that he might know again the path of life and know pleasantness at God’s right hand forever.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Acts 2:22-31</a>.</p>

Let Him provide him with escape! Let him deliver him, since he has taken delight in him!” We can see the Roman soldiers who stripped Jesus of his clothing before nailing him up throwing dice for the ownership of his inner garment: “They apportion my clothing among themselves, and upon my garment they cast lots.” We can hear Jesus just before his death taking up the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 22:1</a>: “My God, my God, why have you left me? [Why are you] far from saving me, [from] the words of my roaring?” And as he finally breathes his last and a Roman soldier jabs his side with a spear and blood and water stream out, we see fulfilled the words: “Like water I have been poured out, and all my bones have been separated from one another. My heart has become like wax; it has melted deep in my inward parts. My power has dried up just like a fragment of earthenware, and my tongue is made to stick to my gums, and in the dust of death you are setting me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ps. 22:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 14, 15,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/29/2" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> 18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/29/3" data-bid="30-4" class="b"> Matt. 27:43,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/29/4" data-bid="30-5" class="b"> 46;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/29/5" data-bid="30-6" class="b"> John 19:23, 24</a>) Even the gall that they had tried to make him drink, and the vinegar with which the soldiers sponged his mouth to quench his thirst, were foretold: “Reproach itself has broken my heart and [the wound] is incurable.

But for food they proceeded to give [me] a poisonous plant, and for my thirst they tried to make me drink vinegar.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ps. 69:20, 21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> John 19:28-30</a>) Such fulfillments mark Jesus as the foretold Messiah!</p><p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="qu">19.

Having this in mind, Jehovah in the Psalms foretold Jesus’ resurrection from the dead. The dead Jesus was buried in a nearby tomb in a rock and thus his soul, which he had poured out in death, went to Sheol or mankind’s common grave. But Jesus died with full hope of a resurrection, his hope being voiced in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 16:8-11</a>: “I have placed Jehovah in front of me constantly.

Also, <span id="page631" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="631" data-before-text="631"></span>my own flesh will reside in security. For you will not leave my soul in Sheol. You will not allow your man of loving-kindness to see the pit. You will cause me to know the path of life. Rejoicing to the full is with your face; there is pleasantness at your right hand forever.” That this and other prophecies of the Psalms might be carried out, Jehovah God brushed aside the Devil’s preventive efforts and raised Jesus from the dead, delivering him from Sheol on the third day. God rewarded him with a spirit body in place of the sacrificed human body, that he might know again the path of life and know pleasantness at God’s right hand forever.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Acts 2:22-31</a>.</p>

For example, centuries before the arrival of Jesus Christ on earth, God foretold in detail many things in connection with him.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>WHAT PROPHECIES CONCERNING JESUS TESTIFY</strong></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Consider Jesus’ birth. About seven hundred years in advance God inspired his prophet to foretell that it would take place in Bethlehem. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967121/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mic. 5:2</a>) And how remarkably this was fulfilled! It was, in fact, as a result of a royal decree of the Roman Caesar himself! The Jewish virgin Mary and her husband Joseph were living in Galilee, in Nazareth, some sixty or more miles north of Bethlehem, a long journey over rugged terrain in those days. However, Augustus Caesar’s registration decree required them to travel to Bethlehem to register​—at just the right time for Jesus to be born there!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967121/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 2:1-7</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Consider, also, the prophecies that were fulfilled at Jesus’ death. In the inspired Psalms it was foretold that not one of his bones would be broken, and that those present would cast lots for his clothing. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967121/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 34:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967121/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 22:18</a>) Did this occur? Since the day following the execution was a holy one to the Jews and bodies were not to be left on the torture stake overnight, the Roman soldiers proceeded to break the legs of the men to hasten their death. But since Jesus had just died, his were left unbroken. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967121/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 19:31-36</a>) As for Jesus’ inner garment, it was woven with no seam, so the soldiers decided to determine by lot whose it would be, rather than to tear it up and divide it. How miraculously these prophecies were fulfilled!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967121/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 19:23, 24</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Prophecies regarding Jesus’ time in the tomb and his resurrection likewise were astonishingly fulfilled. In the Psalms it was foretold that God would not leave his holy one in hell, or the grave. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967121/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 16:10</a>, <em>AV</em>) And Jesus himself explained that he would “be killed, and on the third day be raised up.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967121/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 16:21</a>) Was he? Yes, he was! Testified the apostle Peter: “This Jesus God resurrected, of which fact we are all <span id="page102" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="102" data-before-text="102"></span>witnesses.” The prophecies were fulfilled!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967121/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 2:30-32</a>.</p>

<strong>‘The Kingdom Is at Hand’—When?</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">In taking this course of action these religious leaders of the Jews were certainly reprehensible. First, they deliberately refused to acknowledge the king Jehovah had sent and to help the Jewish people to see that their King was indeed at hand. Moreover, though they themselves claimed to be priests of God, they were seditious against God and degraded their priestly office by accepting as king the Pontifex Maximus of pagan religion. Even in Jesus’ <span id="page58" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="58" data-before-text="58"></span>death they did not want him to be acknowledged as King, for they objected to the sign that Governor Pilate insisted on posting over Jesus’ head on the torture stake, which read: “Jesus the Nazarene the King of the Jews.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966046/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">John 19:12-22</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Even though the Jewish leaders took their puny precautions by having Pilate seal the door of the memorial tomb, which may have made them feel more at ease to enjoy their formal Passover festival, they did not do away with the King of Israel, for on the third day, Nisan 16, which is the day of offering barley-harvest firstfruits to Jehovah at his temple, God himself brought forth a far finer firstfruits by raising his Son Jesus Christ from the dead.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">These chief priests and other religious leaders overlooked the fact that King David himself had written at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966046/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Psalm 16:10</a>: “You will not leave my soul in Sheol. You will not allow your loyal one to see the pit.” On this sixteenth day of Nisan Jesus was raised up, but no longer in a fleshly body that can be harmed and put to death by men. During the time of his fleshly presence among the Jews, which presence meant that the kingdom of the heavens had drawn near to Zion, Jesus proved his faithfulness and his qualifications to be raised up an immortal glorious spirit person. This is why the watchmen whom Pilate allowed the chief priests and Pharisees to station at the tomb could not see Jesus resurrected, for they could not see a spirit person. They did, however, behold the materialized angel who broke the sealed tomb. As the apostle Peter later wrote: “Christ died once for all time concerning sins, a righteous person for unrighteous ones, that he might lead you to God, he being put to death in the flesh, but being made alive in the spirit.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966046/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966046/33/1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> Matt. 27:57–28:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966046/33/2" data-bid="34-3" class="b"> 11-15</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="ss"><strong>WHEN ‘KINGDOM AT HAND’ NOT PREACHED</strong></p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Jesus gave ample proof of his resurrection to his faithful disciples by appearing in many instances through the miraculous materialization of a human body. Then he went to the heavens to sit at the right hand of his Father, expecting or waiting till the time that he was to take over his power as the heavenly king. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966046/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966046/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> Heb. 10:12, 13</a>) On the festival day of Pentecost the fiftieth day after Jesus’ resurrection, the apostle Peter stood up and quoted <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966046/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Psalm 16:10</a> and then said: “[David] saw beforehand and spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he forsaken in Hades [Greek translation for the Hebrew <em>Sheol</em>] nor did his flesh see corruption. This Jesus God resurrected, of which fact we are all witnesses.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966046/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Acts 2:29-33</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">After Jesus’ ascension to heaven the King was no longer at hand and therefore the kingdom of the heavens was no longer at hand. In fact, Jesus was not now exercising kingly authority except over those who were members of the Christian congregation. For this reason Jesus’ disciples did not announce “the kingdom of heaven is at hand” after his death. Jesus had told them that he would go away and he would come back in glorious kingdom power and he gave the disciples parables to this effect while he was on earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966046/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">John 14:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966046/37/1" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> Matt. 25:31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966046/37/2" data-bid="38-3" class="b"> Luke 19:11-27</a>) The King would not again appear in the flesh in earthly Zion. The Kingdom was now something in the future. It was to administer the affairs of the entire earth from heaven, heavenly Zion, in due time.

As regards the resurrection of the dead, did you not read what was spoken to you by God, saying, ‘I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob’? He is the God, not of the dead, but of the living.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matt. 22:29-32</a>) In other words, if those three patriarchs were to stay dead forever, God would not have said regarding Abraham, Isaac and Jacob: “I am the God.” He would properly have said, ‘I was the God.’ But, knowing His own purpose to have those three faithful men “living” again by means of the resurrection, Jehovah said: “I am the God” of them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Mark 12:24-27</a>.</p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">21.

If they had been then alive in the days of Moses, there would have been no need for resurrecting them from Sheol or Haʹdes and Jehovah’s words would have been no proof that there will be a resurrection of the dead. But only because it was God’s purpose that there be a resurrection, He spoke of the three patriarchs as though they were already living.

<strong>Death and Hades to Give Up the Dead</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> In the oldest known handwritten copies of the Christian Greek Scriptures the word Haʹdes occurs ten times.<a id="footnotesource5" data-fnid="5" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965041/4">e</a> Are people alive in the Biblical Haʹdes?

However, the religionists of Christendom are infected with pagan Greek mythology and they will say: “Not so. The dead in Haʹdes are not really dead. Only their body is dead, but their soul is alive because it is immortal. For them death means only that they are separated from God. In other respects, those immortal souls in Haʹdes are really alive.” But is this argument of the religionists of Christendom right?

Why would those “gates” not remain forever closed upon Jesus’ followers and thus make Haʹdes a “land of no return”?

In those verses the resurrected Jesus Christ in heaven said to John: “Do not be fearful. I am the First and the Last, and the living one; and I became dead, but, look! I am living forever and ever, and I have the keys of death and of Haʹdes.” Since he has the keys of death and of Haʹdes, the heavenly Jesus Christ can unlock those “gates of Haʹdes” and let his dead congregation out, in this way restoring them to life.</p><p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu">23.

On the festival day of Pentecost at Jerusalem, fifty-one days after the death and burial of Jesus, God’s holy spirit was poured down upon Peter and other disciples of Jesus. So under inspiration of God’s spirit Peter spoke and quoted <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965041/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 16:10, 11</a>, saying: “Because you will not leave my soul in <span id="page43" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="43" data-before-text="43"></span>Haʹdes, neither will you allow your loyal one to see corruption.

This Jesus God resurrected, of which fact we are all witnesses. Therefore because he was exalted to the right hand of God and received the promised holy spirit from the Father, he has poured out this which you see and hear.

<strong>A Cool Hell</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span id="page190" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="190" data-before-text="190"></span>The word “hell” is translated from the Hebrew word “Sheol” and the Greek word “Hades.” Peter showed that these two words have the same meaning by using Hades, as recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964208/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 2:27</a>, when he quoted <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964208/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 16:10</a>, which uses Sheol. These words do not convey the thought of a fiery place of torment. The <em>King James Version</em> translated Sheol as hell, grave and pit.

<strong>Light on Life’s Roadway from the Psalms</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">To begin with, the Psalms eloquently and repeatedly call attention to the fact that Jehovah God created all things: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man?” (8:3, 4) “Before the mountains themselves were born, or you proceeded to bring forth as with labor pains the earth and the productive land, even from time indefinite to time indefinite you are God.” (90:2) “Know that Jehovah is God. It is he that has made us, and not we ourselves.” (100:3) <span id="page550" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="550" data-before-text="550"></span>“I shall laud you because in a fear-inspiring way I am wonderfully made.”—139:14.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Among the earliest instances of God’s dealings with his creatures that the book of Psalms records is that of Jehovah concluding a covenant with Abraham and his making sworn statements to Isaac and Jacob. In fulfillment of these promises Jehovah God “brought out his people with exultation” to the land promised.—105:9, 10, 42-44.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Bringing his people Israel into their Promised Land involved many mighty acts, and these the book of Psalms also features. It tells that Jehovah sent ten plagues upon Egypt, that he split the Red Sea so that they could pass over and that he miraculously sustained them in the wilderness, providing bread, meat and water. Noted also are the striking victories God gained for his people in the days of Barak and Gideon.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalms 78,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 83,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 105,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 106,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/4" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> 135</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Then too, the Psalms record that it was necessary for Jehovah God repeatedly to chastise his people, even to the point of bringing them into Babylonian captivity: “By the rivers of Babylon—there we sat down. We also wept when we remembered Zion.” (137:1-9) And they record also Israel’s return from captivity: “When Jehovah gathered back the captive ones of Zion, we became like those who were dreaming. . . . At that time they proceeded to say among the nations: ‘Jehovah has done a great thing in what he has done with them.’” (126:1, 2) Yes, by recording how Jehovah God dealt with his people in times past and why, the book of Psalms throws much light on life’s roadway, for thereby it acquaints us with God’s attributes and principles.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>THE LIGHT OF PROPHECY</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The book of Psalms also serves as a light on life’s roadway by reason of the prophecies it contains, many of which have already been fulfilled, giving confidence that the rest will also have fulfillment. Among the many prophecies of the Psalms regarding Jesus Christ that the Christian Greek Scriptures show had fulfillment were that he would come in dedication to do God’s will (40:8; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 10:7-9</a>); that zeal for God’s house would eat him up, as it were (69:9; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 2:17</a>); that he would be betrayed by an intimate (41:9; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 13:18</a>); that lots would be cast for his garments (22:18; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 19:24</a>); that not a bone of him would be broken (34:20; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 19:36</a>) and that God would not leave his soul in Sheol or Hades.—16:10; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 2:29-31</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Further, the book of Psalms foretold Jesus’ exaltation to the right hand of his Father, there to await God’s due time for him to go into action against God’s enemies and for God to subject all things under Christ’s feet.—110:1, 2; 8:6; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Heb. 1:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 2:8</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The fulfillment of such prophecies instills faith that the prophecies in the Psalms regarding the blessings of the Messianic reign of the King’s Son, Jesus Christ, will also have fulfillment: “Let him judge the afflicted ones of the people, let him save the sons of the poor one, and let him crush the defrauder. He will descend like the rain upon the mown grass, like copious showers that wet the earth. In his days the righteous one will sprout, and the abundance of peace until the moon is no more. There will come to be plenty of grain on the earth; on the top of the mountains there will be an overflow.”—72:4, 6, 7, 16.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>BIBLE TEACHINGS</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The book of Psalms also throws light on life’s roadway by the various Bible teachings it touches on. Fittingly it stresses the role of Jehovah God as the Universal <span id="page551" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="551" data-before-text="551"></span>Sovereign. Though ‘the rulers of earth mass together as one against Jehovah and his anointed one, Jehovah himself will laugh at them in derision, speak to them in his anger and disturb them in hot displeasure.’ (2:1, 2, 4, 5) He will put them in their place, answering the psalmists’ prayers: “Do arise, O Jehovah! Let not mortal man prove superior in strength. Let the nations be judged before your face. Do put fear into them, O Jehovah, that the nations may know that they are but mortal men.” “Fill their faces with dishonor, that people may search for your name, O Jehovah. That people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.”—9:19, 20; 83:16, 18.</p>

<strong>Men of Loving-Kindness and the Kingdom</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> O so much depended on that sole kingdom Heir, Jesus Christ!

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958886/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Dan. 11:21, 22</a>, AS) Jesus lay broken in death, in Sheol or Haʹdes, which is the grave common to sinful mankind. Seemingly it was an impossibility now to revive the kingdom covenant with David. Yet the real impossibility was for God Almighty to let his covenant fail. His loving-kindness, his loyal love, which was promised in the covenant and which was righteously due to this loyal Son of God, Jesus Christ, could never let the covenant fail. Jehovah God had to get him out of Sheol or Haʹdes or “hell,” the common grave of mankind. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958886/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 16:10</a> Jehovah had promised in advance to do this miraculous thing. He inspired David to say: “You will not leave my soul in Sheol. You will not allow your man of loving-kindness to see the pit.” That prophecy assured the resurrection of Jesus, the Greater David, from the grave.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 9.

The apostle Paul makes this plain to us, saying: “That fact that he resurrected him from the dead destined no more to return to corruption, he has stated in this way: ‘I will give you people the loving-kindnesses of David which are dependable.’ Hence he also says in another psalm, ‘You will not grant your man of loving-kindness to see corruption.’ For David, on the one hand, served the express will of God in his own generation and fell asleep in death and was laid with his forefathers and did see corruption. On the other hand, he whom God raised up did not see corruption.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958886/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 13:34-37</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>OTHERS TAKEN INTO THE COVENANT</strong></p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">10.

Does that not show there is fire and torment of conscious human souls in Hades, Sheol, or hell? Not at all. This is a parable, and Sheol or Hades is used to picture the condition of the “rich man” class while still here among us on earth. Hence this class can be pictured as being in Sheol or Hades or hell and at the same time <span id="page144" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="144" data-before-text="144"></span>existing in torments from a blazing fire.

For this reason they could be pictured as dead and buried in Hades or the grave and yet be alive and able to look up and see afar off and also to experience torment. What they saw helped to contribute torment to them: “he saw Abraham afar off and Lazarus in the bosom position with him.” That means the “rich man” class saw they were not getting the blessing as Abraham’s natural seed. They saw the Greater Abraham, Jehovah God, far off from them and his favor going to the Jewish remnant and Gentiles who believed on Jesus and followed him. Far from being the promised seed of Abraham for a blessing to all the families and nations of the earth, they were a curse to them. Said Paul: “They are not pleasing God, but are against the interests of all men, as they try to hinder us from speaking to the nations that these might be saved, with the result that they always fill up the measure of their sins.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951164/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Thess. 2:15, 16</a>, <em>NW</em>) Both Paul and Barnabas said to them: “It was necessary for the word of God to be spoken first to you. Since you are thrusting it away from you and do not judge yourselves worthy of everlasting life, look! we turn to the nations. In fact, Jehovah has laid commandment upon us in these words, ‘I have appointed you as a light of nations, for you to be a salvation to the most distant part of the earth.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951164/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Acts 13:46, 47</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">10.

Yes, the apostle Peter applied <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101972802/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 16:10</a> to Jesus, saying: “David speaketh concerning him [Jesus] . . . thou wilt not leave my soul in hell [Hebrew, <em>sheol;</em> Greek, <em>hades</em>], neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101972802/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 2:25-27</a>) Surely none of the “Jesus people” will argue that Jesus went to hellfire when he died!</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/515/0">8/1/1965, pp. 464-466</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Recovery Still Possible</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> It can truly be said that there is much in God’s Word that makes a strong appeal, both by direct word and by prophetic dramas and parables, expressed in very moving terms, as we shall see. These appeals abundantly confirm in unmistakable language the Creator’s own description of what his name stands for, as when he declared to Moses: “Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and truth, preserving loving-kindness for thousands, pardoning error and transgression and sin, but [when necessary] by no means will he give exemption from punishment.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ex. 34:6, 7</a>) These appeals are set forth in the Bible, not only to enlighten and guide those striving to serve God acceptably, but <span id="page465" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="465" data-before-text="465"></span>also to catch the attention of those who have fallen by the way, but who are not beyond hope of recovery.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">16, 17. (a) How does God’s Word apply individually, and why is this important? (b) What prayer is appropriate, and what difficulty might this involve?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> In this connection there is another aspect worth remembering. Though the Scriptures often deal with God’s people collectively, as a nation, or prophetically portray certain classes or groups, yet they always have their appeal to the individual reader. It is important to appreciate this, for though, as in Malachi’s day, adverse judgment is pronounced against a <em>people</em> persisting in its evil ways, yet that does not prevent an <em>individual</em> from coming to his senses and turning his heart to God. This must be backed up by the individual’s also turning his feet into the right way, the “path of life.” Such a one might well pray, as did David: “The sins of my youth and my revolts O do not remember. . . . For your name’s sake, O Jehovah, you must even forgive my error, for it is considerable. Who, now, is the man fearful of Jehovah? He will instruct him in the way that he will choose.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ps. 16:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 25:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/28/2" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> 11, 12</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> You may feel that it is not easy to pray under such circumstances, wondering if your prayer will be heard after you have gone so far in the wrong way. For your encouragement, we invite you to consider the following remarkable provision that exactly meets such a need.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>PROVISION FOR PRAYER FORESHADOWED</strong></p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">18. At the inauguration of the temple, how did Solomon pray to Jehovah?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> On completion of the temple and after the Ark, representing Jehovah’s presence, had been placed in the Most Holy of the temple, then King Solomon voiced a prayer of inauguration. He mentioned various circumstances under which prayer might be made “toward this place” (the temple), and asked that Jehovah would hear and answer such prayers. Solomon included the prayers of individuals, and he even mentioned the “foreigner,” so that, when he “actually comes and prays toward this house, may you yourself listen from the heavens . . . and you must do according to all that for which the foreigner calls to you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">1 Ki. 6:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 8:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/29/2" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> 22,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/29/3" data-bid="30-4" class="b"> 30,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/29/4" data-bid="30-5" class="b"> 38,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/29/5" data-bid="30-6" class="b"> 41-43</a>.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">19.

He prayed that, if “they indeed come to their senses<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965563/0">a</a> . . . and they indeed return to you with all their heart,” and they pray in the direction of “the house that I have built to your name; you must also hear . . . their prayer and their request for favor, and you must execute judgment for them.” This would lead to the opening of the way for their return to their own land. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 Ki. 8:46-53</a>) How well this confirms the course of action that is possible for one who has wandered far off in a self-indulgent course and who feels abandoned’ If, in his distress, he faces up to his bad situation and comes to appreciate his need, then, without fail, he should call on Jehovah.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">20. What conditions were involved, and with what assurance of being heard?</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> But, like Israel of old, he must recognize the channel that Jehovah is using for hearing and answering such prayers. The Israelites could not turn to <em>any</em> temple. Of course not. There was just the one built to Jehovah’s name at his chosen city, Jerusalem. For complying with this requirement, what assurance was given that such prayers would be heard? Notice what Jehovah said to Solomon: “I have heard your prayer and your request for favor . . . I have sanctified this house that you have <span id="page466" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="466" data-before-text="466"></span>built by putting my name there to time indefinite; and my eyes and my heart will certainly prove to be there always.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965563/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">1 Ki. 9:3</a>.</p>

Seeing that he has specialized on the heart to such an extent, we can be sure that he knows his subject. Better than any human medical specialist of today, He can advise us as to just what is needed to bring our hearts to the condition where they will serve us for life eternal. Even the highest dignitary of an ancient nation, King David of Jerusalem, applied to him for needed examinations. That is why David could say to him: “You have examined my heart, you have made inspection.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977804/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 17:3</a>.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 8.

In substantiation of this, we read in the Holy Bible, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977804/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Romans 8:27</a>: “He who searches the hearts knows what the meaning of the spirit is.” Yes, he gets the sense of what we want to express to him verbally when we come to him for examination and inspection. If a person has been leading a clean life according to the Bible, he has nothing to fear. That is why the ancient psalmist could plead for an examination, saying: “Search through me, O God, and know my heart.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977804/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 139:23</a>.</p>

<strong>Eye</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>Jehovah’s Eyes.</strong> God helps humans to understand and appreciate things about himself by likening them to things that we see and know well. Thus he speaks figuratively of his “eyes” being on his people, evidently indicating his watchfulness and loving care for them. The apostle Peter says: “The eyes of Jehovah are upon the righteous ones.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001465/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1Pe 3:12</a>) God emphasizes this care and sensitiveness for their welfare when he speaks of his servants as “the pupil” of his eye, metaphorically representing their preciousness in his sight and his quickness to act in their behalf when touched by the enemy.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001465/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">De 32:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001465/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Ps 17:8</a>.</p>

The reference is evidently to the tiny image of oneself that can be seen reflected in that part of another’s eye.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The eye is extremely tender and sensitive; even a small hair or speck of dust between the lid and eyeball is quickly noticed. The transparent part of the eye (the cornea) covering the pupil must be guarded and cared for, because if this portion is scarred by injury or becomes cloudy through disease, distorted vision or blindness can result. With force and yet with delicacy of expression the Bible uses “the pupil of your eyes” in speaking of that which is to be guarded with utmost care. God’s <span id="page715" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="715" data-before-text="715"></span>law is to be so treated. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003583/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Pr 7:2</a>) Mentioning God’s fatherly care of Israel, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003583/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:10</a> says that He safeguarded the nation “as the pupil of his eye.” David prayed that he would be protected and cared for by God as “the pupil of the eyeball.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003583/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps 17:8</a>) He wanted Jehovah to be quick to act in his behalf when under enemy attack.

Their share is in this life only. David, on the other hand, was interested in making “a good name” with Jehovah, as his son later recommended that all do. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011683/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Eccl. 7:1</a>, ftn.) Just like Asaph, David saw that having Jehovah as his Friend was far better than putting his own interests foremost in life. He rejoiced in walking with God. In our time, many Christians have put spiritual activities ahead of their secular employment.</p>
