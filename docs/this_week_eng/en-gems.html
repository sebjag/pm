<strong>Genealogy</strong><br/><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">One example of such an abridgment is found in Ezra’s own genealogy. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001646/65/0" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Ezr 7:1-5</a>) He records his descent from Aaron the high priest, but in a parallel listing at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001646/66/0" data-bid="67-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 6:3-14</a>, several names appear in verses 7 to 10 that are dropped at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001646/67/0" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Ezra 7:3</a>. Likely Ezra did this to avoid unnecessary repetition and to shorten the long list of names. Still, the list was perfectly adequate to prove his priestly descent. Ezra says that he is “the son” of Seraiah, meaning that he was his descendant, for he must have been Seraiah’s great-grandson, or possibly his great-great-grandson. Seraiah was high priest and was killed by Nebuchadnezzar at the time of the exile to Babylon (607 B.C.E.), his son Jehozadak being taken into exile. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001646/68/0" data-bid="69-1" class="b">2Ki 25:18-21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001646/68/1" data-bid="69-2" class="b"> 1Ch 6:14, 15</a>) Joshua (Jeshua) the high priest, who returned 70 years later with Zerubbabel, was Seraiah’s grandson. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001646/69/0" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Ezr 5:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001646/69/1" data-bid="70-2" class="b"> Hag 1:1</a>) Ezra traveled to Jerusalem 69 years after that, which circumstance would make it impossible for Ezra to be Seraiah’s actual son and Jehozadak’s brother.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">Another thing that we learn from comparing genealogies here is that Ezra, though descended from Aaron through Seraiah, was evidently not from <em>that</em> line of Seraiah in which the office of high priest was hereditary, namely, from Jehozadak. The high-priestly line from Seraiah ran through Joshua (Jeshua), Joiakim, and Eliashib, the latter being high priest during the governorship of Nehemiah. Ezra, then, achieved his objective with his abridged genealogy, supplying just sufficient names to prove his position in the lineage of Aaron.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001646/70/0" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Ne 3:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001646/70/1" data-bid="71-2" class="b"> 12:10</a>.</p>

<strong>Seraiah</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>6.</strong> The chief priest when Babylon destroyed Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E. Though Seraiah was slain at Nebuchadnezzar’s order, his son Jehozadak was spared and taken captive to Babylon.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003904/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1Ch 6:14, 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003904/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Ezr 3:2</a>) Seraiah is also called the father of Ezra, but in view of the 139 years between Seraiah’s death and Ezra’s return, there were probably at least two unnamed generations in between them, a type of omission common in Biblical genealogies.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003904/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ezr 7:1</a>.</p>

Almost 50 years elapse, bringing us down to 468 B.C.E., the seventh year of the Persian king Artaxerxes (known as Longimanus because his right hand was longer than his left). The king grants the skilled copyist Ezra “all his request” with respect to a journey to Jerusalem to render much-needed aid there. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990076/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">7:6</a>) In authorizing him, the king encourages the Jews to go with him and grants Ezra silver and gold vessels for temple use, as well as provisions of wheat, wine, oil, and salt. He exempts the priests and temple workers from taxation. The king makes Ezra responsible to teach the people and declares it to be a capital offense for anyone not to become a doer of the law of Jehovah and the law of the king. With thankfulness to Jehovah for this expression of his loving-kindness through the king, Ezra acts immediately on the commission.</p>

<strong>Genealogy</strong><br/><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">These genealogies were carefully preserved down to the start of the Common Era. This is proved by the fact that each family of Israel was able to go back to the city of its father’s house to be registered in response to Caesar Augustus’ decree shortly before Jesus’ birth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Luke 2:1-5</a>) Also, John the Baptist’s father Zechariah is noted as of the priestly division of Abijah and John’s mother Elizabeth as from the daughters of Aaron. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Luke 1:5</a>) Anna the prophetess is spoken of as “of Asher’s tribe.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Luke 2:36</a>) And, of course, the extensive listings of Jesus’ forefathers at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Matthew, chapter 1</a>, and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Luke, chapter 3</a>, make it <span id="page636" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="636" data-before-text="636"></span>clear that such records were kept in the public archives, available for examination.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">The historian Josephus gives testimony to the existence of Jewish official genealogical registers when he says: “Now, I am not only sprung from a sacerdotal family in general, but from the first of the twenty-four courses; and . . . of the chief family of that first course also.” Then, after pointing out that his mother was descended from Asamoneus, he concludes: “Thus have I set down the genealogy of my family as I have found it described in the public records, and so bid adieu to those who calumniate me.”—<em>The Life of Flavius Josephus,</em> par. 1.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">The official genealogies of the Jews were destroyed, not by King Herod the Great, as some have supposed, but by the Romans at the destruction of Jerusalern in 70 C.E. Since that time the Jews have been unable to establish their descent in even the two most important lines, David and Levi.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="ss"><strong>PROBLEMS IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF GENEALOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS</strong></p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">In determining relationships, often the context or a comparison of parallel lists or of texts from different parts of the Bible is necessary. For example, “son” may actually mean a grandson or merely a descendant. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Matt. 1:1</a>) Again, a list of names may appear to be a register of brothers, the sons of one man. On closer observation and by comparison with other texts, however, it may prove to be the register of a genealogical line, naming some sons and also some grandsons or later descendants. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Genesis 46:21</a> evidently lists both sons and grandsons of Benjamin as “sons,” as can be seen by a comparison with <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Numbers 26:38-40</a>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">The above situation is found even in the genealogies of some major families. For example, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 6:22-24</a> lists ten “sons of Kohath.” But in the eighteenth verse, and at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Exodus 6:18</a>, we find only four sons attributed to Kohath.

The same list reads, further: “The sons of Salma were Bethlehem and the Netophathites, Atroth-beth-joab and half of the Manahathites, the Zorites.” (Vs. 54) Here Netophathites, Manahathites and Zorites were evidently families.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Genesis 10:13, 14</a>, the names of Mizraim’s descendants have what appear to be plural forms. It has been suggested that they represent the names of families or tribes rather than individuals. However, it should be borne in mind that other names in dual or plural form, such as Ephraim, Appaim, Diblaim, Meshillemoth, and also the above-named Mizraim, son of Ham, each refer to one individual.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Gen. 41:52;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/57/1" data-bid="58-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 2:30, 31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/57/2" data-bid="58-3" class="b"> Hos. 1:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/57/3" data-bid="58-4" class="b"> 2 Chron. 28:12</a>.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="ss"><strong><em>Abbreviated lists</em></strong></p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">Often the Bible writers greatly abbreviated a genealogical list, evidently naming only family heads of the more prominent houses, or important personages, or persons most important to the particular history being considered. At times descent from a certain remote ancestor was apparently all that the chronicler was concerned with showing; therefore he could leave out many intermediate names.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">One example of such abridgment is found in Ezra’s own genealogy. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/58/0" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Ezra 7:1-5</a>) He records his descent from Aaron the high priest, but in a parallel listing at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 6:3-14</a>, several names appear in verses 7 to 10 that are dropped at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/60/0" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Ezra 7:3</a>. Likely Ezra did this to avoid unnecessary repetition and to shorten the long list of names. Still, the list was perfectly adequate to prove his priestly descent. Ezra says that he is the “son” of Seraiah, meaning that he was his descendant, for he must have been Seraiah’s great-grandson, or possibly his great-great-grandson. Seraiah was high priest and was killed by Nebuchadnezzar at the time of the exile to Babylon (607 B.C.E.), his son Jehozadak being taken into exile. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">2 Ki. 25:18-21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/61/1" data-bid="62-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 6:14, 15</a>) Joshua (Jeshua) the high priest, who returned seventy years later with Zerubbabel, was Seraiah’s grandson. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/62/0" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Ezra 5:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/62/1" data-bid="63-2" class="b"> Hag. 1:1</a>) Ezra traveled to Jerusalem sixty-nine years after that, which circumstance would make it impossible for Ezra to be Seraiah’s actual son and Jehozadak’s brother.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">Another thing that we learn from comparing genealogies here is that Ezra, though descended from Aaron through Seraiah, was evidently not from <em>that</em> line of Seraiah in which the office of high priest was hereditary, namely, from Jehozadak, but from a son born later to either Seraiah or Jehozadak. The high-priestly line from Seraiah ran through Joshua (Jeshua), Joiakim and Eliashib, the latter being high priest during the governorship of Nehemiah. Ezra, then, achieved his objective with his abridged genealogy, supplying just sufficient names to prove his position in the lineage of Aaron.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/63/0" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Neh. 3:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/63/1" data-bid="64-2" class="b"> 12:10</a>.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="ss"><strong>SOME REASONS FOR VARIATIONS IN GENEALOGICAL LISTS</strong></p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb">A son who died childless was often not named; in some cases the man may have had a daughter but no son, and the inheritance may have been transmitted through a daughter who, in marriage, went under another family head in the same tribe. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Num. 36:7, 8</a>) At times the genealogy may merge a less prominent family under another family head, so that such minor family is not listed. Therefore childlessness, transmission of inheritance through women, perhaps adoption, or failure to establish a separate ancestral house caused names to be dropped out of some of the genealogical lists, while new houses formed might add new names to the lists. It is obvious, therefore, that the names in a later genealogy might differ at many points from those in an earlier listing.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">A number of family heads may appear in what seems to be a list of brothers but which may actually include nephews, as in Jacob’s “adoption” of Joseph’s sons, Jacob saying: “Ephraim and Manasseh will become mine like Reuben and Simeon.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/65/0" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Gen. 48:5</a>) Later, therefore, Ephraim and Manasseh are counted alongside their uncles as tribal heads.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/66/0" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Num. 2:18-21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/66/1" data-bid="67-2" class="b"> Josh. 17:17</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/67/0" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Nehemiah, chapter 10</a>, presents a number of names attesting by seal a “trustworthy arrangement” to perform God’s commandments. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/68/0" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Neh. 9:38</a>) In these lists, the names given are not necessarily the names of the individuals entering into the agreements, but may refer to the houses involved, the ancestral head being named. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/69/0" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Ezra 10:16</a>.) This may be indicated by the fact that many of the names listed are the same as those listed as returning with Zerubbabel from Babylon some eighty years earlier. So, while those present may in some cases have had the same name as the ancestral head, they may have been merely representatives of the ancestral houses listed by those names.</p>

<strong>Sennacherib</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The Jewish historian of the first century C.E., Josephus, claims to quote the Babylonian Berossus (considered as of the third century B.C.E.) as recording the event thus: “Now when Sennacherib was returning from his Egyptian war to Jerusalem, he found his army under Rabshakeh his general in danger, <span id="page1470" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1470" data-before-text="1470"></span>for God had sent a pestilential distemper upon his army; and on the very first night of the siege, a hundred fourscore and five thousand, with their captains and generals, were destroyed.” Some commentators attempt to explain the disaster by an account from Herodotus (of the fifth century B.C.E.) in which he claims that a legion of rats gnawed everything in the Assyrians’ weapons that was made of rope or leather, leaving them unable to carry out an invasion of Egypt. This account obviously does not coincide with the Biblical record, nor does Herodotus’ description of the Assyrian campaign harmonize with the Assyrian inscriptions. Nevertheless, the accounts by Berossus and Herodotus at least reflect the fact that Sennacherib’s forces met up with sudden and calamitous difficulty in this campaign.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Sennacherib’s troubles had not ended, however, and following his return to Assyria he had to quell another revolt in Babylon, provoked by Merodach-baladan. This time Sennacherib placed his own son, Ashur-nadin-shumi, as king in Babylon. Six years later Sennacherib embarked on a campaign against the Elamites, but they soon retaliated by invading Mesopotamia, captured Ashur-nadin-shumi, and placed their own king on the throne of Babylon. Several years of struggle for control of the region followed, until finally the enraged Sennacherib took vengeance on Babylon by leveling it to the ground, an unparalleled act in view of Babylon’s position as the “Holy City” of all Mesopotamia. The remaining years of Sennacherib’s reign were apparently without major incident.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Sennacherib’s death is considered to have come some twenty years after his campaign against Jerusalem. This figure is dependent on Assyrian records, their reliability being subject to question. At any rate, it should be noted that the Bible account does not state that Sennacherib’s death occurred immediately upon his return to Nineveh. “Later on he entered the house of his god” Nisroch, and his sons, Adrammelech and Sharezer, “struck him down with the sword,” escaping to the land of Ararat. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013807/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013807/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Isa. 37:37, 38</a>) An inscription of his son and successor, Esar-haddon, confirms this.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>BUILDING WORKS</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The Assyrian Empire thus saw no particular expansion under Sennacherib. He did, however, carry out an ambitious building project in Nineveh, which he had restored to its position as the capital city. The vast palace he erected there was a complex of halls, courts and rooms of state covering an area 1,500 feet (457 meters) long by 700 feet (213 meters) wide. He brought in water from thirty miles (48 kilometers) away, constructing a causeway over the Gomer River, known as the Jerwan Aqueduct. Its waters contributed toward the irrigation of gardens and parks, as well as the strengthening of the city’s defenses by its encircling moat.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Genealogy</strong><br/><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">These genealogies were carefully preserved down to the start of the Common Era. This is proved by the fact that each family of Israel was able to go back to the city of its father’s house to be registered in response to Caesar Augustus’ decree shortly before Jesus’ birth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Luke 2:1-5</a>) Also, John the Baptist’s father Zechariah is noted as of the priestly division of Abijah and John’s mother Elizabeth as from the daughters of Aaron. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Luke 1:5</a>) Anna the prophetess is spoken of as “of Asher’s tribe.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Luke 2:36</a>) And, of course, the extensive listings of Jesus’ forefathers at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Matthew, chapter 1</a>, and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Luke, chapter 3</a>, make it <span id="page636" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="636" data-before-text="636"></span>clear that such records were kept in the public archives, available for examination.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">The historian Josephus gives testimony to the existence of Jewish official genealogical registers when he says: “Now, I am not only sprung from a sacerdotal family in general, but from the first of the twenty-four courses; and . . . of the chief family of that first course also.” Then, after pointing out that his mother was descended from Asamoneus, he concludes: “Thus have I set down the genealogy of my family as I have found it described in the public records, and so bid adieu to those who calumniate me.”—<em>The Life of Flavius Josephus,</em> par. 1.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">The official genealogies of the Jews were destroyed, not by King Herod the Great, as some have supposed, but by the Romans at the destruction of Jerusalern in 70 C.E. Since that time the Jews have been unable to establish their descent in even the two most important lines, David and Levi.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="ss"><strong>PROBLEMS IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF GENEALOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS</strong></p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">In determining relationships, often the context or a comparison of parallel lists or of texts from different parts of the Bible is necessary. For example, “son” may actually mean a grandson or merely a descendant. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Matt. 1:1</a>) Again, a list of names may appear to be a register of brothers, the sons of one man. On closer observation and by comparison with other texts, however, it may prove to be the register of a genealogical line, naming some sons and also some grandsons or later descendants. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Genesis 46:21</a> evidently lists both sons and grandsons of Benjamin as “sons,” as can be seen by a comparison with <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Numbers 26:38-40</a>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">The above situation is found even in the genealogies of some major families.

The same list reads, further: “The sons of Salma were Bethlehem and the Netophathites, Atroth-beth-joab and half of the Manahathites, the Zorites.” (Vs. 54) Here Netophathites, Manahathites and Zorites were evidently families.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Genesis 10:13, 14</a>, the names of Mizraim’s descendants have what appear to be plural forms. It has been suggested that they represent the names of families or tribes rather than individuals. However, it should be borne in mind that other names in dual or plural form, such as Ephraim, Appaim, Diblaim, Meshillemoth, and also the above-named Mizraim, son of Ham, each refer to one individual.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Gen. 41:52;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/57/1" data-bid="58-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 2:30, 31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/57/2" data-bid="58-3" class="b"> Hos. 1:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/57/3" data-bid="58-4" class="b"> 2 Chron. 28:12</a>.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="ss"><strong><em>Abbreviated lists</em></strong></p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">Often the Bible writers greatly abbreviated a genealogical list, evidently naming only family heads of the more prominent houses, or important personages, or persons most important to the particular history being considered. At times descent from a certain remote ancestor was apparently all that the chronicler was concerned with showing; therefore he could leave out many intermediate names.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">One example of such abridgment is found in Ezra’s own genealogy. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/58/0" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Ezra 7:1-5</a>) He records his descent from Aaron the high priest, but in a parallel listing at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 6:3-14</a>, several names appear in verses 7 to 10 that are dropped at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/60/0" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Ezra 7:3</a>. Likely Ezra did this to avoid unnecessary repetition and to shorten the long list of names. Still, the list was perfectly adequate to prove his priestly descent. Ezra says that he is the “son” of Seraiah, meaning that he was his descendant, for he must have been Seraiah’s great-grandson, or possibly his great-great-grandson. Seraiah was high priest and was killed by Nebuchadnezzar at the time of the exile to Babylon (607 B.C.E.), his son Jehozadak being taken into exile. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">2 Ki. 25:18-21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/61/1" data-bid="62-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 6:14, 15</a>) Joshua (Jeshua) the high priest, who returned seventy years later with Zerubbabel, was Seraiah’s grandson. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/62/0" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Ezra 5:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/62/1" data-bid="63-2" class="b"> Hag. 1:1</a>) Ezra traveled to Jerusalem sixty-nine years after that, which circumstance would make it impossible for Ezra to be Seraiah’s actual son and Jehozadak’s brother.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">Another thing that we learn from comparing genealogies here is that Ezra, though descended from Aaron through Seraiah, was evidently not from <em>that</em> line of Seraiah in which the office of high priest was hereditary, namely, from Jehozadak, but from a son born later to either Seraiah or Jehozadak. The high-priestly line from Seraiah ran through Joshua (Jeshua), Joiakim and Eliashib, the latter being high priest during the governorship of Nehemiah. Ezra, then, achieved his objective with his abridged genealogy, supplying just sufficient names to prove his position in the lineage of Aaron.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/63/0" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Neh. 3:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/63/1" data-bid="64-2" class="b"> 12:10</a>.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="ss"><strong>SOME REASONS FOR VARIATIONS IN GENEALOGICAL LISTS</strong></p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb">A son who died childless was often not named; in some cases the man may have had a daughter but no son, and the inheritance may have been transmitted through a daughter who, in marriage, went under another family head in the same tribe. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Num. 36:7, 8</a>) At times the genealogy may merge a less prominent family under another family head, so that such minor family is not listed. Therefore childlessness, transmission of inheritance through women, perhaps adoption, or failure to establish a separate ancestral house caused names to be dropped out of some of the genealogical lists, while new houses formed might add new names to the lists. It is obvious, therefore, that the names in a later genealogy might differ at many points from those in an earlier listing.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">A number of family heads may appear in what seems to be a list of brothers but which may actually include nephews, as in Jacob’s “adoption” of Joseph’s sons, Jacob saying: “Ephraim and Manasseh will become mine like Reuben and Simeon.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/65/0" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Gen. 48:5</a>) Later, therefore, Ephraim and Manasseh are counted alongside their uncles as tribal heads.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/66/0" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Num. 2:18-21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/66/1" data-bid="67-2" class="b"> Josh. 17:17</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/67/0" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Nehemiah, chapter 10</a>, presents a number of names attesting by seal a “trustworthy arrangement” to perform God’s commandments. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/68/0" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Neh. 9:38</a>) In these lists, the names given are not necessarily the names of the individuals entering into the agreements, but may refer to the houses involved, the ancestral head being named. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/69/0" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Ezra 10:16</a>.) This may be indicated by the fact that many of the names listed are the same as those listed as returning with Zerubbabel from Babylon some eighty years earlier. So, while those present may in some cases have had the same name as the ancestral head, they may have been merely representatives of the ancestral houses listed by those names.</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010389/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Neh. 2:1-8</a>) Because this edict is referred to at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010389/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Daniel 9:25</a> as relating to the time of the promised coming of the Messiah, the date of Artaxerxes’ twentieth year has been a matter of considerable study. Whereas most secular works fix the date of the start of his reign at 465 or 464 B.C.E., there is sound reason for placing it at an earlier date, as follows:</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The first year of the reign of Xerxes, father and predecessor of Longimanus, ran from December of 486 B.C.E. to the spring of 485 B.C.E. During 480-479 B.C.E. (the seventh year of his reign) he attempted an invasion of Greece but suffered defeats due to the tactics of the Athenian general Themistocles. The book of Esther (which calls him Ahasuerus) refers to the twelfth year of Xerxes’ rule (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010389/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Esther 3:7</a>) and indicates that his rule likely extended on into its thirteenth year (474 B.C.E.). Though modern historians generally extend Xerxes’ reign on to include a total of twenty-one years, and although some clay tablets referring to a sixteenth, twentieth and twenty-first year have been assigned by certain scholars to his reign, there is strong testimony to show that Xerxes’ rule ended in 474 B.C.E. and that he was then replaced by his son, Artaxerxes Longimanus.—See CHRONOLOGY.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The key to the matter relates to the flight of Athenian general Themistocles to the Persian capital, because of being accused of treason in his own land. The Greek historian Thucydides of Athens lived during the reign of Artaxerxes, and he records that Themistocles fled to Persia when Artaxerxes had but “lately come to the throne.” (See Thucydides in Book I, chapter 137.) Nepos, a Roman historian of the first century B.C.E., supports this statement, saying: “I know that most historians have related that Themistocles went over into Asia in the reign of Xerxes, but I give credence to Thucydides in preference to others, because he, of all who have left records of that period, was nearest in point of time to Themistocles, and was of the same city. Thucydides says that he went to Artaxerxes.” (Nepos, <em>Themistocles,</em> chap. 9) Similarly, the Greek biographer Plutarch, of the first century C.E., says: “Thucydides, and Charon of Lampsacus, say that Xerxes was dead, and that Themistocles had an interview with his son, Artaxerxes; but Ephorus, Dinon, Clitarchus, Heraclides and many others, write that he came to Xerxes. The chronological tables better agree with the account of Thucydides.”—Themistocles, c. 27; see also <em>The Encyclopedia Americana,</em> 1956 ed., Vol. 26, p. 507.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The weight of historical evidence, therefore, points to Themistocles’ flight as occurring in the reign of Artaxerxes, not of Xerxes. As to the date of that flight, Jerome’s <em>Eusebius</em> places Themistocles’ arrival in Asia in the fourth year of the 76th Olympiad (four-year periods beginning in 776 B.C.E.), that is, in the year 473/472 B.C.E. Confirming this are the annals or chronology of Diodorus the Sicilian, a Greek historian of the first century B.C.E., which place the date of Themistocles’ death in 471 B.C.E. Since after his arrival Themistocles is reported to have requested one year’s time in which to learn Persian before receiving audience with the king, it fits well that his arrival would reasonably have taken place about two years before his death or by the year 473 B.C.E. And since, as Thucydides records, Themistocles arrived when Artaxerxes had but “lately come to the throne,” then the first year of Artaxerxes’ reign evidently began in 474 B.C.E. The noted German scholar Ernst Wm. Hengstenberg (1802-1869) in his work entitled “Christology of the Old Testament” (Vol. 2, p. 395) states: “Krueger . . . places the death of Xerxes in the year 474 or 473, and the flight of Themistocles a year later.” Archbishop James Ussher, of Ireland (1581-1656), as a chronologist, also held that Artaxerxes Longimanus ascended the Persian throne in 474 B.C.E., as did the celebrated writer Vitringa (1659-1722).</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Accepting the year 474 B.C.E. on this basis as the initial year of Artaxerxes’ reign, we conclude that the twentieth year of his rule should have been the year 455 B.C.E., at which time his decree sent to Palestine by Nehemiah for the rebuilding of the city of Jerusalem would go into effect, thus marking the start of the “seventy weeks” of Daniel’s prophecy. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010389/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Dan. 9:24</a>) Hengstenberg sums up the matter in saying (Vol. 2, p. 394): “The difference [of opinion] concerns only the year of the commencement of the reign of Artaxerxes. Our problem is completely solved, when we have shown that this year falls in the year 474 before Christ. For then the twentieth year of Artaxerxes is the year 455 before Christ, according to the usual reckoning.” Undoubtedly the strongest proof for the date of 455 B.C.E. as the twentieth year of the reign of Artaxerxes, however, is the fact of the Messiah’s appearance in the year 29 C.E., and his death in 33 C.E., in fulfillment of the time period indicated in Daniel’s prophecy.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010389/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Dan. 9:25, 26</a>; see MESSIAH.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010389/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Nehemiah 13:6</a> refers to the “thirty-second year of Artaxerxes,” at which time (443-442 B.C.E.)

(according to <em>Babylonian Chronology 626 B.C.—A.D. 75</em> by Parker and Dubberstein, page 18) and was succeeded by Darius II.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Captivity</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">However, being exiled to a foreign land was not as bad as being sold into cruel perpetual slavery, or executed in the sadistic manner typical of Assyrian and Babylonian conquests.

Take wives and become father to sons and to daughters; and take wives for your own sons and give your own daughters to husbands, that they may give birth to sons and to daughters; and become many there, and do not become few. Also, seek the peace of the city to which I have caused you to go into exile, and pray in its behalf to Jehovah, for in its peace there will prove to be peace for you yourselves.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010878/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Jer. 29:4-7</a>) Some of them developed skills in various trades that proved useful after the captivity ended.

The findings concerning a well-known Jewish family in Nippur indicate a flourishing banking, real estate and insurance business; many Jewish names were found among their business records. Such commercial intercourse and social contact with non-Jews in time tended to infiltrate the Hebrew language with Aramaic.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The period of captivity, amounting to eighty years for some, naturally affected community worship of the true God Jehovah. With no temple, no altar and no organized priesthood, the offering of daily sacrifices was not possible. However, the practice of circumcision, abstention from unclean foods, sabbath observance and constancy in prayer were things the faithful could do in spite of the scorn and ridicule of others. Captive Daniel’s “serving with constancy” his God was well-known by King Darius and others. Even when an interdict was legalized forbidding under the penalty of death the making of a petition to anyone except the king, “even three times in a day [Daniel] was kneeling on his knees and praying and offering praise before his God, as he had been <em>regularly</em> doing prior to this.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010878/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Dan. 6:4-23</a>) Such faithfulness in their limited worship helped to prevent these exiles from losing their national identity. They could also profit from the contrast they observed between the pure simplicity of Jehovah’s worship and the ostentatious idolatrous materialism of Babylon. No doubt they also benefited from the presence of Jehovah’s prophets, Ezekiel and Daniel.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010878/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Ezek. 8:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010878/35/1" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> Dan. 1:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010878/35/2" data-bid="36-3" class="b"> 10:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">As the local synagogue arrangement developed among the Jews, the need for copies of the Scriptures in the communities of Jewish exiles all over Media, Persia and Babylonia intensified. Ezra was known as “a skilled copyist in the law of Moses,” indicating that copies of Jehovah’s law had been brought from Judah, reproductions of which were made. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010878/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Ezra 7:6</a>) Without doubt these precious scrolls of past generations included the book of Psalms, with the probability that <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010878/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Psalm 137</a>, and perhaps also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010878/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Psalm 126</a>, were composed during or shortly after the captivity.

Only in Jehovah’s prophetic promises was there any basis for hope. Moses and Solomon, centuries before, had spoken of restoration that would follow captivity.

Isaiah foretold that Jesus Christ would become a stumbling stone “to both the houses of Israel,” hardly meaning that Jesus, or the twelve whom he sent out during his third tour of Galilee, would have to visit settlements of captives in far-off Media in order to preach to descendants of the northern kingdom.

Old age prevented many from risking the hardships of the trip. Others who could have made the trip from a physical point of view chose to remain where they were. Many, no doubt, had gained a little material success over the years and were satisfied to remain where they were. It the rebuilding of Jehovah’s temple did not occupy the first place in their lives they would not be inclined to make the hazardous trip, with an uncertain future awaiting them. And, of course, those who had proved apostate had no incentive to go back.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">This means that, as a people, part of the Jews remained scattered and came to be known as the <em>Di·a·spo·raʹ</em> or “Dispersion.” In the fifth century B.C.E. communities of Jews were found throughout <span id="page299" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="299" data-before-text="299"></span>the 127 jurisdictional districts of the Persian Empire.

<strong>Ezra</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>1.</strong> An Aaronic priest, a descendant of Eleazar and Phinehas, a scholar, an expert copyist and teacher of the Law, skilled in both Hebrew and Aramaic. Ezra had genuine zeal for pure worship and “prepared his heart to consult the law of Jehovah and to do it and to teach in Israel regulation and justice.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001475/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezr 7:1-6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001475/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 10</a>) In addition to writing the book bearing his name, Ezra apparently wrote the two books of Chronicles, and Jewish tradition credits him with beginning the compiling and cataloging of the books of the Hebrew Scriptures. Moreover, Ezra was an outstanding researcher, citing about 20 sources of information in the two books of Chronicles. Since many of the Jews were scattered far and wide in Ezra’s day, it necessitated the making of many copies of the Hebrew Scriptures, and likely Ezra pioneered this work.</p>

For one thing, you can imitate the example and method of capable teachers mentioned in God’s Word. Ezra was such a teacher.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="ss"><strong>Learning From Ezra’s Example</strong></p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Ezra was an Aaronic priest who lived some 2,500 years ago in Babylon. In the year 468 B.C.E., he went to Jerusalem in order to advance pure worship among the Jews living there. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002484/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezra 7:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002484/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002484/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 12, 13</a>) This task required him to teach the people God’s Law. What did Ezra do to ensure that his teaching was effective? He took several necessary steps. Note these steps as recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002484/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezra 7:10</a>:</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Ezra himself had [1] <em>prepared</em> his heart [2] to <em>consult</em> the law of Jehovah and [3] to <em>do</em> it and [4] to <em>teach</em> in Israel regulation and justice.” Let us briefly look at each of these steps and see what we can learn from them.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>“Ezra Himself Had Prepared His Heart”</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Just as the farmer first prepares the soil by using a plow before sowing seed, Ezra prayerfully prepared his heart to receive the word of God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002484/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezra 10:1</a>) In other words, he ‘inclined his heart’ to Jehovah’s teaching.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002484/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:2</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Similarly, the Bible states that King Jehoshaphat “prepared [his] heart to search for the true God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002484/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 19:3</a>) In contrast, a generation of Israel “who had not prepared their heart” is described as “stubborn and rebellious.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002484/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 78:8</a>) Jehovah sees “the secret person of the heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002484/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:4</a>) Yes, “he will teach the meek ones his way.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002484/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 25:9</a>) How important it is, therefore, that teachers today follow Ezra’s example by first prayerfully bringing their heart into the proper condition!</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><span id="page21" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span><strong>“To Consult the Law of Jehovah”</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">To be a capable teacher, Ezra consulted God’s Word. If you were to consult a doctor, would you not listen attentively and make sure that you understood all that he was saying or prescribing? No doubt you would, for your health is at stake. How much more, therefore, should we give profound attention to the things Jehovah is telling us, or prescribing, through his Word, the Bible, and through “the faithful and discreet slave.” After all, his counsel concerns our very life! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002484/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 4:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002484/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 24:45-47</a>) Of course, a doctor can be wrong, but “the law of Jehovah is perfect.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002484/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 19:7</a>) We will never be in need of a second opinion.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The Bible books of Chronicles (which Ezra originally wrote as one volume) show that Ezra was indeed a thorough student. To write those books, he referred to numerous sources.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2002484/0">a</a> The Jews, who had recently arrived from Babylon, were in need of a summary of their nation’s history. They had insufficient knowledge of the observances of their religion, the service in the temple, and the tasks of the Levites. Genealogical records were of vital importance for them. Ezra paid special attention to those matters. Until the coming of the Messiah, the Jews were to remain as a nation with its own land, a temple, a priesthood, and a governor. Thanks to the information Ezra had gathered, unity and true worship could be preserved.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">How do your study habits compare with those of Ezra? Studying the Bible diligently will aid you in teaching the Bible effectively.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>“Consult the Law of Jehovah” as a Family</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Consulting the law of Jehovah is not restricted to personal study. Family study is an excellent opportunity to do this as well.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Jan and Julia, a couple in the Netherlands, have read out loud to their two sons from the very day the children were born. Today, Ivo is 15 years old, and Edo is 14. Once a week, they still have their family study. Jan explains: “Our main objective is not that we cover a lot of material during the study but that the boys grasp what is discussed.” He adds: “The boys do a lot of research. They check unfamiliar words and Bible personalities​—when they lived, who they were, what their occupation was, and so forth. Ever since they learned to read, they have consulted such books as <em>Insight on the Scriptures,</em> dictionaries, and encyclopedias. This makes the family study much more enjoyable. The boys are always waiting and ready to go.” As a fringe benefit, both boys now also are at the head of their classes in linguistic abilities.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">John and Tini, another couple in the Netherlands, studied with their son, Esli (now 24 years old and pioneering in another congregation), and their daughter, Linda (now 20 years old and married to a fine young brother). However, instead of studying a certain publication by means of the usual question-and-answer method, they tailored the family study to the age and needs of the children. What method did they use?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">John explains that his son and daughter chose an interesting subject from “Questions From Readers” (from <em>The Watchtower</em>) and “The Bible’s Viewpoint” (from <em>Awake!</em>). Later, they presented what they had prepared, which always resulted in interesting family discussions. In this way the young ones gained experience in doing research and in discussing the results of their study. Do you “consult the law of Jehovah” with your children? This not only will enhance your personal teaching ability but will also help your children to become more effective teachers.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><span id="page22" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span><strong>“To Do It”</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Ezra applied what he learned. For instance, while still in Babylon, he may have lived a settled life. Nevertheless, when he realized that he could help his people abroad, he exchanged the comforts of Babylon for the distant city of Jerusalem, with all its inconveniences, problems, and perils. Clearly, not only had Ezra been gathering Bible knowledge but he was ready to act on what he had learned.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002484/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Timothy 3:13</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Later, while living in Jerusalem, Ezra again showed that he applied what he had learned and was teaching. This became evident when he heard of the marriages of Israelite men to heathen women. The Bible record tells us that he ‘ripped apart his garment and his sleeveless coat and pulled out some of the hair of his head and of his beard and kept sitting stunned until the evening.’ He even felt ‘ashamed and embarrassed to raise up his face’ to Jehovah.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002484/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ezra 9:1-6</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">How his study of God’s Law had affected him! Ezra had a clear view of the terrible consequences of the people’s disobedience. The number of the repatriated Jews was small. If they entered into mixed marriages, they might eventually merge with the surrounding pagan nations, and pure worship could easily vanish from the face of the earth!</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Happily, Ezra’s example of devoted fear and zeal moved the Israelites to correct their ways. They got rid of their foreign wives. Within three months all was set straight. Ezra’s personal loyalty to God’s Law did much to make his teaching effective.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">The same is true today. One Christian father said: “Children do not do as you say; they do as you do!” The same principle applies within the Christian congregation. Elders who set a fine example may expect that the congregation will respond to their teachings.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>“To Teach in Israel Regulation and Justice”</strong></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">There is yet another reason why Ezra’s teaching was effective. He did not teach his own ideas, but he taught “regulation and justice.” That is, the regulations, or laws, of Jehovah. This was his priestly responsibility. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002484/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Malachi 2:7</a>) He also taught justice, and he provided an example of what he taught by sticking to what is right in a fair and impartial way, according to a standard. When those having authority show justice, stability is built and permanent results are produced. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002484/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Proverbs 29:4</a>) Similarly, Christian elders, parents, and Kingdom proclaimers who are well-acquainted with God’s Word will build up spiritual stability when they teach Jehovah’s regulations and justice in the congregation, in their families, and to interested ones.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Do you not agree that your teaching may become more effective when you imitate to the full the example of faithful Ezra? Therefore, <em>‘prepare</em> your heart, <em>consult</em> the law of Jehovah, <em>do</em> it, and <em>teach</em> Jehovah’s regulation and justice.’​<em>—</em><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002484/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ezra 7:10</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sf"><strong>[Footnote]</strong></p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="se"><strong>[Box/Picture on page 22]</strong></p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sc"><strong>Picture caption:</strong> <strong>WHAT MADE EZRA’S TEACHING EFFECTIVE?</strong></p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sm"> 1.

Distractions may turn our attention away from what is being said. The spoken words can exert little influence on us if we are preoccupied with things that happened during the day or are concerned about what is awaiting us tomorrow. We need to be firmly resolved to listen and learn if we are to benefit from what is being said. What benefits we can receive if we are determined to understand the scriptures being expounded and the meaning that is being put into them!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001764/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Nehemiah 8:5-8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001764/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 12</a>.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">15.

Humility softens the heart, helping us to become more teachable. Jehovah said to Judean King Josiah: “For the reason that your heart was soft so that you humbled yourself because of Jehovah at your hearing what I have spoken . . . and began weeping before me, I, even I, have heard.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001764/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">2 Kings 22:19</a>) Josiah’s heart was humble and receptive.

<strong>Study—Rewarding and Enjoyable</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Yes, our love for Jehovah’s Word should come from our heart, the seat of emotion. We should take pleasure in lingering over certain passages that we have just read. We should muse over deep spiritual thoughts, become absorbed in them, and meditate on them. This requires quiet reflection and prayer. Like Ezra, we need to prepare our hearts for the reading and study of God’s Word. Of him it is written: “Ezra himself had prepared his heart to consult the law of Jehovah and to do it and to teach in Israel regulation and justice.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000723/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ezra 7:10</a>) Note the triple purpose of Ezra’s preparing his heart: to <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>study, to make personal application, and to teach. We should follow his example.</p>

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page29" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span><strong>Searching for Jehovah With a Prepared Heart</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">ISRAELITE priest Ezra was an outstanding researcher, scholar, copyist, and teacher of the Law. For Christians today he is also a fine example of whole-souled service. How so? In that he maintained his godly devotion even while living in Babylon, a city filled with false gods and demon worship.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Ezra’s godly devotion did not just happen. He worked at it. Indeed, he tells us that he <em>“had prepared his heart</em> to consult the law of Jehovah and to do it.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000166/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezra 7:10</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Like Ezra, Jehovah’s people today want to do all that Jehovah asks of them while living in a world that is hostile to true worship. So let us examine ways in which we too can prepare our heart, the inner person​—including our thoughts, attitudes, desires, and motivations—​to “consult the law of Jehovah and to do it.”</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>Preparing Our Heart</strong></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“To prepare” means “to make ready beforehand for some purpose: put into condition for a particular use, application, or disposition.” Of course, if you have come to an accurate knowledge of God’s Word and have dedicated your life to Jehovah, then your heart has certainly proved to be in a prepared state and can be compared to “the fine soil” that Jesus spoke about in his parable of the sower.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000166/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 13:18-23</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Nevertheless, our heart needs constant attention and refinement. Why? For two reasons. First, because harmful tendencies, like weeds in a garden, can readily take root, especially during these “last days” when “the air” of Satan’s system is more than ever filled with hurtful seeds of fleshly thinking. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000166/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000166/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ephesians 2:2</a>) The second reason concerns the soil itself. Left untended, soil may soon dry out, harden, and become unfruitful. Or too many people may carelessly walk over the garden and tread down the soil into a hard mass. The figurative soil of our heart is similar. It may become infertile if neglected or trodden down by people who have no interest in our spiritual well-being.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">How important it is, then, for all of us to apply the Bible’s admonition: “More than all else that is to be guarded, safeguard your heart, for out of it are the sources of life.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000166/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 4:23</a>.</p>

<strong>Steps Toward Life</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Baptism, therefore, symbolically and outwardly testifies to an agreement to do God’s will. In the picture concerning the cities of refuge (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950483/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Num. 35:10-32</a>) the “other sheep” of <span id="page206" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="206" data-before-text="206"></span>the Lord are shown as fleeing to the Lord’s organization, thereby agreeing to do his will. They are thus hidden or immersed under and unto the organization of the Lord. Those who followed Moses through the waters of the Red sea and under the canopy of the cloud overhead were thus “baptized unto Moses” in the sea and the cloud and were thus against the Egyptians, representing the Devil’s organization. Likewise those who followed Noah into the ark and remained there were hidden or immersed and thereby baptized unto Noah. Both Moses and Noah pictured Christ Jesus the great Prophet of Jehovah God. Therefore even the “other sheep” at this present time experience the baptism unto the Greater Noah, Christ Jesus. Coming under the protection of the Theocratic organization of Christ Jesus, they now find shelter, and if they continue there to seek righteousness and meekness, rendering themselves in obedience unto the Lord, they have the promise of deliverance from the wrath of God at Armageddon. That baptism “with fire” will be to the destruction of all Satan’s organization, but will be to the protection of all those who find refuge in or under Jehovah’s organization.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Hence experiencing and living up to the meanings of faith, consecration, sanctification and baptism are important steps along the way to life in Jehovah’s incoming new world of righteousness.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Taxation</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">During the Persian period, the Jews (with the exception of the priests and others serving at the sanctuary, who were exempted by Artaxerxes Longimanus) had to pay tax (Aramaic, <em>mid·dahʹ</em> or <em>min·dahʹ</em>), tribute (<em>belohʹ</em>), and toll (<em>halakhʹ</em>). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004333/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ezr 4:13,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004333/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004333/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 7:24</a>) <em>Mid·dahʹ</em> is thought to designate personal tax on individuals; <em>belohʹ,</em> a tax on consumer items, excise; and <em>halakhʹ,</em> toll paid by travelers at road stations or river fords. The <em>mid·dahʹ</em> (translated “tribute” in <em>AS, KJ, NW</em> at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004333/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ne 5:4</a>) must have been quite high, for many of the Jews had to borrow money to pay it.

<strong>Prophetic Temple Rebuilding by the “Sons of the Exile”</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Though inferior as it most likely was in all these respects, Zerubbabel’s temple <span id="page630" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="630" data-before-text="630"></span>nevertheless did serve Jehovah’s purpose as the place of meeting between Jehovah and his covenant people. Particularly did it hold an honorable position in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah. Artaxerxes I (Longimanus) generously decreed at that time regarding “the priests and the Levites, the musicians, the doorkeepers, the Nethinim [temple slaves], and the workers of this house of God,” that “no tax, tribute or toll is allowed to be imposed upon them.” At their assemblies the people would crowd into the temple courts and Ezra would make public declaration and prayer in front of the sanctuary or temple proper.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959764/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ezra 7:24</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>A CHECKERED EXISTENCE</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Zerubbabel’s temple had a checkered existence, even as did that of Solomon, although at no time was it as grossly defiled by Israelite hands, for at times they had set up idols in the courts of Solomon’s temple and once even nailed its doors shut. Still, even in Nehemiah’s day—while he was away at the Persian court—the Jews showed lack of appreciation of their temple. Thus we read that upon his return he found the Levites and priests working their farms instead of attending to temple duties, because the people failed to bring in the tithe as they had solemnly agreed to do earlier in Nehemiah’s governorship.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959764/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Neh. 10:32, 33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959764/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 13:10, 11</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Chief of the pagan defilers of Zerubbabel’s temple doubtless was Antíochus Epíphanes, a fanatical Syrian ruler. Frustrated in his ambition to extend his domains, it is said, he tried to satisfy his vanity and lust for power by embarking on a crusade to Hellenize his subject peoples. Determined to eradicate the religion and customs of the Jews, he invaded Jerusalem in 170 B.C. and robbed the temple of many of its treasures. Two years later he showed the degree of his contempt for Jehovah’s house by sacrificing a sow upon its great altar, at which time he also established a garrison in Jerusalem to see to it that his pagan policies were carried out.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">This religious oppression sparked the revolt of the Maccabees. Three years later, to the very day of that initial defilement of the temple by Antíochus, the Maccabean general Judas Maccabeus entered Jerusalem at the head of a victorious army, cleansed the temple and rededicated it. (The record of all this is found in the book of First Maccabees, the only one of the Apocrypha historically reliable.) In commemoration of this event the feast of dedication was celebrated annually, reference to which is made in the Scriptures: “At that time the feast of dedication took place in Jerusalem. It was wintertime.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959764/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 10:22</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Some hundred years later, in 63 B.C., a Roman army under General Pompey attacked the temple area of Jerusalem from the north, resulting in a great massacre of Jews in the temple courts. In 54 B.C. the plundering Roman politician Crassus robbed the temple of some ten million dollars worth of treasures. In 37 B.C. King Herod, in his war with the Jewish Asmonean rulers, the dynasty that resulted from the success of the Maccabean revolt, stormed the temple and destroyed some of its halls. Then about twenty years later, or after standing five hundred years, Zerubbabel’s temple gradually made way for its successor, Herod’s temple.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>PROPHETIC PATTERNS</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The Scriptural record of temple rebuilding by the sons of the Exile is part of the “all things that were written aforetime” for our instruction. Contained therein are forceful lessons in appreciation of Jehovah’s manner of dealing with his servants, as well as striking prophetic patterns or parallels that throw light on our roadway, <span id="page631" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="631" data-before-text="631"></span>making clear the divine will for us.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959764/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Rom. 15:4</a>.</p>

<strong>Tartarus</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The word Tartarus also is used in pre-Christian heathen mythologies. In Homer’s <em>Iliad</em> this mythological Tartarus is represented as an underground prison ‘as far below Hades as earth is below heaven.’ In it were imprisoned the lesser gods, Cronus and the other Titan spirits. As we have seen, the Tartarus of <span id="page1577" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1577" data-before-text="1577"></span>the Bible is not a place but a condition and, therefore, is not the same as this Tartarus of Greek mythology. However, it is worth noting that the mythological Tartarus was not presented as a place for humans but for superhuman creatures. So, in that regard there is a similarity, since the Scriptural Tartarus is clearly not for the detention of human souls (compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014228/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 11:23</a>) but only for wicked superhuman spirits who are rebels against God.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The condition of utter debasement represented by Tartarus is a precursor of the abyssing that Satan and his demons are to experience prior to the start of the thousand-year reign of Christ. This, in turn, is to be followed after the end of the thousand years by their utter destruction in the “second death.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014228/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 25:41;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014228/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Rev. 20:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014228/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 7-10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014228/11/3" data-bid="12-4" class="b"> 14</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"></p>

Contrary to some other overseers in the past, he did not oppress the people or demand special favors. “As for me, I did not do that way on account of the fear of God. And, what is more, in the work of this wall I took a hand, and not a field did we acquire; and all my attendants were collected together there for the work.” With a clear conscience he could pray: “Do remember for me, O my God, for good, all that I have done in behalf of this people.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962322/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Neh. 5:15, 16,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962322/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 19</a>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">16.

There was a subtle depreciation of true worship from the top down and from the bottom up. Subsequent rebellions of the Jews did not bring relief but brought more oppression by the nations. In the first century the Jewish system of things revolved around the Sanhedrin and around the imposing of handed-down tradition rather than the pure Word of God. There were still a high priest and auxiliary priests to offer sacrifice and administer at the temple, but practices and sectarian doctrines violated completely the spirit of the Mosaic law. How greatly the people needed a leader, a faithful overseer, to lead them back to true worship! Their very lives depended upon this, for the time had come now to take an accounting.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">17. As overseer of the new system of things, what did Jesus do while on earth?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Roman rule was represented by Governor Pilate at Jerusalem when Christ Jesus began his ministry. Jesus did not seek to set himself up as king over Israel or try to displace imperial power of Rome. He came only to “seek and to save what was lost” and to prepare the way for the new system of things that would bring fulfillment of all God’s promises to eliminate disobedience, sin, death and all the awful consequences. Jesus was to be the true overseer, and he described himself as being the Fine Shepherd. “The sheep listen to his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.” “I have come that they might have life and might have it in abundance. I am the fine shepherd; the fine shepherd surrenders his soul in behalf of the sheep.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962322/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Luke 19:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962322/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> John 10:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962322/17/2" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 10, 11</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">18.

Besides his own vigorous preaching campaign, he trained his apostles and disciples to carry on the work after he had returned to heaven. Love was demonstrated in all his activities. Correction and chastisement were needed from time to time, but he administered these with discernment, knowing what was needed and how it should be given. He was a leader and called for his followers to come after him. As a nation the Jews rejected him as their overseer and life-giver. So he said: “How often I wanted to gather your children together in the manner that a hen gathers her brood of chicks under her wings, but you people did not want it! Look! Your house is abandoned to you.” How horrible it was in the year 70 when the Romans sacked the city, all “because you did not discern the time of your being inspected.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962322/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Luke 13:34, 35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962322/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 19:44</a>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">19.

A body of older men, including the apostles, took charge of the work and sent representatives from Jerusalem to various parts of the land. “When he [Jesus] ascended on high . . . he gave gifts in men . . . some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelizers, some as shepherds and teachers, with a view to the training of the holy ones, for ministerial work.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962322/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Eph. 4:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962322/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 11, 12</a>) Congregations of holy ones were organized.

<strong>Ezra</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Many of the Jews had become prosperous in Babylon, and the prospects offered in Jerusalem were not attractive from a material viewpoint. Jerusalem was sparsely settled. The fine start made by the Jews under Zerubbabel seems to have deteriorated. One commentator, Dean Stanley, says: “Jerusalem itself was thinly inhabited, and seemed to have stopped short in the career which, under the first settlers, had been opening before it. . . . It is certain that, whether from the original weakness of the rising settlement, or from some fresh inroad of the surrounding tribes, of which we have no distinct notice, the walls of Jerusalem were still unfinished; huge gaps left in them where the gates had been burnt and not repaired; the sides of its rocky hills cumbered with their ruins; the Temple, though completed, still with its furniture scanty and its ornaments inadequate.” (<em>Ezra and Nehemiah: Their Lives and Times,</em> by George Rawlinson, London, 1890, pp. 21, 22) So to return to Jerusalem meant loss of position, disruption of ties, the denial of a more or less comfortable way of life, and the building of a new life in a distant land under circumstances that were trying, difficult, and possibly dangerous, not to mention a long and hazardous journey, since many hostile Arab tribes and other enemies might be encountered. It called for zeal for true worship, faith in Jehovah, and courage to make the move. Only some 1,500 men and their families were found willing and able to go, perhaps 6,000 or so in all. Ezra had a difficult task as their leader. But Ezra’s past course of life had prepared him, and he strengthened himself according to Jehovah’s hand upon him.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001475/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezr 7:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001475/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001475/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 8:1-14</a>.</p>

Herodotus (I, 179) speaks of a little river named Is, which flows into the Euphrates, and states that the city of Is on this river is about eight days’ journey from Babylon. Is has been identified with the modern Hit, and some suggest this as the probable location of Ahava.</p>

<strong>Steps Toward Life</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Baptism, therefore, symbolically and outwardly testifies to an agreement to do God’s will.

They are thus hidden or immersed under and unto the organization of the Lord. Those who followed Moses through the waters of the Red sea and under the canopy of the cloud overhead were thus “baptized unto Moses” in the sea and the cloud and were thus against the Egyptians, representing the Devil’s organization. Likewise those who followed Noah into the ark and remained there were hidden or immersed and thereby baptized unto Noah. Both Moses and Noah pictured Christ Jesus the great Prophet of Jehovah God. Therefore even the “other sheep” at this present time experience the baptism unto the Greater Noah, Christ Jesus. Coming under the protection of the Theocratic organization of Christ Jesus, they now find shelter, and if they continue there to seek righteousness and meekness, rendering themselves in obedience unto the Lord, they have the promise of deliverance from the wrath of God at Armageddon. That baptism “with fire” will be to the destruction of all Satan’s organization, but will be to the protection of all those who find refuge in or under Jehovah’s organization.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Hence experiencing and living up to the meanings of faith, consecration, sanctification and baptism are important steps along the way to life in Jehovah’s incoming new world of righteousness.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Canals</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The canals also furnished Babylonia with a means of communication and transportation of goods. Shallow basketlike vessels and rafts carried merchandise to and from the sea. By means of these the products of the fertile land to the N of Babylon were brought down for sale. Ancient Babylon was a commercial depot between the Eastern and Western world, having many ships in the Persian Gulf.

<strong>Daric</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A Persian gold coin weighing 8.4 g (0.27 oz t) and hence presently evaluated at $94.50. The obverse side of a daric that was coined for two centuries from the latter part of the sixth century B.C.E. onward depicts a king in a half-kneeling position, with a spear in his right hand and a bow in his left. The reverse side shows the oblong punch impression made when the coin was stamped.

<strong>Ezra</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Ezra then proclaimed a fast in order to seek from Jehovah the right way. Even though his caravan would be carrying great riches, Ezra did not want to bring the least shadow on Jehovah’s name by requesting an escort after he had expressed to the king his full faith in Jehovah’s protection for his servants. After entreating God, he called in 12 from among the chiefs of the priests, carefully weighed out to them the contribution, which, according to modern-day values, was evidently worth more than $43,000,000, and entrusted it to them.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001475/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ezr 8:21-30</a>.</p>

<strong>Jerusalem</strong><br/><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">In “the first year” (evidently as ruler over Babylon) of Cyrus the Persian (538 B.C.E.) the royal decree went forth freeing the exiled Jews to “go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and rebuild the house of Jehovah the God of Israel.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/73/0" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Ezr 1:1-4</a>) The people who made the long trip to Jerusalem, carrying temple treasures with them, included 42,360 Israelites, besides slaves and professional singers. They arrived in time to celebrate the Festival of Booths in Tishri (September-October) 537 B.C.E. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/74/0" data-bid="75-1" class="b">Ezr 2:64, 65;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/74/1" data-bid="75-2" class="b"> 3:1-4</a>) Temple rebuilding got under way under Governor Zerubbabel’s direction and, after serious interference and the infiltration of some apathy among the returned Jews, was finally completed by March of 515 B.C.E. More exiles returned with priest-scribe Ezra in 468 B.C.E., bringing additional things “to beautify the house of Jehovah, which is in Jerusalem” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002436/75/0" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Ezr 7:27</a>), this by authorization of King Artaxerxes (Longimanus).
