(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Job 1:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/52/1" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> 12:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/52/2" data-bid="53-3" class="b"> 28:28</a>) In the account of Abraham their forefather the name <em>Jehovah</em> is used some seventy times from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Genesis chapters 12 to 24</a> inclusive.

But their characteristic behavior also makes them ideal subjects for illustrations and metaphors. In the Bible, many of the references to the birds of the heavens teach us important lessons about life and our relationship with God. Let us look at a few examples.</p>

<strong>Are They “Intelligent”?</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Whether animals act by “intelligence” or by instinct, the question remains: What is the source of their wisdom? Even though Dr. Gould admits he cannot explain it, his basic stand in this field is: “Evolution can program very complex behavior into very tiny brains.” But would it not be more logical to conclude that such “intelligent” behavior must be the result of intelligent design rather than blind evolution? The Bible links the behavior of the winged creatures to the Creator and says: “Ask, please, the domestic animals, and they will instruct you; also the winged creatures of the heavens, and they will tell you. Who among all these does not well know that the hand of Jehovah itself has done this?”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101986924/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 12:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101986924/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 9</a>; see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101986924/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 30:24-28</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">What will these creatures tell you? If they had the ability to speak, they would say: <em>‘The Creator</em> can program very complex behavior into very tiny brains.’ While evolutionists may “wish they’d never done” such intriguing things, the Bible attributes the wisdom​—whether learned or instinctive—​of such creatures to their Maker, Jehovah God.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101986924/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 1:20-22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101986924/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Romans 1:20</a>.</p>

<strong>Man Learns from God’s Creations</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">A bat can fly in a dark room that is strung with wires or rods without striking them. By echo-ranging it can locate and <span id="page644" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="644" data-before-text="644"></span>catch with uncanny accuracy a tiny insect that is flying around in the dark. Despite the presence of loud background noise it can pick out its echo signals, although those signals may be 2,000 times fainter than the background noise. This ability astounds scientists. They have no idea how the bat does it and would like very much to learn its secret. The <em>Scientific American</em> said: Bats “have achieved their signal-to-noise discrimination with an auditory system that weighs only a fraction of a gram, while we rely on computing machines which seem grossly cumbersome by comparison.” Note too what was observed by <em>National Geographic</em> magazine: “Big ears detect the returning echoes, and a brain weighing a few hundredths of an ounce computes the data and controls the hunter’s speed and direction. . . . He can hear an echo from a target as tiny as a mosquito, recognize it in a split second, and swoop to the attack—a feat of nature that man, with all his electronic skill, must still hold in awe.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In an effort to design efficient hulls for submarines, man has turned to the porpoise and the whale. He wants to learn how a porpoise can swim through the water at great speed with almost no energy-sapping turbulence. Scientists are inclined to think that the secret lies in the two-layered construction of the porpoise’s skin. They are testing out their theory by experimenting with a rubber covering for the hulls of submarines. By applying what they learn from studying the porpoise, they hope to have the same success they have had in changing submarine-hull design to be like that of a whale. The first nuclear submarine to have this new design is the American submarine Skipjack. The result has been greater maneuverability and speed.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In the field of aeronautics, birds have aided men in solving many problems concerning heavier-than-air flight. “Aeronauts naturally look to birds,” says <em>The Encyclopedia Americana,</em> “for suggestions in artificial flight. They have paid particular attention to the poise and flight of the herring-gull in arriving at the principles of aerial navigation.” It took man a long time to learn from birds the secret of flight; yet birds do not know the laws of aerodynamics or of aeronautics. The One who gave their wings a highly perfected mechanical design for flight gave them instinctive knowledge of flying and of aerial navigation.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">These are only a few of many examples that could be mentioned of how man learns from studying God’s creations. In the bodies of living creatures man finds wise designing that permits various life forms to make efficient use of physical laws. Because man learns from studying these creatures, they are, in a sense, telling him that they are the creations of an infinitely wise Creator. “Ask, please, the domestic animals, and they will instruct you; also the winged creatures of the heavens, and they will tell you. Or show your concern to the earth, and it will instruct you; and the fishes of the sea will declare it to you. Who among all these does not well know that the hand of Jehovah itself has done this?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961800/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 12:7-9</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Creatures of high intelligence are not instructed by those of low intelligence, but rather the lesser is instructed by the greater. The fact that man can apply to his inventions the knowledge he gains from studying dumb creatures indicates that he is learning from the handiwork of a superior Intelligence. His inventive works can carry the label “Made by man,” but the things in nature that instruct him can rightly bear the label “Made by God.”</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Be Taught by Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">What does Jehovah teach those who are willing to be taught by him? First of all: “I am Jehovah. That is my name.” Also that “Jehovah is in truth God. He is the living God and the King to time indefinite.” Jehovah further teaches us what his purposes are. His transcendent purpose regarding himself is to vindicate his name by clearing it of reproach, so “that people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the <span id="page341" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="341" data-before-text="341"></span>earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 42:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Jer. 10:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Ps. 83:18</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">His purpose regarding the earth and humankind is to have the earth “filled with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters are covering the very sea.” Also to “wipe out every tear from their eyes,” for “death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be any more.” In other words, Jehovah’s purpose for earth and man is an earth-wide Paradise. By means of the kingdom for which Jesus taught us to pray Jehovah God accomplishes both purposes.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 11:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Rev. 21:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Matt. 6:9, 10</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Jehovah also teaches us what is his will for us. Since the Kingdom is his chief means for accomplishing his purposes, his will for us is: “Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you.” Otherwise stated, ‘You must love Jehovah with your whole heart, mind, soul and strength, and your neighbor as yourself.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 6:33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Mark 12:30, 31</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">How does Jehovah teach us? Since he is the great Spirit whom it is impossible for us to see and yet live, he uses various instrumentalities, such as the “book of nature,” his dealings and providences, his holy spirit, his visible channel or earthly organization and, chief of all, his Word, the Bible.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ex. 33:20</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>THE “BOOK OF NATURE”</strong></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Jehovah God’s “book of nature” is used by him to teach man ever so many things. Men of science are continually letting themselves be taught by this book, as when they imitate God’s handiwork in building airplanes, ships and countless other things. Parents would also do well to let themselves be taught by it by taking lessons from deer, monkeys and bears as to the importance of discipline in the rearing of one’s offspring.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Wise King Solomon showed that God teaches prudence and diligence by this book: “Go to the ant, you lazy one; see its ways and become wise.” The Greater-than-Solomon, Jesus Christ, likewise referred to God’s teaching by means of this book. For a lesson of faith and trust in our heavenly Father he called attention to the birds of the air and the lilies of the field. And said the apostle Paul: “Does not nature itself teach you that . . . if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Prov. 6:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Matt. 6:26-30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 1 Cor. 11:14, 15</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">But most important of all, by means of this book God teaches man as to His existence and attributes: “His invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are understood by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship, so that they are inexcusable.” Job also appreciated that fact, for he said: “Ask, please, the domestic animals and they will instruct you, also the winged creatures of the heavens and they will tell you. Or speak thoughtfully to the earth and it will instruct you, and the fishes of the sea will declare it to you. Who among all these does not well know that the hand of Jehovah itself has done this?” Truly God teaches by his book of nature!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rom. 1:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Job 12:7-10</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>MIRACLES AND PROVIDENCES—EXPERIENCES</strong></p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">There is an old saying, “Experience is the best teacher.” But not so. Far better to learn without the costly and painful process of experience, which one may undergo without learning anything, as can be seen all about us. But God’s servants have an infallible and omniscient authority; and therefore knowledge of God, faith that his will is for the best, and obedience to it are far better than experience.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Still, at times, because of human frailty or some other valid reason, Jehovah does teach his servants by experience. That is, by means of miracles or his providences <span id="page342" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="342" data-before-text="342"></span>he indicates his will or drives home certain lessons. He let the Israelites go hungry in the wilderness and then fed them on miraculous manna ‘in order to make them know,’ that is, to teach them, “that not by. bread alone does man live.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Deut. 8:2, 3</a>.</p>

<strong>Are They “Intelligent”?</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Whether animals act by “intelligence” or by instinct, the question remains: What is the source of their wisdom? Even though Dr. Gould admits he cannot explain it, his basic stand in this field is: “Evolution can program very complex behavior into very tiny brains.” But would it not be more logical to conclude that such “intelligent” behavior must be the result of intelligent design rather than blind evolution? The Bible links the behavior of the winged creatures to the Creator and says: “Ask, please, the domestic animals, and they will instruct you; also the winged creatures of the heavens, and they will tell you. Who among all these does not well know that the hand of Jehovah itself has done this?”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101986924/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 12:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101986924/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 9</a>; see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101986924/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 30:24-28</a>.</p>

<strong>The Faithful Creator</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> These works astound in their wisdom and scope. How rich is earth’s store of minerals and oil, and how abundant that essential commodity—water! Jehovah made also the air for man to breathe, and to be maintained in freshness and purity—a provision that unthankful men have abused in these “last days” by filling the atmosphere with smog and radioactive fallout. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1, 2</a>) He brought forth a luxuriant variety of plant life, endowed with remarkable powers of photosynthesis, whereby sunlight is captured and built into energy-rich food. And what a wide range of menus he prepared for man’s future enjoyment! Moreover, he created the colorful array of fish, bird and animal life, for the service and pleasure of man. Truly God’s preparation and provisioning of earth as his gift to humankind is a superlative example of his faithfulness and loving-kindness. <span id="page299" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="299" data-before-text="299"></span>What heartfelt admiration and praise it should excite among God-fearing men!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 37:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Job 12:7-10</a>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 9, 10. In what respects is man himself a masterpiece among Jehovah’s creations?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> In making man himself, Jehovah provided a mind, a body, a set of organs and an ability and capacity for work that are a miracle of miracles in all the material creation. Consider, for example, the God-given abilities of speaking, listening, writing and reading. Even though fallen from perfection, the man of God can exclaim: “I shall laud you because in a fear-inspiring way I am wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful, as my soul is very well aware.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 139:14</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> What a wondrous masterpiece of construction is the upright human frame! The design and balance of the body, its mechanics and its chemistry, and the amazing hookup of nerves, mind and senses, are without parallel in human scientific achievement. Reflect on those ten marvelously designed levers, the human fingers. Even the smartest engineer could never have thought out, or manufactured, anything so beautifully utilitarian. Reflect, too, that no human production on this earth, from a tiny transistor to a mighty ocean liner, could have been constructed without the skillful manipulation of those God-given fingers.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Prov. 31:10-13</a>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">11. How does the miracle of reproduction show forth the Creator’s faithfulness?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> As further loving provision of the faithful Creator, man was endowed with power to reproduce his kind. “Male and female he created them. Further, God blessed them and God said to them: ‘Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth and subdue it.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Gen. 1:27, 28</a>) Is there anything so marvelous in the realm of the material creation as this miracle of reproduction? No outside architect or blueprint decides the form that a growing embryo shall take. The egg cell, once made fertile, divides and multiplies of itself. By miraculous processes—designed by the all-wise Creator, and passed down through each generation of humankind—the embryo develops true to pattern, producing head, body, arms and legs. No outside building materials need be brought in to fashion those sparkling eyes, that powerful heart, or the soft hair that will provide beauty and protection. All is brought forth wondrously from the laboratory of the ever-multiplying cells. As the end of the divinely ordered process, another baby is born, with prospect of further growth to the full radiance of manhood or womanhood. Truly we can thank and praise the faithful Creator for his arrangement whereby we have received the gift of human life.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 139:15-17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Eccl. 11:5</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">12.

In gratitude all mankind should declare: “Bless Jehovah, O my soul. O Jehovah my God, you have proved very great. With dignity and splendor you have clothed yourself. How many your works are, O Jehovah! All of them in wisdom you have made.” Mortal man should want to use all his God-given body, abilities and vital force to the honor of his God and Maker. His expression should be: “Your loving-kindness, O Jehovah, has filled the earth. Teach me your own regulations. All your commandments are faithfulness itself.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 104:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/18/2" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> 119:64,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/18/3" data-bid="19-4" class="b"> 86</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>FAITHFULNESS TO THE CREATOR</strong></p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">13.

How thankful <span id="page300" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="300" data-before-text="300"></span>we can be that “God went on to say: ‘Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness’”! Thus Jehovah placed in mortal man godly intelligence and attributes of mind that He and His beloved heavenly Son exercise so wonderfully. Man was made with the capacity to appreciate the divine principles that would govern his existence. God’s laws were plainly stated to him. In loving obedience man could now show gratitude for all of Jehovah’s bounteous provision in the earthly paradise.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Gen. 1:26-31</a>.</p>

<strong>Man Learns from God’s Creations</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">A bat can fly in a dark room that is strung with wires or rods without striking them. By echo-ranging it can locate and <span id="page644" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="644" data-before-text="644"></span>catch with uncanny accuracy a tiny insect that is flying around in the dark. Despite the presence of loud background noise it can pick out its echo signals, although those signals may be 2,000 times fainter than the background noise. This ability astounds scientists. They have no idea how the bat does it and would like very much to learn its secret. The <em>Scientific American</em> said: Bats “have achieved their signal-to-noise discrimination with an auditory system that weighs only a fraction of a gram, while we rely on computing machines which seem grossly cumbersome by comparison.” Note too what was observed by <em>National Geographic</em> magazine: “Big ears detect the returning echoes, and a brain weighing a few hundredths of an ounce computes the data and controls the hunter’s speed and direction. . . . He can hear an echo from a target as tiny as a mosquito, recognize it in a split second, and swoop to the attack—a feat of nature that man, with all his electronic skill, must still hold in awe.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In an effort to design efficient hulls for submarines, man has turned to the porpoise and the whale. He wants to learn how a porpoise can swim through the water at great speed with almost no energy-sapping turbulence. Scientists are inclined to think that the secret lies in the two-layered construction of the porpoise’s skin. They are testing out their theory by experimenting with a rubber covering for the hulls of submarines. By applying what they learn from studying the porpoise, they hope to have the same success they have had in changing submarine-hull design to be like that of a whale. The first nuclear submarine to have this new design is the American submarine Skipjack. The result has been greater maneuverability and speed.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In the field of aeronautics, birds have aided men in solving many problems concerning heavier-than-air flight. “Aeronauts naturally look to birds,” says <em>The Encyclopedia Americana,</em> “for suggestions in artificial flight. They have paid particular attention to the poise and flight of the herring-gull in arriving at the principles of aerial navigation.” It took man a long time to learn from birds the secret of flight; yet birds do not know the laws of aerodynamics or of aeronautics. The One who gave their wings a highly perfected mechanical design for flight gave them instinctive knowledge of flying and of aerial navigation.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">These are only a few of many examples that could be mentioned of how man learns from studying God’s creations. In the bodies of living creatures man finds wise designing that permits various life forms to make efficient use of physical laws. Because man learns from studying these creatures, they are, in a sense, telling him that they are the creations of an infinitely wise Creator. “Ask, please, the domestic animals, and they will instruct you; also the winged creatures of the heavens, and they will tell you. Or show your concern to the earth, and it will instruct you; and the fishes of the sea will declare it to you. Who among all these does not well know that the hand of Jehovah itself has done this?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961800/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 12:7-9</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Creatures of high intelligence are not instructed by those of low intelligence, but rather the lesser is instructed by the greater. The fact that man can apply to his inventions the knowledge he gains from studying dumb creatures indicates that he is learning from the handiwork of a superior Intelligence. His inventive works can carry the label “Made by man,” but the things in nature that instruct him can rightly bear the label “Made by God.”</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"></p>

And said the apostle Paul: “Does not nature itself teach you that . . . if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Prov. 6:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Matt. 6:26-30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 1 Cor. 11:14, 15</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">But most important of all, by means of this book God teaches man as to His existence and attributes: “His invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are understood by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship, so that they are inexcusable.” Job also appreciated that fact, for he said: “Ask, please, the domestic animals and they will instruct you, also the winged creatures of the heavens and they will tell you. Or speak thoughtfully to the earth and it will instruct you, and the fishes of the sea will declare it to you. Who among all these does not well know that the hand of Jehovah itself has done this?” Truly God teaches by his book of nature!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rom. 1:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Job 12:7-10</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>MIRACLES AND PROVIDENCES—EXPERIENCES</strong></p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">There is an old saying, “Experience is the best teacher.” But not so.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● If an unmarried pregnant woman who has made arrangements for the baby to be adopted comes to a knowledge of the truth before the baby is born, should she then feel obligated to keep the child in order to teach it the truth of God’s Word?</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One may argue that if the baby is adopted it will have more in a material way and will not have to bear the stigma of illegitimacy. But spiritual provisions are more vital than material things, and if necessary the social stigma can be avoided by the mother’s moving to another place.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Jehovah commands the parent: “These words that I am commanding you today must prove to be on your heart, and you must inculcate them in your son and speak of them when you sit in your house and when you walk on the road and when you lie down and when you get up.” How could a parent do this if she gives her baby away? How could she give it the right start in life: “Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it”?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956611/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deut. 6:6, 7</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956611/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 22:6</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">At the moment it might seem wise to unburden oneself of the problem by having the baby adopted, but it would be against the motherly instincts and as time passed there might be bitter regret because of this course. It would be against natural affection, although in these last days of critical, difficult times we are told that many persons would be “having no natural affection.” It would seem better to follow the principles of motherly affection and love for offspring and the keeping of a clear conscience. Even the principles of Christian faith would seem to be violated by failure to look after the child one brought into existence. Paul wrote: “Certainly if anyone does not provide for those who are his own, and especially for those who are members of his household, he has disowned the faith and is worse than a person without faith.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956611/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956611/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 5:8</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">So it would seem more courageous and more Christian to bear the burden of keeping and rearing the baby, facing whatever consequences that might follow, such as loss of reputation. Especially so now that the mother has come to a knowledge of the truth and is in position to teach the truth to her offspring and perhaps make it possible for it to live forever in a new world of righteousness. The person finding herself in this difficult position must make her own decision as to the course she will follow.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"></p>

And what a wide range of menus he prepared for man’s future enjoyment! Moreover, he created the colorful array of fish, bird and animal life, for the service and pleasure of man. Truly God’s preparation and provisioning of earth as his gift to humankind is a superlative example of his faithfulness and loving-kindness. <span id="page299" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="299" data-before-text="299"></span>What heartfelt admiration and praise it should excite among God-fearing men!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 37:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Job 12:7-10</a>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 9, 10.

Consider, for example, the God-given abilities of speaking, listening, writing and reading. Even though fallen from perfection, the man of God can exclaim: “I shall laud you because in a fear-inspiring way I am wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful, as my soul is very well aware.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 139:14</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> What a wondrous masterpiece of construction is the upright human frame! The design and balance of the body, its mechanics and its chemistry, and the amazing hookup of nerves, mind and senses, are without parallel in human scientific achievement. Reflect on those ten marvelously designed levers, the human fingers. Even the smartest engineer could never have thought out, or manufactured, anything so beautifully utilitarian. Reflect, too, that no human production on this earth, from a tiny transistor to a mighty ocean liner, could have been constructed without the skillful manipulation of those God-given fingers.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Prov. 31:10-13</a>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">11.

No outside architect or blueprint decides the form that a growing embryo shall take. The egg cell, once made fertile, divides and multiplies of itself. By miraculous processes—designed by the all-wise Creator, and passed down through each generation of humankind—the embryo develops true to pattern, producing head, body, arms and legs. No outside building materials need be brought in to fashion those sparkling eyes, that powerful heart, or the soft hair that will provide beauty and protection. All is brought forth wondrously from the laboratory of the ever-multiplying cells. As the end of the divinely ordered process, another baby is born, with prospect of further growth to the full radiance of manhood or womanhood. Truly we can thank and praise the faithful Creator for his arrangement whereby we have received the gift of human life.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 139:15-17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Eccl. 11:5</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">12.

In gratitude all mankind should declare: “Bless Jehovah, O my soul. O Jehovah my God, you have proved very great. With dignity and splendor you have clothed yourself.

Thus Jehovah placed in mortal man godly intelligence and attributes of mind that He and His beloved heavenly Son exercise so wonderfully. Man was made with the capacity to appreciate the divine principles that would govern his existence. God’s laws were plainly stated to him. In loving obedience man could now show gratitude for all of Jehovah’s bounteous provision in the earthly paradise.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Gen. 1:26-31</a>.</p>

<strong>Man Learns from God’s Creations</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">A bat can fly in a dark room that is strung with wires or rods without striking them. By echo-ranging it can locate and <span id="page644" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="644" data-before-text="644"></span>catch with uncanny accuracy a tiny insect that is flying around in the dark. Despite the presence of loud background noise it can pick out its echo signals, although those signals may be 2,000 times fainter than the background noise. This ability astounds scientists. They have no idea how the bat does it and would like very much to learn its secret. The <em>Scientific American</em> said: Bats “have achieved their signal-to-noise discrimination with an auditory system that weighs only a fraction of a gram, while we rely on computing machines which seem grossly cumbersome by comparison.” Note too what was observed by <em>National Geographic</em> magazine: “Big ears detect the returning echoes, and a brain weighing a few hundredths of an ounce computes the data and controls the hunter’s speed and direction. . . . He can hear an echo from a target as tiny as a mosquito, recognize it in a split second, and swoop to the attack—a feat of nature that man, with all his electronic skill, must still hold in awe.”</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In an effort to design efficient hulls for submarines, man has turned to the porpoise and the whale. He wants to learn how a porpoise can swim through the water at great speed with almost no energy-sapping turbulence. Scientists are inclined to think that the secret lies in the two-layered construction of the porpoise’s skin. They are testing out their theory by experimenting with a rubber covering for the hulls of submarines. By applying what they learn from studying the porpoise, they hope to have the same success they have had in changing submarine-hull design to be like that of a whale. The first nuclear submarine to have this new design is the American submarine Skipjack. The result has been greater maneuverability and speed.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In the field of aeronautics, birds have aided men in solving many problems concerning heavier-than-air flight. “Aeronauts naturally look to birds,” says <em>The Encyclopedia Americana,</em> “for suggestions in artificial flight. They have paid particular attention to the poise and flight of the herring-gull in arriving at the principles of aerial navigation.” It took man a long time to learn from birds the secret of flight; yet birds do not know the laws of aerodynamics or of aeronautics. The One who gave their wings a highly perfected mechanical design for flight gave them instinctive knowledge of flying and of aerial navigation.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">These are only a few of many examples that could be mentioned of how man learns from studying God’s creations. In the bodies of living creatures man finds wise designing that permits various life forms to make efficient use of physical laws. Because man learns from studying these creatures, they are, in a sense, telling him that they are the creations of an infinitely wise Creator. “Ask, please, the domestic animals, and they will instruct you; also the winged creatures of the heavens, and they will tell you. Or show your concern to the earth, and it will instruct you; and the fishes of the sea will declare it to you. Who among all these does not well know that the hand of Jehovah itself has done this?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961800/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 12:7-9</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Creatures of high intelligence are not instructed by those of low intelligence, but rather the lesser is instructed by the greater. The fact that man can apply to his inventions the knowledge he gains from studying dumb creatures indicates that he is learning from the handiwork of a superior Intelligence. His inventive works can carry the label “Made by man,” but the things in nature that instruct him can rightly bear the label “Made by God.”</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Be Taught by Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">What does Jehovah teach those who are willing to be taught by him? First of all: “I am Jehovah. That is my name.” Also that “Jehovah is in truth God. He is the living God and the King to time indefinite.” Jehovah further teaches us what his purposes are. His transcendent purpose regarding himself is to vindicate his name by clearing it of reproach, so “that people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the <span id="page341" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="341" data-before-text="341"></span>earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 42:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Jer. 10:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Ps. 83:18</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">His purpose regarding the earth and humankind is to have the earth “filled with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters are covering the very sea.” Also to “wipe out every tear from their eyes,” for “death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be any more.” In other words, Jehovah’s purpose for earth and man is an earth-wide Paradise. By means of the kingdom for which Jesus taught us to pray Jehovah God accomplishes both purposes.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 11:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Rev. 21:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Matt. 6:9, 10</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Jehovah also teaches us what is his will for us.

He let the Israelites go hungry in the wilderness and then fed them on miraculous manna ‘in order to make them know,’ that is, to teach them, “that not by. bread alone does man live.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Deut. 8:2, 3</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● If an unmarried pregnant woman who has made arrangements for the baby to be adopted comes to a knowledge of the truth before the baby is born, should she then feel obligated to keep the child in order to teach it the truth of God’s Word?</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One may argue that if the baby is adopted it will have more in a material way and will not have to bear the stigma of illegitimacy. But spiritual provisions are more vital than material things, and if necessary the social stigma can be avoided by the mother’s moving to another place.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Jehovah commands the parent: “These words that I am commanding you today must prove to be on your heart, and you must inculcate them in your son and speak of them when you sit in your house and when you walk on the road and when you lie down and when you get up.” How could a parent do this if she gives her baby away? How could she give it the right start in life: “Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it”?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956611/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deut. 6:6, 7</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956611/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 22:6</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">At the moment it might seem wise to unburden oneself of the problem by having the baby adopted, but it would be against the motherly instincts and as time passed there might be bitter regret because of this course. It would be against natural affection, although in these last days of critical, difficult times we are told that many persons would be “having no natural affection.” It would seem better to follow the principles of motherly affection and love for offspring and the keeping of a clear conscience. Even the principles of Christian faith would seem to be violated by failure to look after the child one brought into existence. Paul wrote: “Certainly if anyone does not provide for those who are his own, and especially for those who are members of his household, he has disowned the faith and is worse than a person without faith.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956611/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956611/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 5:8</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">So it would seem more courageous and more Christian to bear the burden of keeping and rearing the baby, facing whatever consequences that might follow, such as loss of reputation. Especially so now that the mother has come to a knowledge of the truth and is in position to teach the truth to her offspring and perhaps make it possible for it to live forever in a new world of righteousness. The person finding herself in this difficult position must make her own decision as to the course she will follow.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Mouth</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>The Palate.</strong> The <em>palate</em> is the roof of the mouth, which separates the mouth from the nasal cavities; it has a soft part that forms a curtain between the mouth and the pharynx. In the Scriptures, “palate” is, in some cases, used synonymously with “mouth.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003129/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Pr 8:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003129/32/1" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> Ho 8:1</a>, ftn.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Both Job and Elihu make a comparative use of the word when they liken the palate’s ability to discriminate taste to man’s judgment as to what is right and wise. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003129/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Job 12:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003129/33/1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 34:3</a>) That the palate has a function in tasting is not erroneous, as is sometimes claimed. This can be seen by observing the part played by the palate in swallowing. Food is pressed by the tongue against the palate and spread out as it moves back into the pharynx, which is a cone-shaped tube leading toward the stomach and connecting also with the nasal passages. This brings about better diffusion of the aroma of the food into the nasal passages, which greatly contributes to what is commonly called taste.</p>

Even without the words, you can often tell what kind of mood or spirit a piece is designed to produce, what kind of conduct it encourages. That was the case with the music that Moses heard on coming down from Mount Sinai and approaching the Israelite camp. As he said to Joshua: “It is not the sound of the singing over mighty performance [a victory song], and it is not the sound of the singing of defeat [a mournful singing]; it is the sound of other singing that I am hearing.” The singing actually reflected wild and idolatrous immoral activity.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101976087/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Exodus 32:15-19,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101976087/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 25</a>.</p>

Researchers studied older people to measure such qualities as “insight, sound judgment, perspective and the ability to weigh conflicting values and generate good problem-solving strategies.” According to <em>U.S.News &amp; World Report,</em> the study showed that “older people consistently outshine younger people on all measures of wisdom, offering more-thoughtful, sophisticated advice.” Studies also show that “although it often takes older people longer than youngsters to make a decision, it is usually a better one.” Thus, as the Bible book of Job suggests, age is, indeed, sage.</p>

The term “elder” of itself implies age, though it must be recognized that the emphasis is on spiritual, rather than physical, qualities. Age alone is not the determining factor; yet, even as Moses recognized, experience is certainly a valuable asset for men caring for serious responsibilities.

But the years of life represented by gray hairs generally give reason for expecting an increased measure of wisdom, even as Job said: “Is there not wisdom among the aged and understanding in length of days?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978886/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 12:12</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978886/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">12 verse 20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978886/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 32:6, 7</a>.) A young person may be willing, even eager, to serve and show promise for the future. But lack of experience in life can put him at a severe disadvantage when it comes to helping those older than himself with the serious problems of life. His words, however sincere, cannot be expected to carry the same weight as those of one with more years behind him.</p>

This is difficult for many young persons to accept.

It is not unusual for the young to think themselves <span id="page164" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="164" data-before-text="164"></span>wiser than the old. A king of Israel made this blunder, with disastrous results. When 41-year-old Rehoboam succeeded his father Solomon as king, the people asked that their burdens be made lighter. Rehoboam consulted older men, who counseled gentleness and kindness. He then went to young men and they advised harsh measures. He took their advice. The result? Ten of the 12 tribes rebelled and Rehoboam was left with only about one sixth of his kingdom. The aged, not the young, gave the wise counsel. “Is there not wisdom among the aged and understanding in length of days?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101978012/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 12:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101978012/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 1 Kings 12:1-16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101978012/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 14:21</a>.</p>

Also, they have tails and stings like scorpions; and in their tails is their authority to hurt the men five months.” From this description we note that the remnant of Jehovah’s anointed witnesses were brought forth in 1919 for warfare, a spiritual warfare from that year till the actual outbreak of the “war of the great day of God the Almighty,” commonly called Armageddon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Rev. 16:14-16</a>) Hence they looked like horses, which in Bible times were used for warfare. “The horse <span id="page719" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="719" data-before-text="719"></span>is something prepared for the day of battle,” says <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Proverbs 21:31</a>.</p><p id="p97" data-pid="97" class="qu">28. What is denoted by the crowns on the locusts’ heads, their having hair like women, and their having breastplates like iron ones?</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[97]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="28"><sup>28</sup></span> The symbolic locusts are royal warriors, as denoted by the goldlike crowns upon the locusts’ heads; for by being anointed with God’s spirit they have been made “joint heirs with Christ” and have been assigned a crown and throne in Christ’s kingdom of a thousand years. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Rom. 8:16, 17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Luke 22:28-30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/29/2" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> Rev. 3:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/29/3" data-bid="30-4" class="b"> 21</a>) During this time of spiritual warfare with Christendom these symbolic locusts are mere humans gifted with intelligence, as denoted by their “men’s faces.” Like Hebrew warriors in the field who did not have barbershop facilities, they let their head of hair grow to the length of women’s hair, so that they had a hairy mane and looked like lions for fierceness. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 Chron. 12:8</a>) Appropriately, then, “their teeth were as those of lions,” that could devour solid food, flesh, like the strong judgment message of God’s vengeance against Christendom. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Heb. 5:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/31/1" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 3:1, 2</a>) Their hearts, the organs of love for God and for his righteousness, hence hearts that know no fear but are courageous, are well protected as if by impenetrable breastplates of iron. So they never lose love and courage.</p><p id="p98" data-pid="98" class="qu">29. How do the symbolic locusts make a terrific noise, and for how long are they authorized to torment men not having the seal?</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[98]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="29"><sup>29</sup></span> Like a huge swarm of winged locusts that are capable of flying for a thousand miles or more, they unitedly make a noise that sounds like a squadron of war chariots rattling along to the beat of many horses’ hoofs into the battle. It is a terrific sound. The symbolic locusts shout as from the house-tops and let God’s judgment message be heard over a vast distance in the territory that they cover. Fear of the enemy does not soften down their message to a mere whisper. Jehovah’s war declaration must be sounded loudly. He is responsible for the hurting of feelings that the message causes to the ones who are stung by it. For the brief time interval till Armageddon breaks out, “five months,” as it were, the symbolic locusts must use their scorpion-like tails, God’s Word, “the sword of the spirit,” and must strike men against whom God’s judgment is directed. It is not God’s time to spare feelings. His enemies have to be exposed and notified of coming judgment.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Eph. 6:17</a>.</p><p id="p99" data-pid="99" class="qu">30. Who is king over the symbolic locusts, and what do his names in Hebrew and Greek mean and show?</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[99]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"><sup>30</sup></span> The symbolic locusts must follow their King, Jesus Christ. John says of them: “They have over them a king, the angel of the abyss. In Hebrew his name is Abadʹdon, but in Greek he has the name Apollyon.” The resurrected heavenly Jesus Christ is the “angel of the abyss,” for he holds the “keys of death and of Haʹdes.” In the finale of the universal war of Armageddon he will bind and pitch Satan the Devil and his spirit demons into the abyss of deathlike inactivity. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Rev. 20:1-3</a>) When Jesus was on earth as a man, he was a Hebrew, and now in his capacity as Jehovah’s royal Executioner he is called by the Hebrew name Abadʹdon, which means Destruction. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Job 26:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 28:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/34/2" data-bid="35-3" class="b"> 31:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/34/3" data-bid="35-4" class="b"> 12:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/34/4" data-bid="35-5" class="b"> 14:19</a>) In the Greek in which the inspired Christian Scriptures were written his similar title is Apollyon, which means Destroyer. This name clearly shows that he comes to the throne at God’s right hand to rule first in the midst of his enemies and to destroy them in execution of Jehovah’s righteous judgment, Jehovah’s judicial decision against them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Jas. 4:12</a>.</p><p id="p100" data-pid="100" class="qu">31. (a) How, like locusts, do the Witnesses move forward, and of what quality is this indicative? (b) What keeps them united?</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[100]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="31"><sup>31</sup></span> The symbolic locusts who must proclaim the judgment message before the judgment is executed in the “low plain of the decision” have Jesus Christ as their King, but he is invisible. They have no <span id="page720" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="720" data-before-text="720"></span>visible king any more than literal locusts have: “The locusts have no king, and yet they go forth all of them divided into groups.” For the reason that they move forward in groups or swarms, they are “instinctively wise,” although being among the “smallest” things on earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Prov. 30:24,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/36/1" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 27</a>) The symbolic locusts, the anointed witnesses of Jehovah, move forward united, grouped according to their local congregations. But this is not due to any locust instinct. It is due to the heavenly wisdom imparted by God’s spirit. Also, their following their heavenly King Jesus Christ as the Leader whom God had enthroned is what keeps them united in their attack upon the men not sealed. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Rev. 7:2-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/37/1" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> 9:4</a>) Willingly, obediently, they subject themselves to his command; and this is what may also be pictured by the fact that the symbolic locusts “had hair as women’s hair,” since a woman’s long hair naturally is a sign of her subjection, a sign of having authority on her head.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/38/1" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/38/2" data-bid="39-3" class="b"> Ps. 110:3</a>.</p>
