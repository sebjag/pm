Possibly feeling that he has failed in some way, he has the book of records, perhaps the royal diary, read to him. Discovering that Mordecai has gone unrewarded for uncovering an assassination plot, the king asks Haman to suggest an appropriate reward. Haman imagines himself the honored one and proposes an elaborate ceremony. But to his horror he is commanded to heap such honors upon Mordecai! Haman’s advisers take this as an omen of his downfall.</p>

That night while Haman was plotting mischief against Mordecai, King Ahasuerus went to bed but could not sleep. Drawing the conclusion that he had omitted something, was guilty of some delinquency, some failure, he had the book of records brought to him and asked his servants to read. They ran down the list to see if anything had failed to be done. “At length there was found written what Mordecai had reported concerning Bigthana and Teresh, two court officials of the king, <span id="page181" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="181" data-before-text="181"></span>doorkeepers, who had sought to lay hand on King Ahasuerus. Then the king said: ‘What honor and great thing has been done to Mordecai for this?’ To this the king’s attendants, his ministers, said: ‘Nothing has been done with him.’” The king determined at once to honor Mordecai.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971206/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Esther 6:1-3</a>.</p>

Therefore he advised the king according to his own ambitions: ‘Bring out the king’s own horse with a crown upon its head and the man who is to be honored is to be seated on the horse and the chief officer in the king’s realm is to take the horse and make this favored man ride in the public square of the city and proclaim aloud before him: “This is how it is done to the man in whose honor the king himself has taken a delight.”’ Confidently, Haman awaited the king’s reply, only to hear him say: “Quickly, take the apparel and the horse, just as you have said, and do that way to Mordecai the Jew who is sitting in the king’s gate.” Haman was completely crushed. But he could do nothing but comply. Failure to do so would have meant certain death. Thus, when Mordecai most needed to be remembered, Jehovah acted in his behalf for his protection and the saving of his life. Haman, by contrast, was obliged to admit that, not he, but this hated, despised Jew Mordecai was the one whom the king delighted to honor.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971206/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Esther 6:6-11</a>.</p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The hamstrings of a horse are the back tendons above the hock of the hind legs of the horse; the hock of the hind legs corresponding to the knee of the horse’s front legs. By cutting these tendons the horses were crippled and no longer able to serve war purposes, either for cavalry or to pull war chariots. This was the simplest way to put a horse out of the battle. Of course, after these horses were hamstrung, disabled, they would be put to death, <span id="page608" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="608" data-before-text="608"></span>destroyed, even as were the war chariots.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Concerning horses McClintock &amp; Strong’s <em>Cyclopædia</em> states: “The most striking feature in the Biblical notices of the horse is the exclusive use of it for military operations. In no instance is it referred to as employed for the purpose of ordinary locomotion or agriculture.” They were, however, used for affairs of state. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962729/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Esther 6:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962729/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 8:14</a>) They were especially associated with Egypt, as we note at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962729/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 31:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962729/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 3</a>: “Woe to those going down to Egypt for assistance, those who rely on mere horses, and who put their trust in war chariots, because they are numerous, and in steeds, because they are very mighty, but who have not looked to the Holy One of Israel and have not searched for Jehovah himself. The Egyptians, though, are earthling men, and not God; and their horses are flesh, and not spirit.” Similar unfavorable references appear at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962729/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 20:7 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962729/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Ps 33:17</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Concerning the king of Israel in particular, warning was given: “He should not increase horses for himself.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962729/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Deut. 17:16</a>) No doubt, among the reasons why Jehovah, by the requirements set out in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962729/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Leviticus 11</a>, showed that the horse was to be viewed as an unclean animal was so that the Jews would not be tempted to acquire horses for food and then use them for war purposes and place their trust in them. Joshua’s action was according to divine instructions that, in turn, were in line with this divine principle. He was the judge of Israel under the invisible King Jehovah God. In obeying the divine command to hamstring the forces of the enemy, he did not appropriate them to himself and thus increase horses for himself as the judge of Israel.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">All this, however, serves for more than historical interest, for it is included in “all the things that were written aforetime [which] were written for our instruction, that through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962729/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Rom. 15:4</a>) Joshua’s diligently complying with these instructions, doing “just as Jehovah had said to him,” pictures that Jehovah’s people of today do not rely upon the world’s means of carnal warfare. They renounce the carnal warfare of this world and beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears. This corresponds to the hamstringing of the war horses of the ancient Canaanites.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962729/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isa. 2:4</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"></p>

Therefore he advised the king according to his own ambitions: ‘Bring out the king’s own horse with a crown upon its head and the man who is to be honored is to be seated on the horse and the chief officer in the king’s realm is to take the horse and make this favored man ride in the public square of the city and proclaim aloud before him: “This is how it is done to the man in whose honor the king himself has taken a delight.”’ Confidently, Haman awaited the king’s reply, only to hear him say: “Quickly, take the apparel and the horse, just as you have said, and do that way to Mordecai the Jew who is sitting in the king’s gate.” Haman was completely crushed. But he could do nothing but comply. Failure to do so would have meant certain death. Thus, when Mordecai most needed to be remembered, Jehovah acted in his behalf for his protection and the saving of his life. Haman, by contrast, was obliged to admit that, not he, but this hated, despised Jew Mordecai was the one whom the king delighted to honor.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971206/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Esther 6:6-11</a>.</p>

For we have been sold, I and my people, to be annihilated, killed and destroyed. Now if we had been sold for mere men slaves and for mere maidservants, I should have kept silent. But the distress is not appropriate when with damage to the king.” The king was highly aroused. “‘Who is this, and just where is the one who has emboldened himself to do that way?’ Then Esther said: ‘The man, the adversary and enemy, is this bad Haman.’” The king, unable to contain his rage, withdrew to the garden of the palace to regain his composure. Haman, terrified at this turn of events, pleaded with Esther for his life because he knew that the king’s face was set against him. So intense were his pleas that he fell upon her couch beside her just as the king returned from the garden. Seeing this the king said: “‘Is there also to be a raping of the queen, with me in the house?’ The word itself went out of the king’s mouth, and Haman’s face they covered. Harbona, one of the court officials before the king, now said: ‘Also, there is the stake that Haman made for Mordecai, who had spoken good concerning the king, standing in Haman’s house​—fifty cubits high.’ At that the king said: ‘You men, hang him on it.’ And they proceeded to hang Haman on the stake that he had prepared for Mordecai; and the king’s rage itself subsided.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971206/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Esther 7:1-10</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">13.

When did those of the Esther class in modern times identify themselves according to the historical record? <span id="page183" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="183" data-before-text="183"></span>The best evidence is the identification that took place Sunday, July 26, 1931, at an assembly of Jehovah’s people in Columbus, Ohio. On that occasion they adopted a resolution by which they identified themselves, embracing the name “Jehovah’s witnesses.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971206/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Isa. 43:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971206/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 12</a>) A booklet containing this resolution was published and given a wide circulation. This identification also worked for the exposé of the clergy class. The hatred already manifested toward the true servants of God was now revealed in even stronger action and the Haman class now became identified even more positively as anti-God, determined to destroy God’s servants. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971206/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Matt. 23:29-36</a>) Jehovah’s people ran into opposition as never before in their history.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1971206/1">b</a> The fulfillment of Haman’s being hanged on the stake prepared for Mordecai does not need to wait until the destruction of Babylon the Great, for by these acts, from this time forward, the Haman class died in the sight of God and in the eyes of honest-hearted persons the world over. Additionally, Haman’s ten sons survived him to carry forward the picture to a further fulfillment.</p>

<strong>Highlights From the Book of Esther</strong><br/><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006162/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b"><strong>7:4</strong></a>​<strong>—How would an annihilation of the Jews bring “damage to the king”?</strong> By tactfully pointing out the possibility of selling the Jews as slaves, Esther brought to the fore the matter of damage to the king by their destruction. The 10,000 silver pieces that Haman had promised were far less profitable to the king’s treasury than the wealth that could have been generated if Haman had schemed to sell the Jews as slaves. The execution of the plot would also have meant the loss of the queen.</p>

But the destruction of an entire people would result in financial loss far greater than the 10,000 silver talents Haman had promised to pay. Success of the genocide plot would also result in the king’s losing his queen​—very personal damage indeed!</p>

For we have been sold, I and my people, to be annihilated, killed and destroyed. Now if we had been sold for mere men slaves and for mere maidservants, I should have kept silent.

Why, Queen Esther is Jewish, and annihilation has been decreed for her people! Ahasuerus wants to know who is responsible. Boldly, Esther says: “The man, the adversary and enemy, is this bad Haman.” The queen has been fair in having the now-terrified Amalekite present when exposing him. Courageously, Esther has indicted Haman as responsible for gross misrepresentation and has identified him as a treacherous schemer against the Persian monarch’s own interests. Enraged, the king goes into the palace garden. Frightened Haman, knowing he can expect no mercy from Ahasuerus, falls on the couch on which Esther has been reclining. He pleads for his very life. But Esther does not relent, for this would displease Jehovah, who has decreed the complete destruction of the Amalekites.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979205/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Esther 7:5-8</a>.</p>

Evidently the court officials covered his face, possibly to represent shamefulness or doom. Likely this was the first step taken in carrying out the death sentence.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204406/204/0">6/15/1950, pp. 190-191</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Haman’s “Pride Goes Before Destruction”</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span id="page190" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="190" data-before-text="190"></span>Of course, Haman could not carry out such an ambitious scheme of murder without official sanction and cooperation, neither could he reveal his own petty and personal motive for this malicious action. Being a superstitious pagan, he first sought the cooperation of his gods by having lots cast before him to determine the most auspicious time for the carrying out of his murderous conspiracy. Then he appeared before the king with this story:</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples throughout all the provinces of your kingdom, and their laws are different from every other people; neither do they observe the king’s laws; therefore it is not fitting to leave them alone. If it please the king, let it be prescribed that they be destroyed; and I will pay ten thousand talents [$18,000,000, at $1,800 a talent] into . . . the king’s treasuries.” What a grand-scale patriotic and unselfish gesture! Unsuspectingly, King Xerxes accepted it for just what it superficially seemed to be, and so authorized Haman to proceed against the Jews “as seems good to you”.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950443/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Esther 3:7-11</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Letters dictated by Haman and bearing the king’s seal were then sent on the 13th day of the first month (Nisan) to all the provinces in their respective languages “to wipe out, to slay, and to destroy all the Jews, both young and old, infants and women in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, . . . and to take the spoil of them as plunder”. Then the king and Haman sat down to drink wine and felicitate each other at the prospect.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950443/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Esther 3:12-15</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Not long thereafter Haman received an invitation to attend a royal banquet that Queen Esther had made for him and the king, after which “Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart. But when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, and he neither stood up nor moved for him, Haman was filled with wrath against Mordecai”. Coming home he related to his wife and friends “the glory of his riches and the multitude of his children and every instance where the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and the servants of the king . . . ‘Even Esther the queen . . . has permitted no man but me to come in with the king to the banquet she has prepared, and tomorrow also I am invited by her together with the king. Yet all this does not satisfy me so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950443/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Esther 6:5-13</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em>) Yes, Haman was a great man in his own estimation; but how little did he suspect as to why the queen had invited him!</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Haman’s wife and friends egged him on by suggesting that he have a gallows seventy-five feet high erected and then have Mordecai hanged thereon. This just suited his vanity and malice, and so he immediately had it built, and then hastened to the king for permission to hang Mordecai on it. But the king had other plans for Mordecai. During a sleepless night he had occasion to learn that that trusted servant had uncovered a plot on his life and that he had not been rewarded therefor. Seeing his grand vizier Haman standing in the outer court, the king bids him to enter and then poses the question to him: “What shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor?” Of course, conceited Haman thought, ‘whom could the king possibly want to honor more than me, and so, how would <em>I</em> like to be honored? Hm! Ah!’ Figuratively rubbing his hands in glee at the prospect, he expressed his sentiments: “For the man whom the king delights to honor, let royal garments be brought which the king has worn [nothing but the best for Haman!], and a horse which the king has ridden [no ordinary horse would do!], on the head of which a royal crown is set. [How Haman would have liked to be king himself!] Let the garments and the horse be delivered to one of the king’s most noble princes [no mere lackey or porter would do!], and let them clothe the man whom the king delights to honor and cause him to ride on horseback through the open square of the city, and proclaim before him, ‘Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.’” Haman already saw himself riding through the streets of the capital and could hardly wait for the king to tell him that he was the man to be so honored. Imagine, then, the fall of his haughty spirit as the king commands him as “one of the most noble of the princes” to do this signal honor to his worst enemy, even to Mordecai! The one for whom he had already built a gallows, in fact, had come to the king at that very time for the purpose of obtaining permission to hang Mordecai.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950443/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Esther 5:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950443/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 6:1-11</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Had Haman known what was further in store for him he might have spared himself this humiliation, but, having no inkling of that, there was nothing left for him to do but to obey the king’s command. Coming home, crestfallen and mourning, he got very little comfort from the ones who had influenced him to build those gallows just a few hours before. Now they said: “If Mordecai . . . be of the Jewish race, you . . . will surely fall before him.” And while they were yet speaking the king’s messenger arrived to hurry Haman to the banquet Queen Esther had prepared for him and the king.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950443/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Esther 6:12-14</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Picture the setting: King Xerxes, powerful world ruler, whose very whim was law; Queen Esther, loveliest woman of all the empire, decked in her most beautiful robes; and fawning Haman, vain, proud, and with a heart filled with malice—all enjoying a most sumptuous banquet where wine flowed freely. The king again asks his queen for her petition. Note the expression on Haman’s face as with amazement he hears the queen discuss his plot to destroy the Jews, and learns that she is a Jewess; see it blanche with stark fear and guilt as the king in great rage asks, “Who is he, and where is he who dares presume in his heart to do so?” and as Esther, pointing to Haman, replies, “An adversary and an enemy, this wicked Haman.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950443/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Esther 7:3-6</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Terrified, Haman pleads with Esther for his life, and falls on her couch while doing so. The king, who in rage had gone out to the garden, upon returning sees Haman on the couch with Esther. He demands: “Will he violate the queen in my presence in the house?” At this his servants cover Haman’s face (as was the custom with condemned criminals). Being advised of the gallows 75 feet high that Haman had built for Mordecai, the king ordered Haman to be hanged on it. “So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king’s wrath abated.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950443/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Esther 7:7-10</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Pride had led Haman to his downfall and destruction, and a disgraceful one at that. And not only to his own end, but by a subsequent decree counter to the decree that he had engineered, also to the downfall and destruction of <span id="page191" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="191" data-before-text="191"></span>some 75,000 enemies of the Jews, which enemies either shared his malice for the Jews or sought to profit by their destruction. His own ten sons were hanged on the gallows and his estate was turned over to Esther and, by her, to Mordecai. It was not God’s will that his typical name-people, the Jews, should be wiped out, and therefore he maneuvered the destruction of their would-be destroyers. The record leaves no doubt about this, even though it directly omits all references to God.</p>

<strong>Persia, Persians</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><strong>Religion and Law.</strong> The Persian rulers, while as capable of cruelty as the Semitic kings of Assyria and Babylonia, initially at least seem to have endeavored to manifest a degree of fairness and legality in their dealings with the conquered peoples. <span id="page613" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="613" data-before-text="613"></span>Their religion apparently contained some concept of ethics. Following their chief god Ahura Mazda, a principal deity was Mithra, who became known not only as a god of war but also as the god of contracts, the one whose eyes and ears were ever alert to spy out any violator of an agreement. (See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003447/4">GODS AND GODDESSES</a>.) Greek historian Herodotus (I, 136, 138) wrote of the Persians: “They educate their boys from five to twenty years old, and teach them three things only, riding and archery and truthtelling. . . . They hold lying to be foulest of all.” While the history of the Persian rulers shows them to be not above duplicity and intrigue, yet a basic adherence to some tribal creed of ‘keeping one’s word’ may be reflected in their insistence on the inviolability of “the law of the Medes and the Persians.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003447/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Da 6:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003447/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003447/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Es 1:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003447/9/3" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> 8:8</a>) Thus, when Cyrus’ decree was found some 18 years after its date of issuance, King Darius recognized the legality of the Jews’ position as regards the building of the temple and gave orders that full cooperation be extended to them.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003447/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ezr 6:1-12</a>.</p>

Today we do not have the spirit speaking audibly to us or the apostles bodily present with us to lay their hands upon us to impart the miraculous gifts of the spirit, and there is no professed Christian on earth today that can Scripturally prove he is even an apostolic successor with such power. Those miraculous gifts of the spirit have passed away as well as the apostolic channels. That is why Paul classed the “laying on of the hands” as part of the “elementary doctrine about the Christ.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955809/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Heb. 6:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955809/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Acts 8:18</a> and; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955809/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:8-11</a>, <em>NW</em>) The formality of literally laying hands upon a person at his appointment has no special power today.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">18.

That appointment may be delivered verbally or by letter, even by a formal appointment letter. What matters here is that the appointment comes from the recognized governing body, and so the signature of the appointment letter or form must show that it comes from such authoritative body. The signature’s being handwritten or stamped does not alter the matter or weaken or void the appointment. If the stamp is that of the governing body and is imprinted by the one who has the authority to use that stamp, then the appointment is authoritative and is binding.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">19, 20. What ancient examples of such practice are described in the Bible?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> This is true even though rubber-stamping an appointment letter or form may not be so ceremonial or impressive-looking as a literal formalistic laying of men’s hands upon the head of an appointed person. Stamping an official letter is good Bible practice.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> When Queen Jezebel wanted to issue instructions to the older men of Jezreel, what did she do? Have King Ahab sign instruction letters? Listen: “She wrote letters in Aʹhab’s name and sealed them with his seal and sent the letters to the older men and the nobles that were in his city dwelling with Naʹboth.” The older men and nobles recognized the stamped-in seal and carried out the instructions that apparently came from the king. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955809/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">1 Ki. 21:8-11</a>, <em>NW</em>) The value and power of an authoritative stamp or seal King Ahasuerus showed when he said to Esther his queen and to Mordecai his prime minister: “You yourselves write in behalf of the Jews according to what is good in your own eyes in the king’s name and seal [it] with the king’s signet ring, for a writing that is written in the king’s name and sealed with the king’s signet ring it is not possible to undo.” Prime Minister Mordecai did accordingly: “He proceeded to write in the name of King A·has·u·eʹrus and do the sealing with the king’s signet ring and send written documents by the hand of the couriers.” In the face of that uniform stamp the governors of all of Persia’s provinces and also the Jews recognized the binding force of those written documents and they acted as instructed in them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955809/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Esther 8:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955809/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 10</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">21. Why is the Watch Tower Society’s method of indicating servants’ appointments for congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses not lacking in value?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> So let no one undervalue the power of a properly stamped letter; the stamp gives it weight and authority. Now one form letter with such true, official stamp may appoint more than one servant of a congregation, but the duties assigned to any person appointed determine the degree of responsibility of that appointed person, <span id="page668" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="668" data-before-text="668"></span>whether he has more responsibilities than other servants. What else the letter may say or whom else the same letter may appoint to a different service does not take away from that servant’s special position. So stamped appointment letters (form letters in many cases) are used by the Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society and its many branches today as a convenient way of making appointments of servants for more than 14,000 congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the earth. In all such congregations the members recognize the stamp and accept the appointment. Who, then, has a right to question the power of the ordination or appointment? You may be sure that all such special servants put in office by these stamped appointment letters the Society’s governing body keeps its hands on, not literally, but to back them up, support and sustain them or to remove them in the general interests of the work.</p>

<strong>Cush</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Though Cushites were to be found in Arabia, the name “Cush” as used in the Bible in most cases clearly refers to a region in Africa and, where the relationship is obvious, translators simply render “Cush” as “Ethiopia.” It is regularly associated with Egypt (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isa. 20:3-5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 43:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/15/2" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> Jer. 46:7-9</a>) and also with Libya.

Cush thus embraced a more extensive and generally more southern area than that included in present-day <span id="page404" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="404" data-before-text="404"></span>Ethiopia. The “rivers of Ethiopia [Cush]” are suggested to have been the Blue and White Nile Rivers, which have their junction at Khartoum, and also the Atbara River, which joins the Nile S of the fifth cataract.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Zeph. 3:10</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The “Arabs that were by the side of the Ethiopians [<em>Ku·shim</em>ʹ]” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Chron. 21:16</a>) likely were those Arab tribes occupying the SW coast of the Arabian Peninsula and thus facing Africa across the Red Sea.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Much of the land of Cush was evidently arid desert country. The “region of the rivers of Ethiopia” is described as the “land of the whirring insects with wings” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Isa. 18:1</a>), perhaps referring to the locusts that swarm in Ethiopia and Egypt, while some suggest the mosquitoes, and others point out that the Hebrew word for “whirring” (<em>ts<sup>e</sup>la·tsal</em>ʹ) resembles in sound the name given to the tsetse fly (<em>tsaltsalya</em>) by the Galla tribes (a Hamitic people living in modern Ethiopia). Ivory, ebony, gold, precious stones, iron and aromatics were products of the land, and Biblical mention is made of the “merchants of Ethiopia” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Isa. 45:14</a>) and the “topaz of Cush.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Job 28:19</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>LATER HISTORY</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">At about the time of the exodus of Israel from Egypt, Cush or Ethiopia had come under Egyptian domination and continued thus for some five hundred years. A viceroy administering this domain under the Egyptian Pharaoh was known by the title “King’s Son of Kush.” Evidently toward the close of the second millennium B.C.E. Ethiopia freed itself from Egypt’s control. The Ethiopian capital was thereafter located first at Napata, near the fourth cataract, and later at Meroe, about 130 miles (209 kilometers) N-NE of Khartoum.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Ethiopian warriors formed part of Pharaoh Shishak’s forces that attacked Judah in the fifth year of Rehoboam (993-992 B.C.E.).

This king came up against the forces of Sennacherib during their invasion of Judah (c. 732 B.C.E.), but, according to the Assyrian inscriptions, was defeated at Elteke.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">2 Ki. 19:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Isa. 37:8, 9</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Assyrian Emperors Esar-haddon and Ashurbanipal invaded Egypt during their respective reigns, and the destruction of Thebes in Upper Egypt (called No-amon at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011061/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Nahum 3:8-10</a>) by Ashurbanipal (c. 684 B.C.E.) completely subjugated Egypt and also ended Ethiopian dominance of the Nile valley.

These satraps were granted a measure of autonomy in the government of the satrapy, including the administration of judicial and financial affairs within their territory.

Today we do not have the spirit speaking audibly to us or the apostles bodily present with us to lay their hands upon us to impart the miraculous gifts of the spirit, and there is no professed Christian on earth today that can Scripturally prove he is even an apostolic successor with such power. Those miraculous gifts of the spirit have passed away as well as the apostolic channels. That is why Paul classed the “laying on of the hands” as part of the “elementary doctrine about the Christ.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955809/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Heb. 6:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955809/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Acts 8:18</a> and; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955809/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:8-11</a>, <em>NW</em>) The formality of literally laying hands upon a person at his appointment has no special power today.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">18.

That appointment may be delivered verbally or by letter, even by a formal appointment letter. What matters here is that the appointment comes from the recognized governing body, and so the signature of the appointment letter or form must show that it comes from such authoritative body. The signature’s being handwritten or stamped does not alter the matter or weaken or void the appointment. If the stamp is that of the governing body and is imprinted by the one who has the authority to use that stamp, then the appointment is authoritative and is binding.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">19, 20.

Have King Ahab sign instruction letters? Listen: “She wrote letters in Aʹhab’s name and sealed them with his seal and sent the letters to the older men and the nobles that were in his city dwelling with Naʹboth.” The older men and nobles recognized the stamped-in seal and carried out the instructions that apparently came from the king. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955809/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">1 Ki. 21:8-11</a>, <em>NW</em>) The value and power of an authoritative stamp or seal King Ahasuerus showed when he said to Esther his queen and to Mordecai his prime minister: “You yourselves write in behalf of the Jews according to what is good in your own eyes in the king’s name and seal [it] with the king’s signet ring, for a writing that is written in the king’s name and sealed with the king’s signet ring it is not possible to undo.” Prime Minister Mordecai did accordingly: “He proceeded to write in the name of King A·has·u·eʹrus and do the sealing with the king’s signet ring and send written documents by the hand of the couriers.” In the face of that uniform stamp the governors of all of Persia’s provinces and also the Jews recognized the binding force of those written documents and they acted as instructed in them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955809/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Esther 8:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955809/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 10</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">21.

What else the letter may say or whom else the same letter may appoint to a different service does not take away from that servant’s special position. So stamped appointment letters (form letters in many cases) are used by the Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society and its many branches today as a convenient way of making appointments of servants for more than 14,000 congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the earth. In all such congregations the members recognize the stamp and accept the appointment. Who, then, has a right to question the power of the ordination or appointment? You may be sure that all such special servants put in office by these stamped appointment letters the Society’s governing body keeps its hands on, not literally, but to back them up, support and sustain them or to remove them in the general interests of the work.</p>

<strong>Persia, Persians</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The Persian rulers, while as capable of cruelty as the Semitic kings of Assyria and Babylonia, initially at least seem to have endeavored to manifest a degree of fairness and legality in their dealings with the conquered peoples. Their religion apparently contained some concept of ethics. Following their chief god <span id="page1294" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1294" data-before-text="1294"></span>Ahura Mazda, a principal deity was Mithra, who became known, not only as a god of war, but also as the god of contracts, the one whose eyes and ears were ever alert to spy out any violator of an agreement. (See GODS AND GODDESSES.) Greek historian Herodotus wrote of the Persians: “Beginning from the age of five years to twenty, they instruct their sons in three things only—to ride, to use the bow, and to speak truth. . . . To tell a lie is considered by them the greatest disgrace.” (Book I, pars. 136-138) While the history of the Persian rulers shows them to be not above duplicity and intrigue, yet a basic adherence to some tribal creed of ‘keeping one’s word’ may be reflected in their insistence on the inviolability of the “law of the Medes and the Persians.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Dan. 6:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Esther 1:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/8/3" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> 8:8</a>) Thus, when Cyrus’ decree was found some seventeen years after its date of issuance, King Darius recognized the legality of the Jews’ position as regards the building of the temple and gave orders that full cooperation be extended to them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ezra 6:1-12</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Considerable administrative ability is evidenced in the Persian imperial organization.

His son Cambyses II succeeded him to the throne and was successful in conquering Egypt. Though not referred to by the name Cambyses in the Bible, he is evidently the “Ahasuerus” to whom the opposers of the temple work sent accusations against the Jews, as stated at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ezra 4:6</a>. Daniel, who had prospered “in the kingdom of Darius [the Mede] and in the kingdom of Cyrus the Persian,” was likely dead by this time, having been taken captive to Babylon in 617 B.C.E.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Dan. 6:28</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The circumstances involving the end of Cambyses’ rule are confused. One account, set forth by Darius the Great in his Behistun Inscription, and recounted by Herodotus and others with certain variations, is that Cambyses had his brother Bardiya (called Smerdis by Herodotus) secretly put to death. Then, during Cambyses’ absence in Egypt, a Magian named Gaumata, posing as Bardiya (Smerdis), usurped the throne and was able to gain recognition as king. Cambyses, while returning from Egypt, either became sick and died or committed suicide, thereby leaving the usurper secure on the throne. The other version, favored by some historians, is that Bardiya had not been killed and that he, not some impostor, usurped the throne during Cambyses’ absence.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Whatever the case, the reign of Cambyses is considered as having ended in 522 B.C.E. and the rule that followed is believed to have lasted less than one year, ending also in 522 B.C.E. with the assassination of the usurper (either Bardiya or Gaumata the pseudo-Smerdis). Yet, during this brief rule it appears that a second charge against the Jews was directed to the Persian throne, the king then being designated in the Bible as “Artaxerxes” (perhaps a throne name or title), and this time the accusations were successful in producing a royal ban against further construction on the temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ezra 4:7-23</a>) The temple work then lay idle “until the second year of the reign of Darius the king of Persia.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ezra 4:24</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong><em>Darius the Great</em></strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Darius I (called Darius Hystaspis, or, Darius the Great) evidently engineered or instigated the slaying of the one occupying the Persian throne. His father Hystaspes appears to have held the position of a satrap in the empire and was of the same Achaemenian family as Cyrus, though of a different branch. Darius does not seem to have gained recognition as king until 521 B.C.E., the first part of his rule being marked by violent revolt throughout the empire, requiring several military campaigns to effect submission. Typical of the treatment dispensed to the rebel leaders was that given to Fravartish (Phraortes), who headed the revolt in Media. When finally captured, his nose, ears and tongue were cut off, his eyes put out and he was then put on public exhibition before being impaled.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">During Darius’ rule the temple work at Jerusalem was again renewed with royal approval and the temple was completed during his sixth year of rule (probably early in 515 B.C.E.). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ezra 6:1-15</a>) Darius’ reign was one of imperial reorganization and expansion. He reconquered rebellious Egypt, subdued Libya, and extended Persian dominion as far E as India and as far W as Thrace and Macedonia. At least by this time the Persian rulers had fulfilled the prophetic symbolisms of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Daniel 7:5 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 8:4</a>, where, under the symbols of a bear and also a ram, the Medo-Persian Empire is represented as seizing territories in three principal directions: to the N (as Assyria and Babylon), the W (Asia Minor and Thrace) and the S (Egypt). In a punitive campaign against Greece, however, Darius’ forces suffered defeat at Marathon in 490 B.C.E. Darius died a few years later (486 B.C.E.) before being able to avenge this defeat.—See DARIUS No. 2.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong><em>Xerxes</em></strong></p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Xerxes, Darius’ son, succeeded to the throne. He is evidently the king called “Ahasuerus” in the book of Esther. His actions also fit the description of the fourth Persian king who would “rouse up everything against the kingdom of Greece.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Dan. 11:2</a>) Endeavoring to retaliate for the Persian defeat at Marathon, Xerxes launched massive forces against the Greek mainland in 480 B.C.E. but suffered crushing defeats in both naval and land battles at Salamis, Thermopylae, and Plataea. While Xerxes is represented by some modern historians as a “weakling,” it appears that their judgment is based on the writings of the Greeks, who may well have been strongly prejudiced against Xerxes due to his military activity against their homeland. His reign was marked by certain administrative reforms and the completion of much of the construction work his father had initiated at Persepolis.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Esther 10:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The Greek stories of the end of Xerxes’ reign revolve around marital difficulties, disorders in the harem, and a supposed dominance of Xerxes by certain of his courtiers. These traditional accounts may reflect, though in a very confused and twisted way, some of the basic facts of the book of Esther, including the deposing of Queen Vashti and her replacement by Esther, and also the ascension of Mordecai to a position of great authority in the realm. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Esther 2:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 10:3</a>) According to the secular accounts, Xerxes was assassinated by one of his courtiers. While most secular authorities present 466/465 B.C.E. <span id="page1295" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1295" data-before-text="1295"></span>as the date of his death, thereby giving him a rule of some twenty-one years, an earlier date of 475/474 B.C.E. accords with the Bible record and has creditable testimony in its favor from certain of the ancient secular historians.—See ARTAXERXES No. 3.</p>

<strong>A Change from Mourning to a Good Day</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> Now Mordecai was promoted and was given the king’s signet ring, which had been <span id="page184" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="184" data-before-text="184"></span>removed from the finger of Haman before he was hanged. The fulfillment is in harmony with the prophecy of Jesus when he said: “This is why I say to you [that is, to the clergy of his day], The kingdom of God will be taken from you and be given to a nation producing its fruits.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971206/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matt. 21:43</a>) This has indeed been a dramatic reversal that has taken place in our day. But something else needed to be done. Though Mordecai’s personal life had been saved and he had been exalted, Haman’s ten sons were still alive and there still stood the decree for the extermination of all the Jews throughout the empire on Adar 13. Mordecai realized that there was a way out for the Jews, one that Haman’s decree had not allowed for. This was authority for Jehovah’s people to gather together and fight back in self-defense. Now the Jews could take the initiative against those who would destroy them and destroy the malicious enemy instead. To this provision the king agreed and the decree was sealed with his ring and copies were sent to all 127 jurisdictional districts.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971206/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Esther 8:1-14</a>.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">16.

Now, instead of great mourning among the Jews, and fasting and weeping and wailing, they began to rejoice and to gather together and unite themselves for their stand against their enemies. Furthermore, the fear of the Jews fell upon the peoples of the land and many began to declare themselves Jews. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971206/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Esther 8:15-17</a>) This part of the drama had a dramatic fulfillment during the critical decade in the 1930’s. Realizing they were entitled to take all peaceful, law-conforming measures for the protection of their lives, God’s servants proceeded to appeal to the courts and the governments in behalf of their God-given work of finding those honestly disposed toward Jehovah and his people. Further steps of unification were taken and the theocratic structure of the organization came to its full realization by 1938. God’s people were now fully united and ready when the time for the antitypical fulfillment of Adar 13 should arrive.<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1971206/2">c</a></p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">17.

All the evidence points to the conclusion that the enemies of God’s people determined to use that war situation with its patriotism, its nationalism, its bias, its false accusations of Communism on the one hand and Nazism on the other in order to get Jehovah’s witnesses and destroy them. A global attack shaped up that appeared as though it might completely blot out the worldwide preaching of the Mordecai and Esther classes and their companions who had now begun to join with them.<a id="footnotesource4" data-fnid="4" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1971206/3">d</a> It could have been a bleak day indeed, one of mourning, but these faithful servants of God did not take this concerted action lying down. During this time represented by Adar 13 Jehovah’s witnesses fought as they have never fought before. They made a spiritual fight to preserve their spiritual lives all around the world, fighting from a centralized headquarters, presenting an organized front against the enemy. There were casualties, but there was no fighting with carnal weapons by Jehovah’s people.

Along with them, 500 of God’s enemies were slain in Shushan and 75,000 throughout the rest of the realm. On Adar 14 the fighting was continued in Shushan the castle and 300 more enemies of the Jews were put to death, whereas in the outlying districts the Jews were celebrating their victory.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971206/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Esther 9:1-19</a>.</p>

In the fifth century B.C. the Persian Empire was the world power. It was ruled over by Ahasuerus, who is commonly known in history as Xerxes. God’s people were in captivity and scattered throughout that world. The wicked prime minister, Haman, sought to destroy all of God’s people throughout the empire. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954883/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Esther 3:6</a>) He tricked the king into signing an unchangeable decree of death for them. Jehovah then used the king’s new wife, Esther. At the instance of Mordecai she intervened. A request was made for relief from the death sentence that had been ordered by the king. The king granted Esther’s request. He did not change the decree, but he ordered that all the Jews in each of the provinces and in every city should stand and fight for their lives.

In the Roman Empire there were stations placed every few kilometers for the couriers where 40 horses were constantly kept. Roman couriers could travel about 160 km (100 mi) a day, a considerable speed in those times. With this system of post-horses, royal messages could be dispatched to the ends of an empire in a relatively short period of time.</p>

<strong>Persia, Persians</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Considerable administrative ability is evidenced in the Persian imperial organization.

These satraps were granted a measure of autonomy in the government of the satrapy, including the administration of judicial and financial affairs within their territory. (See <a class="it" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003447/5">SATRAP</a>.) Within the satrapy there appear to have been subordinate governors of jurisdictional districts (numbering 127 in King Ahasuerus’ day), and within the jurisdictional districts there were princes of the particular peoples composing the district’s population.

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The hamstrings of a horse are the back tendons above the hock of the hind legs of the horse; the hock of the hind legs corresponding to the knee of the horse’s front legs. By cutting these tendons the horses were crippled and no longer able to serve war purposes, either for cavalry or to pull war chariots. This was the simplest way to put a horse out of the battle. Of course, after these horses were hamstrung, disabled, they would be put to death, <span id="page608" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="608" data-before-text="608"></span>destroyed, even as were the war chariots.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Concerning horses McClintock &amp; Strong’s <em>Cyclopædia</em> states: “The most striking feature in the Biblical notices of the horse is the exclusive use of it for military operations.

In obeying the divine command to hamstring the forces of the enemy, he did not appropriate them to himself and thus increase horses for himself as the judge of Israel.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">All this, however, serves for more than historical interest, for it is included in “all the things that were written aforetime [which] were written for our instruction, that through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962729/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Rom. 15:4</a>) Joshua’s diligently complying with these instructions, doing “just as Jehovah had said to him,” pictures that Jehovah’s people of today do not rely upon the world’s means of carnal warfare. They renounce the carnal warfare of this world and beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears. This corresponds to the hamstringing of the war horses of the ancient Canaanites.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962729/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isa. 2:4</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Persia, Persians</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The Persian rulers, while as capable of cruelty as the Semitic kings of Assyria and Babylonia, initially at least seem to have endeavored to manifest a degree of fairness and legality in their dealings with the conquered peoples. Their religion apparently contained some concept of ethics. Following their chief god <span id="page1294" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1294" data-before-text="1294"></span>Ahura Mazda, a principal deity was Mithra, who became known, not only as a god of war, but also as the god of contracts, the one whose eyes and ears were ever alert to spy out any violator of an agreement. (See GODS AND GODDESSES.) Greek historian Herodotus wrote of the Persians: “Beginning from the age of five years to twenty, they instruct their sons in three things only—to ride, to use the bow, and to speak truth. . . . To tell a lie is considered by them the greatest disgrace.” (Book I, pars. 136-138) While the history of the Persian rulers shows them to be not above duplicity and intrigue, yet a basic adherence to some tribal creed of ‘keeping one’s word’ may be reflected in their insistence on the inviolability of the “law of the Medes and the Persians.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Dan. 6:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Esther 1:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/8/3" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> 8:8</a>) Thus, when Cyrus’ decree was found some seventeen years after its date of issuance, King Darius recognized the legality of the Jews’ position as regards the building of the temple and gave orders that full cooperation be extended to them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ezra 6:1-12</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Considerable administrative ability is evidenced in the Persian imperial organization. In addition to the king’s own privy council or advisory board, composed of “seven princes of Persia and Media” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Esther 1:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Ezra 7:14</a>), there were satraps appointed over major regions or countries, such as Media, Elam, Parthia, Babylonia, Assyria, Arabia, Armenia, Cappadocia, Sardis, Ionia, and, as the empire expanded, Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya, and others. These satraps were granted a measure of autonomy in the government of the satrapy, including the administration of judicial and financial affairs within their territory. (See SATRAP.) Within the satrapy there appear to have been subordinate governors of jurisdictional districts (numbering 127 in King Ahasuerus’ day), and within the jurisdictional districts there were princes of the particular peoples composing the district’s population. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ezra 8:36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Esther 3:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 8:9</a>) Likely to overcome the disadvantage of the imperial capital’s being somewhat in a corner of the far-flung domain, a speedy system of communication was developed by means of a royal mail service employing couriers riding post horses, thereby connecting the throne with all the jurisdictional districts. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Esther 8:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 14</a>) Royal highways were maintained; one ran from Shushan all the way to Sardis in Asia Minor.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>FROM CYRUS’ DEATH TO NEHEMIAH’S GOVERNORSHIP</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The reign of Cyrus the Great ended in 530 B.C.E. due to his death while on a warring campaign. His son Cambyses II succeeded him to the throne and was successful in conquering Egypt. Though not referred to by the name Cambyses in the Bible, he is evidently the “Ahasuerus” to whom the opposers of the temple work sent accusations against the Jews, as stated at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ezra 4:6</a>. Daniel, who had prospered “in the kingdom of Darius [the Mede] and in the kingdom of Cyrus the Persian,” was likely dead by this time, having been taken captive to Babylon in 617 B.C.E.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Dan. 6:28</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The circumstances involving the end of Cambyses’ rule are confused. One account, set forth by Darius the Great in his Behistun Inscription, and recounted by Herodotus and others with certain variations, is that Cambyses had his brother Bardiya (called Smerdis by Herodotus) secretly put to death. Then, during Cambyses’ absence in Egypt, a Magian named Gaumata, posing as Bardiya (Smerdis), usurped the throne and was able to gain recognition as king. Cambyses, while returning from Egypt, either became sick and died or committed suicide, thereby leaving the usurper secure on the throne. The other version, favored by some historians, is that Bardiya had not been killed and that he, not some impostor, usurped the throne during Cambyses’ absence.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Whatever the case, the reign of Cambyses is considered as having ended in 522 B.C.E. and the rule that followed is believed to have lasted less than one year, ending also in 522 B.C.E. with the assassination of the usurper (either Bardiya or Gaumata the pseudo-Smerdis). Yet, during this brief rule it appears that a second charge against the Jews was directed to the Persian throne, the king then being designated in the Bible as “Artaxerxes” (perhaps a throne name or title), and this time the accusations were successful in producing a royal ban against further construction on the temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ezra 4:7-23</a>) The temple work then lay idle “until the second year of the reign of Darius the king of Persia.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ezra 4:24</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong><em>Darius the Great</em></strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Darius I (called Darius Hystaspis, or, Darius the Great) evidently engineered or instigated the slaying of the one occupying the Persian throne. His father Hystaspes appears to have held the position of a satrap in the empire and was of the same Achaemenian family as Cyrus, though of a different branch. Darius does not seem to have gained recognition as king until 521 B.C.E., the first part of his rule being marked by violent revolt throughout the empire, requiring several military campaigns to effect submission. Typical of the treatment dispensed to the rebel leaders was that given to Fravartish (Phraortes), who headed the revolt in Media. When finally captured, his nose, ears and tongue were cut off, his eyes put out and he was then put on public exhibition before being impaled.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">During Darius’ rule the temple work at Jerusalem was again renewed with royal approval and the temple was completed during his sixth year of rule (probably early in 515 B.C.E.). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ezra 6:1-15</a>) Darius’ reign was one of imperial reorganization and expansion. He reconquered rebellious Egypt, subdued Libya, and extended Persian dominion as far E as India and as far W as Thrace and Macedonia. At least by this time the Persian rulers had fulfilled the prophetic symbolisms of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Daniel 7:5 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 8:4</a>, where, under the symbols of a bear and also a ram, the Medo-Persian Empire is represented as seizing territories in three principal directions: to the N (as Assyria and Babylon), the W (Asia Minor and Thrace) and the S (Egypt). In a punitive campaign against Greece, however, Darius’ forces suffered defeat at Marathon in 490 B.C.E. Darius died a few years later (486 B.C.E.) before being able to avenge this defeat.—See DARIUS No. 2.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong><em>Xerxes</em></strong></p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Xerxes, Darius’ son, succeeded to the throne. He is evidently the king called “Ahasuerus” in the book of Esther. His actions also fit the description of the fourth Persian king who would “rouse up everything against the kingdom of Greece.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Dan. 11:2</a>) Endeavoring to retaliate for the Persian defeat at Marathon, Xerxes launched massive forces against the Greek mainland in 480 B.C.E. but suffered crushing defeats in both naval and land battles at Salamis, Thermopylae, and Plataea. While Xerxes is represented by some modern historians as a “weakling,” it appears that their judgment is based on the writings of the Greeks, who may well have been strongly prejudiced against Xerxes due to his military activity against their homeland. His reign was marked by certain administrative reforms and the completion of much of the construction work his father had initiated at Persepolis.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Esther 10:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The Greek stories of the end of Xerxes’ reign revolve around marital difficulties, disorders in the harem, and a supposed dominance of Xerxes by certain of his courtiers. These traditional accounts may reflect, though in a very confused and twisted way, some of the basic facts of the book of Esther, including the deposing of Queen Vashti and her replacement by Esther, and also the ascension of Mordecai to a position of great authority in the realm. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Esther 2:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 10:3</a>) According to the secular accounts, Xerxes was assassinated by one of his courtiers. While most secular authorities present 466/465 B.C.E. <span id="page1295" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1295" data-before-text="1295"></span>as the date of his death, thereby giving him a rule of some twenty-one years, an earlier date of 475/474 B.C.E. accords with the Bible record and has creditable testimony in its favor from certain of the ancient secular historians.—See ARTAXERXES No. 3.</p>

<strong>Dyes, Dyeing</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Purple dye was obtained from shellfish or mollusks such as the <em>Murex trunculus</em> and <em>Murex brandaris.</em> In the neck of these creatures there is a small gland containing but a single drop of fluid called the flower. Initially it has the appearance and consistency of cream, but upon exposure to air and light it gradually changes to a deep violet or reddish purple. These shellfish are found along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, and the shades of color acquired from them vary according to their location. The larger specimens were broken open individually, and the precious fluid was carefully removed from them, whereas the smaller ones were crushed in mortars. Since the amount of fluid acquired from each shellfish was quite small, accumulating a considerable amount was a costly process. Hence, this dye was expensive, and garments dyed purple became the mark of wealthy persons or those in high station.

<strong>Dust</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Causing foes to “lick the dust” means vanquishing them, effecting their complete subjection.

Unjustifiably enraged by certain words of Paul, a crowd in Jerusalem showed their animosity against him by “tossing dust into the air.” Through their emotional demonstration and their words they made their disapproval of Paul clear to the military commander.

The same principle is in operation in the fulfillment of a prophecy found in the book of Zechariah. It states: “Ten men out of all the languages of the nations will take hold, yes, they will actually take hold of the skirt of a man who is a Jew, saying: ‘We will go with you people, for we have heard that God is with you people.’”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006162/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Zechariah 8:23</a>.</p>

<strong>Divine Deliverance From Genocide</strong><br/><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">Jubilation breaks forth among the Jews! No longer helpless victims, they now have several months to organize their defense. Finally, Adar (February-March) 13th arrives. Some 75,000 who were ‘seeking their injury’ are killed by the Jews. Lest they forget that this victory was from Jehovah, Mordecai decrees that the yearly Festival of Purim be held on the 14th and 15th of Adar.</p>

<strong>A Change from Mourning to a Good Day</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> This caused a great change to take place. Now, instead of great mourning among the Jews, and fasting and weeping and wailing, they began to rejoice and to gather together and unite themselves for their stand against their enemies. Furthermore, the fear of the Jews fell upon the peoples of the land and many began to declare themselves Jews. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971206/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Esther 8:15-17</a>) This part of the drama had a dramatic fulfillment during the critical decade in the 1930’s. Realizing they were entitled to take all peaceful, law-conforming measures for the protection of their lives, God’s servants proceeded to appeal to the courts and the governments in behalf of their God-given work of finding those honestly disposed toward Jehovah and his people. Further steps of unification were taken and the theocratic structure of the organization came to its full realization by 1938. God’s people were now fully united and ready when the time for the antitypical fulfillment of Adar 13 should arrive.<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1971206/2">c</a></p>

<strong>Festivals of Praise to Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> Through the fearless action of Queen Esther, herself a Jewess, a counterlaw was issued granting the Jews the right to “stand for their souls, to annihilate and kill and destroy all . . . that were showing hostility to them, . . . on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, that is, the month of Adar.” Under the fine leadership of faithful Mordecai the Jews were preparing their defense. And when the day arrived, they were assisted not only by the Persian people but, according to the historic record, by “all the princes . . . and the satraps and the governors and the doers of the business that belonged to the king . . . for the dread of Mordecai had fallen upon them. . . . and there was an avenging of themselves upon their enemies and a killing among those hating them of seventy-five thousand.” In Shushan the Castle the fight extended into the next day, with a total of 810 of the enemy killed, including Haman’s ten sons. The Jews in the provinces and in Shushan banqueted on the fourteenth and fifteenth days respectively. Consequently, Mordecai put them under obligation to keep the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar in each and every year “as days of banqueting and rejoicing and sending of portions to one another and of gifts to the poor people.” The Jews were thereby reminded every <span id="page433" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="433" data-before-text="433"></span>year of their deliverance, and year by year they gave praise and honor to Jehovah, the God of deliverance.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967522/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Esther 8:9 to 9:22</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="ss"><strong>MODERN-DAY FULFILLMENT</strong></p><p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="qu">22.

Their extermination as witnesses for the Most High, Jehovah, had been decreed by the modern-day Haman class, the religious leaders of Christendom. Jesus Christ, exercising regal power over the entire earth since 1914 as Ahasuerus did over the Persian Empire, has permitted such vicious attempts upon the life of the remnant under all kinds of false accusations, for a severe test. But as the Persian king permitted the Jews to fight for their lives, so, too, Christ Jesus has allowed the remnant to stand for their lives as Jehovah’s witnesses against their enemies.</p><p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="qu">23. How have the remnant fought for their lives?</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> Would the religious clergy of Christendom, with the help of the political state, be able to kill the remnant as Jehovah’s witnesses, kill their work of preaching Jehovah’s kingdom? Never! As the Jews in Ahasuerus’ time, the Lord’s people have fought zealously for their lives and rights as preachers and witnesses, not with material weapons of destruction, but using all the legal means at their disposal, together with the “sword of the spirit, that is, God’s Word.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967522/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Eph. 6:13-17</a>) They have steadfastly continued preaching the good news of the established Kingdom. With their spiritual weapons and the use of all available legal means, not only have they preserved their spiritual lives as witnesses of Jehovah and the right of preaching his name world wide, but they have symbolically “killed” many attackers by killing the power and influence of their enemies, who were unable to kill their preaching work.</p><p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu">24. (a) What was pictured by the killing of the Jews’ enemies? (b) As in the type, who join with the remnant, assisting them?</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[64]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> The work of the remnant has killed the influence of false religion to such a degree that thousands of honest-hearted people have left its ranks and have taken sides with the remnant, just as it was in the days of Mordecai: “Many of the peoples of the land were declaring themselves Jews.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967522/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Esther 8:17</a>) There they had seen that the king’s favor had turned away from Haman to the Jews, even making provision for their preservation. Thus since 1931; and with special momentum since 1935, many people have been impressed as they have seen the evidence of God’s favor upon the small remnant of spiritual Jews. They have observed the fight of the remnant to save their lives as Jehovah’s Christian witnesses against the whole world. They have been awakened to a lively interest in the remnant’s firmly maintained fight for true worship and clean moral principles. Even some men of high worldly status, like the princes and governors of Mordecai’s day, have assisted the remnant in their fight with what official or judicial help they could lend. In the eyes of the remnant and the “great crowd” of people who have joined the remnant in preaching the good news of the Kingdom, the antitypical religious leaders are already without power and influence, they are dead, and it is only a matter of a short time until Jesus Christ, who holds regal power, will bring about the total extermination of all his enemies on earth in the battle of Armageddon. Until then, many more people will take their stand with the remnant, as pictured in the drama. Thus the anciently celebrated festival of Purim has an antitypical significance <span id="page434" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="434" data-before-text="434"></span>that gives Christians today the unfailing hope of God’s victory over all his enemies.</p>

<strong>Propitiatory Cover</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">As Jehovah instructed Moses, the craftsman Bezalel <span id="page1350" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1350" data-before-text="1350"></span>made a cover of pure gold for the sacred chest or ark of the covenant, two and one-half cubits (c. 44 inches; 111 centimeters) long and one and one-half cubits (c. 26 inches; 67 centimeters) wide. It was surmounted by two golden cherubs, one at each end of the cover, their wings spread upward, screening the cover. The cherubs’ faces were toward the cover. The Ark was placed in the Most Holy compartment of the Tabernacle.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013484/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex. 25:17-21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013484/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 37:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013484/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 6-9</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">On the day of atonement (<em>yohm hak·kip·pu·rimʹ,</em> meaning “day of the coverings or propitiations” [<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013484/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Lev. 23:27, 28</a>]), the high priest entered the Most Holy and spattered some of the bull’s blood before the cover (at its front or east side), and then did the same with the blood of the goat.
