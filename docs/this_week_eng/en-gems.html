<strong>What Did That Dream Mean?</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Unhappily, dreams have a habit of slipping away from us soon after we wake up, and we remember just the last one, if any. So we cannot tell anyone much about that full-length nocturnal movie! It is as recorded in the Bible book of Job: “Like a dream he [the wicked apostate] will fly off, and they will not find him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101981291/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 20:8</a>) For this reason, researchers will awaken the dreamer when the rapid movements of the eyeballs stop.</p>

<strong>Marriage</strong><br/><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb">‘Marry in the Lord’ is the apostle’s admonition, which is in harmony with the practice of ancient worshipers of God in marrying only those who were likewise true worshipers. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012845/73/0" data-bid="74-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:39</a>) However, the apostle gives counsel to those who are not married that they may be able to serve the Lord without distraction if they remain single. He says that, in view of the time, those who get married should live ‘as though they had no wives,’ in other words, that they should not devote themselves fully to the marital privileges and responsibilities, making it their whole life, as many do, but should seek and serve Kingdom interests, while not excluding their marriage responsibilities. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012845/74/0" data-bid="75-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:29-38</a>) As to younger widows in the congregation, Paul counsels that, rather than to <span id="page1117" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1117" data-before-text="1117"></span>be put on the list to be cared for on the basis of the expression that they intend to devote themselves exclusively to Christian ministerial activities, it is better for them to remarry. This is because, he says, their sexual impulses may induce them to go contrary to their expression of faith wherein they might accept the congregation’s financial support as hard workers, while at the same time trying to get a husband and becoming unoccupied and meddlers. They would thereby bring themselves under an unfavorable judgment. To marry, bear children and manage a household, while still maintaining the Christian faith, would effectively occupy them, protecting them against gossiping and talking of things they ought not. This would enable the congregation to relieve those who were actually widows and who qualified for such aid.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012845/75/0" data-bid="76-1" class="b">1 Tim. 5:9-16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012845/75/1" data-bid="76-2" class="b"> 2:15</a>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="ss"><strong>CELIBACY</strong></p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">The apostle Paul warns that one of the identifying features of the apostasy that was to come would be enforced celibacy, “forbidding to marry.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012845/76/0" data-bid="77-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012845/76/1" data-bid="77-2" class="b"> 3</a>) Some of the apostles were married.

According to the arrangement in Bible times, the requirement would consistently be that a marriage be legalized according to the laws of the land, and that marriages and births should be registered where such a provision is made by law. Since the “Caesar” governments exercise such control of marriage, the Christian would be obliged to apply to them for the legalizing of a marriage. And even if he should desire to use the adultery of his mate as Scriptural grounds for divorce, he could not properly consider the marriage legally dissolved until a divorce decree was granted by the government. A Christian who remarries without Scriptural and legal freedom, therefore, would be violating God’s laws.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012845/80/0" data-bid="81-1" class="b">Matt. 19:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012845/80/1" data-bid="81-2" class="b"> Rom. 13:1</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="ss"><strong>MARRIAGE AND THE RESURRECTION</strong></p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="sb">A group of Jesus’ opponents who did not believe in the resurrection asked Jesus a question that was calculated to embarrass him.
