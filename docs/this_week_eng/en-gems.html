(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019445/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 42:6</a>) Like Job, a person today who is enduring a stressful problem may give in to wild talk, saying things that he later regrets. How should we respond? Rather than being critical, we should be compassionate. Remember that Jehovah did not intend for any of us to have the problems and stresses we face today. So it is understandable if a faithful servant of Jehovah speaks thoughtlessly when under great stress. Even if he says inaccurate <span id="page23" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>things about Jehovah or about us, we should not quickly become angry at him or judge him for saying such things.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2019445/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Prov. 19:11</a>.</p>

Though a load of sand is a heavy burden, the vexation of a foolish person is even heavier to the one having to bear it.

<strong>Sanctuary</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The members of the Christian congregation, Christ’s body’ constitute a temple or sanctuary. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013739/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013739/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Eph. 2:21, 22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013739/17/2" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 1 Pet. 2:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013739/17/3" data-bid="18-4" class="b"> 9</a>) This provides a basis for understanding the words directed to the apostle John: “Get up and measure the temple sanctuary of God and the altar and those worshiping in it. But as for the courtyard that is outside the temple sanctuary, cast it clear out and do not measure it, because it has been given to the nations, and they will trample the holy city underfoot for forty-two months.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013739/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Rev. 11:1, 2</a>) The temple here referred to could not be the one at Jerusalem, for that structure had been <span id="page1446" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1446" data-before-text="1446"></span>destroyed nearly three decades earlier. Being earthly, the nations could only be “given” a courtyard that was likewise on earth. Since this courtyard is associated with God’s sanctuary, it could reasonably represent prospective members of the heavenly sanctuary, those still on earth. Whereas it would be impossible for the nations to trample upon a location in the heavens, they could trample upon persons who were in line to receive a heavenly inheritance as members of Christ’s body, persons who were due to become ‘pillars in the temple of God.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013739/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Rev. 3:12</a>) Similarly, Daniel’s prophecy regarding the throwing down of the established place of the sanctuary (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013739/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Dan. 8:11</a>) and the profaning of the sanctuary (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013739/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Dan. 11:31</a>) appears to point to events in connection with those in line for membership in God’s spiritual temple.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Marshmallow</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A perennial plant that is closely related to the hollyhock. The woody stems of the marshmallow (<em>Althaea officinalis</em>) measure up to 1.8 m (6 ft) in height. The plant’s large, wide leaves are notched and terminate in a sharp point. Both the stems and the leaves are covered with soft downy hair. The pale-pink, five-petal flowers are about 5 cm (2 in.) across. In times of famine, the marshmallow’s white carrotlike root has been used for food. The sole Scriptural reference to the marshmallow alludes to its tastelessness.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002916/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 6:6</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Hebrew term <em>chal·la·muthʹ,</em> found only at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002916/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 6:6</a>, has been variously rendered “egg” (<em>AS, KJ</em>), “purslain” (<em>AT</em>), and, as defined in a Hebrew and Aramaic lexicon by L. Koehler and W. Baumgartner, “marsh-mallow” (<em>Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros,</em> Leiden, 1958, p. 304).</p>

What is symbolized by salt?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[22]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>MOSAIC law required that sacrifices be seasoned with salt: “Every offering of your grain offering you will season with salt, and you must not allow the salt of the covenant of your God to be missing upon your grain offering. Along with every offering of yours you will present salt.” Why? Salt is a preservative and prevents putrefaction. To offer anything fermented was forbidden, and salt with the offering prevented this. Forestalling change by decay, salt assured permanence, and was used in conjunction with a covenant to show the unchangeableness of it, the permanence of it. Among ancient peoples it was a sign of friendship to eat salt together and denoted perpetual fidelity and loyalty. The one sacrificing communion offerings on Jehovah’s altar was considered as a partaker with Jehovah; so the use of salt with the sacrifices indicated partaking of salt with him, which symbolized perpetual loyalty.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956771/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Lev. 2:13</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="qu"> 2. What does it mean for Christians to season their word sacrifices with salt?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[23]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> Because the true followers of Jesus, by example and by preaching, would be an influence to preserve from putrefaction and moral decay, Jesus called them “the salt of the earth.” Salt is also mentioned in connection with their words of preaching: “Let your utterance be always with graciousness, seasoned with salt, so as to know how you ought to give an answer to each one.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956771/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 5:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956771/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Col. 4:6</a>, <em>NW</em>) Christians do not offer grain or meat sacrifices to Jehovah as the nation of Israel did, but they do offer a sacrifice of praise by the words of their lips, and these are likened to bulls and fruits. Just as Israel’s material sacrifices were to be accompanied by salt, so the Christian’s words, the symbolic bulls of his lips, are to be seasoned with salt. This means the utterances are to be pure in truth, to have a preserving effect upon both the speaker and the hearer, and to be loyal and faithful to Jehovah, not despising his name or making his table appear contemptible. The words offered are to be appetizing to lovers of righteousness. Salt is an appetizing condiment in the food of both man and beast: “Is a tasteless thing eaten without salt?” “The oxen and young asses that till the soil will feed on salted fodder.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956771/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 6:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956771/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Isa. 30:24</a>, <em>AT</em>) So the word sacrifices of Christians are to be seasoned with spiritual salt, not being tasteless, insipid and corrupt, but being appetizing, friendly, faithful and with preserving power.</p>

It is bounded on the E by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, on the S by the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden, and on the W by the Red Sea, while the Fertile Crescent of Mesopotamia, Syria and Palestine curves around its northern end. Surrounded as it is on three sides by water, in part it resembles a huge island and is commonly called by its people the “Island of the Arabs” (<em>Jazirat al-ʽarab</em>).</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">With an area of nearly 1,000,000 square miles (2,590,000 square kilometers), or the equivalent of about one-third the land surface of the continental United States, Arabia is the world’s largest peninsula. The western coastline stretches some 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) and, at its widest point, the peninsula is about 1,200 miles (1,930 kilometers) across.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The name “Arabia” is of Semitic origin and is believed to be drawn from a root word meaning “to be arid.” (Compare the “desert plain” [Heb., <em>ʽ</em>aravʹ; “Arabia,” <em>AV</em>] at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010330/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 21:13</a>.) The peninsula consists of a rocky tableland sloping eastward down toward the Persian Gulf from its backbone formed by the mountain range running parallel to the W coast. One peak in the SW corner reaches an altitude of over 12,000 feet (3,657.6 meters).</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Across the interior of the southern end of the peninsula lies the great desert known as al-Rabʽ al-Khali, the largest continuous stretch of sandy area on earth, known as the “Empty Quarter.” To the N of the Najd or central plateau is the smaller al-Nufud Desert region, which culminates in the Syrian Desert, a stony plateau extending from the Transjordanian area over to the Euphrates River. From the early centuries of the Common Era geographers described the sections of Arabia as <em>Arabia Petrea</em>, embracing the Sinai Peninsula, Edom, and Moab; <em>Arabia Deserta</em>, the Syrian Desert; and <em>Arabia Felix</em>, or South Arabia.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>WATER SOURCES GOVERN HUMAN AND ANIMAL LIFE</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The small streams found along the outer edges of the peninsula and in the high central plateau (or Najd) are not numerous and their flow is only during certain seasons. Job, who evidently lived in what is today the Syrian Desert region, describes the drying up of such “winter torrents.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010330/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 6:15-20</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Though so much of this vast tableland is arid, yet sufficient rainfall does occur along the western mountain range, the central plateau, and in the S to sustain a considerable population. Here and around the larger oases the “fellahin” or peasant farmers can produce crops of millet, wheat, barley and corn, and here are found date palms (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010330/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex. 15:27</a>) and fig trees. Acacia trees, producing the resinous gum known as gum arabic, and other balsamic and aromatic trees and plants formed a major part of the ancient Arabian economy, as they do to a lesser extent in modern times, being eclipsed today by the “black gold” of petroleum.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010330/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 2:12</a>; see BALSAM.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Even the al-Nufud Desert in the N at times receives enough winter rain to bring forth a growth of grass on which the camels and sheep of the roving Bedouins can feed. In large sections, however, the general scarcity of water allows only for a nomadic life dependent upon scattered oases, water holes and wells. Temperatures are extreme, reaching as much as 130° F.

(See WILDERNESS OF THE WANDERING.) As the Funk and Wagnalls’ <em>New Standard Bible Dictionary</em> (p. 58) comments: “It is possible that desert routes may have been practicable for large caravans or even armies which now can be traversed only by small companies.” The existence of many deep dry wadis or valleys, which were once riverbeds, gives evidence that at some time in the past there was sufficient rainfall to produce streams of water coursing through them. The disappearance of certain forms of animal life may be due in part to the decrease in the water supply.

<strong>Compensation</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">When items or goods were left with another for safekeeping and during this time were stolen, the thief, if found, had to make the usual double compensation. Things such as money, articles, and so forth, would not require special care, but only a safe place. In the case of a domestic animal kept for another, the one keeping the animal (bailee) was to exercise the same care that he did for his own flock. Such bailees were usually paid for food the <span id="page369" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="369" data-before-text="369"></span>animals needed, and sometimes they were probably paid also for the extra trouble of keeping the animals. If an animal died of itself, was torn by a wild beast or was taken by a band of marauders, the bailee was free from blame. The loss was beyond his control. This might happen to his own animals, but if it was stolen (by someone whom the bailee could have prevented, or through his negligence) the bailee was responsible and was required to make compensation.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011000/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ex. 22:7-13</a>; see <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011000/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Genesis 31:38-42</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">A man who borrowed an animal from another person for his own use had to compensate for any damages incurred.

<strong>Do You Have Trouble Sleeping?</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">What is the cause of insomnia? It might be any one of a hundred different things. It could be inherited, a genetic defect in which the brain fails to produce serotonin, a hormonelike substance. This substance is said to act like a “sleep juice” that enters the blood and causes the body to become sleepy. Severe pains, such as the Biblical patriarch Job had, might neutralize this “sleep juice,” for he tells of being “glutted with restlessness until morning.” <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101975163/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 7:4</a>.</p>

<strong>Weaving</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">On the loom the warp threads were usually separated into two sets, so that the woof thread would pass over one set when drawn across the warp in one direction and under that set when moved across it in the opposite way. For this, two “sheds,” or passages, were needed. In a simple horizontal loom a flat “shed stick” was placed across the warp under alternate warp threads, and by turning it on edge, one “shed” was made, through which the woof thread was passed in one direction. Alternate warp threads attached by loops of thread to a “lease rod” lying on top of the warp were next raised by lifting the “lease rod” vertically from the warp, making another “shed” through which the weft was drawn in the opposite direction across the warp. After each movement across the warp, the woof thread was pressed against the growing cloth with a peg. The weaver drew the weft across the warp with a shuttle, basically a rod carrying the thread. Since the skillful weaver moved the shuttle rapidly, Job could say: “My days themselves have become swifter than a weaver’s shuttle.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004591/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 7:6</a>.</p>

<strong>Willow</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The name of this tree in Hebrew corresponds with the Arabic <em>safsaf,</em> which is applied to the willow tree. There are four types of willow growing in Palestine, one designated by the botanical term <em>Salix safsaf,</em> but the most common is the <em>Salix acmophylla.</em> The Hebrew word occurs only once, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014506/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezekiel 17:5</a>, where the symbolic “seed of the land,” evidently referring to Zedekiah, is figuratively planted by the king of Babylon as “a willow by vast waters.” The willow trees are found along the bank of rivers and shallow streams and other moist places, where they sprout quickly from cuttings or slips and grow rapidly. They never attain the height of poplar trees but grow as shrubs or small trees <span id="page1658" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1658" data-before-text="1658"></span>and often form thickets along the water courses. Their beauty is in their slender long leaves, hanging gracefully from the slender twigs and branches.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Part Two</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> It was Almighty God, whose name is Jehovah, who miraculously brought up Jonah the prophet out of the belly of the huge fish on the third day. This same God, Jehovah, brought up his faithful prophet <span id="page46" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="46" data-before-text="46"></span>Jesus Christ out of the “heart of the earth” on the third day. Hence the deliverance of Jonah was a prophetic picture of the resurrection of the Son of God from the dead. After his resurrection the “keys of death and of Haʹdes” were given to Jesus Christ, that he might be God’s Agent in raising all the others who are in Haʹdes or Sheol and in the condition of death. No man can, by his own means and arrangements, escape death and Sheol or Haʹdes, the grave that is common to dead mankind in the dust of the earth.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">10.

(b) So how will survivors of Armageddon escape going into Sheol?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> The psalmist Ethan the Ezrahite painfully realized this fact, when he said to Jehovah God: “Remember of what duration of life I am. Is it all in vain that you have created all the sons of men? What able-bodied man is there alive who will not see death? Can he provide escape for his soul from the hand of Sheol?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 89:47, 48</a>) For this reason those dedicated Christians today who will survive the coming battle of Armageddon and enter into a righteous new order on earth with the opportunity of never dying will survive only by means of God’s miraculous power of protection and preservation. Likewise, those who die and are buried in Sheol or Haʹdes cannot come up out of that place of death and decay by their own power. The deathly diseased prophet Job spoke of this inability of man when he mournfully said: “The eye of him that sees me will not behold me; your eyes will be upon me, but I shall not be. The cloud certainly comes to its end and goes away; so he that is going down to Sheol will not come up.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 7:8, 9</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">11.

For he sees that even the wise ones die, together the stupid one and the unreasoning one perish, and they must leave to others their means of maintenance.” Unlike a materialistic rich man, the inspired psalmist trusts in Almighty God Jehovah and says: “However, God himself will redeem my soul from the hand of Sheol, for he will receive me.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 49:15</a>.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">12.

O Jehovah, you have brought up my soul from Sheol itself; you have kept me alive, that I should not go down into the pit.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 30:2, 3</a>) Not only can this God of David keep a person from going down into death and the grave prematurely but he can also bring up the dead from Sheol or Haʹdes by means of a resurrection, just as he did in the case of his own Son Jesus Christ. The mother of the prophet Samuel voiced that same fact when she said: “Jehovah is a Killer and a Preserver of life, a Bringer down to Sheol, and He brings up.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Sam. 2:6</a>) Mary, the mother of Jesus, spoke in praise to Jehovah with a similar thought in mind.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Luke 1:46-55</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>DEAD OR CONSCIOUSLY ALIVE—WHICH?</strong></p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">13.

That is why numbers of Bible translators render these two words into English as “the grave” (not, a grave). The <em>Authorized Version</em> or King James Bible Version renders the Hebrew word Sheol as “the grave” thirty-one times and as “the pit” three times, and the Greek word Haʹdes as “grave” once (in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:55</a>). But for centuries the religious clergy of Christendom have taught that Haʹdes is a place of fiery torment. So now our question is, What is the condition of people who are dead in Sheol or Haʹdes? Are they consciously alive as immortals, or are they really dead and out of existence? What does God’s own Word, the Holy Bible, not the clergy of Christendom, say in answer to this question?</p>

<strong>“Man” in the Hebrew Scriptures</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Even as <em>adám</em> sets man apart from the lower animals, so it also calls attention to <span id="page58" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="58" data-before-text="58"></span>man’s inferiority to the Creator, Jehovah God. Thus Moses was told that no human could see God and live. Samuel was reminded that a human can see only the outside, but God can see the heart. David prayed that he might not fall into human hands but into God’s hands, for having numbered the fighting men of his nation presumptuously. The temple of Solomon, David said, was to be built, not for humans, but for God. Jehoshaphat counseled the judges to remember that they were judging, not for humans, but for God. Elihu refused to give flattering titles to mere humans.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ex. 33:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 1 Sam. 16:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 1 Chron. 21:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/3" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 29:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/4" data-bid="11-5" class="b"> 2 Chron. 19:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/5" data-bid="11-6" class="b"> Job 32:21</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The psalmist twice asked why the great Creator should take note of mere humans; also, he said that, though certain ones were “gods,” they would die like earthling man. The fear of humans brings a snare, but he that trusts in Jehovah will be safe. Why go down to Egypt for help? The Egyptians are not spirits but mere humans, earthlings. And to highlight the seriousness of the selfishness of the priests in Malachi’s day, God asked: “Will earthling man rob God?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 8:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 144:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 82:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/3" data-bid="12-4" class="b"> Prov. 29:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/4" data-bid="12-5" class="b"> Isa. 31:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/5" data-bid="12-6" class="b"> Mal. 3:8</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>“ENÓSH”</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The thought behind <em>enósh,</em> weak or mortal, shows, for one thing, that the Hebrew Scripture writers had no illusions about man’s being immortal. How could they, since they received their “theology,” not from pagan sources, but from God himself, who made plain man’s mortal nature both by warning him of death in the event he sinned and by sentencing him, after he had sinned, to return to the dust from which man had been taken.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. 2:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 3:19</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><em>Enósh</em> always has an unfavorable connotation and, therefore, is never used in a complimentary sense. Fittingly, it is frequently coupled with <em>adám,</em> human, when man is contrasted with his immortal Maker, Jehovah God. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalms 8:4 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Ps 144:3</a> are typical of this coupling of <em>enósh</em> with <em>adám</em> when contrasting man with God. Thus also Moses wrote: “You make mortal man [<em>enósh</em>] go back to crushed matter, and you say: ‘Go back, you sons of men [<em>adám</em>].’” Because of the wickedness of man God warned that he would make <em>‘enósh</em> scarcer than refined gold and <em>adám</em> scarcer than the gold of Ophir.’ Putting both <em>enósh</em> and <em>adám</em> in their places are the words of Jehovah to Isaiah: “I myself am the One that is comforting you people. Who are you that you should be afraid of a mortal man [<em>enósh</em>] that will die, and of a son of mankind [<em>adám</em>] that will be rendered as mere green grass? And that you should forget Jehovah your Maker, the One stretching out the heavens and laying the foundation of the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 90:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Isa. 13:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 51:12, 13</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Particularly in the book of Job, which features God’s sovereignty in contrast to man’s puniness, is <em>enósh</em> a favorite term when making this point: “How can mortal man be in the right in a case with God?” “What is mortal man that you should rear him, and that you should set your heart upon him?” “Do you [Jehovah] have eyes of flesh, or is it as a mortal man sees that you see? Are your days like the days of mortal man, or your years just like the days of an able-bodied man?” “As one trifles with mortal man will you trifle with [God]? “ “God is much more than mortal man.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Job 9:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 7:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/2" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 10:4, 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/3" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> 13:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/4" data-bid="16-5" class="b"> 33:12</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">From his prayers we can see that David had a like keen appreciation: “Do arise, O Jehovah! Let not mortal man prove superior in strength.” “Judge the fatherless boy and the crushed one, that mortal man who is of the earth may no more cause trembling.” “As for mortal man, his days are like those of green grass.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ps. 9:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 10:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/16/2" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 103:15</a>.</p>
