	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page611" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="611" data-before-text="611"></span><strong>Gratitude for Little Things</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">IF SOMEONE gave you a large sum of money without expecting anything in return, would you not voice your thanks? Surely you would consider one an ingrate who did not express appreciation for this generosity. The benefactor might even be tempted to withdraw his gift because of such ingratitude. How much better it would be to show sincere appreciation!</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Yet, no part of this gift could be enjoyed without the things we so often take for granted, things that we may consider small in our lives, but on which our life depends. What could be enjoyed if the sun ceased to shine? if we had no air to breathe? if there was no water to drink? if the vegetation did not grow? How could we appreciate living without a refreshing night’s sleep or our marvelous senses?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">All the many things needed to sustain and enjoy life are free gifts from God. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960760/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 106:1</a> counsels: “Give thanks to Jehovah, for he is good; for his loving-kindness is to time indefinite.” Many of earth’s inhabitants never turn to God in prayer to acknowledge this loving-kindness. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960760/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:2</a>) We should be thankful that he does not withdraw his gifts because of such ingratitude.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Some who turn to God in prayer do so only when they want to ask for something. While it is proper to make a request if it is in harmony with his will, can we expect God to listen if we do not regularly communicate with him to thank him for what he has already given? “Be persevering in prayer,” said the apostle Paul, “remaining awake in it with thanksgiving.” “In everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960760/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Col. 4:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960760/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Phil. 4:6</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Since gratitude is an expression of thanksgiving for a favor received, giving thanks in prayer should not be done in a mechanical manner, without meaning. Our prayers should be heartfelt expressions of appreciation to God for the things he has given to us, things that have far more value than large sums of money. When Jesus provided food for about five thousand men, he “took the loaves and, after giving thanks, he distributed them to those reclining.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960760/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 6:11</a>) We could not imagine Jesus giving thanks hurriedly, as if he wanted to get it over with.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Being grateful to God for what he has provided is one way to show our love for him. Loving God is the greatest commandment, <span id="page612" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="612" data-before-text="612"></span>Jesus said. If gratitude is included in our love for God, would it not also be included in the other great commandment, that of neighbor love? Jesus stated: “You must love your neighbor as yourself.” Gratitude shown to our fellow man for kindnesses we receive is one way to show this love.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960760/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 22:37-39</a>.</p>

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page349" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="349" data-before-text="349"></span><strong>The Joy Found in New World Associations</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">UPON hearing a Witness give his doorstep sermon, a householder said: “I could tell right away that you were one of Jehovah’s witnesses. You people are so happy!” The observation was by no means unique. Time and again the public press has commented upon the happiness of the Witnesses at their assemblies, that they seem to get so much joy out of their religion.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Their joyful state being noticed by men of goodwill toward God attracts these to the New World society. Like the psalmist, they long to ‘see the goodness to God’s chosen ones, that they may rejoice with the rejoicing of his nation.’ As these progress they feel about New World associations as did David: “I rejoiced when they were saying to me: ‘To the house of Jehovah let us go.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962408/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 106:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962408/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 122:1</a>.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1962408/0">a</a></p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">This is as it should be, for in ancient times Jehovah’s people were specifically commanded to rejoice: “You must . . . rejoice in every undertaking of yours, you and your households, because Jehovah your God has blessed you.” And the apostolic command to Jehovah’s Christian witnesses is: “Always rejoice in the Lord. Once more I will say, Rejoice!”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962408/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deut. 12:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962408/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Phil. 4:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962408/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 3:1</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">No question about it, Jehovah God has blessed his people in modern times. He gives them many reasons for rejoicing. To mention but a few of them: The establishment of God’s kingdom, the manifestation of Christ’s presence, the return to their “land” of pure worship from bondage to modern Babylon, the holy spirit poured out upon God’s people, the appearance of a “great crowd” of desirable ones from all nations, the ever-increasing light and the prosperity of the New World society.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962408/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hag. 2:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962408/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Rev. 7:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962408/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 11:15</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Knowledge alone is not sufficient to have enduring joy. For joy to continue it must be cultivated. It must have the right soil. It is the result of a right course of conduct in the climate of peace and harmony with God’s people. Among the things that will cause one to have joy is generosity. At the same time generosity is the result of joy. Israel’s generosity in contributing material for the temple brought them joy; the joy of the brothers of Macedonia caused them to manifest generosity.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962408/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962408/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962408/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 2 Cor. 8:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">And so we find it today. Joyful Witnesses are eager to help; helping results in further joy. When they build a Kingdom Hall, work at an assembly or voluntarily give of their time and means on other occasions, joy results. Jesus said that there was more happiness in giving, and this is especially true of giving the truth about God’s kingdom to men of goodwill from house to house and in their homes by means of Bible studies.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962408/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Association is another great aid to joy. All of us need it, for it is not good for us to be alone. But let us exercise care that seeking association of others is not from any materialistic motives.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">True, one may have preferences and there is nothing wrong with that since even Jesus had preferences. The twelve apostles were preferred by Jesus to the rest of his disciples; but even of these Jesus preferred three: Peter, James and John; and of these three one was Jesus’ favorite: the beloved apostle John. But Jesus freely spent himself for all as he had opportunity and as they appreciated their need.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962408/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Mark 6:31-34</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">So let us also be concerned with others in seeking association. Let us take note of the weak, the irregular ones, the shy, the backward and humble “lambs” and go out of our way to greet them with a smile, a cheery handshake and edifying, upbuilding conversation. And, best of all, let us try to draw them out, to get them to express themselves and so receive the greater joy of giving.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962408/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:14</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">For our New World associations to be conducive to joy they must be kept wholesome. The human heart is deceitful, the flesh is weak, and unless we are careful we can easily be ensnared by our weaknesses, to our lasting regret. We also want to guard against becoming burdensome to others or letting our associations be limited to mere mundane things such as food and drink.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">And finally, for our associations to be joyful let us make allowances for others, not rejecting any because of immaterial peculiarities, and being natural ourselves. All of this makes for true joy in New World associations.</p>

<strong>Rejoicing in New World Associations</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[27]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> Today Jehovah God is inviting all lovers of truth and righteousness to assemble together with the happy New World society of his witnesses. God himself provides the sound reasons for rejoicing among his people. At one time Jehovah’s modern witnesses found themselves in a stricken and unhappy state, particularly at the end of the first world war, in 1918. They were depicted in prophecy as persons dressed in sackcloth, and even as dead corpses lying <span id="page297" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="297" data-before-text="297"></span>in the streets. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961362/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rev. 11:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961362/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 7-10</a>) But Jehovah caused the condition of his people to be changed from that of sorrow and mourning to one of joy and happiness. He delivered his faithful witnesses from their deathlike state of inactivity, put his spirit upon them and caused the prophetic words of Isaiah to be fulfilled toward them, namely: “Then the redeemed ones of Jehovah themselves will return and must come to Zion with a joyful outcry, and rejoicing to time indefinite will be upon their head. To exultation and rejoicing they will attain. Grief and sighing will certainly flee away.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961362/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isa. 51:11</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="qu"> 4. What do persons of good will note, and what do they desire?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[28]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> It is therefore not strange that so many people in the world take note of the happiness of Jehovah’s people. Indeed, it is a factor that draws many persons to associate with us. They find themselves sharing the desire of the psalmist, who wrote: “That I may see the goodness to your chosen ones, that I may rejoice with the rejoicing of your nation.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961362/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 106:5</a>.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="qu"> 5. Name some things that contribute to the joy of the New World society.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Many things contribute to the joy of the New World society. What joy there is in knowing and understanding Bible truth, being aware of the fact that Jehovah has now taken up his power to rule by establishing Christ Jesus as King in the heavenly kingdom and that shortly Jehovah’s universal sovereignty will be vindicated by means of this kingdom when it destroys all that oppose its rule! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961362/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 97:1-12</a>) The hope we have of living forever in the New World at hand, the evidence of the outpouring of Jehovah’s spirit upon his people in these last days, along with thrilling revelations of truth and the gathering of a great crowd of persons of good will into the New World fold, are further causes for rejoicing. And, knowing the needs of his creatures, Jehovah provides the right climate for rejoicing—the happy companionship and association of others of like faith.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu"> 6, 7. On what is the happiness of Jehovah’s creatures dependent? Therefore, what should be safeguarded?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Jehovah himself does not need the companionship of others in order to be happy. He is complete in himself. Yet he chooses to delight in his servants and to find pleasure and cause for rejoicing in his people. “Jehovah your God is in the midst of you. As a mighty One, he will save. He will be glad over you with rejoicing. He will become silent in his love. He will be joyful over you with happy cries.” Concerning the restoration of his people to spiritual prosperity in these last days, Jehovah says: “I will be joyful in Jerusalem and exult in my people.” On the other hand, none of God’s creatures is complete in himself as He is. All depend on Jehovah for their happiness. They all have certain needs, which must be satisfied in order for them to be truly happy. And this is most certainly true of us imperfect humans on earth. One of these needs is for right companionship and association, and this Jehovah provides in various ways, especially in the Christian fellowship of the New World society.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961362/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Zeph. 3:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961362/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Isa. 65:19</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Hence, if we want to continue rejoicing in every undertaking of ours as God’s people, we need to safeguard and maintain the joyfulness of our association. Joy does not come of itself but is the result of a right course of conduct in the climate of harmony and peace with the people of God. It is one of the fruits of the spirit. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961362/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Gal. 5:22</a>) We should by all means pray for joy to be in our midst, but we also need to cultivate it by making our own contribution to building up happiness in congregational association.</p>

Our own individual, personal continuance in this rejoicing in the gladness of Jehovah’s nation and in sharing in its prosperity is conditional. Why? Because it is to his organization that he gives the sure word, “And no more will there be any curse,” since he will see to it that his organization as such keeps clean and free and faithful. It is to his organization as a whole that he says: “No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue [whether nationalist, fascist, religionist or communist] that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of Jehovah, and their righteousness which is of me, saith Jehovah.” It is to his restored organization that he gives this word: “Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: My cities shall yet overflow with prosperity; and Jehovah shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952885/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Rev. 22:3</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952885/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa. 54:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952885/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Zech. 1:17</a>, <em>AS</em>) But will you as an individual keep on sharing in all this spiritual welfare, favor and protection? It all depends upon your holding fast to Jehovah’s theocratic organization and keeping at one and in harmony with it. It all rests with your living up to its faithful principles and conducting yourself worthy of being retained in Jehovah’s organization.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">15. To that end, what must we do?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> To that end you must shun the sins that easily entangle the careless and the self-reliant ones. We must not let spiritual prosperity go to our heads and make us conceited and feel sure of ourselves. Beware of saying yet as the psalmist did: “As for me, I said in my prosperity, I shall never be moved.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952885/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 30:6</a>, <em>AS</em>) Do not forget your responsibilities and grow foolish by neglecting them, showing unfaithfulness in what is least. Remember the proverb: “The turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity [or, the careless ease] of fools shall destroy them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952885/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Prov. 1:32</a>; <em>AS</em>) Do not get like Christendom to whom Jehovah spoke prophetically: “I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will not hear.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952885/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Jer. 22:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952885/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Zech. 7:7</a>) There is a danger that those self-conscious of their prosperity may disobey. Keep clearly in mind the sins that caused individuals inside Jehovah’s ancient organization of Israel to be destroyed, yes, caused the entire nation to be turned over to its enemies for corrective punishment. Remember your own sins which once separated you from the true God and his nation. You can easily get to repeating them. Avoid doing so.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">16. With what did the psalmist follow up his prayer, and who did likewise since the close of World War I?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> The psalmist prayed God to favor him once more and save him and let him see and join in the prosperity and gladness of God’s nation, but he immediately followed up his prayer by making a confession of the sins of his nation and not excusing himself but sharing the blame. He said: “We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952885/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 106:6</a>) Yes, “we,” I as well as the rest. It is something for a nation to confess its national sins against God. At the close of World War I Christendom, dripping with blood, seething with internal strife, guilty of persecuting Jehovah’s people, proudly refused to confess her sins. A few religious ministers made a sort of confessing, but not getting at the real heart of Christendom’s sin and ungodliness. Hence, as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952885/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Proverbs 28:13</a> says: “He that covereth his transgressions shall not prosper; but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall obtain mercy.” (<em>AS</em>) The loyal-hearted remnant of Jehovah’s <span id="page726" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="726" data-before-text="726"></span>anointed witnesses did make an organizational confession of their sins and failings toward God. They repented of them in a godly way which led to turning from them and correcting themselves in their teachings and practices. Their organization confessed such sins against the Most High God and the individual members owned up to having a part in those sins. So God reinstated them in his favor and service and prospered them.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/1506/0">9/1/1995, pp. 19-20</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Can You Cultivate More Discernment?</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>Israel’s Lack of Discernment</strong></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The danger of failing to exercise discernment is seen in an event in the early history of Israel. Looking back on that time, the inspired psalmist said: “As for our forefathers in Egypt, they did not show any insight into your wonderful works. They did not remember the abundance of your grand loving-kindness, but they behaved rebelliously at the sea, by the Red Sea.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995644/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 106:7</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">When Moses led Israel out of Egypt, Jehovah had already shown his power and his determination to free his people by visiting ten plagues on that mighty world power. After Pharaoh let the Israelites go, Moses led them to the banks of the Red Sea. However, the armies of Egypt marched after them in pursuit. It seemed as though the Israelites were trapped and that their newfound freedom was to be very short-lived. So the Bible record says: “The sons of Israel got quite afraid and began to cry out to Jehovah.” And they turned on Moses, saying: <span id="page20" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>“What is this that you have done to us in leading us out of Egypt? . . . For it is better for us to serve the Egyptians than for us to die in the wilderness.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995644/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Exodus 14:10-12</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Their fear may seem understandable until we remember that they had already seen ten outstanding demonstrations of Jehovah’s power. They knew firsthand what Moses would remind them of some 40 years later: “Jehovah brought us out of Egypt with a strong hand and an outstretched arm and with great fearsomeness and with signs and miracles.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995644/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 26:8</a>) Hence, as the psalmist wrote, when the Israelites turned against Moses’ direction, “they did not show any insight.” Nevertheless, Jehovah, true to his promise, inflicted a stunning defeat on the forces of Egypt.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995644/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Exodus 14:19-31</a>.</p>

They had been told of his dealings with their forefathers, and they had personally experienced his loving-kindness. But on more than one occasion, they acted with a gross lack of insight. They “behaved rebelliously” toward Jehovah and his representatives. Why? Because “they did not remember” what he had done for them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989206/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 106:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989206/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 13</a>) It was not that they did not know these things; they failed to ponder over them appreciatively. As a result, they proved to be “persons desiring injurious things.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989206/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:6</a>.</p>

The psalmist says of that time: “Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957561/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 106:8</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In the third month after leaving Egypt Moses was on Mount Sinai receiving the law from Jehovah. Later Jehovah told Moses that the people were acting ruinously by worshiping the image of a calf. When Jehovah said he was going to destroy them it was Moses who caused Him to refrain. On what basis? The salvation of the people, their preservation? No, but for the sake of Jehovah’s name, which was on this people. Moses argued: “Why should the Egyptians say, ‘With evil intent he brought them out in order to kill them among the mountains and to exterminate them from the surface of the ground’?” Also, “Remember Abraham, Isaac and Israel your servants, to whom you swore by yourself, in that you said to them, ‘I shall multiply your seed like the stars of the heavens, and all this land that I have designated I shall give to your seed, that they may indeed take possession of it to time indefinite.’” So Jehovah withheld destruction, not for Israel’s sake, but to keep the Egyptians from saying Jehovah was unable to take them to the Promised Land and killed them instead, and to keep the promise made in his name to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957561/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex. 32:12, 13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957561/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Deut. 9:24-29</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Later, when the spies returned from spying out the land of Canaan and the Israelites rebelled at entering the land, Jehovah berated their lack of respect and faith and was going to destroy them. Again Moses intervened, saying that the nations “have heard that you are Jehovah in among this people” and “were you to put this people to death as one man, then the nations who have heard of your fame would certainly say this, ‘Because of Jehovah’s not being able to bring this people into the land about which he swore to them he proceeded to slaughter them in the wilderness.’” So again the people were spared, not because their salvation was so important, but because it would reflect unfavorably on the name of Jehovah that was associated with this people.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957561/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Num. 14:14-16</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">After Israel had entered the land of Canaan and been under the rule of judges for centuries, they decided they wanted a human king, as the nations around them had. This was a rejection of Jehovah God, but it was permitted nonetheless. However, Jehovah showed his displeasure by causing thunder and rain in the time of wheat harvest—not the season for such weather at all! The people were greatly frightened at this miraculous display, but after admonishing them to follow Jehovah the prophet Samuel reassured them: “For Jehovah will not desert his people for the sake of his great name, because Jehovah has taken it upon himself to make you his people.” Here again it was for the sake of his name upon those people that he put up with them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957561/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Sam. 12:22</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Jehovah was long-suffering with these people for his name’s sake, but the time came when their blasphemy and idolatry <span id="page454" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="454" data-before-text="454"></span>became so disgraceful that he cast them out of the land. The debased, obscene demon worship they indulged in while saying they served Jehovah was a taking of his name in a worthless way—a sin not to go unpunished! He allowed the Babylonians to take his faithless people captive. But the nations among whom the Israelites were scattered interpreted the dispersion as evidence of the weakness of the Israelites’ God, Jehovah. To demonstrate the falsity of this reasoning Jehovah said he would restore Israel to the land of Judah. Hence Israel’s restoration was not for the nation’s salvation, but for the vindication of Jehovah’s name. We read about this at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957561/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezekiel 36:19-24</a> (<em>RS</em>):</p>

God’s dealings with them were in addition to the goodness and normal blessings of life that he bestows upon mankind in general. Despite these advantages, however, the psalmist points out that the Israelites did not continue to show appreciation for their unique blessings. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988482/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps 106 Verse 13</a> states: “Quickly they forgot his works; they did not wait for his counsel.” No, it was not the passing of time that gradually diminished their thankfulness, so that decades later they no longer remembered what God had done for them. Instead, they forgot <em>quickly</em>​—within weeks of Jehovah’s outstanding miracles in their behalf at the Red Sea. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1988482/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Exodus 16:1-3</a>) Sadly, future events showed that unthankfulness became a regular pattern in their life.</p>

Then, following Moses’ call to the rest of the people to withdraw from around the tents of the three ringleaders of the rebellion, God manifested his condemnation of their disrespectful course by causing the ground to open up beneath the tents of these men, swallowing up Dathan and Abiram, and their households.

Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and he that is loving it will eat its fruitage.” If the fruitage is Kingdom fruitage, the preaching of the good news, such leads to everlasting life in God’s new world. But if one is quick to speak what is rotten, injurious and foolish, then it will be as Jesus warned the Pharisees: “I tell you that every unprofitable saying that men speak, they will render an account concerning it on Judgment Day; for by your words you will be vindicated, and by your words you will be condemned.” How true it is: “He that would love life and see good days, let him restrain his tongue from what is injurious and his lips from speaking deceitfully”!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960162/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Prov. 18:20, 21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960162/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Matt. 12:36, 37;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960162/21/2" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> 1 Pet. 3:10</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="ss"><strong>“PUTTING UP WITH ONE ANOTHER”</strong></p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">20.

To be quick in expressing fault in these unweighty matters shows unbalance. It shows a lack of love because love “does not look for its own interests.” The trend in the world today is to be swift about insisting on one’s own way by being quick to speak fault-finding, nagging, carping words. There are verbal tyrants in small things. Little wonder that a worldly wit has said: “My wife is too beautiful for words—but not for arguments!” Such carping must not exist among Christians. Follow God’s will as expressed at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960162/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Philippians 2:14</a>: “Keep doing all things free from murmurings and arguments.” Really do as the apostle admonished: “Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely if anyone has a cause for complaint against another.” Following such counsel will make for pleasantness and unity both within the family circle and the congregation. “Look! how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity!”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960162/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960162/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Col. 3:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960162/23/2" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> Ps. 133:1</a>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="ss"><strong>AVOIDING RASH WORDS WHEN ANGERED</strong></p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">21.

The murmuring Israelites “caused provocation at the waters of Meribah, so that it went badly with Moses by reason of them. For they embittered his spirit and he began to speak rashly with his lips.” When the Israelites needed water, Jehovah commanded Moses to take his rod and bring forth water from a crag. Moses did it, but because of his anger at the complaining Israelites he was swift to speak: “Hear, now, you rebels! Is it from this crag that we shall bring out water for you?” Later Jehovah said to Moses: “Because you did not show faith in me to sanctify me before the eyes of the sons of Israel, therefore you will not bring this congregation into the land that I shall certainly give them.” It was a big price to pay for rash speech.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960162/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Prov. 10:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960162/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Ps. 106:32, 33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960162/24/2" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> Num. 20:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960162/24/3" data-bid="25-4" class="b"> 12</a>.</p>

Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and he that is loving it will eat its fruitage.” If the fruitage is Kingdom fruitage, the preaching of the good news, such leads to everlasting life in God’s new world. But if one is quick to speak what is rotten, injurious and foolish, then it will be as Jesus warned the Pharisees: “I tell you that every unprofitable saying that men speak, they will render an account concerning it on Judgment Day; for by your words you will be vindicated, and by your words you will be condemned.” How true it is: “He that would love life and see good days, let him restrain his tongue from what is injurious and his lips from speaking deceitfully”!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960162/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Prov. 18:20, 21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960162/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Matt. 12:36, 37;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960162/21/2" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> 1 Pet. 3:10</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="ss"><strong>“PUTTING UP WITH ONE ANOTHER”</strong></p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">20.

To be quick in expressing fault in these unweighty matters shows unbalance. It shows a lack of love because love “does not look for its own interests.” The trend in the world today is to be swift about insisting on one’s own way by being quick to speak fault-finding, nagging, carping words. There are verbal tyrants in small things. Little wonder that a worldly wit has said: “My wife is too beautiful for words—but not for arguments!” Such carping must not exist among Christians. Follow God’s will as expressed at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960162/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Philippians 2:14</a>: “Keep doing all things free from murmurings and arguments.” Really do as the apostle admonished: “Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely if anyone has a cause for complaint against another.” Following such counsel will make for pleasantness and unity both within the family circle and the congregation. “Look! how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity!”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960162/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960162/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Col. 3:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960162/23/2" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> Ps. 133:1</a>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="ss"><strong>AVOIDING RASH WORDS WHEN ANGERED</strong></p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">21.

The murmuring Israelites “caused provocation at the waters of Meribah, so that it went badly with Moses by reason of them. For they embittered his spirit and he began to speak rashly with his lips.” When the Israelites needed water, Jehovah commanded Moses to take his rod and bring forth water from a crag. Moses did it, but because of his anger at the complaining Israelites he was swift to speak: “Hear, now, you rebels! Is it from this crag that we shall bring out water for you?” Later Jehovah said to Moses: “Because you did not show faith in me to sanctify me before the eyes of the sons of Israel, therefore you will not bring this congregation into the land that I shall certainly give them.” It was a big price to pay for rash speech.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960162/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Prov. 10:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960162/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Ps. 106:32, 33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960162/24/2" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> Num. 20:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960162/24/3" data-bid="25-4" class="b"> 12</a>.</p>

An outstanding principle, as stated through Moses, and repeated by Christ Jesus when on this earth, is that “Jehovah our God is one Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Deut. 6:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> Mark 12:29</a>) This fundamental principle of true worship eliminates all other gods, whether they be Baal, a trinity of gods, Allah, Brahma, Buddha or the Red god of Communism. In harmony with this principle Jehovah’s witnesses will not compromise, such as in consenting to a part-Christian, part-Buddhist funeral service. Nor will they compromise by taking part in a local religious ceremonial in honor of community gods. “You must not bow down to them nor be induced to serve them, because I Jehovah your God am a God exacting exclusive devotion.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Ex. 20:5</a>.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">20.

Your daughter you must not give to his son, and his daughter you must not take for your son. For he will turn your son from following me, and they will certainly serve other gods; and Jehovah’s anger will indeed blaze against you, and he will certainly annihilate you in a hurry.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Deut. 7:3, 4</a>) This warning carries added weight, as we stand now at the threshold of Armageddon’s war.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">21.

If the head of the house appreciates divine principles, he should see that these emblems of religious wickedness are got out. Thus will be removed the danger of contaminating the household again with demon worship. Even wise King Solomon, who once placed high store on divine principles, was corrupted by the idols he permitted heathen wives to bring into Israel.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Ps. 106:36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962362/37/1" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> 1 Ki. 11:1-13</a>.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">22.

The Scriptures counsel: “Flee from idolatry.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101974120/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:14</a>) The experience of a woman from Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, illustrates the value of obeying that counsel.</p>

<strong>Does God Feel Regret?</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">There is a particular sense, though, in which Jehovah God may feel regret. In the Scriptures we read: “He would feel regret according to the abundance of his grand loving-kindness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101977210/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 106:45</a>) How is this to be understood?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Since Jehovah God does not make mistakes, his regretting manifestly refers to a change in attitude toward humans. Just what prompts such a change on his part?</p>

<strong>Amen</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In the Hebrew Scriptures the word is used as a solemn expression to obligate oneself legally to an oath or covenant and its consequences (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Nu 5:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> De 27:15-26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Ne 5:13</a>), also as a solemn expression to subscribe to an expressed prayer (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1Ch 16:36</a>), to an expression of praise (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ne 8:6</a>), or to an expressed purpose (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1Ki 1:36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Jer 11:5</a>). Each of the first four books, or collections, of the Psalms concludes with this expression, perhaps indicating that it was customary for the congregation of Israel to join in at the end of the song or psalm with an “Amen.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps 41:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 72:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 89:52;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000227/4/3" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 106:48</a>.</p>

<strong>Ambassador</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Unlike modern-day ambassadors, ancient envoys or messengers, since they did not reside in foreign <span id="page64" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="64" data-before-text="64"></span>capitals, were dispatched only on special occasions for specific purposes. Often they were persons of rank (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:17, 18</a>) and their office was highly respected. Consequently, they were accorded inviolability of person when they visited other rulers.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The treatment accorded a ruler’s messengers or envoys was considered as done toward the ruler and his government. Thus, when Rahab showed favor to the messengers sent as spies to Jericho by Joshua, she really was acting as she did because she recognized that Jehovah was the God and King of Israel. Jehovah, through Joshua showed her favor accordingly. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Josh. 6:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Heb. 11:31</a>) A flagrant violation of the unwritten international custom of respect toward envoys was the action of Hanun the king of Ammon, to whom King David sent some servants in a gesture of friendship. The king of Ammon listened to his princes, who falsely called the messengers spies, and publicly humiliated them, demonstrating his disrespect for David and his government. This disgraceful action led to war.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Sam. 10:2–11:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 12:26-31</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Opposite to the modern-day practice of recalling an ambassador when diplomatic relations are broken with a government, the people of ancient times sent messengers or envoys as spokesmen to one another during times of strain in an effort to reestablish peaceful relations. Isaiah speaks of such “messengers of peace.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isa. 33:7</a>) Hezekiah sent a peace appeal to Sennacherib the king of Assyria. Although Sennacherib was threatening the fortified cities of Judah, the messengers were given freedom of passage by the Assyrians because they were acting as Hezekiah’s envoys. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:13-15</a>) Another example of this can be seen in the record about Jephthah, a judge in Israel. He dispatched messengers with a letter of remonstration against wrong action on the part of the king of the Ammonites and to clear up a dispute over territorial rights. If possible, Jephthah, through his envoys, would have settled the matter without war. These messengers were permitted to pass back and forth between the armies without hindrance.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Judg. 11:12-28</a>; see MESSENGER.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"></p>
