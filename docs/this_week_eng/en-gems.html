<strong>Ahithophel</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A native of Giloh in the hills of Judah (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000169/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Sa 15:12</a>), father of one of David’s mighty men named Eliam, and possibly the grandfather of Bath-sheba. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000169/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2Sa 11:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000169/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 23:34</a>) As David’s personal adviser, Ahithophel’s sagacious counsel was esteemed as if it were the direct word of Jehovah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000169/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2Sa 16:23</a>) Later this once-close companion treacherously turned traitor and joined David’s son Absalom in a coup against the king. As a ringleader in the rebellion, he advised Absalom to violate David’s concubines, and he asked permission to raise an army of 12,000 and immediately hunt down and kill David while David was in a disorganized and weakened state. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000169/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2Sa 15:31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000169/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 16:15,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000169/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000169/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 17:1-4</a>) When Jehovah thwarted this bold scheme, and the counsel of Hushai was followed, Ahithophel evidently realized that Absalom’s revolt would fail. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000169/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2Sa 15:32-34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000169/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 17:5-14</a>) He committed suicide and was buried with his forefathers.

<strong>Foreknowledge, Foreordination</strong><br/>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sn"><strong><em>Did God predestine Judas to betray Jesus in order to fulfill prophecy?</em></strong></p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb">The traitorous course of Judas Iscariot fulfilled divine prophecy and demonstrated Jehovah’s foreknowledge as well as that of his Son. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/101/0" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Ps 41:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/101/1" data-bid="102-2" class="b"> 55:12, 13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/101/2" data-bid="102-3" class="b"> 109:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/101/3" data-bid="102-4" class="b"> Ac 1:16-20</a>) Yet it cannot be said that God foreordained or predestinated Judas himself to such a course. The prophecies foretold that some intimate acquaintance of Jesus would be his betrayer, but they did not specify which of those sharing such acquaintance it would be. Again, Bible principles rule against God’s having foreordained Judas’ actions. The divine standard stated by the apostle is: “Never lay your hands hastily upon any man; neither be a sharer in the sins of others; preserve yourself chaste.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/102/0" data-bid="103-1" class="b">1Ti 5:22</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/103/0" data-bid="104-1" class="b">3:6</a>.) Evidencing his <span id="page858" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="858" data-before-text="858"></span>concern that the selection of his 12 apostles be wisely and properly made, Jesus spent the night in prayer to his Father before making known his decision. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/104/0" data-bid="105-1" class="b">Lu 6:12-16</a>) If Judas were already divinely foreordained to be a traitor, this would result in inconsistency in God’s direction and guidance and, according to the rule, would make him a sharer in the sins that one committed.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="sb">Thus, it seems evident that at the time of his being selected as an apostle, Judas’ heart presented no definite evidence of a treasonous attitude. He allowed a ‘poisonous root to spring up’ and defile him, resulting in his deviation and in his accepting, not God’s direction, but the Devil’s leading in a course of thievery and treachery. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/105/0" data-bid="106-1" class="b">Heb 12:14, 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/105/1" data-bid="106-2" class="b"> Joh 13:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/105/2" data-bid="106-3" class="b"> Ac 1:24, 25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/105/3" data-bid="106-4" class="b"> Jas 1:14, 15</a>; see <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/3">JUDAS</a> No. 4.) By the time such deviation reached a certain point, Jesus himself could read Judas’ heart and foretell his betrayal.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/106/0" data-bid="107-1" class="b">Joh 13:10, 11</a>.</p>

<strong>“Throw Your Burden Upon Jehovah”—How?</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Why did David find himself in this condition? Because of his foes. He next prays for God to take action against his enemies and particularly singles out a friend who had turned traitor. No doubt this was Ahithophel, of whom it could well be said: “For it was not an enemy that proceeded to reproach me; . . . But it was you, . . . one familiar to me and my acquaintance, because we used to enjoy sweet intimacy together; into the house of God we used to walk with the throng.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 55 Verses 12-14</a>.</p>

(15:31; 16:15, 21; 17:1-4) When Jehovah thwarted this bold scheme by the counsel of Hushai, Ahithophel’s pride was offended. (15:32-34; 17:5-14) He committed suicide and was buried with his forefathers. (17:23) Apart from wartime, this is the only case of suicide mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures.

<strong>Foreknowledge, Foreordination</strong><br/><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="sb">Paul’s quotations concerning Jehovah’s ‘love for Jacob [Israel] and his hatred for Esau [Edom]’ comes from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/76/0" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Malachi 1:2, 3</a>, written long after Jacob and Esau’s time. So the Bible does not necessarily say that Jehovah held such opinion of the twins before their birth. It is a scientifically established fact that much of a child’s general disposition and temperament are determined at the time of conception, due to the genetic factors contributed by each parent. That God can see such factors is self-evident; David speaks of Jehovah as seeing “even the embryo of me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/77/0" data-bid="78-1" class="b">Ps. 139:14-16</a>; see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/78/0" data-bid="79-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 11:5</a>.) To what extent such divine insight affected Jehovah’s foreordination concerning the two boys cannot be said, but, at any rate, his choice of Jacob over Esau did not of itself doom Esau or his descendants, the Edomites, to destruction. Even individuals from among the accursed Canaanites gained the privilege of association with God’s covenant people and received blessings. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/79/0" data-bid="80-1" class="b">Gen. 9:25-27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/79/1" data-bid="80-2" class="b"> Josh. 9:27</a>; see CANAAN, CANAANITE.) The “change of mind” that Esau earnestly sought with tears, however, was only an unsuccessful attempt to change his father Isaac’s decision that the firstborn’s special blessing should remain entirely with Jacob. Hence, this indicated no repentance before <span id="page598" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="598" data-before-text="598"></span>God on Esau’s part as to his materialistic attitude.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/80/0" data-bid="81-1" class="b">Gen. 27:32-34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/80/1" data-bid="81-2" class="b"> Heb. 12:16, 17</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="sb">Jehovah’s prophecy concerning Josiah called for some descendant of David to be so named, and foretold his acting against false worship in the city of Bethel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/81/0" data-bid="82-1" class="b">1 Ki. 13:1, 2</a>) Over three centuries later a king so named fulfilled this prophecy.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/83/0" data-bid="84-1" class="b">2 Chron. 35:20-24</a>) Hence, while foreknown by God and foreordained to do a particular work, Josiah was still a free moral agent able to choose to heed or disregard divine guidance.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="sb">Similarly, Jehovah foretold nearly two centuries beforehand that he would use a conqueror named Cyrus to effect the release of the Jews from Babylon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/84/0" data-bid="85-1" class="b">Isa. 44:26-28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/84/1" data-bid="85-2" class="b"> 45:1-6</a>) But the Persian to whom that name eventually was given in fulfillment of divine prophecy is not stated in the Bible to have become a genuine worshiper of Jehovah, and secular history shows him continuing his worship of pagan gods.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sb">These cases of foreknowledge prior to the individual’s birth thus do not conflict with God’s revealed qualities and announced standards. Nor is there any indication that God coerced the individuals to act against their own will. In the cases of Pharaoh, Judas Iscariot, and God’s own Son, there is no evidence that Jehovah’s foreknowledge was exercised prior to the person’s coming into existence. Within these individual cases certain principles are illustrated, bearing on God’s foreknowledge and foreordination.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="sb">One such principle is God’s testing of individuals by causing or allowing certain circumstances or events, or by causing such individuals to hear his inspired messages, the result being that they are obliged to exercise their free choice to make a decision and thus reveal a definite heart attitude, read by Jehovah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/85/0" data-bid="86-1" class="b">Prov. 15:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/85/1" data-bid="86-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 1:6, 7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/85/2" data-bid="86-3" class="b"> Heb. 4:12, 13</a>) According to the way the individuals respond, God can also mold them in the course they have selected of their own volition.

A contrasting case is that of the unresponsive Pharaoh of the Exodus. Jehovah foreknew that Pharaoh would refuse permission for the Israelites to leave “except by a strong hand” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/90/0" data-bid="91-1" class="b">Ex. 3:19, 20</a>), and foreordained the plague resulting in the death of the firstborn. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/91/0" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Ex. 4:22, 23</a>) The apostle Paul’s discussion of God’s dealings with Pharaoh is often incorrectly understood to mean that God arbitrarily hardens the heart of individuals according to his foreordained purpose, without regard for the individual’s prior inclination or heart attitude. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/92/0" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Rom. 9:14-18</a>) Likewise, according to many translations, God advised Moses that he would “harden [Pharaoh’s] heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/93/0" data-bid="94-1" class="b">Ex. 4:21</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/94/0" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Exodus 9:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/94/1" data-bid="95-2" class="b"> 10:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/94/2" data-bid="95-3" class="b"> 27</a>.) However, some translations render the Hebrew account to read that Jehovah “let [Pharaoh’s] heart wax bold” (<em>Ro</em>); “let [Pharaoh’s] heart became obstinate.” (<em>NW</em>) In support of such rendering<em>,</em> the Appendix to Rotherham’s translation shows that in Hebrew the <em>occasion</em> or <em>permission</em> of an event is often presented as if it were the <em>cause</em> of the event, and that “even <em>positive commands</em> are occasionally to be accepted as meaning no more than <em>permission.”</em> Thus at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/95/0" data-bid="96-1" class="b">Exodus 1:17</a> the original Hebrew text literally says that the midwives “caused the male children to live,” whereas in reality they <em>permitted</em> them to live by refraining from putting them to death. After quoting Hebrew scholars M. M. Kalisch, H. F. W. Gesenius, and B. Davies in support, Rotherham states that the Hebrew sense of the texts involving Pharaoh is that “God permitted Pharaoh to harden his own heart—spared him—gave him the opportunity, the occasion, of working out the wickedness that was in him. That is all.”—<em>The Emphasised Bible,</em> by J. B. Rotherham, Appendix, p. 919; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/96/0" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Isaiah 10:5-7</a>.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="sb">Corroborating this understanding is the fact that the record definitely shows that Pharaoh himself “hardened his heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/97/0" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Ex. 8:15,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/97/1" data-bid="98-2" class="b"> 32</a>, <em>AV</em>; “made his heart unresponsive,” <em>NW</em>) He thus exercised his own will and followed his own stubborn inclination, the results of which inclination Jehovah accurately foresaw and predicted. The repeated opportunities given him by Jehovah obliged Pharaoh to make decisions and in doing so he became hardened in his attitude. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/98/0" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 8:11, 12</a>.) As the apostle Paul shows by quoting <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/99/0" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Exodus 9:16</a>, Jehovah allowed the matter to develop in this way to the full length of ten plagues in order to make manifest his own power and cause his name to be made known earth wide.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/100/0" data-bid="101-1" class="b">Rom. 9:17, 18</a>.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sb">The traitorous course of Judas Iscariot fulfilled divine prophecy and demonstrated Jehovah’s foreknowledge, and also that of his Son. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/101/0" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Ps. 41:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/101/1" data-bid="102-2" class="b"> 55:12, 13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/101/2" data-bid="102-3" class="b"> 109:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/101/3" data-bid="102-4" class="b"> Acts 1:16-20</a>) Yet it cannot be said that God foreordained or predestinated Judas himself to such a course. The prophecies foretold that some intimate acquaintance of Jesus would be his betrayer, but did not specify which of those sharing such acquaintance it would be. Again, Bible principles rule against God’s having foreordained Judas’ actions. The divine standard stated by the apostle is: “Never lay your hands hastily upon any man; neither be a sharer in the sins of others; preserve yourself chaste.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/102/0" data-bid="103-1" class="b">1 Tim. 5:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/102/1" data-bid="103-2" class="b"> compare 3:6</a>.) Evidencing his concern that the selection of his twelve apostles be wisely and properly made, Jesus spent the night in prayer to his Father before making known his decision. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/103/0" data-bid="104-1" class="b">Luke 6:12-16</a>) If Judas were already divinely foreordained to be a traitor, this would result in inconsistency in God’s direction and guidance and, according to the rule, would make him a sharer in the sins that one committed.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sb">Thus, it seems evident that at the time of his being selected as an apostle, Judas’ heart presented no definite evidence of a treasonous attitude. He allowed a ‘poisonous root to spring up’ and defile him, resulting in his deviation and in his accepting, not God’s direction, but the Devil’s leading in a course of thievery and treachery. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/104/0" data-bid="105-1" class="b">Heb. 12:14, 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/104/1" data-bid="105-2" class="b"> John 13:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/104/2" data-bid="105-3" class="b"> Acts 1:24, 25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/104/3" data-bid="105-4" class="b"> Jas. 1:14, 15</a>; see JUDAS No. 4.) By the time such deviation reached a certain point, Jesus himself could read Judas’ heart and foretell his betrayal.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/105/0" data-bid="106-1" class="b">John 13:10, 11</a>.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="sb">True, in the account at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/106/0" data-bid="107-1" class="b">John 6:64</a>, on the occasion of some disciples stumbling over certain teachings of Jesus, we read that “from the beginning [“from the outset,” <em>JB</em>] Jesus knew who were the ones not believing and who was the one that would betray him.” While the word “beginning” (Greek, <em>ar·kheʹ</em>) is used at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/107/0" data-bid="108-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:4</a> to refer to the start of creation, it can also refer to other times.

<strong>The Traitorous “Evil Slave” and His Prototypes</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">What causes a person to become a traitor is well illustrated by proud and greedy Ahithophel. A traitor is often uncommonly brilliant; what he lacks is honesty and love. Such a traitor was Ahithophel, counselor of King David, concerning whom it was written: “The counsel of Ahithophel, with which he counseled in those days, was just as when a man would inquire of the word of The true God. That was the way all the counsel of <span id="page408" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="408" data-before-text="408"></span>Ahithophel was both to David and to Absalom.” Why did he turn traitor? The record does not state, but the inference is clear that Ahithophel joined the insurrection of Absalom against his father King David because it seemed quite certain that Absalom would win out. But Jehovah saw to it that things turned out differently.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Sam. 16:23</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Absalom, a favorite son of King David, was a most handsome man. At one time he had been banished for having murdered one of his half brothers for having violated his sister Tamar. David mercifully forgave him and restored him to the court. In rank ingratitude for this mercy Absalom schemed to turn the hearts of the people away from his father and then hatched a conspiracy to usurp his father’s throne, succeeding in persuading even Ahithophel to join him. When David heard about this he prayed: “Turn, please, the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness, O Jehovah!”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Sam. 15:12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 31</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The blackness of Ahithophel is recorded for us in one of David’s psalms: “For it was not an enemy that proceeded to reproach me; otherwise I could put up with it. It was not an intense hater of me that assumed great airs against me; otherwise I could conceal myself from him. But it was you, a mortal man who was as my equal, one familiar to me and my acquaintance, because we used to enjoy sweet intimacy together; into the house of God we used to walk with the throng. He has thrust out his hands against those at peace with him; he has profaned his covenant. Smoother than butter are the words of his mouth, but his heart is disposed to fight. His words are softer than oil, but they are drawn swords.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 55:12-14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 20, 21</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">In addition to praying to God to thwart the counsel of Ahithophel, David did what he could do to that end, namely, he sent his counselor Hushai to feign loyalty to Absalom and offset the wise counsel of Ahithophel. In this way Jehovah answered David’s prayer, for when Ahithophel gave good advice, Hushai counseled otherwise and Absalom heeded Hushai. The result was that Absalom lost the initiative and in the end also lost his life. As for vain and proud Ahithophel, when he saw his good advice spurned, he returned home, “gave orders to his household and strangled himself and thus died.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Sam. 17:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 23</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>JUDAS ISCARIOT</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Ahithophel was a fitting prototype of the most infamous, the most notorious traitor of all time, Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus Christ, the Son of God, for a paltry thirty pieces of silver. Judas Iscariot had been chosen to be one of the twelve apostles after Jesus had spent all night in prayer and so, without doubt, his heart was not bad at that time or Jesus would not have chosen him to be one of the honored twelve. But gradually this honored one let selfishness enter his heart. It appears that he was a Judean, whereas the rest of the twelve were Galileans, and Judeans did think themselves to be much better than the Galileans.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Judas Iscariot had been appointed treasurer of the group that followed Jesus, particularly the twelve, quite likely because of his having a better education. As time went on, however, he let selfishness get the upper hand. Being fully trusted, he saw how he could steal from the general fund without anyone knowing about it, and he did not scruple to yield to this temptation. As his heart went bad, Jesus noticed it, and so we read that “initially Jesus knew who were the ones not believing and who was the one that would betray him.” “I chose you twelve, did I not?

<strong>Foreknowledge, Foreordination</strong><br/>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sn"><strong><em>Did God predestine Judas to betray Jesus in order to fulfill prophecy?</em></strong></p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb">The traitorous course of Judas Iscariot fulfilled divine prophecy and demonstrated Jehovah’s foreknowledge as well as that of his Son. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/101/0" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Ps 41:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/101/1" data-bid="102-2" class="b"> 55:12, 13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/101/2" data-bid="102-3" class="b"> 109:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/101/3" data-bid="102-4" class="b"> Ac 1:16-20</a>) Yet it cannot be said that God foreordained or predestinated Judas himself to such a course. The prophecies foretold that some intimate acquaintance of Jesus would be his betrayer, but they did not specify which of those sharing such acquaintance it would be. Again, Bible principles rule against God’s having foreordained Judas’ actions. The divine standard stated by the apostle is: “Never lay your hands hastily upon any man; neither be a sharer in the sins of others; preserve yourself chaste.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/102/0" data-bid="103-1" class="b">1Ti 5:22</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/103/0" data-bid="104-1" class="b">3:6</a>.) Evidencing his <span id="page858" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="858" data-before-text="858"></span>concern that the selection of his 12 apostles be wisely and properly made, Jesus spent the night in prayer to his Father before making known his decision. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/104/0" data-bid="105-1" class="b">Lu 6:12-16</a>) If Judas were already divinely foreordained to be a traitor, this would result in inconsistency in God’s direction and guidance and, according to the rule, would make him a sharer in the sins that one committed.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="sb">Thus, it seems evident that at the time of his being selected as an apostle, Judas’ heart presented no definite evidence of a treasonous attitude. He allowed a ‘poisonous root to spring up’ and defile him, resulting in his deviation and in his accepting, not God’s direction, but the Devil’s leading in a course of thievery and treachery.

By the time such deviation reached a certain point, Jesus himself could read Judas’ heart and foretell his betrayal.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/106/0" data-bid="107-1" class="b">Joh 13:10, 11</a>.</p>

<strong>Always Throw Your Burden on Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">This brings us to the episode that prompted David to write <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Psalm 55</a>.

<strong>“Throw Your Burden Upon Jehovah”—How?</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Why did David find himself in this condition? Because of his foes.

<strong>Foreknowledge, Foreordination</strong><br/><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="sb">Paul’s quotations concerning Jehovah’s ‘love for Jacob [Israel] and his hatred for Esau [Edom]’ comes from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/76/0" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Malachi 1:2, 3</a>, written long after Jacob and Esau’s time. So the Bible does not necessarily say that Jehovah held such opinion of the twins before their birth. It is a scientifically established fact that much of a child’s general disposition and temperament are determined at the time of conception, due to the genetic factors contributed by each parent. That God can see such factors is self-evident; David speaks of Jehovah as seeing “even the embryo of me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/77/0" data-bid="78-1" class="b">Ps. 139:14-16</a>; see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/78/0" data-bid="79-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 11:5</a>.) To what extent such divine insight affected Jehovah’s foreordination concerning the two boys cannot be said, but, at any rate, his choice of Jacob over Esau did not of itself doom Esau or his descendants, the Edomites, to destruction. Even individuals from among the accursed Canaanites gained the privilege of association with God’s covenant people and received blessings. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/79/0" data-bid="80-1" class="b">Gen. 9:25-27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/79/1" data-bid="80-2" class="b"> Josh. 9:27</a>; see CANAAN, CANAANITE.) The “change of mind” that Esau earnestly sought with tears, however, was only an unsuccessful attempt to change his father Isaac’s decision that the firstborn’s special blessing should remain entirely with Jacob. Hence, this indicated no repentance before <span id="page598" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="598" data-before-text="598"></span>God on Esau’s part as to his materialistic attitude.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/80/0" data-bid="81-1" class="b">Gen. 27:32-34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/80/1" data-bid="81-2" class="b"> Heb. 12:16, 17</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="sb">Jehovah’s prophecy concerning Josiah called for some descendant of David to be so named, and foretold his acting against false worship in the city of Bethel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/81/0" data-bid="82-1" class="b">1 Ki. 13:1, 2</a>) Over three centuries later a king so named fulfilled this prophecy. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/82/0" data-bid="83-1" class="b">2 Ki. 22:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/82/1" data-bid="83-2" class="b"> 23:15, 16</a>) On the other hand, he failed to heed a warning from God spoken through Pharaoh Necho, and this led to his being killed. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/83/0" data-bid="84-1" class="b">2 Chron. 35:20-24</a>) Hence, while foreknown by God and foreordained to do a particular work, Josiah was still a free moral agent able to choose to heed or disregard divine guidance.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="sb">Similarly, Jehovah foretold nearly two centuries beforehand that he would use a conqueror named Cyrus to effect the release of the Jews from Babylon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/84/0" data-bid="85-1" class="b">Isa. 44:26-28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/84/1" data-bid="85-2" class="b"> 45:1-6</a>) But the Persian to whom that name eventually was given in fulfillment of divine prophecy is not stated in the Bible to have become a genuine worshiper of Jehovah, and secular history shows him continuing his worship of pagan gods.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sb">These cases of foreknowledge prior to the individual’s birth thus do not conflict with God’s revealed qualities and announced standards. Nor is there any indication that God coerced the individuals to act against their own will. In the cases of Pharaoh, Judas Iscariot, and God’s own Son, there is no evidence that Jehovah’s foreknowledge was exercised prior to the person’s coming into existence. Within these individual cases certain principles are illustrated, bearing on God’s foreknowledge and foreordination.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="sb">One such principle is God’s testing of individuals by causing or allowing certain circumstances or events, or by causing such individuals to hear his inspired messages, the result being that they are obliged to exercise their free choice to make a decision and thus reveal a definite heart attitude, read by Jehovah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/85/0" data-bid="86-1" class="b">Prov. 15:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/85/1" data-bid="86-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 1:6, 7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/85/2" data-bid="86-3" class="b"> Heb. 4:12, 13</a>) According to the way the individuals respond, God can also mold them in the course they have selected of their own volition.

A contrasting case is that of the unresponsive Pharaoh of the Exodus. Jehovah foreknew that Pharaoh would refuse permission for the Israelites to leave “except by a strong hand” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/90/0" data-bid="91-1" class="b">Ex. 3:19, 20</a>), and foreordained the plague resulting in the death of the firstborn. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/91/0" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Ex. 4:22, 23</a>) The apostle Paul’s discussion of God’s dealings with Pharaoh is often incorrectly understood to mean that God arbitrarily hardens the heart of individuals according to his foreordained purpose, without regard for the individual’s prior inclination or heart attitude. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/92/0" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Rom. 9:14-18</a>) Likewise, according to many translations, God advised Moses that he would “harden [Pharaoh’s] heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/93/0" data-bid="94-1" class="b">Ex. 4:21</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/94/0" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Exodus 9:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/94/1" data-bid="95-2" class="b"> 10:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/94/2" data-bid="95-3" class="b"> 27</a>.) However, some translations render the Hebrew account to read that Jehovah “let [Pharaoh’s] heart wax bold” (<em>Ro</em>); “let [Pharaoh’s] heart became obstinate.” (<em>NW</em>) In support of such rendering<em>,</em> the Appendix to Rotherham’s translation shows that in Hebrew the <em>occasion</em> or <em>permission</em> of an event is often presented as if it were the <em>cause</em> of the event, and that “even <em>positive commands</em> are occasionally to be accepted as meaning no more than <em>permission.”</em> Thus at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/95/0" data-bid="96-1" class="b">Exodus 1:17</a> the original Hebrew text literally says that the midwives “caused the male children to live,” whereas in reality they <em>permitted</em> them to live by refraining from putting them to death. After quoting Hebrew scholars M. M. Kalisch, H. F. W. Gesenius, and B. Davies in support, Rotherham states that the Hebrew sense of the texts involving Pharaoh is that “God permitted Pharaoh to harden his own heart—spared him—gave him the opportunity, the occasion, of working out the wickedness that was in him. That is all.”—<em>The Emphasised Bible,</em> by J. B. Rotherham, Appendix, p. 919; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/96/0" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Isaiah 10:5-7</a>.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="sb">Corroborating this understanding is the fact that the record definitely shows that Pharaoh himself “hardened his heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/97/0" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Ex. 8:15,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/97/1" data-bid="98-2" class="b"> 32</a>, <em>AV</em>; “made his heart unresponsive,” <em>NW</em>) He thus exercised his own will and followed his own stubborn inclination, the results of which inclination Jehovah accurately foresaw and predicted. The repeated opportunities given him by Jehovah obliged Pharaoh to make decisions and in doing so he became hardened in his attitude. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/98/0" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 8:11, 12</a>.) As the apostle Paul shows by quoting <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/99/0" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Exodus 9:16</a>, Jehovah allowed the matter to develop in this way to the full length of ten plagues in order to make manifest his own power and cause his name to be made known earth wide.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/100/0" data-bid="101-1" class="b">Rom. 9:17, 18</a>.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sb">The traitorous course of Judas Iscariot fulfilled divine prophecy and demonstrated Jehovah’s foreknowledge, and also that of his Son. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/101/0" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Ps. 41:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/101/1" data-bid="102-2" class="b"> 55:12, 13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/101/2" data-bid="102-3" class="b"> 109:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/101/3" data-bid="102-4" class="b"> Acts 1:16-20</a>) Yet it cannot be said that God foreordained or predestinated Judas himself to such a course. The prophecies foretold that some intimate acquaintance of Jesus would be his betrayer, but did not specify which of those sharing such acquaintance it would be. Again, Bible principles rule against God’s having foreordained Judas’ actions. The divine standard stated by the apostle is: “Never lay your hands hastily upon any man; neither be a sharer in the sins of others; preserve yourself chaste.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/102/0" data-bid="103-1" class="b">1 Tim. 5:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/102/1" data-bid="103-2" class="b"> compare 3:6</a>.) Evidencing his concern that the selection of his twelve apostles be wisely and properly made, Jesus spent the night in prayer to his Father before making known his decision. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/103/0" data-bid="104-1" class="b">Luke 6:12-16</a>) If Judas were already divinely foreordained to be a traitor, this would result in inconsistency in God’s direction and guidance and, according to the rule, would make him a sharer in the sins that one committed.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sb">Thus, it seems evident that at the time of his being selected as an apostle, Judas’ heart presented no definite evidence of a treasonous attitude. He allowed a ‘poisonous root to spring up’ and defile him, resulting in his deviation and in his accepting, not God’s direction, but the Devil’s leading in a course of thievery and treachery. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/104/0" data-bid="105-1" class="b">Heb. 12:14, 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/104/1" data-bid="105-2" class="b"> John 13:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/104/2" data-bid="105-3" class="b"> Acts 1:24, 25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/104/3" data-bid="105-4" class="b"> Jas. 1:14, 15</a>; see JUDAS No. 4.) By the time such deviation reached a certain point, Jesus himself could read Judas’ heart and foretell his betrayal.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/105/0" data-bid="106-1" class="b">John 13:10, 11</a>.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="sb">True, in the account at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/106/0" data-bid="107-1" class="b">John 6:64</a>, on the occasion of some disciples stumbling over certain teachings of Jesus, we read that “from the beginning [“from the outset,” <em>JB</em>] Jesus knew who were the ones not believing and who was the one that would betray him.” While the word “beginning” (Greek, <em>ar·kheʹ</em>) is used at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/107/0" data-bid="108-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:4</a> to refer to the start of creation, it can also refer to other times.

<strong>Make Friends for Yourselves</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> A real friend, then, sticks closer than a brother and is constant in his loyalty and friendliness. He is not warm and friendly one day and cold and aloof the next; as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:17</a> says: “A true <span id="page105" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="105" data-before-text="105"></span>companion is loving all the time, and is a brother that is born for when there is distress.” A real friend comes to the aid of his companion that is in distress. In this regard we can learn much about friendship from the example of Jonathan and David. Those qualities of love, loyalty and unselfishness and others that make up true friendship are all found in this outstanding example: “Jonathan’s very soul became bound up with the soul of David, and Jonathan began to love him as his own soul. And Jonathan and David proceeded to conclude a covenant, because of his loving him as his own soul. Further, Jonathan stripped himself of the sleeveless coat that was on him and gave it to David, and also his garments, and even his sword and his bow and his belt.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Sam. 18:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 3, 4</a>) Later, after Jonathan’s death at the battle of Mount Gilboa, David deeply lamented the loss of his friend and said: “I am distressed over you, my brother Jonathan, very pleasant you were to me. More wonderful was your love to me than the love from women.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Sam. 1:26</a>) From this example it is clear that “there exists a friend sticking closer than a brother.”</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 5, 6. What must be the underlying foundation for every reliable friendship, and what examples show this?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> But, now, what made such an outstanding friendship possible? Mutual love for and devotion and loyalty to Jehovah God! Hence it has been said: “No friendship on pagan soil can rival the qualities displayed by Jonathan and David: ‘the best that Greece and Rome have to show of friendships looks pale beside this.’”<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1962122/0">a</a> The unselfishness and loyalty shown by Jonathan arose out of his putting Jehovah God and His will first. Being Saul’s son, Jonathan was in line for the kingship. Yet when Jehovah removed his favor from King Saul and placed it upon David, bypassing Jonathan, the natural heir to the throne, Jonathan did not hate David, viewing him as a rival to be eliminated, as did Saul. But, recognizing that Jehovah’s favor was on David, Jonathan theocratically submitted to the divine arrangement. Only by both David’s and Jonathan’s putting loyalty to Jehovah God first was their marvelous friendship possible. It is true, then: Without that primary love for and loyalty to Jehovah God, the foundation for any human friendship lies on sandy ground.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> David also had experience with false friends. Ahithophel, David’s astute counselor, was among those “companions disposed to break one another to pieces.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Sam. 15:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Ps. 41:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 55:12-14</a>) Those friends of David who turned disloyal lost their love and exclusive devotion to Jehovah, the real King of Israel. On the other hand, because of having these very qualities, Ruth, the Moabitess, displayed loyal friendship for Naomi. “As for Ruth, she stuck with her.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ruth 1:14</a>) Unswerving devotion to Jehovah God must be the underlying foundation for every lasting and reliable friendship.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>SELECTING THE RIGHT FRIENDS FOR OURSELVES</strong></p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 7. (a) What should the right kind of friend be able to do?

Only lovers of Jehovah can do this. Let us learn a lesson from the mistake made by King Jehoshaphat of Judah. This king, upon whom Jehovah had bestowed his friendship, made the mistake of associating with one who was no friend of God, King Ahab of Israel. This wicked king asked Jehoshaphat to join him in an expedition for the recovery of Ramoth-gilead. Jehoshaphat agreed. Though the prophets of Baal predicted success for the expedition, Micaiah, the only prophet of Jehovah obtainable, <span id="page106" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="106" data-before-text="106"></span>foretold the death of Ahab. Going into battle, Ahab disguised himself; but he had proposed that the king of Judah should put on his royal robes, thus becoming a mark for every missile. In the thick of the battle royally attired Jehoshaphat found every warrior of Syria turned against him, thinking him to be the king of Israel. “Jehoshaphat began to cry for aid, and Jehovah himself helped him, and God at once allured them away from him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Chron. 18:31</a>) True to the words of Jehovah’s prophet, Ahab met his doom, a certain man bending his bow in his innocence and shooting an arrow into the king of Israel, so that he died. When the king of Judah returned to Jerusalem, Jehu the son of Hanani the visionary said to King Jehoshaphat: “Is it to the wicked that help is to be given, and is it for those hating Jehovah that you should have love? And for this there is indignation against you from the person of Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Chron. 19:2</a>.</p>

<strong>The Traitorous “Evil Slave” and His Prototypes</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">What causes a person to become a traitor is well illustrated by proud and greedy Ahithophel. A traitor is often uncommonly brilliant; what he lacks is honesty and love. Such a traitor was Ahithophel, counselor of King David, concerning whom it was written: “The counsel of Ahithophel, with which he counseled in those days, was just as when a man would inquire of the word of The true God. That was the way all the counsel of <span id="page408" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="408" data-before-text="408"></span>Ahithophel was both to David and to Absalom.” Why did he turn traitor? The record does not state, but the inference is clear that Ahithophel joined the insurrection of Absalom against his father King David because it seemed quite certain that Absalom would win out. But Jehovah saw to it that things turned out differently.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Sam. 16:23</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Absalom, a favorite son of King David, was a most handsome man. At one time he had been banished for having murdered one of his half brothers for having violated his sister Tamar. David mercifully forgave him and restored him to the court. In rank ingratitude for this mercy Absalom schemed to turn the hearts of the people away from his father and then hatched a conspiracy to usurp his father’s throne, succeeding in persuading even Ahithophel to join him. When David heard about this he prayed: “Turn, please, the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness, O Jehovah!”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Sam. 15:12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 31</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The blackness of Ahithophel is recorded for us in one of David’s psalms: “For it was not an enemy that proceeded to reproach me; otherwise I could put up with it. It was not an intense hater of me that assumed great airs against me; otherwise I could conceal myself from him. But it was you, a mortal man who was as my equal, one familiar to me and my acquaintance, because we used to enjoy sweet intimacy together; into the house of God we used to walk with the throng. He has thrust out his hands against those at peace with him; he has profaned his covenant. Smoother than butter are the words of his mouth, but his heart is disposed to fight. His words are softer than oil, but they are drawn swords.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 55:12-14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 20, 21</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">In addition to praying to God to thwart the counsel of Ahithophel, David did what he could do to that end, namely, he sent his counselor Hushai to feign loyalty to Absalom and offset the wise counsel of Ahithophel. In this way Jehovah answered David’s prayer, for when Ahithophel gave good advice, Hushai counseled otherwise and Absalom heeded Hushai. The result was that Absalom lost the initiative and in the end also lost his life. As for vain and proud Ahithophel, when he saw his good advice spurned, he returned home, “gave orders to his household and strangled himself and thus died.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Sam. 17:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 23</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>JUDAS ISCARIOT</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Ahithophel was a fitting prototype of the most infamous, the most notorious traitor of all time, Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus Christ, the Son of God, for a paltry thirty pieces of silver. Judas Iscariot had been chosen to be one of the twelve apostles after Jesus had spent all night in prayer and so, without doubt, his heart was not bad at that time or Jesus would not have chosen him to be one of the honored twelve. But gradually this honored one let selfishness enter his heart. It appears that he was a Judean, whereas the rest of the twelve were Galileans, and Judeans did think themselves to be much better than the Galileans.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Judas Iscariot had been appointed treasurer of the group that followed Jesus, particularly the twelve, quite likely because of his having a better education. As time went on, however, he let selfishness get the upper hand. Being fully trusted, he saw how he could steal from the general fund without anyone knowing about it, and he did not scruple to yield to this temptation. As his heart went bad, Jesus noticed it, and so we read that “initially Jesus knew who were the ones not believing and who was the one that would betray him.” “I chose you twelve, did I not? Yet one of <span id="page409" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="409" data-before-text="409"></span>you is a slanderer,” or devil.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 6:64,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 70</a>.</p>

When David heard about this he prayed: “Turn, please, the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness, O Jehovah!”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Sam. 15:12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 31</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The blackness of Ahithophel is recorded for us in one of David’s psalms: “For it was not an enemy that proceeded to reproach me; otherwise I could put up with it. It was not an intense hater of me that assumed great airs against me; otherwise I could conceal myself from him. But it was you, a mortal man who was as my equal, one familiar to me and my acquaintance, because we used to enjoy sweet intimacy together; into the house of God we used to walk with the throng. He has thrust out his hands against those at peace with him; he has profaned his covenant. Smoother than butter are the words of his mouth, but his heart is disposed to fight. His words are softer than oil, but they are drawn swords.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 55:12-14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 20, 21</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">In addition to praying to God to thwart the counsel of Ahithophel, David did what he could do to that end, namely, he sent his counselor Hushai to feign loyalty to Absalom and offset the wise counsel of Ahithophel. In this way Jehovah answered David’s prayer, for when Ahithophel gave good advice, Hushai counseled otherwise and Absalom heeded Hushai. The result was that Absalom lost the initiative and in the end also lost his life. As for vain and proud Ahithophel, when he saw his good advice spurned, he returned home, “gave orders to his household and strangled himself and thus died.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Sam. 17:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 23</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>JUDAS ISCARIOT</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Ahithophel was a fitting prototype of the most infamous, the most notorious traitor of all time, Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus Christ, the Son of God, for a paltry thirty pieces of silver. Judas Iscariot had been chosen to be one of the twelve apostles after Jesus had spent all night in prayer and so, without doubt, his heart was not bad at that time or Jesus would not have chosen him to be one of the honored twelve. But gradually this honored one let selfishness enter his heart. It appears that he was a Judean, whereas the rest of the twelve were Galileans, and Judeans did think themselves to be much better than the Galileans.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Judas Iscariot had been appointed treasurer of the group that followed Jesus, particularly the twelve, quite likely because of his having a better education. As time went on, however, he let selfishness get the upper hand. Being fully trusted, he saw how he could steal from the general fund without anyone knowing about it, and he did not scruple to yield to this temptation. As his heart went bad, Jesus noticed it, and so we read that “initially Jesus knew who were the ones not believing and who was the one that would betray him.” “I chose you twelve, did I not?

<strong>Part Two</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> There was a man who was high in honor in the court of King David. That man was Ahithophel, the intimate adviser of David. “The counsel of Ahithophel, with which he counseled in those days, was just as when a man would inquire of the word of the true God. That was the way all the counsel of Ahithophel was both to David and to Absalom.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965083/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Sam. 16:23</a>) However, <span id="page84" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="84" data-before-text="84"></span>Ahithophel turned traitor to King David and joined in the revolt of his son Absalom.</p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">18.

(b) In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965083/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Psalm 55:13-16</a>, what punishment did David pray to befall the treacherous one?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> In Absalom’s chamber of counselors God caused the wily counsel of Ahithophel to be frustrated. Hence, Ahithophel went off and committed suicide, hanging himself. “So he was buried in the burial place of his forefathers.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965083/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">2 Sam. 17:23</a>) The treacherous person referred to by King David in Psalm Fifty-five is understood to be Ahithophel. Concerning the treacherous friend, David says under inspiration: “But it was you, a mortal man who was as my equal, one familiar to me and my acquaintance, because we used to enjoy sweet intimacy together; into the house of God we use to walk with the throng. Desolations be upon them! Let them go down into Sheol alive; for during their alien residence bad things have been within them. As for me, to God I shall call out; and Jehovah himself will save me.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965083/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ps. 55:13-16</a>.</p><p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu">19.

So Ahithophel was a traitor, not to the Messiah or Christ himself, but to one who was merely a type of the Messiah. In harmony with this fact David’s prayer was that those like Ahithophel committing treachery against him should go down alive into Sheol, just as the household of Korah, Dathan and Abiram had done in Moses’ day. However, Ahithophel was a prototype of Judas Iscariot, who betrayed the real Christ to his enemies for thirty silver pieces of money. Hence, the crime of Judas Iscariot was far more serious than that of Ahithophel, and Jesus called Judas, not the son of Sheol, but “the son of destruction.”<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965083/1">b</a> Jesus also called him a “slanderer” or a “devil.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965083/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">John 17:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965083/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 6:70, 71</a>) The destruction of Judas bars any resurrection for him.</p><p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="qu">20.

So he let others bring them down to Sheol sooner than necessary. Among persons used as tools for bringing about a man’s premature descent into the common grave of dead mankind has been the harlot or prostitute. Concerning her <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965083/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Proverbs 5:5, 6</a> warns us in these words: “Her feet are descending to death. Her very steps take hold on Sheol itself. The path of life she does not contemplate.” Thus, if we follow her, we know where we shall end up—in death, in Sheol. So do not go to her house or district: “The ways to Sheol her house is; they are descending to the interior rooms of death.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965083/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Prov. 7:27</a>) For this reason many men have gone to Sheol or Haʹdes early because of their immorality.</p><p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="qu">21.

The false god worshiped in such a temple cannot save the worshiper from the disastrous results of a course of immorality, even when religiously performed.</p>

<strong>The Traitorous “Evil Slave” and His Prototypes</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">What causes a person to become a traitor is well illustrated by proud and greedy Ahithophel. A traitor is often uncommonly brilliant; what he lacks is honesty and love. Such a traitor was Ahithophel, counselor of King David, concerning whom it was written: “The counsel of Ahithophel, with which he counseled in those days, was just as when a man would inquire of the word of The true God. That was the way all the counsel of <span id="page408" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="408" data-before-text="408"></span>Ahithophel was both to David and to Absalom.” Why did he turn traitor? The record does not state, but the inference is clear that Ahithophel joined the insurrection of Absalom against his father King David because it seemed quite certain that Absalom would win out. But Jehovah saw to it that things turned out differently.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Sam. 16:23</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Absalom, a favorite son of King David, was a most handsome man. At one time he had been banished for having murdered one of his half brothers for having violated his sister Tamar. David mercifully forgave him and restored him to the court. In rank ingratitude for this mercy Absalom schemed to turn the hearts of the people away from his father and then hatched a conspiracy to usurp his father’s throne, succeeding in persuading even Ahithophel to join him. When David heard about this he prayed: “Turn, please, the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness, O Jehovah!”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Sam. 15:12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 31</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The blackness of Ahithophel is recorded for us in one of David’s psalms: “For it was not an enemy that proceeded to reproach me; otherwise I could put up with it.

<strong>Why Be Honest?</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Most people today do not think it makes sense to tell the truth all the time. Many businessmen claim they could not compete successfully without some dishonesty. Daily, advertisements come into our view that exaggerate or misrepresent. Though political leaders bear the serious charge of watching over the public’s general welfare, most people view their word as often untrustworthy.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Seeing so much dishonesty among adults, young people often adopt the same course. In school, many cheat at tests or cut classes under false pretenses. With friends, they may boast, brag and otherwise paint false pictures of what they are or have done. At home, they may even deceive their parents​—answering questions about their conduct with half-truths, hiding the facts by phrasing their answer so it gives an entirely different impression from the true one. If their parents, or others rightly concerned about their welfare, try to find out how they feel about immorality or drugs or similar things, they may give them “a snow job” to cover over the facts, saying what they think those questioning them <em>want</em> to hear, not necessarily the truth of how they really feel. To get money or permission to do something, they may “butter up” a parent with insincere affection or with flattery.​—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974284/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 55:21</a>.</p>

<strong>Burial Places of the Kings, or, of David</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Righteous High Priest Jehoiada was accorded the <span id="page270" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="270" data-before-text="270"></span>honor of a burial in the “city of David along with the kings,” the only person not of the royal line mentioned as receiving such distinction.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010831/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Chron. 24:15, 16</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The location of these royal burial places has not been determined. On the basis of the reference to the “Burial Places of David” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010831/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Nehemiah 3:16</a> and the mention of the “ascent to the burial places of the sons of David” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010831/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 32:33</a>, some believe the likely location to have been on the SE hill of the city near the Kidron valley. A number of what appear to be ancient rock-cut tombs have been found along a 350-foot (106.1-meter) strip of ground in this area, their entrances being in the form of sunken rectangular shafts. However, no positive identification can be made, such effort being complicated, not only due to the destruction of the city in the year 70 C.E. and again in 135 C.E., but also because the southern part of the city was used by the Romans as a stone quarry. Hence, the above-mentioned tombs are in a greatly deteriorated state.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The mausoleum of Queen Helena of Adiabene, located in the N of the modern city of Jerusalem, has acquired the misleading name of the “Tombs of the Kings.” It was actually built in the first century C.E. and should not be confused with the royal burial grounds mentioned in the Bible account.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010831/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ezekiel 43:7-9</a> Jehovah condemned the house of Israel and their kings for defiling his holy name by “their fornication and by the carcasses of their kings at their death,” and said, “Now let them remove their fornication and the carcasses of their kings far from me, and I shall certainly reside in the midst of them to time indefinite.” Some commentators have taken this to indicate that the Jews were guilty of having made the burial places of certain kings near the temple area. About twenty Hebrew manuscripts and editions and the Targums contain the phrase “at their death,” while the Masoretic text reads, instead, “their high places,” and the <em>Septuagint Version</em> says “in the midst of them.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Even if the phrase “at their death” is the correct reading here, this seems to be no solid basis for believing that any of the kings of Judah were buried near the temple grounds. Since the dead body of a person was unclean according to the Law, to bury anyone near the temple would be an open affront to God, and such an obvious and gross violation of the temple’s sanctity is not even hinted at in the histories of the kings. Those kings not accorded a burial in the “burial places of the kings” or “of the sons of David” are not likely to have been given a more exalted place of burial, such as near the temple, but, rather, a less prominent and less honorable place.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">A closer consideration of the text indicates that the discussion involved idolatry and that, even as the “fornication” is primarily figurative, so too the “carcasses of their kings” represent the dead idols that the house of Israel and their rulers had worshiped. Thus, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010831/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Leviticus 26:30</a> Jehovah warned the Israelites that their disobedience would cause him to “annihilate your sacred high places and cut off your incense stands and lay your own carcasses upon <em>the carcasses of your dungy idols.”</em> (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010831/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Jeremiah 16:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010831/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Ezekiel 6:4-6</a>.) The record shows that such idols were introduced into the temple area. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010831/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ezek. 8:5-17</a>) It may also be noted that some of these idol gods were designated as kings, the word for “king” being included within the names Molech (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010831/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Ki. 11:7</a>), Milcom (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010831/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Ki. 11:5</a>), and Malcham. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010831/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Jer. 49:1</a>) Concerning the idol gods of the northern kingdom the prophet <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010831/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Amos (5:26</a>) wrote: “And you will certainly carry Sakkuth your king and Kaiwan, your images, the star of your god, whom you made for yourselves.” So, there seems to be greater weight for viewing the text as being a condemnation of idolatry rather than of a desecration of the dedicated ground by improper burial of literal rulers.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"></p>

<strong>The Traitorous “Evil Slave” and His Prototypes</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">What causes a person to become a traitor is well illustrated by proud and greedy Ahithophel. A traitor is often uncommonly brilliant; what he lacks is honesty and love. Such a traitor was Ahithophel, counselor of King David, concerning whom it was written: “The counsel of Ahithophel, with which he counseled in those days, was just as when a man would inquire of the word of The true God. That was the way all the counsel of <span id="page408" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="408" data-before-text="408"></span>Ahithophel was both to David and to Absalom.” Why did he turn traitor? The record does not state, but the inference is clear that Ahithophel joined the insurrection of Absalom against his father King David because it seemed quite certain that Absalom would win out. But Jehovah saw to it that things turned out differently.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Sam. 16:23</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Absalom, a favorite son of King David, was a most handsome man. At one time he had been banished for having murdered one of his half brothers for having violated his sister Tamar. David mercifully forgave him and restored him to the court. In rank ingratitude for this mercy Absalom schemed to turn the hearts of the people away from his father and then hatched a conspiracy to usurp his father’s throne, succeeding in persuading even Ahithophel to join him. When David heard about this he prayed: “Turn, please, the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness, O Jehovah!”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Sam. 15:12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 31</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The blackness of Ahithophel is recorded for us in one of David’s psalms: “For it was not an enemy that proceeded to reproach me; otherwise I could put up with it. It was not an intense hater of me that assumed great airs against me; otherwise I could conceal myself from him. But it was you, a mortal man who was as my equal, one familiar to me and my acquaintance, because we used to enjoy sweet intimacy together; into the house of God we used to walk with the throng. He has thrust out his hands against those at peace with him; he has profaned his covenant. Smoother than butter are the words of his mouth, but his heart is disposed to fight. His words are softer than oil, but they are drawn swords.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 55:12-14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 20, 21</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">In addition to praying to God to thwart the counsel of Ahithophel, David did what he could do to that end, namely, he sent his counselor Hushai to feign loyalty to Absalom and offset the wise counsel of Ahithophel. In this way Jehovah answered David’s prayer, for when Ahithophel gave good advice, Hushai counseled otherwise and Absalom heeded Hushai. The result was that Absalom lost the initiative and in the end also lost his life. As for vain and proud Ahithophel, when he saw his good advice spurned, he returned home, “gave orders to his household and strangled himself and thus died.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Sam. 17:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 23</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>JUDAS ISCARIOT</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Ahithophel was a fitting prototype of the most infamous, the most notorious traitor of all time, Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus Christ, the Son of God, for a paltry thirty pieces of silver. Judas Iscariot had been chosen to be one of the twelve apostles after Jesus had spent all night in prayer and so, without doubt, his heart was not bad at that time or Jesus would not have chosen him to be one of the honored twelve. But gradually this honored one let selfishness enter his heart. It appears that he was a Judean, whereas the rest of the twelve were Galileans, and Judeans did think themselves to be much better than the Galileans.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Judas Iscariot had been appointed treasurer of the group that followed Jesus, particularly the twelve, quite likely because of his having a better education. As time went on, however, he let selfishness get the upper hand. Being fully trusted, he saw how he could steal from the general fund without anyone knowing about it, and he did not scruple to yield to this temptation. As his heart went bad, Jesus noticed it, and so we read that “initially Jesus knew who were the ones not believing and who was the one that would betray him.” “I chose you twelve, did I not? Yet one of <span id="page409" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="409" data-before-text="409"></span>you is a slanderer,” or devil.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 6:64,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961486/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 70</a>.</p>

<strong>Burden</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The person faithful to God can throw his figurative burden, or the lot that has been given to him in such things as trials and cares, upon Jehovah. Thus, David declared: “Throw your burden upon Jehovah himself, and he himself will sustain you. Never will he allow the righteous one to totter.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000841/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps 55:22</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000841/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1Pe 5:6, 7</a>.)

<strong>The Bible Can Help You Find Joy</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><strong>“Throw your burden upon Jehovah himself, and he himself will sustain you.”</strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005561/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 55:22</a>) First and foremost, prayer can help us find true joy. Simone says: “Whenever I feel discouraged, I turn to Jehovah and ask for his help. I have never been in a situation where I have not felt his strength and his guidance.” When the psalmist urges us to throw our burden on Jehovah, he is in effect reminding us that Jehovah not only cares about us but also views us as individuals worthy of his help and support. On the night of the Passover 33 C.E., Jesus’ disciples were grieved because of what Jesus said about his impending departure. Jesus urged them to pray to the Father, and then he added: “Ask and you will receive, that your joy may be made full.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005561/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 16:23, 24</a>.</p>

<strong>Do Not Be Overcome by Anxiety</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>Help Is Available</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">When facing problems a child can go to a loving father and receive direction and comfort. Similarly, we can go to our heavenly Father, Jehovah, with our problems. In fact, <span id="page23" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>Jehovah invites us to throw our burdens and anxieties upon him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999203/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 55:22</a>) Like a child who no longer worries about his problems after he has received assurances from his father, we should not only throw our burdens upon Jehovah but also leave them with him.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999203/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">James 1:6</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">How do we throw our anxieties upon Jehovah? <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999203/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Philippians 4:6, 7</a> answers: “Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God; and the peace of God that excels all thought will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.” Yes, in response to our persistent prayers and supplications, Jehovah can give us an inner calm that protects our minds from being disturbed by unnecessary anxieties.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999203/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Jeremiah 17:7, 8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999203/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Matthew 6:25-34</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">To work in harmony with our prayers, though, we should not isolate ourselves either physically or mentally. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999203/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Proverbs 18:1</a>) Rather, we would do well to consider Bible principles and directions that touch on our problem, thus avoiding reliance upon our own understanding. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999203/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:5, 6</a>) Young and old alike can turn to the Bible and Watch Tower publications for a wealth of information on making decisions and dealing with problems. Additionally, in the Christian congregation, we are blessed with wise and experienced elders and other mature Christians who are always willing to talk to us. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999203/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Proverbs 11:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999203/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 15:22</a>) Those who are not emotionally involved and who have God’s mind on a matter can often help us to look at our problems from a different perspective.

If anxiety over what might happen makes us feel apprehensive and uneasy, then let us turn to Jehovah in prayer and supplication. Look to his Word and organization for direction, wisdom, and soundness of mind. We will find that whatever circumstance may arise, there is help available to deal with it.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Feeling heavy of heart and agitated, the psalmist sang: “Why are you in despair, O my soul, and why are you boisterous within me?

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page27" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span><strong>Always Throw Your Burden on Jehovah</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">MANY today feel crushed by burdens. Economic hardships, distressing family problems, health problems, pain and suffering due to oppression and tyranny, and a host of other afflictions hang like millstones around their necks. Besides these external pressures, some also feel weighed down by a sense of personal worthlessness and failure because of their own imperfections. Many are tempted to give up the fight altogether. How can you cope when burdens seem unbearable?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">At one time King David of Israel felt that the pressure was almost unbearable. According to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 55</a>, he was driven to distraction by anxiety because of pressures and animosity from his enemies. He felt great heartache and fear. He could only groan in his grief. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 55:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 17</a>) Despite all his distress, however, he found a way to cope. How? He looked to his God for support. His advice to others who might feel as he did was: “Throw your burden upon Jehovah himself.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 55:22</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">What did he mean by “throw your burden upon Jehovah himself”? Is it simply a matter of going to Jehovah in prayer and expressing our anxiety? Or can we do something ourselves to help relieve the situation? What if we feel too unworthy to approach Jehovah? We can find out what David meant by looking at some experiences he would have remembered vividly when he penned those words.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>Do Things in Jehovah’s Strength</strong></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Do you recall how Goliath struck fear into the hearts of the fighting men of Israel? This giant of a man, over nine feet <strong>[over 2.7 m]</strong> tall, terrified them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Samuel 17:4-11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 24</a>) But David was not afraid. Why? Because he did not try to deal with Goliath in his own strength. From the time he was anointed as Israel’s future king, he had allowed God’s spirit to direct him and strengthen him in all he did. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Samuel 16:13</a>) So he said to Goliath: “I am coming to you with the name of Jehovah of armies, the God of the battle lines of Israel, whom you have taunted. This day Jehovah will surrender you into my hand.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Samuel 17:45, 46</a>) David was skilled as a slinger, but we can be sure that Jehovah’s holy spirit guided and made more lethal the stone he slung at Goliath.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Samuel 17:48-51</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">David coped with this immense challenge and came off victorious by having confidence that God would support and strengthen him. He had developed a good, trusting relationship with God. This was no doubt strengthened by the way Jehovah had delivered him earlier. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Samuel <span id="page28" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>17:34-37</a>) Like David, you can maintain a strong personal relationship with Jehovah and have complete confidence in his ability and willingness to strengthen and sustain you in all circumstances.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 34:7, 8</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>Do What You Can to Solve the Problem</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">This does not mean, however, that there will never be times of intense pain, anxiety, and even fear, as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 55</a> clearly shows. Some years after this fearless display of confidence in Jehovah, for example, David experienced great fear in the face of his enemies. He lost favor with King Saul and had to flee for his life. Try to imagine the emotional turmoil this must have caused David, the questions it must have raised in his mind about the outworking of Jehovah’s purpose. After all, he had been anointed as the future king in Israel, yet here he was having to survive as a fugitive in the wilderness, hunted like a wild animal. When he tried to find refuge in the city of Gath, the hometown of Goliath, he was recognized. With what result? The record says that “he became very much afraid.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Samuel 21:10-12</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">But he did not allow his fear and deep anxiety to stop him from looking to Jehovah for help. According to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 34</a> (written as a consequence of this experience), David said: “I inquired of Jehovah, and he answered me, and out of all my frights he delivered me. This afflicted one called, and Jehovah himself heard. And out of all his distresses He saved him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 34:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 6</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Jehovah supported him, of course. Yet notice that David did not just sit back and wait for Jehovah to rescue him. He recognized the need for him to do all that he could under the circumstances to get out of the difficult situation. He acknowledged Jehovah’s hand in his deliverance, but he himself took action, feigning insanity so that the king of Gath did not kill him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Samuel 21:14–22:1</a>) We too need to do all we can to cope with burdens, rather than just wait for Jehovah to rescue us.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">James 1:5, 6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 2:26</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>Do Not Add to Your Burdens</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">David learned another lesson, a painful one, later in his life. What was it? That sometimes we add to our own burdens. Following victory over the Philistines, things went wrong for David when he decided to move the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem. The historical account tells us: “Then David and all the people that were with him rose up and went to Baale-judah to bring up from there the ark of the true God . . . However, they had the ark of the true God ride upon a new wagon, . . . and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were leading the new wagon.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Samuel 6:2, 3</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Using a wagon to transport the Ark violated all the instructions that Jehovah <span id="page29" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>had given regarding it. It was clearly stated that the only authorized bearers, the Kohathite Levites, should carry the Ark on their shoulders, using poles placed through the rings specially built into the Ark. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Exodus 25:13, 14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Numbers 4:15,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/16/2" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/16/3" data-bid="17-4" class="b"> 7:7-9</a>) Ignoring these instructions brought calamity. When the cattle pulling the wagon nearly caused it to tip over, Uzzah, who was likely a Levite but certainly not a priest, reached out to steady the Ark and was struck down by Jehovah for his irreverence.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Samuel 6:6, 7</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">David as king had to bear some responsibility for this. His reaction shows that even those who have a good relationship with Jehovah can occasionally react badly to trialsome situations. First David became angry. Then he grew afraid. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Samuel 6:8, 9</a>) His trusting relationship with Jehovah was severely tested. Here was an occasion when seemingly he failed to throw his burden on Jehovah, when he did not follow his commands. Might that be the situation with us sometimes? Do we ever blame Jehovah for problems that result because we ignore his instructions?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Proverbs 19:3</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>Coping With the Burden of Guilt</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Later, David created a huge burden of guilt for himself by sinning grievously against Jehovah’s moral standards. On this occasion David had abdicated his responsibility to lead his men in battle. He stayed in Jerusalem while they went out to fight. This led to serious trouble.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Samuel 11:1</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">King David saw the beautiful Bath-sheba bathing. He got immorally involved with her, and she became pregnant. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">2 Samuel 11:2-5</a>) To try to cover up the misconduct, he arranged for her husband, Uriah, to return to Jerusalem from the field of battle. Uriah refused to have marital relations with his wife while Israel was involved in battle. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">2 Samuel 11:6-11</a>) David now resorted to wicked and devious means to cover up his sin. He arranged for Uriah’s fellow soldiers to leave Uriah in a vulnerable position in the battle so that he would be killed. A heinous, grievous sin!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2 Samuel 11:12-17</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Eventually, of course, David’s sin caught up with him, and he was exposed. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">2 Samuel 12:7-12</a>) Try to imagine the weight of grief and guilt that David must have felt when the enormity of what he had done as a result of his passion dawned on him. He could have been overwhelmed by his own sense of failure, especially because he was likely an emotional, sensitive man. He might well have felt completely worthless!</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">However, David quickly acknowledged his wrong, admitting to the prophet Nathan: “I have sinned against Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">2 Samuel 12:13</a>) <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Psalm 51</a> tells us how he felt and how he supplicated Jehovah God to cleanse him and forgive him. He prayed: “Thoroughly wash me from my error, and cleanse me even from my sin. For my transgressions I myself know, and my sin is in front of me constantly.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Psalm 51:2, 3</a>) Because he was truly repentant, he was able to rebuild his strong, close relationship with Jehovah. David did not dwell on feelings of remorse and worthlessness. He threw his burden on Jehovah by humbly acknowledging his guilt, demonstrating genuine repentance, and praying intensely for Jehovah’s forgiveness. He regained God’s favor.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 51:7-12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 15-19</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="ss"><span id="page30" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="30" data-before-text="30"></span><strong>Coping With Betrayal</strong></p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">This brings us to the episode that prompted David to write <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Psalm 55</a>. He was under great emotional strain. “My very heart is in severe pain within me,” he wrote, “and the frights of death itself have fallen upon me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalm 55:4</a>) What caused this pain? Absalom, David’s son, had schemed to steal the kingship from David. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">2 Samuel 15:1-6</a>) This betrayal by his own son was hard enough to bear, but what made it worse was that David’s most trusted counselor, a man by the name of Ahithophel, joined the conspiracy against David. It is Ahithophel that David describes at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Psalm 55:12-14</a>. As a result of the conspiracy and betrayal, David had to flee Jerusalem. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">2 Samuel 15:13, 14</a>) What anguish this must have caused him!</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Still, he did not allow his intense emotion and grief to weaken his trust and confidence in Jehovah. He prayed to Jehovah to frustrate the plans of the conspirators. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">2 Samuel 15:30, 31</a>) Again we see that David did not merely wait passively for Jehovah to do all the work. As soon as the opportunity presented itself, he did what he could to combat the conspiracy against him. He sent another of his counselors, Hushai, back into Jerusalem to pretend to join the conspiracy, though, in fact, he went to undermine it. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">2 Samuel 15:32-34</a>) With Jehovah’s support, this plan worked. Hushai gained enough time for David to regroup and to get organized to defend himself.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">2 Samuel 17:14</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">How David all through his life must have appreciated Jehovah’s protective care as well as his patience and willingness to forgive! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Psalm 34:18, 19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/37/1" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> 51:17</a>) It is with this background that David confidently encourages us in our times of distress to turn to Jehovah for help, to ‘throw our burden on Jehovah.’—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:6, 7</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="ss"><strong>Build and Maintain a Strong, Trusting Relationship With Jehovah</strong></p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">How do we get the kind of relationship with Jehovah that David had, a relationship that sustained him in times of great trial and tribulation? We build such a relationship by being diligent students of God’s Word, the Bible. We let him instruct us about his laws, principles, and personality. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Psalm 19:7-11</a>) As we meditate on God’s Word, we grow ever closer to him and learn to trust him implicitly. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Psalm 143:1-5</a>) We deepen and strengthen that relationship as we associate with fellow worshipers to be further instructed by Jehovah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Psalm 122:1-4</a>) We intensify our relationship with Jehovah through heartfelt prayer.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Psalm 55:1</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">True, David, like us, did have his low points when his relationship with Jehovah was not as strong as it should have been. Oppression can make us “act crazy.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 7:7</a>) But Jehovah sees what is happening, and he knows what is in our heart.

Then, whatever burdens we have to carry, we can depend on Jehovah to relieve the pressure or to give us the strength to cope with our situation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Philippians 4:6, 7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996246/45/1" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> 13</a>) It is a matter of our staying close to Jehovah. When David did this, he was absolutely secure.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Therefore, whatever your circumstances, says David, <em>always</em> throw your burden upon Jehovah. Then we will experience the truth of the promise: “He himself will sustain you.

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page8" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span><strong>“Throw Your Burden Upon Jehovah”​—How?</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">DAVID, the well-known king of the ancient 12-tribe kingdom of Israel, gave us this encouragement: “Throw your burden upon Jehovah himself, and he himself will sustain you. Never will he allow the righteous one to totter.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 55:22</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Why is such counsel especially appropriate when coming from King David? And how can you heed it?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">David had a very eventful career in serving Jehovah God. As a mere youth he killed a lion, a bear and the giant Goliath. David excelled in warfare, extending the boundaries of ancient Israel to their God-ordained limits. Moreover, he was without equal in composing music and writing psalms. Yet David tasted not only the joys of success and prosperity but also the dregs of remorse and adversity.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Samuel 16:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 17:34-36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 18:7</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>Why David ‘Threw His Burden Upon Jehovah’</strong></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">When David said “throw your burden upon Jehovah,” he was, first of all, talking to himself. How can that be said? Because from the context it is apparent that David composed this psalm when his royal prerogatives were at their lowest ebb. This was when his ambitious son Absalom almost succeeded in wresting the throne from his father.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">David’s desperate plight is apparent from the opening words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 55:1</a>: “Do give ear, O God, to my prayer; and do not hide yourself from my request for favor. Do pay attention to me and answer me. I am driven restlessly about by my concern, and I cannot but show disquietude.” For six more verses he continues in this vein.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Why did David find himself in this condition? Because of his foes. He next prays for God to take action against his enemies and particularly singles out a friend who had turned traitor. No doubt this was Ahithophel, of whom it could well be said: “For it was not an enemy that proceeded to reproach me; . . . But it was you, . . . one familiar to me and my acquaintance, because we used to enjoy sweet intimacy together; into the house of God we used to walk with the throng.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 55 Verses 12-14</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">After describing his lot and the cause of it, David says, in part, of his confidence in Jehovah: “As for me, to God I shall call out; and Jehovah himself will save me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 55 Verse 16</a>) Then after counseling himself, “Throw your burden upon Jehovah,” David concludes the psalm with the same note of confidence in the Most High, saying: “You yourself, O God, will bring them down to the lowest pit. . . . But as for me, I shall trust in you.” And how true David’s words proved to be! His ambitious son Absalom and his deceitful counselor Ahithophel came to untimely ends, whereas David continued to rule as God’s anointed king.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 55 Verses 22, 23</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>Burdens or Responsibilities</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Before considering how we can heed David’s divinely inspired counsel to throw our burdens upon Jehovah, it seems appropriate <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>to note that there are some responsibilities we must bear ourselves. The Christian apostle Paul wrote: “For each one will carry his own load.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Galatians 6:5</a>) Such ‘loads’ are the responsibilities that are our own because we are husbands, wives, parents, children, employees, Jehovah’s Witnesses or, for example, appointed elders in the Christian congregation. We cannot totally and irresponsibly throw such loads upon Jehovah but should willingly bear them ourselves. It is similar when it comes to making decisions. God’s Word provides laws and principles, but we must apply them to the problems facing us. Of course, we can and should ask God for wisdom, strength and his holy spirit to aid us in bearing these loads, but we must not try to get rid of them.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Then what are the burdens that we can throw upon Jehovah? They are anxieties, worries, disappointments and fears regarding the future, such as those David experienced. And they also include the burdens involving our weaknesses and failings. These are the burdens that we are to throw upon Jehovah, for the apostle Peter says: “Throw all your <em>anxiety</em> upon him.” Why? “Because he cares for you.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:6, 7</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Jesus Christ gave similar counsel in his Sermon on the Mount. ‘How so?’ you may ask. Well, not only did he tell us to stop being anxious about what we are to eat, drink and wear but he also told us the reason why we should not have such anxiety. Jesus gave this assurance: “If . . . God . . . clothes the vegetation of the field, . . . will he not much rather clothe you, you with little faith? . . . Your heavenly Father knows you need all these things.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matthew 6:25-32</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>By Prayer</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Yet, how can we really ‘throw our burden upon Jehovah’? One way is by regularly going to him in prayer. Is it not true that one of the burdens we daily have to bear is a consciousness of having come short of God’s righteous requirements? Yes, but by going to God in prayer we can be relieved of this burden. Jesus illustrated this in the case of the tax collector who, because of humbly and sincerely praying to God to be gracious to him, was proved more righteous than a hypocritical Pharisee. In other words, the tax collector was thereby relieved of his burden of guilt. But a word of caution: Depending upon our spiritual condition, the gravity of our sin and the nature of our guilt, we may need to enlist the aid of others, such as congregational elders, so as to become free of our burden.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 18:9-14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Galatians 6:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> James 5:14-16</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">If our prayers are to help us to throw our burdens upon Jehovah we must be really earnest, truly serious about matters. That is why we are commanded: “Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God.” This will help to unburden us, for then ‘the peace of God that excels all thought will guard our hearts and mental powers.’​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Philippians 4:6, 7</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Please note that Paul mentions <em>supplications</em> as well as prayers. What are supplications? They are <em>fervent</em> prayers. And what does it mean to be <em>fervent?</em> This word comes from a root meaning “to be hot, to boil.” So to be fervent means to be ardent, warm in feeling, intense. That is how our prayers should be if by them we are to succeed in ‘throwing our burdens upon Jehovah himself.’</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">If we really are earnest in our prayers, we will also persevere in prayer. After illustrating the need for perseverance in prayer, our Lord Jesus Christ urged: “I say to you, <em>Keep on asking,</em> and it <span id="page10" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>will be given you; <em>keep on seeking,</em> and you will find; <em>keep on knocking,</em> and it will be opened to you. For everyone <em>asking</em> receives, and everyone <em>seeking</em> finds, and to everyone <em>knocking</em> it will be opened.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 11:2-10</a>) Indeed, <em>keep on</em> asking, seeking, knocking, and our heavenly Father will assume the burdens that may fittingly be thrown upon him.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>Faith and Works</strong></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">With our prayers, as with every other aspect of our Christian life and ministry, this principle applies: “According to your faith let it happen to you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 9:29</a>) We must have the faith that pleases God. Not only must we wholeheartedly believe that he exists but we must also be confident that he rewards those earnestly seeking him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:6</a>) We must have faith that God will hear us.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">To have such strong faith, we need to study God’s Word. We should endeavor to read it and related Christian publications daily. It is easy to forget the Bible’s admonition and its grand assurances. So many things of a secular nature keep crowding in on us! But only by feeding regularly on God’s Word can we become truly acquainted with Jehovah, his marvelous qualities and his ways of dealing with his earthly servants. How Jehovah’s Word highlights his loving care for his people! Again and again we read of how he answered the prayers of his servants. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Genesis 20:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Acts 12:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 17</a>) And never forget that Jehovah remains the ever-dependable “Hearer of prayer.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 65:2</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Helpful in more ways than one is the memorizing of Bible texts, especially those that assure us of God’s loving watchcare. Among these are those quoted above, as well as certain psalms, such as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalms 23 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 103</a>. What better way to keep our mind occupied and drive out distracting thoughts than memorizing and reciting some of God’s Word! By having Bible texts in our mind we can feed on his Word even when we are in no position to read from a copy of the Bible. For instance, we can meditate on the Scriptures if we are unable to sleep at night. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalm 63:6</a>.) Truly, all of this is an aid in ‘throwing our burden upon Jehovah.’</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Furthermore, ‘throwing our burden upon Jehovah’ involves our doing our part. Remember that “faith without works is dead.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">James 2:26</a>) Jesus indicated as much in his Sermon on the Mount, for after counseling us not to be anxious but to have faith in God’s care, he commanded: “Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you.” Truly, heeding that counsel will help us to remain free from anxious care.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matthew 6:33</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Helpful, too, will be learning to discipline our mind. We may have got into a rut of negative thinking. Having earnestly presented our petitions to Jehovah and thrown our anxieties upon him, we should leave them there without continued worrisome concern. We must also discipline ourselves as to our words and actions. We must make progress and not keep making the same mistakes over and over again, ‘going around in circles,’ as it were. Rather, let us be like the apostle Paul and ‘pummel our bodies, leading them about as slaves.’ We must also heed Jesus’ counsel to “keep on the watch and pray continually,” for “the spirit . . . is eager, but the flesh is weak.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 9:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983483/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Matthew 26:41</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">So, how can you “throw your burden upon Jehovah”? By earnestly persevering in prayer, by regularly feeding on God’s Word, by seeking first God’s Kingdom and by exercising self-discipline. Then, true to Jehovah’s promise, he will sustain you and never allow you to totter.</p>

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page23" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span><strong>Cast Your Anxieties Upon Jehovah</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WOULD a man who had committed adultery and murder suffer anxiety? Surely he would, if he had any sort of conscience at all. King David <em>did</em> have a conscience. Yet, in the grip of intense passion, this ancient Hebrew king committed adultery with a woman named Bath-sheba. The situation was complicated when she became pregnant, and eventually he felt himself compelled to arrange the death of her husband and to marry her himself.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When he came to his senses, can you imagine the anguish, the torment of conscience that he must have suffered? Well, we do not have to imagine it, because David describes it to us himself. It was this tragic series of events that led him to write <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982687/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">the Ps 51</a> fifty-first psalm.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">How did David handle all that anguish? The psalm tells us that he frankly confessed to his God, Jehovah, what he had done and showed deep, heartfelt repentance. Then he begged for God’s help to develop a different spirit. He said: “Create in me even a pure heart, O God, and put within me a new spirit, a steadfast one.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982687/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 51:10</a>) In this way, he ‘threw all his anxiety upon Jehovah.’​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982687/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:7</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Would God help someone who had committed such crimes? David was confident that he would. He said: “The sacrifices to God are a broken spirit; a heart broken and crushed, O God, you will not despise.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982687/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 51:17</a>) History shows that for the rest of his life David suffered from the consequences of what he did. But because of his heartfelt repentance, his Creator did not abandon him. He was given help to bear his anxieties.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">We may not have committed murder. Yet not one of us is without anxieties of some kind. We all sin, and a bad conscience is a heavy burden. Additionally, nearly everybody has worries about health, the rising cost of living, perhaps the bringing up of children, work, difficulties in getting on with others, crime, debt, and similar things. Do you try to carry all those worries yourself? Really, you do not have to. You will be happier if you follow this Scriptural advice: “Throw your burden upon Jehovah himself, and he himself will sustain you. Never will he allow the righteous one to totter.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982687/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 55:22</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>How to Ask for Jehovah’s Help</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">How can we cast our burden on Jehovah? Of course, we have to pray to him and discuss our anxieties with him. The book of Proverbs gives us good advice on this. It tells us: “Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982687/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:5</a>) Hence, if we want Jehovah’s help, we need to rely on <em>his</em> wisdom, not our own. Sometimes we have to learn this lesson.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">For example, in one country, Christians were faced with bitter persecution. According to the report, at first they <span id="page24" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>prayed to God for help, but without understanding. They did not understand why they had to undergo such experiences and tried to tell Jehovah what they wanted him to do for them.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">However, they became stronger and learned to view it as a privilege to suffer for righteousness’ sake. Thus, they were more like the apostles of old who, after being beaten by the Jewish leaders, “went their way from before the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy to be dishonored in behalf of his name.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982687/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 5:41</a>) Now these modern Christians patiently submit with God’s help to whatever persecution Satan inflicts upon them. They trust in Jehovah to work things out in <em>his</em> way and wait patiently on his due time to deliver them. They confidently cast all their anxieties upon him.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982687/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 14:26</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Additionally, casting our anxieties on Jehovah requires faith that Jehovah can and will help us. One woman learned this lesson well. She suffered from anxieties because, although she wished to serve Jehovah, she was addicted to smoking tobacco. She prayed for help but kept right on smoking. Some time later she was able to announce happily: “I have finally stopped smoking!” Why could she not stop before? She admitted: “I prayed to God for help, but I did not <em>really</em> believe that he could help me.” It was only when she asked <em>in faith</em> that she received the help she needed.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982687/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:6</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Then, if we wish Jehovah to help us bear our anxieties, there are things we have to do. Jesus indicated this, saying: “Come to me, all you who are toiling and loaded down, and I will refresh you. <em>Take my yoke upon you</em> and learn from me, for I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart, and you will find refreshment for your souls.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982687/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 11:28, 29</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">There is a saying, ‘God helps those who help themselves.’ The above words of Jesus show that, in reality, ‘God helps those who are willing to help others.’ Jesus offered refreshment​—relief from anxieties—​to those who were willing to ‘take his yoke,’ that is, submit to Christ’s direction and serve God and their neighbors just as Jesus did.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982687/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 9:35-38;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982687/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> James 1:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982687/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 1 John 3:17</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>How Does Jehovah Help?</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">So then, if we are suffering from great anxiety and pray to God in full faith, and we show that that faith is genuine by trying to do his will, serving him and helping our neighbors, what kind of help can we expect?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">It may be that God will completely remove the problem giving rise to our anxiety. That has happened from time <span id="page25" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>to time. Or it may be that he will give us the necessary wisdom to solve the problem ourselves or to see the correct way of handling it. Then we will experience the truth of the Biblical proverb: “He that is trusting in his own heart is stupid, but he that is walking in wisdom is the one that will escape.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982687/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Proverbs 28:26</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">How can we gain such godly wisdom? Attending meetings of Jehovah’s people and reading the Bible and Bible publications are two ways that come to mind. As one Christian mother who suffered a lot of anxiety because of having an alcoholic husband expressed it, “Reading <em>The Watchtower</em> and studying it and applying it have helped me the most of all.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982687/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:24, 25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982687/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Psalm 119:97-104</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Or, Jehovah can help us by means of our Christian brothers. One elder received from two persons in his congregation a warm note that read in part: “Thank you for the many times you listened to and helped us with our personal problems, encouraged us when we were depressed, visited us when we were sick, came whenever we called and stayed up all night in hospitals when our families needed you. We are grateful to Jehovah to have a brother who cares for us as deeply as you do.”</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Hence, if you have anxieties, why not share them with mature ones in your congregation? Jehovah might help you by means of them, and you will see the truth of the ancient proverb: “A true companion is loving all the time, and is a brother that is born for when there is distress.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982687/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:17</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Of course, Jehovah will not <em>always</em> remove the problems that cause our anxiety. But by strengthening us by means of the Bible, the holy spirit or our Christian brothers, he helps us to view the problems correctly and handle them wisely. In this way, we can experience what the apostle Paul said: “For all things I have the strength by virtue of him who imparts power to me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982687/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Philippians 4:13</a>) Thus even though the problems are still there, Jehovah God keeps his promise: “I will by no means leave you nor by any means forsake you.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982687/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:5</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Alma found this to be true. She is a Christian woman who some years ago was in an automobile accident that left her paralyzed from the waist down. She has much pain, but the knowledge that God will soon remove sickness and suffering is a comfort and help to her. Meantime, she says: “I pray to Jehovah to help me to endure each day. Then, when that day is over, I’m one day closer!”</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Alma never misses a meeting of the Christian congregation, and she uses every avenue open to her to share with others the confidence she has in the future. In this way she feels the support of Jehovah as she throws her burdens upon him.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Whatever help Jehovah gives, we can be sure it is what is needed, and it is sufficient. The apostle Paul confidently declared: “We know that God makes all his works cooperate together for the good of those who love God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982687/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Romans 8:28</a>) Even under great suffering, it is possible to experience Jehovah God’s help. Paul told us: “Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God; and the peace of God that excels all thought will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982687/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Philippians 4:6, 7</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Hence, whatever our anxieties or burdens, let us confidently follow the advice of the apostle Peter: “Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time; while you throw all your anxiety upon him, because he cares for you.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982687/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:6, 7</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="se"><strong>[Box on page 24]</strong></p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> <strong>Jehovah has promised to help us bear our burdens.

This is especially true when one is despondent, discouraged or feeling despair. Whatever the cause for the discouragement, a person should remember that he can throw his burden of anxiety or frustration upon Jehovah, even as the psalmist said: “Throw your burden upon Jehovah himself, and he himself will sustain you. Never will he allow the righteous one to totter.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972642/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 55:22</a>) We can be certain that Jehovah God will not let his servants totter or fall to ruin. But here is a warning: Do not take an independent attitude. Rather, lean upon Jehovah God; completely depend on him. Then he will uphold and keep you from falling.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972642/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Prov. 3:5-7</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 5.

It is indeed true, “Happy is the people whose God is Jehovah!” Their happiness, however, does not come to them automatically. To obtain genuine happiness requires, among other things, heeding the inspired advice: “Throw your burden upon Jehovah himself, and he himself will sustain you.” You cannot be happy if you are burdened down.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970648/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 144:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970648/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 55:22</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">How can you throw your burdens upon Jehovah? By faith and prayer, even as we read: “Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God; and the peace of God that excels all thought will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.” Jesus Christ made the same point in his Sermon on the Mount, saying: ‘Stop being anxious. Your heavenly Father feeds the birds. Are you not worth more than they are? And if God clothes the lilies of the field with a glory greater than that of Solomon, will he not much rather clothe you, you with little faith? So never be anxious as to what you are to eat, drink or wear. For your heavenly Father knows you need all these things.’​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970648/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Phil. 4:6, 7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970648/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Matt. 6:25-32</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span id="page541" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="541" data-before-text="541"></span>Yes, by exercising faith and through prayer to Jehovah God you can throw upon him all your burdens in the form of anxieties, worries, fears, frustrations and all other negative emotions. And this you need to do to have peace of mind allowing for happiness. In fact, doing so is even necessary for your physical well-being because of the psychosomatic principle.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>THE BURDEN OF BEING WRONGED</strong></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">What are some of these burdens that you can throw upon Jehovah? For one thing, there are the emotional burdens that life brings with it. These in particular tend to interfere with your being happy. For example, you might be burdened down emotionally because of having been wronged. You might resent this and want to retaliate or pay back in kind. Or you may not be able to do anything about it and so you let your frustration out on others or you let it make you bitter. Yet how foolish! Needlessly you are bearing a very heavy burden.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The wise course is to heed the counsel of the inspired apostle Paul: “Return evil for evil to no one. . . . Do not avenge yourselves, beloved, but yield place to the wrath; for it is written: ‘Vengeance is mine; I will repay, says Jehovah.’” That is the right as well as the wise course, for it keeps you from becoming presumptuous and arrogating to yourself the role of judge and executioner. By telling Jehovah about it and letting him take care of it you rid yourself of a great burden indeed.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970648/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rom. 12:17,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970648/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 19</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">That this is both the wise and the right course to take, David of old illustrated in his relation with King Saul, who hounded him and repeatedly tried to kill him. David could have taken the law into his own hands, as it were. On two occasions he had the opportunity to slay King Saul, but he did not do so. No question about Saul’s persecution of David being a burden to him. But David threw this burden upon Jehovah, saying: “As Jehovah is living, Jehovah himself will deal him a blow; or his day will come and he will have to die, or down into battle he will go, and he will certainly be swept away. It is unthinkable, on my part, from Jehovah’s standpoint, to thrust my hand out against the anointed of Jehovah!” And that is just the way things did work out. King Saul was wounded in battle and took his own life, and David became his successor upon the throne of Jehovah in Jerusalem without David’s lifting a finger against his persecutor King Saul.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970648/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Sam. 26:10, 11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970648/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 Ki. 2:11</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Jesus Christ, the Son of God, whom David foreshadowed, took the same wise and loving course, even as appears from the record of his life as found in the four Gospels. He could have let the people make him king and then turned the tables on his persecutors, but he did not. Rather, as the apostle Peter tells: “He [Jesus] committed no sin, nor was deception found in his mouth. When he was being reviled, he did not go reviling in return. When he was suffering, he did not go threatening, but kept on committing himself to the one who judges righteously.” Like David of old, Jesus Christ threw this burden upon Jehovah. He humbly submitted himself to whatever his heavenly Father permitted to come upon him, leaving it up to his heavenly Father to avenge him, which Jehovah did in his due time.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970648/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:22, 23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970648/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Matt. 23:35, 36</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>‘DO NOT GET HEATED UP’</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Today there is widespread wickedness in every land. Sexual immorality is rampant. Dishonesty in business matters has honeycombed society from the biggest corporations to the humblest employee. Citizens <span id="page542" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="542" data-before-text="542"></span>cheat their government out of taxes and flout traffic regulations. All of this makes it more difficult for lovers of righteousness to live up to their high principles. What shall they do? Let all this wickedness unduly disturb them and rob them of their peace of mind? Such would not be wise.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">To do so would be carrying a needless burden. Instead, heed the counsel that divine wisdom gives, not to bear this burden but to throw it upon Jehovah. Note the words of King David, who had many opportunities to heed this counsel in his own life: “Do not show yourself heated up because of the evildoers. . . . Trust in Jehovah and do good . . . For evildoers themselves will be cut off, but those hoping in Jehovah are the ones that will possess the earth.” By exercising faith that Jehovah God in his due time will straighten out matters, you will be throwing your burden upon Him instead of trying to carry it yourself. You will thus allow room in your life for happiness.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970648/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 37:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970648/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970648/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 9</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>PHYSICAL AND OTHER HANDICAPS</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">There is no doubt about physical handicaps’ being a burden to the Christian. Polio may have left one lame, so one has difficulty in walking and especially in climbing stairs as one goes from house to house preaching the good news of God’s kingdom. Or one may be plagued by failing or poor eyesight. Another may be afflicted with partial deafness. Still another is feeble because of advancing age. These may be circumstances over which one has no control. But how shall these be viewed? As frustrating handicaps that rob one of the joys of serving God? By no means!</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The apostle Paul had what he called a “thorn in the flesh,” which he repeatedly asked Jehovah to remove. While Jehovah did not remove it, he did relieve Paul of its burdening frustration by saying, in effect, ‘Do not let it worry you, Paul. I understand. I’m not asking more of you than you can do under the circumstances.’ Or, as Paul himself put it: “He really said to me: ‘My undeserved kindness is sufficient for you; for my power is being made perfect in weakness.’ Most gladly, therefore, will I rather boast as respects my weaknesses, that the power of the Christ may like a tent remain over me.” Getting God’s viewpoint of these handicaps or disabilities relieves one of the frustrating burden and allows one to have peace of mind and happiness.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970648/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Cor. 12:9</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">There are, however, certain other burdens aside from anxieties, worries, fears, frustrations and other negative emotions that are the lot of the Christian and that he must himself bear. For example, the governing body of the Christian congregation in Jerusalem wrote the early Christians scattered abroad: “The holy spirit and we ourselves have favored adding no further burden to you, except these necessary things, to keep abstaining from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication.” Christians have certain responsibilities that they must shoulder.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970648/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 15:28, 29</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">And there are also certain burdens or ‘heavy things’ that we can help others to bear, even as Paul told Christians to do: “Go on carrying the burdens of one another, and thus fulfill the law of the Christ.” Yes, “we, though, who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those not strong.” How can Christians do this? By being patient with them, by bearing with them, by helping to make up for their shortcomings and deficiencies, by not expecting too much of them. Jesus set a fine example for us in this regard in the patient manner in which he dealt with his apostles.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970648/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Gal. 6:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970648/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Rom. 15:1</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><span id="page543" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="543" data-before-text="543"></span>There are burdens that we must carry ourselves​—with Jehovah’s help. And others have burdens that we can help them to carry. But such burdens as worries, anxieties, fears and frustrations we need not and should not carry. These are some of the burdens that the psalmist tells us to throw upon Jehovah. Implied, of course, is doing all you can yourself, and, having done that, you can leave the results and the future in God’s hands.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">So do not let injustices or persecution embitter or discourage you; do not get heated up because of the prosperity of evildoers; do not chafe because of physical or other weaknesses or conditions over which you have no control. Do your best and leave all these disturbing things in Jehovah God’s hands by means of faith and prayer. Doing so will help you to know the happiness of the people whose God is Jehovah.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970648/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 144:15</a>.</p>

Continuance in this is admonished. An overseer or other Christian may notice that a brother is depressed and he may make an opportunity to talk with him about it.

You will see, therefore, that God’s kingdom is now at hand and that soon God will wipe from the earth all traces of wickedness and will usher lovers of righteousness into a new order of peace and happiness.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965120/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 24:3-14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965120/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 32-34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965120/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 2 Tim. 3:1-5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965120/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> Dan. 2:44;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965120/3/4" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> Rev. 21:3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">This knowledge will help you to avoid anxiety. Even should governments change and anti-God elements gain control, you will not panic and necessarily think that one will be better off by fleeing to another location. You will appreciate that there is no physical location of real peace and safety, for trouble can quickly strike anywhere on earth. Therefore, you will look to God for help, and continually pray for his spirit and direction. Yes, in keeping with the apostolic encouragement, you will “throw all your anxiety upon him, because he cares for you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965120/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965120/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Ps. 55:22</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">But in this connection, did not Jesus say: “When they persecute you in one city, flee to another”? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965120/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 10:23</a>) Does this not indicate that Christians should flee from areas of persecution? How is Jesus’ instruction to be understood?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Jesus was not advocating fearful flight. He had just told his disciples to ‘shake the dust off their feet’ and move to another place when people did not receive them—not because of fear, but in order to reach persons to whom they could preach the Kingdom message. Similarly, when they were persecuted in one city by those who rejected the message, Jesus advised his disciples to flee to another city. So it was that when Paul’s life was threatened in Damascus because of his preaching, he left town secretly at night; and when persecution made it impossible for Paul and Barnabas to continue preaching in Iconium, they fled to other cities.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965120/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 9:23-25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965120/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 13:49–14:6</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">However, that Jesus did not mean that Christians should quit preaching because of fear of what would happen to them is indicated by his following words: “Do not fear them . . . What I tell you in the darkness, say in the light; and what you hear whispered, preach from the housetops. And do not become fearful of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; but rather be in fear of him that can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna. . . . Therefore have no fear.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965120/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 10:26-31</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Mature Christians do not abandon their ministry because they fear men who may kill their physical body. They are not consumed with anxiety over their personal safety or whether they will be able to obtain necessary material provisions. Rather, their chief concern is caring for the spiritual needs of those who show themselves righteously disposed toward God. They are confident that, not some physical location on earth, but “the name of Jehovah is a strong tower. Into it the righteous runs and is given protection.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965120/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Prov. 18:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965120/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Matt. 6:25-34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965120/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Ps. 37:25,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965120/8/3" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> 40;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965120/8/4" data-bid="9-5" class="b"> Isa. 41:10</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">How evident it is that developing and maintaining strong faith in God is the only way to overcome the anxieties that clutch at the hearts of men! So look to Jehovah. Keep close to him through prayer and obedience to his commandments. Fearlessly continue to preach God’s Word of truth, saying “to those who are anxious at heart: ‘Be strong. Do not be afraid. Look! Your own God will come with vengeance itself, God even with a repayment. He himself will come and save you people.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965120/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isa. 35:4</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Consolation for the Depressed</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Depression is a temporary loss of optimism, courage and hope often termed “low spirits.” As we have seen, it can be induced by personal trials, a sense of personal failure, bitter disappointment, lack of clear understanding of God’s purpose and oppression. Often, however, the cause cannot be easily pinpointed, since a combination of circumstances is involved. A girl away from home may be out of work, alone and homesick. Physical and mental fatigue also team up to cause depression. Sometimes it may simply be poor health or worry. Periodic adjustments in one’s body chemistry may be accompanied by low spirits. Women frequently undergo depression during the menopause. Elderly people may be dejected because of failing physical strength or suspicion that they are unwanted. If one is fatigued by steady hard work or his mind is wearied by intense study and improper rest, he may begin to view life pessimistically, negatively. These are some common causes of the miserable state of depression. Occasionally depression <span id="page183" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="183" data-before-text="183"></span>may lean more toward spiritual sickness, with weakened faith and a corresponding inability to get comfort from the Scriptures. The spiritually sick one imagines that for some reason God has turned His back on him, and God-given promises of hope and sympathy are doubted. Whatever the particular cause, depressed feelings are never pleasant.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>THE REMEDY</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Just as the causes for depression may be one factor or a combination of factors, so the remedy may require one or more steps. Since the depressed mind often is not thinking properly on the facts, it must be refreshed. Then problems will be seen in a clearer light. First, give your body proper rest and attend to its other needs as far as possible. If you have been putting unreasonable demands on your physical stamina, make some adjustments in your schedule. See that late televiewing is not depriving you of needed sleep. Very often depression passes with simple remedies, since the healthy, rested person is able to approach his problems optimistically. He is able to weigh reasons for discouragement against reasons for hope and thereby keep his thinking controlled.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">In any depressed state, and particularly where the cause is not easily removed, the Christian will earnestly call on Jehovah in the name of Jesus. The inspired psalmist urges us: “Throw your burden upon Jehovah himself, and he himself will sustain you. Never will he allow the righteous one to totter.” “Jehovah is giving support to all who are falling, and is raising up all who are bowed down.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 55:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 145:14</a>) Confirmation of God’s keen interest in our low spirits comes through the prophet Isaiah: “For this is what the High and Lofty One, who is residing forever and whose name is holy, has said: ‘In the height and in the holy place is where I reside, also with the one crushed and lowly in spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly ones and to revive the heart of the ones being crushed.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isa. 57:15</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">After throwing your burden upon Jehovah, devote as much time as you can drawing close to God through reading the Bible. The proverb says: “Anxious care in the heart of a man is what will cause it to bow down, but the good word is what makes it rejoice.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Prov. 12:25</a>) That God’s good Word can bring joy back into the heart and light to the sad eyes is attested by <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 19:7, 8</a>: “The law of Jehovah is perfect, bringing back the soul. The reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy, making the inexperienced one wise. The orders from Jehovah are upright, causing the heart to rejoice; the commandment of Jehovah is clean, making the eyes shine.”</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">If your saddened state is due to bitter disappointment in yourself or others, or results from tribulation, remember that trial accomplishes much good when endured. Peter declares that “the person that has suffered in the flesh has desisted from sins, to the end that he may live the remainder of his time in the flesh, no more for the desires of men, but for God’s will.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:1, 2</a>) Yes, tribulation makes us see that our sure hope is in doing God’s will; we come through trial more appreciative of that fact. Apart from discipline, the Christian expects various trials of his faith: “In this fact you are greatly rejoicing, though for a little while at present, if it must be, you have been grieved by various trials, in order that the tested quality of your faith, of much greater value than gold that perishes despite its being proved by fire, may be found a cause for praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:6, 7</a>) Of course, Jehovah is not bringing trials and depression upon you. He is the God of all comfort and it is not desirable with him “for <span id="page184" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="184" data-before-text="184"></span>one of these little ones to perish.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962204/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 18:14</a>.</p>

Overwhelmed and distressed, eyes glistening with tears, he called upon the kindness and compassion of his God, Jehovah, begging him: “Do put my tears in your skin bottle.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008731/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 56:8</a>) That man was David, later to be king of Israel. But what was the skin bottle he referred to, and how can God put our tears in one?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The skin bottle was familiar to David. It was a container used for holding water, oil, wine, or even butter. Nomads of the Sahara, such as the Tuareg, still use skin bottles, made out of the whole skin of a goat or a sheep. Such bottles can hold large quantities of water, depending on the size of the animal. Skin bottles have earned a reputation for keeping water cool, even in the intense heat of the desert sun. In the past, they were generally transported by donkeys or camels. These days, you might even see one attached to the front of an all-terrain vehicle!</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">David’s touching words about the skin bottle can also have meaning for us. How so? Well, the Bible explains that Satan controls this world and that he has “great anger” in our day. As a result, the earth is experiencing terrible woes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008731/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Revelation 12:12</a>) For that reason, there are many who, like David, are faced with emotional, mental, or physical suffering​—especially those who are trying to please God. Does that describe you? With courage, “even weeping,” such faithful people never stop trying to live a life of integrity. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008731/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 126:6</a>) They can be assured that their heavenly Father sees not only the trials they face but also the emotional impact of those trials. He truly understands the pain afflicting his servants, and he compassionately remembers their tears and sufferings, figuratively storing them up in his skin bottle.</p>

<strong>Jehovah Has Numbered “the Very Hairs of Your Head”</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>“Put My Tears in Your Skin Bottle”</strong></p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">12.

For example, when the Israelites were being oppressed as slaves, Jehovah said to Moses: “Unquestionably I have seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and I have heard their outcry as a result of those who drive them to work; because I well know the pains they suffer.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005565/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Exodus 3:7</a>) How comforting it is to realize that when we are enduring a trial, <span id="page24" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>Jehovah sees what is happening and hears our outcries! He is certainly not indifferent to our suffering.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">13. What shows that Jehovah truly feels for his servants?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> Jehovah’s care for those who have entered into a relationship with him is further seen in his feelings for the Israelites. Even though their suffering was often a result of their own stubbornness, Isaiah wrote concerning Jehovah: “During all their distress it was distressing to him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005565/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Isaiah 63:9</a>) As a faithful servant of Jehovah, you can be sure, then, that when you are pained, Jehovah is pained. Does that not impel you to face up to adversity fearlessly and to continue doing your best to serve him?​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005565/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:6, 7</a>.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">14.

David escaped to Gath, but he feared capture when he was recognized by the Philistines. He wrote: “My foes have kept snapping all day long, for there are many warring against me high-mindedly.” Because of his perilous situation, David turned to Jehovah. “All day long they keep hurting my personal affairs,” he said. “All their thoughts are against me for bad.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005565/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Psalm 56:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005565/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 5</a>.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">15.

Do put my tears in your skin bottle. Are they not in your book?” What a touching description of Jehovah’s tender care! When we are under stress, we may cry out to Jehovah with tears. Even the perfect man Jesus did so. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005565/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Hebrews 5:7</a>) David was convinced that Jehovah observed him and would remember his agony, as if preserving his tears in a skin bottle or inscribing them in a book.<a id="footnotesource4" data-fnid="4" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2005565/3">d</a> Perhaps you feel that your tears would fill a good part of that skin bottle or many pages of such a book. If that is the case, you can take comfort. The Bible assures us: “Jehovah is near to those that are broken at heart; and those who are crushed in spirit he saves.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005565/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Psalm 34:18</a>.</p>

<strong>God Cares About You</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Still, throughout this adversity David was convinced of Jehovah’s personal care. “My being a fugitive you yourself have reported,” he declared in a prayer to Jehovah. Yes, to David it was as if Jehovah had documented the entire ordeal. Then David added: “Do put my tears in your skin bottle. Are they not in your book?”<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1996161/0">a</a> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996161/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 56:8</a>) With this analogy, David expressed confidence that Jehovah was aware of not only the situation but also its emotional impact.</p>

<strong>Increase Your Peace Through Accurate Knowledge</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> When going through a troubling experience, never forget that Jehovah knows what you are suffering. In a psalm that was also composed when he reflected on his experience at Gath, David entreated Jehovah: “Do put my tears in your skin bottle. Are they not in your book?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1987284/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Psalm 56:8</a>) Certainly, God listened to David’s request. How consoling to know that God would gather up such tears caused by affliction and anxiety and put these, as it were, in his skin bottle, just as one would pour into such a container precious wine or drinking water! Such tears would always be remembered, yes, written down in God’s book. How tender is Jehovah’s regard!</p>

<strong>Bottle</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Gibeonites told Joshua: “These are the wine skin-bottles that we filled new, and, look! they have burst.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010784/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Josh. 9:13</a>) Such a thing could happen in time because of pressure built up due to active fermentation of the wine. Suffering Job said: “Look! My belly is like wine that has no vent; like new skin bottles it wants to burst open.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010784/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 32:19</a>) Generally, however, new wineskins would be able to withstand the internal pressure developed due to fermentation of the wine. Yet, old wineskins would in time become hard and lose their elasticity, and they were then likely to burst. Hence, Jesus Christ fittingly said: “Neither do people put new wine into old wineskins; but if they do, then the wineskins burst and the wine spills out and the wineskins are ruined. But people <span id="page254" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="254" data-before-text="254"></span>put new wine into new wineskins, and both things are preserved.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010784/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 9:17</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">David, a fugitive beleaguered by foes, referred to the skin bottle figuratively. Requesting God, in whom he placed his trust, not to forget his tears, David said: “Do put my tears in your skin bottle.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010784/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 56:8</a>) It is said that skins filled with wine were sometimes hung where they could be smoked so as to protect them from insects or to impart quickly certain desired properties to the wine. On the other hand, when not in use, skin bottles might be hung in a room without a chimney and thus become darkened by smoke from fires built there. These wineskins would soon lose their elasticity and shrivel up. Perhaps with this in mind, the psalmist who was beset with trials said: “For I have become like a skin bottle in the smoke.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010784/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 119:83</a>; see POTTER; VESSELS.</p>

<strong>Conquer Your Fears!</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The last two global wars were fought presumably to remedy the basic cause for fears. But alas! Instead of conquering these fears the great wars gave birth to new ones. Likewise, the conferences, treaties, <span id="page356" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="356" data-before-text="356"></span>peace pacts and alliances since 1945 have all failed to establish genuine freedom from fear. Notwithstanding the dramatic efforts of the United Nations to blot out fear and make the world a cozy family, the world is sicker with the jitters than ever.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Science also has attempted to conquer fear. But what a miserable failure it has been! Credit for the modern tanks, warships, guided missiles, flame throwers, atomic bombs and biological weapons goes to science. Around the neck of science hangs the laurels for reducing London, Berlin, Hamburg and hundreds of other cities to piles of rubble. To science goes the glory for the gutted cities, the maimed soldiers, the tortured women and children, the death of millions. Certainly it will take science a long, long time to save as many lives as it has destroyed and may yet destroy in this present generation. Science is by no means the conqueror, but rather the creator, of fear. How true the saying, the scientific, social, political, commercial, military and religious leaders of this world promise the people freedom from fear, while at the same time they themselves are slaves of corruption and fear!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951440/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Pet. 2:19</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Now, is there no remedy? No escape from these killing and fearful conditions? Indeed there is, but not in the schemes of men. The great Teacher, Christ Jesus, extends the invitation: “Come to me, all you who are toiling and loaded down, and I will refresh you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951440/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 11:28</a>, <em>NW</em>) All who will sincerely accept this extension of mercy will have great peace of mind. “Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951440/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 26:3</a>) Such ones take up the song and jubilantly sing: “God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will we not fear.” “Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid: for Jehovah, even Jehovah, is my strength and song; and he is become my salvation.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951440/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 46:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951440/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Isa. 12:2</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">If you put full trust and confidence in Jehovah God, and refuse to rely on princely leaders of men or their armored chariots of war, you will not worry over world conditions or the threat of another global war. These are faithful sayings: “The fear of man bringeth a snare; but whoso putteth his trust in Jehovah shall be safe.” “In God have I put my trust, I will not be afraid; what can man do unto me?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951440/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 146:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951440/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Isa. 31:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951440/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Prov. 29:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951440/5/3" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> Ps. 56:11</a>, <em>AS</em>) By exercising faith in Jehovah and exhibiting love for his kingdom, you can conquer all worldly fears. “This is the conquest that has conquered the world, our faith.” “There is no fear in love, but perfect love throws fear outside, because fear exercises a restraint. Indeed, he that is under fear has not been made perfect in love.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951440/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 John 5:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951440/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 4:18</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Here is another secret for successfully overcoming worry: “The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951440/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 111:10</a>, <em>AS</em>) If you fear this Most High and Lofty One you will study his precious Word the Bible and you will obey his righteous commandments. “You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951440/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 8:32</a>, <em>NW</em>) In turn, this not only will give you peace of mind now, but will lead you toward the new system of things which will shortly replace the present, where boundless freedom from every sort of fear will be yours forever and ever.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Just think of it! No more sighing, no more crying, no more dying. No fear of cold and hot wars. No fear of inflations or depressions. A beautiful paradise full of peace, goodness, love and joy. A new world over which Jehovah God will reign supreme! Hope placed in such removes all fear over the collapse and destruction of the present satanic system.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"></p>
