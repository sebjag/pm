But by whom? The new apostle should be one who had followed Jesus throughout his ministry and had witnessed his resurrection.

<strong>Foreknowledge, Foreordination</strong><br/>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sn"><strong><em>Did God predestine Judas to betray Jesus in order to fulfill prophecy?</em></strong></p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb">The traitorous course of Judas Iscariot fulfilled divine prophecy and demonstrated Jehovah’s foreknowledge as well as that of his Son. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/101/0" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Ps 41:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/101/1" data-bid="102-2" class="b"> 55:12, 13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/101/2" data-bid="102-3" class="b"> 109:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/101/3" data-bid="102-4" class="b"> Ac 1:16-20</a>) Yet it cannot be said that God foreordained or predestinated Judas himself to such a course. The prophecies foretold that some intimate acquaintance of Jesus would be his betrayer, but they did not specify which of those sharing such acquaintance it would be. Again, Bible principles rule against God’s having foreordained Judas’ actions. The divine standard stated by the apostle is: “Never lay your hands hastily upon any man; neither be a sharer in the sins of others; preserve yourself chaste.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/102/0" data-bid="103-1" class="b">1Ti 5:22</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/103/0" data-bid="104-1" class="b">3:6</a>.) Evidencing his <span id="page858" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="858" data-before-text="858"></span>concern that the selection of his 12 apostles be wisely and properly made, Jesus spent the night in prayer to his Father before making known his decision. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/104/0" data-bid="105-1" class="b">Lu 6:12-16</a>) If Judas were already divinely foreordained to be a traitor, this would result in inconsistency in God’s direction and guidance and, according to the rule, would make him a sharer in the sins that one committed.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="sb">Thus, it seems evident that at the time of his being selected as an apostle, Judas’ heart presented no definite evidence of a treasonous attitude. He allowed a ‘poisonous root to spring up’ and defile him, resulting in his deviation and in his accepting, not God’s direction, but the Devil’s leading in a course of thievery and treachery. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/105/0" data-bid="106-1" class="b">Heb 12:14, 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/105/1" data-bid="106-2" class="b"> Joh 13:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/105/2" data-bid="106-3" class="b"> Ac 1:24, 25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/105/3" data-bid="106-4" class="b"> Jas 1:14, 15</a>; see <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/3">JUDAS</a> No. 4.) By the time such deviation reached a certain point, Jesus himself could read Judas’ heart and foretell his betrayal.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001549/106/0" data-bid="107-1" class="b">Joh 13:10, 11</a>.</p>

To start with, this governing body appears to have been made up of just the 11 apostles. When seeking Jehovah’s will in the replacement of Judas Iscariot, Peter quoted <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1987564/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 109:8</a>, which states: “His office of oversight let someone else take.” Then, in their prayer to Jehovah, Peter and his companions asked God to designate the man “to take the place of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas deviated.” Matthias was appointed to serve “along with the eleven apostles.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1987564/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 1:20,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1987564/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 24-26</a>.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 8.

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">After Christ’s death, but prior to Pentecost, 33 C.E., the apostle Peter presented at a Christian gathering the need for a replacement for Judas, in accord with the prophetic words at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971368/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 109:8</a>. “So they [evidently the male Christians present] put up two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.” The assembled Christians prayed, asking <em>Jehovah</em> to designate the replacement. Then “they cast lots over them [the two], and the lot fell upon Matthias; and <em>he was reckoned along with the eleven apostles.”</em>​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971368/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Acts 1:15-26</a>.</p>

(a) In connection with filling the place vacated by unfaithful Judas, how is it indicated that the apostles were “overseers”? (b) With how many “overseers” did the Jerusalem congregation start at Pentecost of 33 C.E.?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> The apostle Peter and the other eleven apostles were, not only “older men,” but also “overseers.” This becomes apparent at the time that Peter recommended to the Jerusalem congregation to fill the place that had been vacated by the unfaithful apostle Judas. As calling for this, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971843/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 109:8</a> was quoted by Peter, as he said: “It is written in the book of Psalms, . . . ‘His office of oversight let someone else take.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971843/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Acts 1:20</a>) The Hebrew word for “office of oversight” was rendered in the Greek <em>Septuagint Version</em> by the word <em>e·pi·sko·peʹ,</em> which refers to the office of an overseer (<em>e·piʹsko·pos,</em> Greek). Logically, then, the office of an apostle was the office of an overseer, and the apostles were overseers appointed by Jesus Christ. For this reason, on the day of Pentecost of 33 C.E., the Jerusalem congregation of about one hundred and twenty members started out with twelve overseers. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971843/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Acts 1:15 to 2:43</a>) Thereafter as “older men” were appointed to help in taking care of the growing congregation, more than twelve overseers were serving in it.</p>

So the Bible does not necessarily say that Jehovah held such opinion of the twins before their birth. It is a scientifically established fact that much of a child’s general disposition and temperament are determined at the time of conception, due to the genetic factors contributed by each parent. That God can see such factors is self-evident; David speaks of Jehovah as seeing “even the embryo of me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/77/0" data-bid="78-1" class="b">Ps. 139:14-16</a>; see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/78/0" data-bid="79-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 11:5</a>.) To what extent such divine insight affected Jehovah’s foreordination concerning the two boys cannot be said, but, at any rate, his choice of Jacob over Esau did not of itself doom Esau or his descendants, the Edomites, to destruction. Even individuals from among the accursed Canaanites gained the privilege of association with God’s covenant people and received blessings.

The “change of mind” that Esau earnestly sought with tears, however, was only an unsuccessful attempt to change his father Isaac’s decision that the firstborn’s special blessing should remain entirely with Jacob.

Nor is there any indication that God coerced the individuals to act against their own will. In the cases of Pharaoh, Judas Iscariot, and God’s own Son, there is no evidence that Jehovah’s foreknowledge was exercised prior to the person’s coming into existence. Within these individual cases certain principles are illustrated, bearing on God’s foreknowledge and foreordination.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="sb">One such principle is God’s testing of individuals by causing or allowing certain circumstances or events, or by causing such individuals to hear his inspired messages, the result being that they are obliged to exercise their free choice to make a decision and thus reveal a definite heart attitude, read by Jehovah.

However, some translations render the Hebrew account to read that Jehovah “let [Pharaoh’s] heart wax bold” (<em>Ro</em>); “let [Pharaoh’s] heart became obstinate.” (<em>NW</em>) In support of such rendering<em>,</em> the Appendix to Rotherham’s translation shows that in Hebrew the <em>occasion</em> or <em>permission</em> of an event is often presented as if it were the <em>cause</em> of the event, and that “even <em>positive commands</em> are occasionally to be accepted as meaning no more than <em>permission.”</em> Thus at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/95/0" data-bid="96-1" class="b">Exodus 1:17</a> the original Hebrew text literally says that the midwives “caused the male children to live,” whereas in reality they <em>permitted</em> them to live by refraining from putting them to death. After quoting Hebrew scholars M. M. Kalisch, H. F. W. Gesenius, and B. Davies in support, Rotherham states that the Hebrew sense of the texts involving Pharaoh is that “God permitted Pharaoh to harden his own heart—spared him—gave him the opportunity, the occasion, of working out the wickedness that was in him. That is all.”—<em>The Emphasised Bible,</em> by J. B. Rotherham, Appendix, p. 919; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/96/0" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Isaiah 10:5-7</a>.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="sb">Corroborating this understanding is the fact that the record definitely shows that Pharaoh himself “hardened his heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/97/0" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Ex. 8:15,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/97/1" data-bid="98-2" class="b"> 32</a>, <em>AV</em>; “made his heart unresponsive,” <em>NW</em>) He thus exercised his own will and followed his own stubborn inclination, the results of which inclination Jehovah accurately foresaw and predicted.

The prophecies foretold that some intimate acquaintance of Jesus would be his betrayer, but did not specify which of those sharing such acquaintance it would be. Again, Bible principles rule against God’s having foreordained Judas’ actions. The divine standard stated by the apostle is: “Never lay your hands hastily upon any man; neither be a sharer in the sins of others; preserve yourself chaste.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/102/0" data-bid="103-1" class="b">1 Tim. 5:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011507/102/1" data-bid="103-2" class="b"> compare 3:6</a>.)

None of such nonsense! The Bible plainly shows and illustrates that the holy spirit is an invisible active force. It issues forth from God and acts directly upon his Son Jesus Christ. Then through his heavenly Son it acts upon other persons or things in order to bring God’s will and purposes to reality. For instance, on the festival day of Pentecost, fifty days after Jesus was resurrected from the dead and ten days after he went back to heaven, the holy spirit was poured out upon the Christian congregation in Jerusalem. The apostle Peter explained the miracle that took place by saying to the crowd of wondering Jews: “This Jesus God resurrected, of which fact we are all witnesses. Therefore because he was exalted to the right hand of God and received the promised holy spirit from the Father, he has poured out this which you see and hear.” King David had not ascended to heaven to pour out that spirit, but Jesus, David’s descendant and Lord, had done so.

The holy spirit is not a wild force running blindly. It is a directed force. In the appointing of the Ephesian overseers it was sent forth from Jehovah God as its fountain. The first agent or intermediary through which it operated from heaven was the Lord Jesus at God’s right hand. On the day of Pentecost its operation was accompanied by a “noise just like that of a rushing stiff breeze” and by visible “tongues as if of fire” sitting on the heads of each of the 120 Christian disciples into whom it came, to fill them and make them talk with languages that they had never learned.

No; the action of those men was only incidental and to show that they acted for God’s spirit in setting aside the two missionaries. The fact stands out that they were made missionaries by the holy spirit, for the Bible goes on to say about the two missionaries: “Accordingly <span id="page44" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="44" data-before-text="44"></span>these men, sent out by the holy spirit [not by men in Antioch], went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed away to Cyprus. And when they got to be in Salamis they began publishing the word of God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958043/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Acts 13:1-5</a>.</p>

<strong>“Clean Worship” Assemblies: from France to Netherlands</strong><br/><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">As with its predecessors, this assembly now progressed to a rapid but heart-warming close, with just two speakers. The feeling of the Dutch seemed brought up to a pitch where it must express itself more freely, and the convention servant’s report had them repeatedly laughing and applauding. He asked if the assembly had been a <em>slag!</em> (a hit, a success!) and they roared out <em>Ja!</em> a positive Yes! Then with appropriate suggestions and remarks the Society’s president spoke in farewell and dismissal of the convention. All agreed with him that Jehovah’s witnesses are the greatest optimists, and that those appointed to minister to them in responsible <span id="page763" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="763" data-before-text="763"></span>positions should be servants, and not stern, exacting, hard bosses. Love is vitally essential for us all, love to God first and love to neighbor as to oneself; and in love we should help one another in the theocratic organization.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">So with song and prayer the finest assembly yet in The Land of Windmills and Dikes concluded. By their beaming faces and words the friends showed that was the way they felt about it. How glad they were they had expended themselves to come, and now how loath they seemed to part! The blessings received at Rotterdam are sure to sustain them in the days ahead, moving them still more zealously in Jehovah’s service, to the increase of the interest of his kingdom in the Netherlands.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Beggar, Begging</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">While the English word “begging” may mean simply to implore or plead, the discussion here deals primarily with begging in the <span id="page208" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="208" data-before-text="208"></span>sense of the habitual practice of publicly asking for charity.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The patriarchal arrangement, which the Bible indicates existed prior to and after the global flood of Noah’s day, doubtless served greatly to prevent situations where individuals would find themselves isolated, in dire straits, and dependent upon public charity, and thus it worked against the development of a pauper class. From ancient times hospitality to strangers or travelers seems to have been quite freely practiced; such hospitality is at least reflected in the Biblical accounts, with rare exceptions. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 19:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ex. 2:18-20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Judg. 19:15-21</a>) The development of cities is considered to have contributed to the weakening of the patriarchal arrangement and possibly this, together with a selfish tendency to take undue advantage of the hospitality or charity of others, led to the development of begging among humankind.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Begging or mendicancy is apparently of very ancient origin in the lands of the Orient. This makes all the more notable the fact that in the Hebrew Scriptures there is no indication that begging existed to any degree or constituted a particular problem in the nation of Israel from the time of its formation until its going into exile in Babylon. When moving out of Egypt and their slavery in that land, the Israelites “went asking [a form of the Hebrew verb <em>sha·ʼalʹ</em>] from the Egyptians articles of silver and articles of gold and mantles. . . . and they stripped the Egyptians.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ex. 12:35, 36</a>) This, however, was in accord with God’s command and prophecy and was evidently viewed as just compensation for their long years of slave labor and the injustices endured by them at the hands of the Egyptians. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex. 3:21, 22</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 15:12-15</a>.) It set no precedent for the practice of begging.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Mosaic law contained forceful legislation on behalf of the poor, which, when observed, removed all cause for begging. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Lev. 19:9, 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Deut. 15:7-10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 24:19-21</a>; see GIFTS OF MERCY.) The Hebrew Scriptures strongly express trust in God’s providence for those adhering to righteousness, even as David in his old age exclaimed: “I have not seen anyone righteous left entirely, nor his offspring looking for [“begging,” <em>AV;</em> a form of the Hebrew <em>ba·qashʹ</em>] bread,” even though such righteous ones themselves are shown to be openhanded in their generosity.

On the other hand, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs (20:4</a>) portrays the lazy man as “begging in reaping time,” and the psalmist (109:10) describes the execution of punishment on the wicked as obliging “his sons [to] go wandering about; and they must do begging, and they must look for food from their desolate places.” In these two latter texts the word “begging” translates the Hebrew <em>sha·ʼalʹ</em>, which term basically means simply to ask or request (as at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Exodus 3:22</a>); however, in these two cases the implication is that the asking is done in the active, and perhaps public, manner characterizing begging.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">It appears that, during the period from the time of the Jews’ return from exile (537 B.C.E.) down to the time of Jesus’ appearance on the earthly scene, the concept developed among the Jews that the act of giving “alms” or gifts of charity had merit in itself toward salvation. This is evidenced by the statement contained in the apocryphal book of Ecclesiasticus (3:30) (believed to have been written about the second century B.C.E.) that “almsgiving atones for sins.” Such view undoubtedly served to encourage begging. (Compare the much publicized giving denounced by Jesus in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 6:2</a>.)</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Domination by the foreign powers brought oppression to the Jewish people and doubtless caused considerable disruption of the application of the Mosaic law concerning ancestral land rights and similar provisions. This, together with false religious philosophies, which failed to inculcate a genuine and principled love of neighbor (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 23:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Luke 10:29-31</a>), also likely shared responsibility for the growth of begging in Palestine. Thus we find a number of references in the Christian Greek Scriptures to beggars in that land.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The blind, the lame and the diseased figure among the beggars described in the time of Jesus and the apostles. Ophthalmia (a disease of the eyes still common in the Near East) perhaps caused some of the blindness among these men. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Mark 10:46-49;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Luke 16:20,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/11/3" data-bid="12-4" class="b"> 18:35-43;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/11/4" data-bid="12-5" class="b"> John 9:1-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/11/5" data-bid="12-6" class="b"> Acts 3:2-10</a>) Like beggars today, they often situated themselves along public thoroughfares or near places frequented by crowds, as at the temple. Despite the prominence given to almsgiving, beggars were looked down upon, so that the steward of Jesus’ parable said, “I am ashamed to beg [from Gr., <em>e·pai·teʹo,</em> an intensified form of the verb <em>ai·teʹo,</em> meaning ‘to ask’].”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 16:3</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The Greek word <em>pto·khosʹ,</em> used by <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Luke (16:20,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 22</a>) in recording Jesus’ reference to Lazarus as a beggar, describes one who crouches and cringes and refers not merely to the poor but to the very poor, the destitute, the beggars.

Such things were “beggarly” in comparison with the spiritual riches obtainable through Christ Jesus.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Although Jesus and his apostles showed kindness to beggars, they did not encourage begging; though they gratefully accepted hospitality, they did not beg. Jesus told those who followed him merely to obtain bread that their concern should be, not for “the food that perishes, but for the food that remains for life everlasting.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010616/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">John 6:26, 27</a>) Peter told a lame beggar at the temple: “Silver and gold I do not possess, but what I do have is what I give you,” using his spiritual gifts to heal the man.

<strong>Increase Your Praise of Jehovah!</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span id="page339" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="339" data-before-text="339"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> This matter of aiding one another is not limited to dealing with your brothers at the Kingdom Hall but also extends out to assisting others in the field service. “The generous soul will itself be made fat, and the one freely watering others will himself also be freely watered.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Prov. 11:25</a>) So whenever you plan to engage in the house-to-house or back-call or home Bible study activity, ask yourself: “Whom can I invite to go along with me?” Are you a pioneer who goes alone simply because “I just have to get my time in before the end of the month”? Stop and think. If you get in only two hours instead of three, due to helping three weak ones, think how much more praise this means to Jehovah. Four times two equals eight hours instead of your individual three. Maybe <em>you</em> will be praised more by men if you put in more hours working by yourself, but <em>Jehovah</em> is praised more when more praisers are in the field. Paul counsels: Keep “an eye, not in personal interest upon just your own matters, but also in personal interest upon those of the others.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Phil. 2:4</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="ss"><strong>PRAISING JEHOVAH WITH THE POWERS OF SPEECH</strong></p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">21.

For, says the apostle Peter, “maintain your conduct fine among the nations.” Why so? In order, Peter continues, “that . . . they may as a result of your fine works of which they are eyewitnesses <em>glorify God.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:12</a>) So when dealing with outsiders you must be patient and long-suffering. You must show kindness and neighbor love. You must exercise self-control. You must prove your uncompromising integrity to Jehovah when facing the everyday issues. And there are so many issues presented by this materialistic, sex-crazed system of things, including such vital matters as blood transfusions, regimented servitude and saluting of images of the State, all of which must be met with the same intelligent determination as displayed by first-century Christians who boldly declared: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965403/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Acts 5:29</a>.</p>

Although the <em>King James Version</em> acknowledges the divine name by using “LORD” as opposed to “Lord,” it was not the first to confuse these titles, for the ancient Greek <em>Septuagint,</em> translated from the Hebrew, used “Lord” for Jehovah in its later copies. Why? Because the <em>title</em> “Lord” was substituted for the divine <em>name,</em> the Tetragrammaton (יהוה). Says scholar A. E. Garvie: “Use of the title Lord [<em>kyʹri·os</em>] is most easily and probably explained from the use of that title in the Jewish synagogue instead of the covenant name Yahveh [Jehovah], when the Scriptures were being read.”</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Bible identifies Jehovah as the “Sovereign Lord.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994407/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 15:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994407/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994407/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Acts 4:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994407/1/3" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> Revelation 6:10</a>) He is also called “the true Lord” and “the Lord of the whole earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994407/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Exodus 23:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994407/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Joshua 3:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994407/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Revelation 11:4</a>) Who, then, is the other “Lord” of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994407/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 110:1</a>, and how did he come to be recognized as “Lord” by Jehovah?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>Jesus Christ as “Lord”</strong></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Jesus is addressed as “Lord” in the four Gospels, most often in Luke and John.

Although the end of the Gentile Times had been announced in publications by the Watch Tower Society for decades as due to fall in 1914, those earthly rulers were determined to resist the heavenly Messiah in taking over world domination. They kept making the most advanced preparations for international war. Yet, outwardly, 1914 started off peacefully.

Why so? Because as the newly installed King over the earth it was proper for him to turn his attention to his earthly domain, then occupied by his enemies, aspirants for imperial world domination. ‘The rod of his strength’ was sent out of “the Jerusalem above,” toward our earth. At Jehovah’s command he began to ‘rule in the midst of his enemies’ down at the earth. It was also to the earth that he hurled down the Devil and his demons out of heaven.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983566/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 12:7-17</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 8.

At any rate, his answer corresponds with those prophecies made by King David, far more impressively so since 1914 than during the 37 years from when the apostles asked the question and the destruction of Jerusalem by the Roman legions in 70 C.E. Certainly that appalling Jewish calamity did not remain without equal. It was not worse, for example, than the massacre of the reported 6,000,000 Jews under the Nazi Hitler regime before and during World War II. Jerusalem’s destruction was not a “great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning until now, no, nor will occur again.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983566/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 24:21</a>) What the inquiring apostles witnessed down to the end of the first century C.E. was a miniature fulfillment of Jesus’ prophecy, in the way of famines, earthquakes, pestilences, wars and persecutions, as well as the wiping out of “the Jerusalem today.” They did not need to howl over this, because the celestial Jerusalem kept standing.</p>

(a) When did Jesus’ time of waiting in heaven end?

In our twentieth century, in the year 1914, at the end of what Jesus Christ called “the times of the Gentiles” or “the appointed times of the nations.” He prophesied that the city of Jerusalem of his day would be destroyed and would continue to be trampled on by the Gentile nations until the end of those Gentile times for the nations to do such trampling. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970763/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 21:20-24</a>, <em>Authorized Version; New World Translation</em>) Even in Jesus’ days the Gentile nations as represented in the Roman World Power were trampling on what Jerusalem stood for, the kingdom of Jehovah God in the hands of the royal house of David. Before the Roman Empire, the Babylonian Empire had started the trampling by destroying Jerusalem and its temple back in 607 B.C.E., and after that the Medo-Persian Empire and then the Grecian Empire kept up the trampling until the Roman World Power took over Gentile control of Jerusalem. So Jesus Christ did not try to restore the earthly throne of King David to Jerusalem. Why should he try to do so, when he himself foretold the destruction that came upon Jerusalem by the Romans in the year 70 C.E.?</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="qu"> 4.

Since he himself had brought up the subject of the “times of the Gentiles,” he knew that he had to wait at God’s right hand until those “appointed times of the nations” ended 1,844 years after Jerusalem’s second destruction in the year 70 C.E. He could not change God’s timing of world affairs, and he did not desire to do so. During all those years of waiting he would be serving as Jehovah’s High Priest and applying the lifesaving benefits of his ransom sacrifice to his faithful disciples on earth, as these make up his church or congregation. Why? Because these are to be made joint heirs or associate kings with him in God’s heavenly kingdom.

Subtly the old enemy Satan was out to defile the true worship of Jehovah by means of a two-pronged campaign. Firstly, by means of introducing untheocratic forms of church government he would defile the original clean temple structure of organization as set by Jesus Christ.

This, namely, the stoppage of the trampling of the Gentile nations on what was symbolized by the ancient Davidic city of Jerusalem. The kingdom of Jehovah God by means of his anointed one of the royal line of David was no longer to be trampled on in contempt by the Gentile nations. The beginning of those Gentile Times was in 607 B.C.E. and was marked by the ruining of the kingdom of God. In opposite fashion, the end of the Gentile Times in 1914 C.E. was to be marked by the revival, the rebirth, of God’s kingdom in the hands of his anointed one or Messiah, Christ. It was the time marked for the coming of the Anointed One with the “legal right” to the crown and the time for Jehovah God to give it to him. This Messianic kingdom of God would then be a divine government for the Gentile nations to reckon with henceforth. Never would they be able to trample on it <span id="page618" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="618" data-before-text="618"></span>victoriously, even though they kept up their selfish endeavors to hold on to the sovereignty of all parts of the earth.

It is beyond the reach of the Gentile governments and their spaceships and rockets. The earthly Jerusalem has nothing to do with it. Since Jesus Christ was put to death on Calvary outside the walls of Jerusalem in the year 33 C.E., that city has no connection with God’s Messianic kingdom.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[73]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Five days before his death Jesus rode into Jerusalem accompanied by a great crowd of joyful people.

How so? In this way: For almost six thousand years now all mankind have been dying, and at death they have quit eating and drinking. To eat and drink we have to live and stay in good health. In turn, to keep on living we have to eat and drink. All mankind have inherited sinfulness and death from the first man on earth, who sinned against God the Creator and brought God’s sentence of death upon himself before ever he became a father of children. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965283/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12-14</a>) Because of his rebellious sin against his Creator, the first man and his wife were driven from their perfect Paradise home in the garden of Eden, to die outside. Thus the ruining of the earth, and the famine, drought, hunger and starvation have come about as an outgrowth of man’s sinfulness. Says the Christian apostle Paul: “The wages sin pays is death, but the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965283/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rom. 6:23</a>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 4.

He died childless, thus sacrificing even his right to become father to a perfect human race on earth. Long ago miraculous food sustained the life of his earthly nation for forty years when they traveled through a wilderness. Hence Jesus compared his <span id="page244" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="244" data-before-text="244"></span>perfect sacrifice to such food. He said: “I am the bread of life. . . .

<strong>Answering the Roman Governor’s Question, “What Is Truth?”</strong><br/><p id="p36" data-pid="36" data-rel-pid="[100]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"><sup>30</sup></span> This kingdom covenant and all its features were what God’s Word calls the “loving-kindnesses to David,” and God’s swearing to it added to the faithfulness and trustworthiness of it. Hence in a time of persecution God’s people who depend upon him to carry out this kingdom covenant can well take up the words of the psalmist, not in any doubt about the covenant, but in an appeal to God concerning it, and say: “Where are your former acts of loving-kindness, O Jehovah, about which you swore to David in your faithfulness?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ps. 89:49</a>) Considerately God assures his people of his faithfulness to the covenant, saying: “I shall readily conclude with you people an indefinitely lasting covenant respecting <span id="page653" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="653" data-before-text="653"></span>the loving-kindnesses to David that are faithful.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Isa. 55:3</a>) Jesus Christ in particular could take consolation from this divine promise.</p><p id="p101" data-pid="101" class="qu">31.

Thus Jehovah did not prove untrue to King David and did not draw back from giving to that anointed king a permanent heir. Jehovah answered the prayer made to him in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 132:1-18</a>: “On account of David your servant, do not turn back the face of your anointed one.

This Jesus God resurrected, of which fact we are all witnesses. Therefore because he was exalted to the right hand of God and received the promised holy spirit from the Father, he has poured out this which you see and hear.

He was to be a deathless, everlasting heavenly king.

<strong>Why Two Covenants for Kingdom Power?</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">God’s covenant with King David reads, in part, as follows: “When your days come <span id="page477" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="477" data-before-text="477"></span>to the full, and you must lie down with your forefathers, then I shall certainly raise up your seed after you, which will come out of your inward parts; and I shall indeed firmly establish his kingdom. . . . And your house and your kingdom will certainly be steadfast to time indefinite before you; your very throne will become one firmly established to time indefinite.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964566/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Sam. 7:12-16</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In faithfulness to this promise Jehovah saw to it that those who sat as His representatives on the earthly throne in Jerusalem thereafter were the fleshly descendants of David. This continued until the days of wicked King Zedekiah, when Jehovah decreed that that typical kingdom would “certainly become no one’s until he comes who has the legal right.” This one with the legal right was to be the Son of God, and he was born through the virgin Mary, who was in David’s lineage. So when his birth was announced the angel Gabriel appropriately stated: “Jehovah God will give him the throne of David his father, and he will rule as king over the house of Jacob forever, and there will be no end of his kingdom.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964566/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezek. 21:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964566/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Luke 1:32, 33</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">What, specifically, was promised to David’s heirs in this covenant? It was strictly the right to rule on an earthly throne. It promised nothing more than this; so its heirs could inherit nothing more. That this was the understanding of matters, even among Jesus’ own apostles, is evident from the question that they asked him after he had been resurrected from the dead and appeared to them in a materialized body: “Lord, are you restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time?” They still expected the restoration of the earthly kingdom of David, which had been overturned in 607 B.C.E., because that is the way they understood the promises of the Davidic covenant.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964566/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 1:6</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In this very same conversation Jesus advised his followers that they should “not withdraw from Jerusalem, but keep waiting for what the Father has promised.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964566/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 1:4</a>) They received the fulfillment of this promise shortly thereafter when Jesus poured out God’s holy spirit on them on the day of Pentecost, 33 C.E., and it was only then that they began fully to understand spiritual things. Under the power of this holy spirit the apostle Peter enlightened his hearers as to the superiority of Jesus’ position over that held by his earthly predecessor David, saying: “This Jesus God resurrected . . . he was exalted to the right hand of God . . . Actually David did not ascend to the heavens, but he himself says, ‘Jehovah said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand, until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.”’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964566/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 2:32-35</a>) From this it became evident that Jesus was to receive something greatly superior to an earthly throne such as David had had. His kingdom was to be heavenly and include rulership over all the earth.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">David himself under inspiration showed that the position to be held at a later date by God’s Son would embrace more than anything he could pass on to him, and that is why he spoke of him prophetically as “my Lord.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964566/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1</a>) Concerning the kingdom that this one would inherit it was foretold in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964566/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Daniel 7:13, 14</a>: “I kept on beholding in the visions of the night, and, see there! with the clouds of the heavens someone like a son of man happened to be coming; and to the Ancient of Days he gained access, and they brought him up close even before that One. And to him there were given rulership and dignity and kingdom, that the peoples, national groups and languages should all serve even him. His rulership is an indefinitely lasting rulership that will not pass away, and his <span id="page478" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="478" data-before-text="478"></span>kingdom one that will not be brought to ruin.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">So after Jesus had faithfully finished his earthly ministry, God “raised him up from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above every government and authority and power and lordship and every name named, not only in this system of things, but also in that to come.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964566/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Eph. 1:20, 21</a>) At that time, in the year 33 C.E., <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964566/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 110:1</a> applied, which says: “The utterance of Jehovah to my Lord is: ‘Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.’” After nearly nineteen centuries, at the end of the “appointed times of the nations,” or in 1914 C.E., Jehovah issued the further command recorded in the following verse, saying to his King-Son: “Go subduing in the midst of your enemies.” So Jesus’ position as king is something far more than anything that David ever had.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>COVENANT FOR HEAVENLY KINGDOM</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Does that ruling position of Jesus include anything else? Yes, it does. Just two verses later in the same psalm, David was inspired to say: “Jehovah has sworn (and he will feel no regret): ‘You are a priest to time indefinite according to the manner of Melchizedek!’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964566/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 110:4</a>) Here, then, was another legal promise concerning the coming Messiah that God had made under oath, first recorded in David’s time. Not only would Jesus’ kingdom be superior to that of David, but he would be a priest as well as a king, something that could never be under the Davidic covenant because God’s law to Israel maintained a strict separation between kingship and priesthood. The very nature of this special office held by Melchizedek made it something that could not be passed on to anyone as a human successor of his. It did not come into existence again in God’s arrangement until God’s due time to make Jesus a spiritual king and priest. For this reason, it is not even mentioned again in the Scriptures until Paul discussed the subject in his letter to the Hebrew Christians, written about 61 C.E.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">‘But,’ someone may object, ‘how can it be said that the covenant for a kingly priesthood gives Jesus the right to a heavenly kingdom and priesthood when Melchizedek was also a man, just like David?’ Well, Jesus was not and is not the heir of Melchizedek. However, there were certain circumstances surrounding Melchizedek that appear to have been ordered by God precisely for a prophetic purpose. They showed that Melchizedek’s office was not dependent on human relationships. Paul alludes to these circumstances in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964566/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Hebrews 7:3</a>: “In being fatherless, motherless, without genealogy, having neither a beginning of days nor an end of life [in that none of these things were recorded], but having been made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.” So, too, Jesus’ being God’s High Priest does not result from any human connections; it is not because of his genealogy. While Jesus remained on earth as a man he could not become a Jewish priest at all, because the law covenant was still in effect until after his death and this limited the Jewish priesthood strictly to the members of Aaron’s house in the tribe of Levi. But Jesus became a spiritual priest.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Moreover, the apostle Paul understood that Jesus could be perfected in this spiritual office only by being raised from a sacrificial death and exalted to God’s right hand in the heavens, as is shown by the fact that Paul applies David’s prophetic words concerning Melchizedek to Jesus Christ, who did not appoint himself or seek the honor, saying: “Christ did not glorify himself by becoming a high priest, but was glorified by him who spoke with reference <span id="page479" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="479" data-before-text="479"></span>to him: ‘You are my son; I, today, I have become your father.’ Just as he says also in another place: ‘You are a priest forever according to the manner of Melchizedek.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964566/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Heb. 5:5, 6</a>.</p>

And upon him the spirit of Jehovah must settle down, . . . And it must occur in that day that there will be the root of Jesse that will be standing up as a signal for the peoples. To him even the nations will turn inquiringly, and his resting place must become glorious.” This Jesus, the offspring of Jesse through David, became also the “root of Jesse” from three aspects: (1) Jesus Christ has kept the genealogical line of Jesse alive by becoming the permanent heir of Jesse. (2) He becomes Lord to David and so to David’s father Jesse, as the apostle Peter explained at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost of A.D. 33:</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="si">“Actually David did not ascend to the heavens, but he himself says, ‘Jehovah said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand, until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.’” Therefore let all the house of Israel know for a certainty that God made him both Lord [to King David] and Christ, this Jesus whom you impaled.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964606/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Acts 2:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964606/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 34-36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964606/23/2" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> Ps. 110:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964606/23/3" data-bid="24-4" class="b"> Matt. 22:41-45</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">(3) Christ is now a Savior, and during his 1,000-year reign over mankind, he will resurrect Jesse as well as his son David.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964606/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Isa. 9:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964606/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> John 5:26-29</a>.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">There can be no question about it.

He is a king-priest like Melchizedek forever, therefore is both God’s chief one in government and High Priest of the true worship of God. A choice of worship and government has to be made. We cannot establish the rule of Shiloh in the earth, but the choice that we make greatly affects our lives and our prospects for life under the peaceful reign of the great Shiloh, “The One Whose It Is.” This will be further graphically proved as later issues of <em>The Watchtower</em> consider the matter.</p>

All the earthly nations who oppose God’s heavenly kingdom as exercised through his enthroned Son Jesus Christ. As they are the enemies of the royal Stone laid in the heavenly Zion or Jerusalem, they are also the enemies of that heavenly city.

<strong>Light on Life’s Roadway from the Psalms</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">To begin with, the Psalms eloquently and repeatedly call attention to the fact that Jehovah God created all things: “When I see your heavens, the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have prepared, what is mortal man?” (8:3, 4) “Before the mountains themselves were born, or you proceeded to bring forth as with labor pains the earth and the productive land, even from time indefinite to time indefinite you are God.” (90:2) “Know that Jehovah is God. It is he that has made us, and not we ourselves.” (100:3) <span id="page550" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="550" data-before-text="550"></span>“I shall laud you because in a fear-inspiring way I am wonderfully made.”—139:14.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Among the earliest instances of God’s dealings with his creatures that the book of Psalms records is that of Jehovah concluding a covenant with Abraham and his making sworn statements to Isaac and Jacob. In fulfillment of these promises Jehovah God “brought out his people with exultation” to the land promised.—105:9, 10, 42-44.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Bringing his people Israel into their Promised Land involved many mighty acts, and these the book of Psalms also features. It tells that Jehovah sent ten plagues upon Egypt, that he split the Red Sea so that they could pass over and that he miraculously sustained them in the wilderness, providing bread, meat and water. Noted also are the striking victories God gained for his people in the days of Barak and Gideon.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalms 78,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 83,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 105,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 106,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/3/4" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> 135</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Then too, the Psalms record that it was necessary for Jehovah God repeatedly to chastise his people, even to the point of bringing them into Babylonian captivity: “By the rivers of Babylon—there we sat down. We also wept when we remembered Zion.” (137:1-9) And they record also Israel’s return from captivity: “When Jehovah gathered back the captive ones of Zion, we became like those who were dreaming. . . . At that time they proceeded to say among the nations: ‘Jehovah has done a great thing in what he has done with them.’” (126:1, 2) Yes, by recording how Jehovah God dealt with his people in times past and why, the book of Psalms throws much light on life’s roadway, for thereby it acquaints us with God’s attributes and principles.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>THE LIGHT OF PROPHECY</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The book of Psalms also serves as a light on life’s roadway by reason of the prophecies it contains, many of which have already been fulfilled, giving confidence that the rest will also have fulfillment. Among the many prophecies of the Psalms regarding Jesus Christ that the Christian Greek Scriptures show had fulfillment were that he would come in dedication to do God’s will (40:8; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 10:7-9</a>); that zeal for God’s house would eat him up, as it were (69:9; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 2:17</a>); that he would be betrayed by an intimate (41:9; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 13:18</a>); that lots would be cast for his garments (22:18; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 19:24</a>); that not a bone of him would be broken (34:20; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 19:36</a>) and that God would not leave his soul in Sheol or Hades.—16:10; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 2:29-31</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Further, the book of Psalms foretold Jesus’ exaltation to the right hand of his Father, there to await God’s due time for him to go into action against God’s enemies and for God to subject all things under Christ’s feet.—110:1, 2; 8:6; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Heb. 1:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 2:8</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The fulfillment of such prophecies instills faith that the prophecies in the Psalms regarding the blessings of the Messianic reign of the King’s Son, Jesus Christ, will also have fulfillment: “Let him judge the afflicted ones of the people, let him save the sons of the poor one, and let him crush the defrauder. He will descend like the rain upon the mown grass, like copious showers that wet the earth. In his days the righteous one will sprout, and the abundance of peace until the moon is no more. There will come to be plenty of grain on the earth; on the top of the mountains there will be an overflow.”—72:4, 6, 7, 16.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>BIBLE TEACHINGS</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The book of Psalms also throws light on life’s roadway by the various Bible teachings it touches on. Fittingly it stresses the role of Jehovah God as the Universal <span id="page551" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="551" data-before-text="551"></span>Sovereign. Though ‘the rulers of earth mass together as one against Jehovah and his anointed one, Jehovah himself will laugh at them in derision, speak to them in his anger and disturb them in hot displeasure.’ (2:1, 2, 4, 5) He will put them in their place, answering the psalmists’ prayers: “Do arise, O Jehovah! Let not mortal man prove superior in strength. Let the nations be judged before your face. Do put fear into them, O Jehovah, that the nations may know that they are but mortal men.” “Fill their faces with dishonor, that people may search for your name, O Jehovah. That people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.”—9:19, 20; 83:16, 18.</p>

<strong>The Time for God’s Kingdom to Come</strong><br/><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sb">Ever since 1914 these anointed footstep followers of Jesus, using the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society as their legal and publishing instrument, have continued to enlighten people to the meaning of the momentous happenings of this generation. They show how these events have fulfilled Bible prophecy and that, therefore, Jesus did begin ruling in the heavens in 1914, and soon, within this generation, he will <span id="page632" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="632" data-before-text="632"></span>resume the tribulation on Satan’s organization, completely destroying it in the war of Armageddon.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961762/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Rev. 16:14-16</a>.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="ss"><strong>“HE WILL SEPARATE . . . THE SHEEP FROM THE GOATS”</strong></p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="sb">Continuing his discussion with his four disciples, Jesus said that, on his arrival, “he will separate people one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. And he will put the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961762/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matt. 25:32, 33</a>) Since his arrival for judgment work in 1918 Jesus has been doing this separating of the peoples, some to the right side for preservation and others to the left for destruction. How is this separating done? Jesus showed that classification as a “sheep” or a “goat” was based on the way an individual treated his followers on earth and the Kingdom message they carried. This separating work is nearing completion as all peoples are identifying themselves either in support of God’s kingdom, or in opposition to it.</p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="ss"><strong>OTHER PROPHECIES</strong></p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="sb">In addition to the extensive sign of the last days given by Jesus, features of which we have just considered, another inspired prophecy was recorded by the apostle Paul. It says: “But know this, that <em>in the last days</em> critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, self-assuming, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, disloyal, having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, without love of goodness, betrayers, headstrong, puffed up with pride, lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God, having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power; and from these turn away.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961762/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1-5</a>.</p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="sb">Do you not see on every hand these very conditions? Look at the millions of money lovers that make material things their chief aim in life! See the unprecedented increase of disobedience and delinquency among youth. Observe how the nations talk, talk, talk, but are not open to any agreement. Note the fierceness and lack of self-control of people who, in their drive to get ahead, have lost all love of goodness. See the millions of pleasure lovers whose love of God has grown cold. Note how they pretend to be Christian, “having a form of godly devotion,” but that it exercises no power in their lives to motivate them to love and right works as followers of Christ.</p><p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="sb">In spite of the overwhelming evidence some will scoff: “Conditions are the same as they have been for generations.” But even such ridicule of the scoffers is in fulfillment of Bible prophecy concerning the last days, for the apostle Peter wrote: “For you know this first, that <em>in the last days</em> there will come ridiculers with their ridicule, proceeding according to their own desires and saying: ‘Where is this promised presence of his? Why, from the day our forefathers fell asleep in death, all things are continuing exactly as from creation’s beginning.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961762/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="sb">Do not hastily dismiss the evidence that this is the time for God’s kingdom. Bible chronology pinpoints the year 1914 as the time that Christ arrived and began ruling in the midst of his enemies. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961762/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1, 2</a>) The events of the past forty-seven years support the chronological evidence as correct. The kingdom of the heavens is here! And soon, within this generation, it will come in all its destructive force against Satan and his wicked system of things. Under its rule this earth will become the everlasting paradise home of obedient mankind. So act in harmony with your prayers for God’s kingdom to come by joining the hundreds of thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses in preaching ‘this good news of the Kingdom in all the inhabited earth.’</p><p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="sb"></p>

<strong>This Is a Time of Judgment</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Because the great Judge, Jehovah God, selected Christ to represent him in this judicial work, Jesus speaks of himself as the <span id="page54" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="54" data-before-text="54"></span>one doing the actual judging. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">the fifth chapter of John</a> he points out that he had received this authority from the great Judge, saying: “For the Father judges no one at all, but he has committed all the judging to the Son.

And he will not judge by any mere appearance to his eyes, nor reprove simply according to the thing heard by his ears. And with righteousness he must judge the lowly ones.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa. 11:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">It is the divinely commissioned Judge, Jesus Christ, therefore, who does the actual judging of mankind during this final judgment period for the old world. In his prophecy in which he likens himself to a shepherd, he says: “When the Son of man arrives in his glory and all the angels with him, then he will sit down on his glorious throne. And all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. And he will put the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 25:31-33</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>BEGINNING OF LAST DAYS</strong></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The time for this judging of the nations, as you will note, was set for the last days when Christ would be enthroned in Kingdom glory. It could not take place after the worldly system of things has been destroyed by heavenly forces, as Christ could not then separate the people as sheep are separated from goats. His enthronement in Kingdom power at his second presence would have to be at a time when the wicked still exist, a time before their destruction.

This date is also confirmed by the fact that the Gentile times, or times of the nations, that began in 607 B.C. ended then. It was three and a half years later that he began the work of judgment, first of the “house of God” and then of the nations of this world. This corresponds with the three and a half years that passed from the time Jesus was anointed as King until he entered the temple in Jerusalem and cleansed it. When the evidence is carefully examined it proves conclusively that we are in the last days of this world—the long-foretold judgment period.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">How people respond to the earth-wide preaching of the good news of God’s kingdom and how they treat Jehovah’s servants who do this preaching determines whether they are classed as sheep or goats. To the sheep class Jesus says: “Truly I say to you, To the extent that you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.” And to the goat class he says: “‘Truly I say to you, To the extent that you did not do it to one of these least ones, you did not do it to me.’ And these will depart into everlasting cutting-off, but the righteous ones into everlasting life.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 25:40,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 45, 46</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">If you are one who follows the policy of doing what you think is right and never harming other people but yet you ignore the good news of God’s kingdom and the things he requires, you cannot expect a favorable judgment.

<strong>Jehovah Has Become King</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Jehovah God reigns by and through his Son Jesus Christ. So, when Jesus ascended into heaven, forty days after his resurrection, God said to him: “Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.” When that time came the prophetic words were fulfilled: “I, even I, have installed my king upon Zion, my holy mountain. . . . You are my son; I, today, I have become your father. Ask of me, that I may give nations as your inheritance <span id="page311" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="311" data-before-text="311"></span>and the ends of the earth as your own possession.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 2:6-8</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">In keeping with these prophecies Jesus Christ likened himself to a nobleman who went to a far country to receive a kingdom and then returned, thereby clearly tying in the beginning of God’s kingdom with the return of Christ. When was he to return? In answer to that question Jesus gave the prophecies recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 24,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 25,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/12/2" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> Mark 13 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/12/3" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> Luke 21</a>. Among the various evidences marking the sign of his return Jesus listed wars, famine, earthquakes and pestilence. He also foretold that lawlessness would greatly increase and that “this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations.” The facts show that all these words of Jesus are seeing a most striking fulfillment since the year 1914.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Since that year we are also seeing the fulfillment of Paul’s prophecy: “But know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, . . . without self-control, fierce, . . . lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God, having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1-5</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Many scoff, ridicule and mock when such things are brought to their attention, but they cannot point to another period of time in world history when these prophecies have had such thorough-going fulfillment. In fact, their very ridicule is further evidence, for it also was foretold: “In the last days there will come ridiculers with their ridicule, proceeding according to their own desires and saying: ‘Where is this promised presence of his? Why, from the day our forefathers fell asleep in death, all things are continuing exactly as from creation’s beginning.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>KINGDOM ESTABLISHED IN THE HEAVENS</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">That 1914 indeed marks the year Jehovah became King is conclusively proved by the voices in heaven that John in his apocalyptic vision heard: “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will rule as king for ever and ever.” “We thank you, Jehovah God, the Almighty, the one who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and begun ruling as king. But the nations became wrathful, and your own wrath came, and the appointed time . . . to bring to ruin those ruining the earth.” Without doubt, 1914 marks the time when the nations became wrathful as never before.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Rev. 11:15-18</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">What actually took place in the heavens at that time the apostle John goes on to tell. After introducing God’s heavenly organization of angelic creatures under the symbol of “a woman arrayed with the sun,” and Satan the Devil as “a great fiery-colored dragon,” he describes the beginning of God’s kingdom as the birth of a son “who is destined to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod.”</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Since Satan had been ruler of this wicked world or system of things without any interruption since 607 B.C., it is not to be expected that he would let the birth of God’s kingdom take place without putting up a fight. And so we read that “war broke out in heaven: Michael [Jesus Christ] and his angels battled with the dragon, and the dragon and its angels battled but it did not prevail, neither was a place found for them any longer in heaven. So down the great dragon was hurled, the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan, who is misleading the entire inhabited earth; he was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him.” That this conflict was a real fight can be seen from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Daniel 10:13</a>, which tells of an instance where one of God’s angels was held up for <span id="page312" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="312" data-before-text="312"></span>twenty-one days by one of Satan’s demons.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960365/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Rev. 12:7-9</a>.</p>

On the third day of Jesus’ death Jehovah showed again to all the universe that He is God the Almighty by resurrecting Jesus Christ from the dead and clothing him with immortality, incorruptibility and heavenly glory.

That was when the royal city of Jerusalem was razed to the ground by the world power Babylon. However, God’s kingdom in relation to our earth was not to go out of existence forever.

The destruction of the throne city of Jerusalem and the desolating of its territory of Judah were completed by the month of October of 607 B.C. Hence those seven times of complete heathenish, Gentile domination of the earth would end 2,520 years from that time, or by October of 1914, in our own twentieth century.

Only by subduing these rivals to world domination, and then by desolating the kingdom of Jehovah’s people with capital at ancient Jerusalem, did Babylon become a world power, the third world power listed in Biblical history. Assyria conquered Egypt and even tried to prevent the rise of Babylon to dominance by destroying the city. But Babylon was rebuilt and strove for the ascendancy.

Hengstenberg, one of the foremost German Bible scholars of the nineteenth century, argues at great length to that effect in his <em>Christology and Commentary on the Apocalypse.</em> A strong case for this position is also made in the <em>Imperial Bible Dictionary,</em> edited by the British Bible scholar Fairbairn. And Clarke, in his <em>Commentary,</em> holds that, at least at times, Michael refers to Jesus Christ.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">As for the Scriptural testimony, in the first place note the very meaning of the name “Michael,” namely, “Who is like God?” There is no one else to whom that name could so fittingly apply as to Jesus, either before he came to earth or since his ascension. He alone is described as “the image of God,” “the reflection of his glory and the exact representation of his very being,” and as “the image of the invisible God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958687/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958687/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Heb. 1:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958687/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Col. 1:15</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Further, note his title “archangel.” This term occurs only twice in the Scriptures (<em>AV</em>), at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958687/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 4:16 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958687/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Jude 9</a>.

This being so makes clear why “Michael the archangel had a difference with the Devil and was disputing about Moses’ body.” The full force of Jude’s condemnation of rebellious ones, incidentally, becomes apparent when we note that not even Jesus Christ, the highest of all God’s creatures, dared render abusive judgment upon the Devil but said: “May Jehovah rebuke you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958687/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jude 9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958687/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Zech. 3:2</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">And finally we have <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958687/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Revelation 12:7, 8</a>, where we read: “And war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels battled with the dragon, and the dragon and its angels battled but it did not prevail.” The context tells of the birth of God’s kingdom, whose king is Jesus Christ, and identifies the dragon as Satan the Devil.

If Christ is at Jehovah’s right hand, would that not mean that Jehovah is at Christ’s left?—R. C., Australia.</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955491/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 110</a> views Jehovah as speaking to Christ, Jehovah being referred to in the third person and Christ in the second person. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955491/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps 110 Verse 1</a> (<em>AS</em>) reads: “Jehovah saith unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand.” <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955491/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps 110 Verse 5</a> states: “The Lord at thy right hand will strike through kings in the day of his wrath.” “Thou” and “thy” refer to Christ, so “Lord” in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955491/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps 110 verse 5</a> refers to the Lord Jehovah. Hence the psalm does first speak of Christ as at Jehovah’s right hand, then later refers to Jehovah as being at Christ’s right hand.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">However, being at the right hand does not necessarily mean literal location, any more than do Jesus’ illustrative words mean the sheep are now literally always located at his right and the goats literally at the left. It is no more literal than is the sitting position mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955491/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 110:1</a>. Jesus did not literally sit from the time of his resurrection and ascension to heaven until 1914, when he stood up as the enthroned King. The sitting position merely meant that he was inactive as far as assuming the kingly duties is concerned. Also, the right-hand position is not necessarily to be viewed as literal, but symbolical. The right side indicates the place of preference, of excellence, of favor and approval. The left-hand position, as in the illustration of the sheep and goats, is the side of disapproval and disfavor. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955491/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 10:2</a> expresses the sense, when it says: “A wise man’s heart is at his right hand; but a fool’s heart at his left.” Or, “The wise man’s mind makes for his success; the fool’s mind makes for his failure.” (<em>AT</em>) Here the right represents success, the left failure. It would be absurd to try to apply this text to the literal heart position, for it is to the left, whether the person is wise or a fool. Following this rule of excellence of the right hand, the aged Jacob laid his right hand upon Joseph’s younger son Ephraim and gave him the superior farewell blessing, while he laid his left hand upon the older boy Manasseh and gave him an inferior blessing. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955491/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Gen. 48:14-20</a>) In harmony with this, Christ Jesus himself is prophetically pictured as saying to his heavenly Father: “In thy presence is fulness of joy; in thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955491/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 16:11</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Therefore, when we do not try to take a literal view of matters there is no difficulty in Jehovah and Christ’s being at each other’s right hand, as shown at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955491/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 110:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955491/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 5</a>.

Since that was centuries before his lifetime, how are Paul’s words to be understood?—D. S., United States.</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Paul’s argument is that the law, by making sin known, made the sinfulness of men manifest. It convicted them as being sinners, and sin merited death. So the law brought sin to life and made those under the law deserving of death. An imperfect man, unable to keep the law perfectly, was convicted as a sinner and worthy of death. It is in this setting that Paul wrote, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955491/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Romans 7:9</a> (<em>NW</em>): “I was once alive apart from law; but when the commandment arrived, sin came to life again, but I died.” Before the law was given he speaks of himself as alive, but when the law came into effect it brought sin to life and it convicted him to death.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">But how could this be true in the case of the apostle Paul? The law covenant went into effect fifteen centuries before he was born. He was not “alive apart from law” or living when the law arrived. However, Paul was a fleshly descendant of Abraham, to whom God said: “In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955491/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Gen. 22:18</a>) Abraham was God’s friend and was justified in God’s sight because of his faith. While yet unborn in the loins of Abraham, Paul had a hope of life through faith. But 330 years after Abraham died, the law covenant was added to the divine promise made to Abraham. This law covenant made it plainly appear that Abraham’s fleshly descendants, the twelve tribes of Israel, were sinners and transgressors. <span id="page415" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="415" data-before-text="415"></span>Paul was born under this law covenant, and he being unable to justify himself to life by the works of the law covenant, his hope of life by it died.</p>

The called ones were justified or relieved from Adamic sin and condemnation and were begotten as sons by means of God’s spirit before they were called to be members of the heavenly kingdom. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953525/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Rom. 5:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953525/33/1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 8:16, 17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953525/33/2" data-bid="34-3" class="b"> 1 John 3:1</a>) Those who were called as spiritual sons of God were chosen, and if they remain faithful to Jehovah to the end of their earthly lives they will be privileged to be with Christ in the Kingdom as joint heirs. Jehovah determined that all who would be associated with Christ in His kingdom must be patterned after the image of the Son. “Moreover, those whom he foreordained are the ones he also called; and those <span id="page438" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="438" data-before-text="438"></span>whom he called are the ones he also declared to be righteous.

Such must be called, chosen and remain faithful to Jehovah even until death. “Prove yourself faithful even with the danger of death, and I will give you the crown of life.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953525/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Rev. 2:10</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="qu">31.

Therefore they in turn, that is, those on earth, can be assured that these sympathize with all who desire to do the will of Jehovah in the new world. Jehovah’s purpose to have Christ’s associates in the Kingdom government taken from among the condemned descendants of Adam shows his wisdom, justice and love. Men can say during the reign of Christ: “We have a priestly company able to understand our weakness, because they were at one time as we are now. They can and will be patient with us.”</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="ss"><strong>KINGDOM GOVERNMENT NOT LAUNCHED AT PENTECOST</strong></p><p id="p86" data-pid="86" class="qu">32.

The avowed purpose of this battle was to determine who was supreme in the affairs of men, Jehovah God or Satan. By teaching this false doctrine the clergymen made themselves seem very important, for they taught that Jehovah looked to them to help him in the struggle to win men away from Satan. This caused much confusion among Christians and brought great reproach and slander upon the name of the Almighty God, Jehovah!</p><p id="p87" data-pid="87" class="qu">33.

David said in the 110th Psalm: “Jehovah saith unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953525/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Ps 110:1</a> <em>AS</em>) Being seated does not indicate action; rather the opposite. However, Jesus did not remain idle while waiting for the time to go into action against the Devil. He was guiding and helping the members of his body still on earth, for he said: “Look! I am with you all the days until the consummation of the system of things.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953525/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Matt. 28:20</a>, <em>NW</em>) God’s purpose was that Jesus should wait at the Father’s right hand until the time came for his enemies to be made the stool for his feet, and THEN he would stand up and go into action, just as Daniel said: “And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953525/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Dan. 12:1</a>) But, more about this trouble later.</p>

In this tense situation Britain continued efforts to stop general war. While Russia and Austria were conferring, Germany sent ultimatum to Russia demanding end of mobilization in twelve hours.

Germans enter Belgium, in violation of treaty, guaranteed by Britain. Britain asked Germany to guarantee neutrality of Belgium by midnight August 4; Germany refused. Britain declared war August 4. Italy bound to Germany and Austria in Triple Alliance, proclaimed neutrality; had secret understanding with France not to join in any war against France.

Christ had to await God’s due time. “From then on awaiting until his enemies should be made a stool for his feet.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951726/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951726/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Heb. 10:13</a>, <em>NW</em>) This waiting time terminates when the lease of power in the hands of the nations of earth runs out, the end of the Gentile times, in 1914. During this long waiting period Jehovah’s purposes have been working out. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951726/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 21:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951726/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Heb. 2:5-13</a>, <em>NW</em>) Then, when the “times of the Gentiles” end, the day of Jehovah commences. Now He acts toward the Kingdom and the greatest of all events takes place. The King, Christ Jesus, the ‘cornerstone of Zion’, is authorized to start operations. “Jehovah will send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion: Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.

First, it is necessary to remove from heaven the iniquitous organization that has been a defiling influence and obnoxious to the extreme. Heaven is to be cleansed, for it is impossible to contemplate the rulership of the Lord Jesus Christ in heaven as the king of the capital of the universe and at the same time and place tolerating filthiness and wickedness. One has to go, and it is Satan and the demons who have to quit. And quit they do, for they are pitched out of heaven, “hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951726/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Rev. 12:7-12</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="qu"> 4.

Just as at the first advent Christ appeared at Jordan and was anointed, and three and a half years later presented himself as king, so in the completion. In 1914 he begins activity as priest and king, and three and a half years later offers himself as king. Again he is the ‘tried’ and ‘tested’ cornerstone. For three and a half years he battles evil, and conquers. Jehovah says: “Yet I have set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951726/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 2:6</a>, <em>AS</em>) The stone of Zion is laid in completion in 1918. The King not only is now present but has proved himself the victorious one of God’s choice by ousting from heaven Satan and all his demon forces.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu"> 5. How do we differentiate between ‘laying the stone in Zion’ and the bringing of it forth?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Zion is God’s capital organization erected in heaven, made up of Christ Jesus and the anointed spiritual children of Jehovah, whereas the new world is organized to embrace that which is for the benefit of man, earth’s new society, those who will be subjects under the supervision of God’s royal house, which is the governing agency in heaven. However, it is important to note that the foundation of the new world was brought forth at the time of the dedication of Jesus at the Jordan river, after which time he began to preach “the kingdom of heaven is at hand”; and three and a half years later the laying of the “stone” in miniature took place. So it is also in the major fulfillment. In 1914 Christ commenced to exercise his power as earth’s rightful ruler by moving against Satan, and three and a half years later (1918) offered himself as king to his professing people. In the three and a half years the King broke the power of the ruler of this present system of things.</p>

<strong>At God’s Right Hand</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">While at God’s right hand, Jesus awaits the command from his Father: “Go subduing in the midst of your enemies.” But in the meantime, until he takes action against his enemies, what does Jesus do? He rules, or reigns, over his anointed disciples, guiding them in their preaching activity and preparing them to become, by resurrection, associate kings with him in his Father’s Kingdom.</p>

In the splendors of holiness, from the womb of the dawn, you have your company of young men just like dewdrops.” True to this prophecy, the dedicated “people” who followed in Jesus’ footsteps and recognized the end of the Gentile Times in 1914 offered themselves willingly to serve as announcers of the newly begun rule of Jehovah God in heavenly Zion by means of the Lord Jesus Christ. But the so-called Christian nations did not submit willingly to Jehovah’s newly enthroned King. Actually, they proved to be his “enemies,” for they engaged in the first world war of human history over the issue of world domination. Worldwide they also interfered with the proclamation of God’s Kingdom.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">18.

On May 8, 1918, the editor of the <em>Watch Tower</em> magazine and a number of his fellow workers were arrested amid war hysteria. Later, on June 21, they were sentenced to many years of imprisonment in the federal penitentiary in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.A. Only after the war had ended and they had spent nine months in prison were these ministers of God’s Kingdom admitted to bail. In due course, they were exonerated of all the false charges lodged against them.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">19.

That religious body declared the League to be “the political expression of the Kingdom of God on earth.” Ignoring that religious recommendation, for political reasons the United States of America refused to join the League, joining only the World Court. Yet the League went into operation at the start of 1920, and the members of the Federal Council of Churches gave it their blessing and support.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">20.

Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985082/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9, 10</a>) They did not offer themselves for the service of that man-made substitute, that fake! Rather, they gave their allegiance to the real Kingdom of God in the hands of Jesus Christ in “heavenly Jerusalem.” With God’s help, they had read aright the “sign” of Jesus’ “presence and of the conclusion of the system of things.” So they set out to advertise the Kingdom worldwide.</p>

Although the end of the Gentile Times had been announced in publications by the Watch Tower Society for decades as due to fall in 1914, those earthly rulers were determined to resist the heavenly Messiah in taking over world domination. They kept making the most advanced preparations for international war. Yet, outwardly, 1914 started off peacefully.

Why so? Because as the newly installed King over the earth it was proper for him to turn his attention to his earthly domain, then occupied by his enemies, aspirants for imperial world domination. ‘The rod of his strength’ was sent out of “the Jerusalem above,” toward our earth. At Jehovah’s command he began to ‘rule in the midst of his enemies’ down at the earth. It was also to the earth that he hurled down the Devil and his demons out of heaven.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983566/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 12:7-17</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 8.

At any rate, his answer corresponds with those prophecies made by King David, far more impressively so since 1914 than during the 37 years from when the apostles asked the question and the destruction of Jerusalem by the Roman legions in 70 C.E. Certainly that appalling Jewish calamity did not remain without equal. It was not worse, for example, than the massacre of the reported 6,000,000 Jews under the Nazi Hitler regime before and during World War II. Jerusalem’s destruction was not a “great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning until now, no, nor will occur again.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983566/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 24:21</a>) What the inquiring apostles witnessed down to the end of the first century C.E. was a miniature fulfillment of Jesus’ prophecy, in the way of famines, earthquakes, pestilences, wars and persecutions, as well as the wiping out of “the Jerusalem today.” They did not need to howl over this, because the celestial Jerusalem kept standing.</p>

It counted for something, and was in line with Jehovah’s own promise that Abraham should be a blessing to all the families of the ground—all families should procure a blessing by means of him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974037/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Genesis 12:3</a>) This mysterious King-Priest Melchizedek, although given such scant mention in history, was not lost to sight. Nine hundred years later the Most High God inspired another king of Salem, King David of Jerusalem, to prophesy and show just how significant Melchizedek had been within the purpose of the Most High God. According to this, Melchizedek was the prefiguring of a still greater king, one even greater than David, one whom even David would be obliged to call “my Lord.” This prefigured king could be no one else but the Messiah, the “seed” of God’s “woman.” So, under the power of God’s holy spirit, David wrote, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974037/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Psalm 110:1-4</a>:</p>

It is by far the most worthy cause of all, and will bring about the vindication and sanctification of his name, Jehovah. Christ Jesus, by God’s appointment, is the king of that kingdom. His enthronement took place in heaven in 1914 C.E. The foretold waiting period had expired, and then was fulfilled the prophecy at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972204/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 110:2</a>: “The rod of your strength Jehovah will send out of Zion, saying: ‘Go subduing in the midst of your enemies.”’ What a delightful moment that must have been to the king and all the holy angels with him! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972204/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 25:31</a>) Similar to the <span id="page181" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="181" data-before-text="181"></span>expression at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972204/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 2:6</a>, Zion is where the king is enthroned, and is the center of operations.

In the major fulfillment, however, the Greater David is Christ Jesus, David’s permanent heir. He reigns in the heavenly “Mount Zion,” and standing there with him are the 144,000 who make up the Christian congregation. As already mentioned, there is a remnant of this congregation still on earth, forming the Zion class, and in whom we can see the modern fulfillment of the many grand promises and prophecies featuring Zion. We have considered a few of these, and now wish to pay attention to others that throw much light on the immediate outworking of Jehovah’s purpose, and show how we can identify ourselves with it.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972204/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rev. 14:1</a>.</p>

It has been revived in our time, not over there in earthly Jerusalem, but in the heavens, where the royal Descendant of King David sits, namely, Jesus Christ.

King Ahaz died, and this marked the end of an era. Likewise, the year 1914 C.E. marked the end of the “appointed times of the nations,” during which God had permitted nationalism and its gods to hold uninterrupted sway over the earth. Now, with World War I, the present-day “pangs of distress” began.

The clergy urged on Catholic to kill Catholic, and Protestant to kill Protestant, and the apostate sects of so-called “Christianity” showed themselves to be as dead spiritually as King Ahaz is physically. They proved that they had lost their real identity as Christians in the same way that Israel lost any remaining identity as God’s nation when it was overthrown by the Assyrian and its people were transplanted within his empire. And why? “Over the fact that they had not listened to the voice of Jehovah their God . . .

His name means “Jehovah Has Strengthened.” It appears that, even before Jehovah established Hezekiah as king in Judah, he may have served for a time as coregent with Ahaz. No doubt he then began to show strength in behalf of true worship. Today, also, Christ began to do a preparatory work among sincere Christians on earth prior to receiving his kingdom. It was in this connection that the <em>Watchtower</em> magazine began to be published in 1879, in strong support of the Christian doctrine of the ransom and other Bible truths.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">20.

The kingdom of Jehovah God by means of his anointed one of the royal line of David was no longer to be trampled on in contempt by the Gentile nations. The beginning of those Gentile Times was in 607 B.C.E. and was marked by the ruining of the kingdom of God. In opposite fashion, the end of the Gentile Times in 1914 C.E. was to be marked by the revival, the rebirth, of God’s kingdom in the hands of his anointed one or Messiah, Christ. It was the time marked for the coming of the Anointed One with the “legal right” to the crown and the time for Jehovah God to give it to him. This Messianic kingdom of God would then be a divine government for the Gentile nations to reckon with henceforth. Never would they be able to trample on it <span id="page618" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="618" data-before-text="618"></span>victoriously, even though they kept up their selfish endeavors to hold on to the sovereignty of all parts of the earth. Why so?</p><p id="p73" data-pid="73" class="qu">17, 18. (a) Why could the Gentile nations not tread upon such a government after 1914?

It is beyond the reach of the Gentile governments and their spaceships and rockets. The earthly Jerusalem has nothing to do with it. Since Jesus Christ was put to death on Calvary outside the walls of Jerusalem in the year 33 C.E., that city has no connection with God’s Messianic kingdom.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[73]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Five days before his death Jesus rode into Jerusalem accompanied by a great crowd of joyful people.

No earthly kingdom was given him. However, he had not preached an earthly kingdom. He preached the good news of God’s Messianic kingdom, and he and his disciples cried out: “The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966761/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 4:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966761/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 10:1-7</a>) The long-foretold Messianic kingdom was to be a heavenly kingdom, a government whose seat was to be in what the Holy Bible symbolically calls “a city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966761/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Heb. 12:22</a>) With a view to the setting up of the heavenly Messianic kingdom in 1914, Jehovah God raised his Son Jesus Christ from death on the third day and had him ascend back to heaven forty days later.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966761/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Acts 1:1-12</a>.</p><p id="p74" data-pid="74" class="qu">19.

<strong>What Has God’s Kingdom Been Doing Since 1914?</strong><br/><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[78]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> Decades in advance searching Bible students had pointed forward to 1914 as the Biblically marked date. But when the accuracy of the time was confirmed by world events fulfilling Bible prophecy, our conviction too of what had taken place in the invisible heavens became overwhelming, and we were impelled to join with God’s faithful worshipers up in heaven in saying: “We thank you, Jehovah God, the <span id="page620" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="620" data-before-text="620"></span>Almighty, the one who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and begun ruling as king. But the nations became wrathful, and your own wrath came, and the appointed time for the dead to be judged, and to give their reward to your slaves the prophets and to the holy ones and to those fearing your name, the small and the great, and to bring to ruin those ruining the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966761/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Rev. 11:16-18</a>.</p><p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="qu">25.

Having patiently permitted the Gentile domination of mankind for 2,520 years since 607 B.C.E., Jehovah God enthroned his Son, the Messianic Heir of King David, and turned over to this One with the “legal right” the domination of all the earth. This Messianic King, ruling in the “heavenly Jerusalem,” will bring to ruin all the Gentiles who are ruining the earth, but his own God-given kingdom will never be brought to ruin.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="ss"><strong>ACTION AGAINST ENEMIES</strong></p><p id="p80" data-pid="80" class="qu">26. Why do we ask whether God’s Messianic kingdom has stood still since 1914, and, therefore, what blunt question are we obliged to ask?</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[80]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"><sup>26</sup></span> Let it stand now as a settled fact that the Messianic kingdom of God was established, unseen to us, in the heavens in 1914. Well, then, since that date has it stood still? Certainly the world of mankind has not stood still since 1914. The Gentile nations have not stood still, and many new nations have since come into existence. In the half century since that critical year of 1914 astounding history has been made. If human creation has been on the move since then, what shall we say about the Creator God Almighty? He is not static either! His kingdom, which is the most powerful government in existence, could never be static. It has too great a role to fulfill since its birth. So, what history has it been making to prove that it exists and is functioning? To be blunt, what has God’s kingdom been doing since 1914?</p><p id="p81" data-pid="81" class="qu">27, 28. (a) Against whom has the Kingdom gone into action, as was to be expected according to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966761/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Psalm 110:1, 2</a>? (b) Was it against someone on earth or someone in heaven that the Kingdom acted first?</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[81]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"><sup>27</sup></span> It has gone into action against its enemies, who are God’s enemies, Christ’s enemies, man’s enemies. We should have expected that, for, according to the prophecy addressed to the Messiah by King David, he was to sit at God’s right hand until the time for God to make his enemies his footstool to be trampled on. After that time, what? Then, according to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966761/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Psalm 110:1, 2</a>, “the rod of your strength Jehovah will send out of Zion, saying: ‘Go subduing in the midst of your enemies.’”</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[81]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="28"><sup>28</sup></span> So, against which enemy of God’s Messianic kingdom was the Messiah’s ‘rod of strength’ stretched out first? Against the Gentile nations on earth? No; for Messiah the King did not start World War I on earth, to weaken them so as to be more easily subdued because of destroying one another. No; but his ‘rod of strength’ was stretched out first against the god of those Gentile nations, that is to say, Satan the Devil. The Gentile nations are merely human; their god, Satan the Devil, is superhuman, supernatural, spiritual. He is the most powerful enemy of all. Being spiritual, this chief enemy has had access to the holy heavens far beyond the neighborhood of our earth for millenniums of time prior to 1914. The Bible shows that.</p><p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="qu">29. (a) What kind of time was it when Jesus was born nineteen centuries ago? (b) According to the prophecies of Revelation, what was the birth of God’s kingdom to usher in?</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[82]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="29"><sup>29</sup></span> Nineteen centuries ago Satan the Devil tried to have the baby Jesus destroyed <span id="page621" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="621" data-before-text="621"></span>at Bethlehem by inciting the fearful King Herod the Great to send soldiers there to kill all the little boys two years old and younger. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966761/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matt. 2:1-18</a>) Jesus’ birth had taken place in Bethlehem as foretold (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966761/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Mic. 5:2</a>), and during a time of peace called the <em>Pax Romana.</em> But the birth of God’s Messianic kingdom in 1914 was not meant to usher in a time of peace for either heaven or earth! <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966761/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Chapter eleven of the book of Revelation</a> foretold that, when God took to himself his great power to reign universally and “the kingdom of the world” became the kingdom of our Lord God and of his Christ, the Gentile nations would be wrathful. Those nations did become wrathful, both inside and outside of Christendom. Prophesying still further of hostility, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966761/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">chapter twelve of Revelation</a> gave a symbolical picture of the birth of God’s Messianic kingdom in the heavens and described the attempt of Satan the Devil to devour the kingdom at its birth, when it would seemingly be weakest, like a newborn babe. So this enemy in heaven needed to be ousted! That called for war!</p>

On the earthly Mount Zion of three thousand years ago, and in the city of Jerusalem of that time, King David ruled in the name of Jehovah. He represented Jehovah of armies as the real King over the nation and hence King David on Mount Zion was said to sit on “Jehovah’s throne.” David’s wise son Solomon succeeded to that throne.

How so? In this way: For almost six thousand years now all mankind have been dying, and at death they have quit eating and drinking. To eat and drink we have to live and stay in good health. In turn, to keep on living we have to eat and drink. All mankind have inherited sinfulness and death from the first man on earth, who sinned against God the Creator and brought God’s sentence of death upon himself before ever he became a father of children. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965283/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12-14</a>) Because of his rebellious sin against his Creator, the first man and his wife were driven from their perfect Paradise home in the garden of Eden, to die outside. Thus the ruining of the earth, and the famine, drought, hunger and starvation have come about as an outgrowth of man’s sinfulness. Says the Christian apostle Paul: “The wages sin pays is death, but the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965283/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rom. 6:23</a>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 4.

He died childless, thus sacrificing even his right to become father to a perfect human race on earth. Long ago miraculous food sustained the life of his earthly nation for forty years when they traveled through a wilderness. Hence Jesus compared his <span id="page244" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="244" data-before-text="244"></span>perfect sacrifice to such food. He said: “I am the bread of life. . . .

<strong>Why Two Covenants for Kingdom Power?</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">David himself under inspiration showed that the position to be held at a later date by God’s Son would embrace more than anything he could pass on to him, and that is why he spoke of him prophetically as “my Lord.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964566/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1</a>) Concerning the kingdom that this one would inherit it was foretold in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964566/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Daniel 7:13, 14</a>: “I kept on beholding in the visions of the night, and, see there! with the clouds of the heavens someone like a son of man happened to be coming; and to the Ancient of Days he gained access, and they brought him up close even before that One. And to him there were given rulership and dignity and kingdom, that the peoples, national groups and languages should all serve even him. His rulership is an indefinitely lasting rulership that will not pass away, and his <span id="page478" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="478" data-before-text="478"></span>kingdom one that will not be brought to ruin.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">So after Jesus had faithfully finished his earthly ministry, God “raised him up from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above every government and authority and power and lordship and every name named, not only in this system of things, but also in that to come.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964566/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Eph. 1:20, 21</a>) At that time, in the year 33 C.E., <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964566/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 110:1</a> applied, which says: “The utterance of Jehovah to my Lord is: ‘Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.’” After nearly nineteen centuries, at the end of the “appointed times of the nations,” or in 1914 C.E., Jehovah issued the further command recorded in the following verse, saying to his King-Son: “Go subduing in the midst of your enemies.” So Jesus’ position as king is something far more than anything that David ever had.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>COVENANT FOR HEAVENLY KINGDOM</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Does that ruling position of Jesus include anything else? Yes, it does. Just two verses later in the same psalm, David was inspired to say: “Jehovah has sworn (and he will feel no regret): ‘You are a priest to time indefinite according to the manner of Melchizedek!’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964566/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 110:4</a>) Here, then, was another legal promise concerning the coming Messiah that God had made under oath, first recorded in David’s time. Not only would Jesus’ kingdom be superior to that of David, but he would be a priest as well as a king, something that could never be under the Davidic covenant because God’s law to Israel maintained a strict separation between kingship and priesthood. The very nature of this special office held by Melchizedek made it something that could not be passed on to anyone as a human successor of his. It did not come into existence again in God’s arrangement until God’s due time to make Jesus a spiritual king and priest. For this reason, it is not even mentioned again in the Scriptures until Paul discussed the subject in his letter to the Hebrew Christians, written about 61 C.E.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">‘But,’ someone may object, ‘how can it be said that the covenant for a kingly priesthood gives Jesus the right to a heavenly kingdom and priesthood when Melchizedek was also a man, just like David?’ Well, Jesus was not and is not the heir of Melchizedek. However, there were certain circumstances surrounding Melchizedek that appear to have been ordered by God precisely for a prophetic purpose. They showed that Melchizedek’s office was not dependent on human relationships. Paul alludes to these circumstances in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964566/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Hebrews 7:3</a>: “In being fatherless, motherless, without genealogy, having neither a beginning of days nor an end of life [in that none of these things were recorded], but having been made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.” So, too, Jesus’ being God’s High Priest does not result from any human connections; it is not because of his genealogy. While Jesus remained on earth as a man he could not become a Jewish priest at all, because the law covenant was still in effect until after his death and this limited the Jewish priesthood strictly to the members of Aaron’s house in the tribe of Levi.

To this very end they were also appointed. But you are ‘a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for special possession, that you should declare abroad the excellencies’ of the one that called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.

All the earthly nations who oppose God’s heavenly kingdom as exercised through his enthroned Son Jesus Christ. As they are the enemies of the royal Stone laid in the heavenly Zion or Jerusalem, they are also the enemies of that heavenly city. The royal Stone Jesus Christ and the heavenly Jerusalem are inseparably linked with each other.

Who is he? Jesus Christ. He is the one that has been given a crown by his Father and is commanded to go forth in a righteous war, pictured by the white horse. This picture calls to mind the words of the psalmist: “Gird your sword upon your thigh, O mighty one, with your dignity and your splendor. And in your splendor go on to success; ride in the cause of truth and humility and righteousness, and your right hand will instruct you in fear-inspiring things. Your arrows are sharp—under you peoples keep falling.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 45:3-5</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Even more explicitly identifying the first horseman are John’s own words recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Revelation 19:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 13, 14</a>: “Look! a white horse.

Also, the armies that were in heaven were following him on white horses, and they were clothed in white, clean, fine linen.”</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">When did this rider go forth to conquer? According to fulfilled Bible prophecy, in the year 1914. Then it was that Jehovah said to his Son, “Go subduing in the midst of your enemies.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 110:2</a>) That marked the time when the dragon and his demons warred against Michael and his angels, right after the birth of God’s kingdom, pictured by the birth of a male child; all of which began to take place in heaven when “the nations became wrathful” on earth in 1914.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Rev. 11:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 12:1-9</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>THE OTHER HORSEMEN</strong></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The second horseman rode a fiery-colored or red mount. The horseman had a large sword and it was granted to him to take peace from the earth, resulting in a large slaughter among men. Red is associated with war because war means bloodshed and blood is red. Thus the ancients made the planet Mars a symbol of war because of its reddish hue. This horseman’s work finds mention in Jesus’ great prophecy: “Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.” Certainly World War I, beginning in 1914, took peace from the earth and resulted in much slaughter.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Mark 13:8</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The third horse was black and its rider carried a pair of scales. He was accompanied by an announcement of high prices: a quart of wheat and three quarts of barley, each for a denarius, a day’s wages. (Barley was held to be so far inferior to wheat that Roman soldiers at times were punished by being given barley instead of wheat rations.) This horseman pictures famine due to war. Fittingly the horse itself was black, for blackness is a symbol of famine: “Their aspect has become darker than blackness itself. They have not been recognized in the streets. Their skin has shriveled upon their bones.” Jesus, in his great prophecy, likewise associated world war with famine: “Nation will rise against nation and . . . there will be food shortages.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Lam. 4:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Mark 13:8</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">The rider’s having a pair of scales in his hand is also indicative of famine conditions. Thus Ezekiel was told: “Son of man, . . . they will have to eat bread by weight and in anxious care, and it will be by measure and in horror that they will drink water itself, to the intent that they may be lacking bread and water.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ezek. 4:16, 17</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">As to the meaning of the peculiar instruction given to this third horseman, <span id="page152" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="152" data-before-text="152"></span>“Do not harm the olive oil and the wine,” God’s Word itself gives a clue, for at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962166/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Proverbs 21:17</a> we are told that “he that is loving wine and oil will not gain riches.” Wine and oil are symbols of luxuries and their not being harmed would indicate that, in spite of famine conditions that affected the common people, the rich still had their luxuries, and so it proved to be.</p>

The physical facts of today placed alongside the fulfilled prophecies prove beyond any doubt that this kingdom has been established in the heavens and that the Master Builder has come.

How is this separating done? Jesus showed that classification as a “sheep” or a “goat” was based on the way an individual treated his followers on earth and the Kingdom message they carried. This separating work is nearing completion as all peoples are identifying themselves either in support of God’s kingdom, or in opposition to it.</p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="ss"><strong>OTHER PROPHECIES</strong></p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="sb">In addition to the extensive sign of the last days given by Jesus, features of which we have just considered, another inspired prophecy was recorded by the apostle Paul. It says: “But know this, that <em>in the last days</em> critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, self-assuming, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, disloyal, having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, without love of goodness, betrayers, headstrong, puffed up with pride, lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God, having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power; and from these turn away.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961762/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1-5</a>.</p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="sb">Do you not see on every hand these very conditions? Look at the millions of money lovers that make material things their chief aim in life! See the unprecedented increase of disobedience and delinquency among youth. Observe how the nations talk, talk, talk, but are not open to any agreement. Note the fierceness and lack of self-control of people who, in their drive to get ahead, have lost all love of goodness. See the millions of pleasure lovers whose love of God has grown cold. Note how they pretend to be Christian, “having a form of godly devotion,” but that it exercises no power in their lives to motivate them to love and right works as followers of Christ.</p><p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="sb">In spite of the overwhelming evidence some will scoff: “Conditions are the same as they have been for generations.” But even such ridicule of the scoffers is in fulfillment of Bible prophecy concerning the last days, for the apostle Peter wrote: “For you know this first, that <em>in the last days</em> there will come ridiculers with their ridicule, proceeding according to their own desires and saying: ‘Where is this promised presence of his? Why, from the day our forefathers fell asleep in death, all things are continuing exactly as from creation’s beginning.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961762/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="sb">Do not hastily dismiss the evidence that this is the time for God’s kingdom. Bible chronology pinpoints the year 1914 as the time that Christ arrived and began ruling in the midst of his enemies. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961762/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1, 2</a>) The events of the past forty-seven years support the chronological evidence as correct. The kingdom of the heavens is here! And soon, within this generation, it will come in all its destructive force against Satan and his wicked system of things. Under its rule this earth will become the everlasting paradise home of obedient mankind. So act in harmony with your prayers for God’s kingdom to come by joining the hundreds of thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses in preaching ‘this good news of the Kingdom in all the inhabited earth.’</p><p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="sb"></p>

<strong>This Is a Time of Judgment</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Because the great Judge, Jehovah God, selected Christ to represent him in this judicial work, Jesus speaks of himself as the <span id="page54" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="54" data-before-text="54"></span>one doing the actual judging. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">the fifth chapter of John</a> he points out that he had received this authority from the great Judge, saying: “For the Father judges no one at all, but he has committed all the judging to the Son. And he has given him authority to do judging, because Son of man he is.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 5:22,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 27</a>) This was foretold by the prophet Isaiah: “And there must go forth a twig out of the stump of Jesse, and out of his roots a sprout will be fruitful. . . . And he will not judge by any mere appearance to his eyes, nor reprove simply according to the thing heard by his ears. And with righteousness he must judge the lowly ones.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa. 11:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">It is the divinely commissioned Judge, Jesus Christ, therefore, who does the actual judging of mankind during this final judgment period for the old world. In his prophecy in which he likens himself to a shepherd, he says: “When the Son of man arrives in his glory and all the angels with him, then he will sit down on his glorious throne. And all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. And he will put the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 25:31-33</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>BEGINNING OF LAST DAYS</strong></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The time for this judging of the nations, as you will note, was set for the last days when Christ would be enthroned in Kingdom glory. It could not take place after the worldly system of things has been destroyed by heavenly forces, as Christ could not then separate the people as sheep are separated from goats. His enthronement in Kingdom power at his second presence would have to be at a time when the wicked still exist, a time before their destruction. This was foretold at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 110, verses one and two</a>, where Christ, David’s Lord, is commanded: “Go subduing in the midst of your enemies.”</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">World events since A.D. 1914 form the great sign of Christ’s second presence that he gave in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">the twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew</a>. This date is also confirmed by the fact that the Gentile times, or times of the nations, that began in 607 B.C. ended then. It was three and a half years later that he began the work of judgment, first of the “house of God” and then of the nations of this world. This corresponds with the three and a half years that passed from the time Jesus was anointed as King until he entered the temple in Jerusalem and cleansed it. When the evidence is carefully examined it proves conclusively that we are in the last days of this world—the long-foretold judgment period.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">How people respond to the earth-wide preaching of the good news of God’s kingdom and how they treat Jehovah’s servants who do this preaching determines whether they are classed as sheep or goats. To the sheep class Jesus says: “Truly I say to you, To the extent that you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.” And to the goat class he says: “‘Truly I say to you, To the extent that you did not do it to one of these least ones, you did not do it to me.’ And these will depart into everlasting cutting-off, but the righteous ones into everlasting life.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 25:40,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960044/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 45, 46</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">If you are one who follows the policy of doing what you think is right and never harming other people but yet you ignore the good news of God’s kingdom and the things he requires, you cannot expect a favorable judgment. It is not what you think is right that counts, but what God thinks is right.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">The establishment of God’s kingdom under Christ is the best news that has ever been proclaimed, because it means Jehovah God’s name will soon be vindicated of the <span id="page55" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="55" data-before-text="55"></span>reproach this world has heaped upon it. It means the approaching end of a world that has exceeded in wickedness the world that was destroyed in the Flood. It means the meek of the earth, the persons of godly devotion who rejoice in the good news of the Kingdom, will inherit the earth and enjoy peace and eternal life under the righteous rule of that heavenly government. No person with any love for righteousness, any love for God and any love for Christ will ignore that good news. They will, instead, gladly receive it and join in the proclaiming of it.</p>

The march began in 607 B.C., when the 2,520 years began to count. But long before then the all-wise King of heaven, Jehovah God, foresaw the march and the successive world powers in the line of procession. In impressive proof of his unerring foresight he foretold the march and marchers, even names and characteristics of the marchers, that we might identify them. Marvelously he has had their history written down long ahead of time. Hence his sacred Word, the Holy Bible, contains much history written in advance, history which the later histories written by men concerning past events now astoundingly confirm.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 2.

Long before this, Babylon had been established in the valley of Mesopotamia by Nimrod, the great-grandson of Noah, about 2,239 years before the Christian era. But before becoming a world power that had to do with the witnesses of Jehovah God it was preceded by two other world powers; first, Egypt, and second, Assyria. Only by subduing these rivals to world domination, and then by desolating the kingdom of Jehovah’s people with capital at ancient Jerusalem, did Babylon become a world power, the third world power listed in Biblical history. Assyria conquered Egypt and even tried to prevent the rise of Babylon to dominance by destroying the city. But Babylon was rebuilt and strove for the ascendancy. It destroyed the Assyrian capital, Nineveh, about 633 B.C. It reached the zenith of its power in the days of King Nebuchadnezzar, who destroyed Jerusalem and its sanctuary to Jehovah God.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 4, 5.

Hengstenberg, one of the foremost German Bible scholars of the nineteenth century, argues at great length to that effect in his <em>Christology and Commentary on the Apocalypse.</em> A strong case for this position is also made in the <em>Imperial Bible Dictionary,</em> edited by the British Bible scholar Fairbairn. And Clarke, in his <em>Commentary,</em> holds that, at least at times, Michael refers to Jesus Christ.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">As for the Scriptural testimony, in the first place note the very meaning of the name “Michael,” namely, “Who is like God?” There is no one else to whom that name could so fittingly apply as to Jesus, either before he came to earth or since his ascension. He alone is described as “the image of God,” “the reflection of his glory and the exact representation of his very being,” and as “the image of the invisible God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958687/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958687/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Heb. 1:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958687/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Col. 1:15</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Further, note his title “archangel.” This term occurs only twice in the Scriptures (<em>AV</em>), at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958687/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 4:16 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958687/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Jude 9</a>. The prefix “arch” means “chief, principal, great.” Certainly both before his coming to earth as a man and since his return to heaven he is the chief or principal one of all God’s spirit creatures or angels. Trinitarians may consider this a downgrading of the “Second Person of the Trinity,” but if we accept the Scriptural testimony that Jesus was “the beginning of the creation by God,” and “the firstborn of all creation,” we will have no diffidence about applying to him the term archangel.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958687/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rev. 3:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958687/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Col. 1:15</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Of the five references to the spirit prince or archangel Michael—there are also ten references to as many different humans by that name—the first two are found at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958687/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Daniel 10:13,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958687/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 21</a> (<em>RS</em>).</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">There he is shown to be a mighty angel rescuing from the clutches of one of Satan’s demon princes an angel of Jehovah God who had been sent to Daniel with a message of comfort. There Michael is also referred to as Daniel’s prince, even as at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958687/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Daniel 12:1</a> (<em>RS</em>) he is spoken of as “the great prince who has charge of your people.” This is in keeping with <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958687/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Exodus 32:34</a> and similar scriptures that tell of God as appointing his angel to lead Israel. This being so makes clear why “Michael the archangel had a difference with the Devil and was disputing about Moses’ body.” The full force of Jude’s condemnation of rebellious ones, incidentally, becomes apparent when we note that not even Jesus Christ, the highest of all God’s creatures, dared render abusive judgment upon the Devil but said: “May Jehovah rebuke you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958687/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jude 9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958687/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Zech. 3:2</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">And finally we have <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958687/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Revelation 12:7, 8</a>, where we read: “And war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels battled with the dragon, and the dragon and its angels battled but it did not prevail.” The context tells of the birth of God’s kingdom, whose king is Jesus Christ, and identifies the dragon as Satan the Devil. Surely Jesus as King would be the one to take action upon the birth of God’s kingdom even as David took action against his enemies upon his becoming king. Did not Jesus state, upon his resurrection, that all power had been given him in heaven and on earth? Does not <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958687/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 110:1, 2</a> command him to rule in the midst of his enemies?

How could that affect us today in this age of hydrogen bombs and nuclear warfare? We humans should not think that all that is too far in the past to be of any concern or value to us today. Nineteen centuries ago seems like long, long ago to us, but to the beginningless, endless Jehovah God, to whom a thousand of our years are as but one day, nineteen hundred years ago is as less than two days ago. More than ever the actions of all the nations since the year 1914 call for the settling of the supreme issue, the vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty over earth as well as heaven. To that end there is the present need of the royal government of his King like Melchizedek.</p>

<strong>Early Help for Surviving the World’s End</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> One city, though, is enjoying a refreshment and a gladness that the world does not know and cannot understand. It is the new world city toward which the true Christians have been traveling for the past nineteen centuries, God’s capital of the universe. Now it has established its power over our earth. This is the city which the apostle means when he writes: “But you have approached a mount Zion and a city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem, and myriads of angels, in general assembly, and the congregation of the firstborn who have been enrolled in the heavens, and <span id="page182" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="182" data-before-text="182"></span>God the Judge of all, and the spiritual lives of righteous ones who have been made perfect, and Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and the blood of sprinkling which speaks in a better way than Abel’s blood.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 12:22-24</a>, <em>NW</em>) Jerusalem on earth was once the symbol of the heavenly Jerusalem, in the days when faithful kings of the lineage of David sat on the “throne of Jehovah” on one of its mountains called “Mount Zion”. By establishing his temple there God placed his name Jehovah at that city, and so the city foreshadowed God’s capital organization of the universe. Christ Jesus and his faithful congregation of joint heirs glorified make up that capital organization.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 3. Why, then, is there unity among the widespread witnesses of Jehovah, and also unusual gladness?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> In 1914 Christ Jesus, the Chief Son in God’s organization, was enthroned and thus brought forth to active Kingdom authority. He reigns at his heavenly Father’s right hand, and the ancient prophecy addressed to him now applies: “Jehovah will send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion: Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1, 2</a>, <em>AS</em>) So now there is unusual gladness in the heavenly Zion. It is no wonder, then, that Jehovah’s witnesses on earth who represent his kingdom are also glad. They may be spread all over the earth for the purpose of giving a pre-Armageddon witness before the world ends, but they are bound together in unbreakable unity by a theocratic organization under the King Christ Jesus. It matters not that they are in the midst of their enemies. They know their King is now ruling in the midst of these enemies and will shortly dash them to pieces like striking a potter’s vessels with an iron rod. They do not mourn over the end of this world which the handwriting on the wall announces to the nations. They rejoice with the holy hosts of heaven over the bringing of God’s kingdom to birth to rule the righteous new world. So the source of their joy and gladness is a secret to this world, and it makes all the nations marvel that no world woe dries it up.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 4. What does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Psalm 46:4</a> disclose to be the source of their irrepressible gladness?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> The psalmist discloses the source of the irrepressible gladness of Jehovah’s witnesses: “There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 46:4</a>, <em>AS</em>) This river is vital to the life of the visible organization of God’s people, for it means life-giving refreshment to them. It is a river of divine blessings to them, a river of truths about his kingdom long ago promised and now set up. Along with this river goes the joyful privilege of spreading its Kingdom truths to all who seek good government, security and lasting peace. Today the American nation is facing a serious shortage in its water resources. The latest Water Resources Report reveals there are serious wastes in the nation’s precious water supply. In the face of increasing water needs it constitutes a national peril. However, Jehovah’s witnesses are not wasting the precious waters of Kingdom truth and are not wasting the precious opportunities of reviving the spiritually parched people of good will. Forth from the throne of God and of his reigning King at his right hand the life-giving river of truth flows, in fulfillment of the vision given to the apostle John, who described it in these words: “And he showed me a river of water of life, clear as crystal, flowing out from the throne of God and of the Lamb down the middle of its broad way. And on this side of the river and on that side there were trees of life producing twelve crops of fruits, yielding their fruits each month. And the leaves of the trees were for the curing of the nations.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951205/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rev. 22:1, 2</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p>

Christ had to await God’s due time. “From then on awaiting until his enemies should be made a stool for his feet.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951726/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951726/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Heb. 10:13</a>, <em>NW</em>) This waiting time terminates when the lease of power in the hands of the nations of earth runs out, the end of the Gentile times, in 1914. During this long waiting period Jehovah’s purposes have been working out. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951726/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 21:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951726/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Heb. 2:5-13</a>, <em>NW</em>) Then, when the “times of the Gentiles” end, the day of Jehovah commences. Now He acts toward the Kingdom and the greatest of all events takes place. The King, Christ Jesus, the ‘cornerstone of Zion’, is authorized to start operations. “Jehovah will send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion: Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. Jehovah hath sworn, and will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951726/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 110:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951726/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 4</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="qu"> 3.

First, it is necessary to remove from heaven the iniquitous organization that has been a defiling influence and obnoxious to the extreme. Heaven is to be cleansed, for it is impossible to contemplate the rulership of the Lord Jesus Christ in heaven as the king of the capital of the universe and at the same time and place tolerating filthiness and wickedness. One has to go, and it is Satan and the demons who have to quit. And quit they do, for they are pitched out of heaven, “hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951726/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Rev. 12:7-12</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="qu"> 4. How is Christ Jesus a ‘tried’ and ‘tested’ cornerstone at the time of Kingdom power rule?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Jehovah’s anointed King wins the battle after approximately three and a half years. Just as at the first advent Christ appeared at Jordan and was anointed, and three and a half years later presented himself as king, so in the completion. In 1914 he begins activity as priest and king, and three and a half years later offers himself as king. Again he is the ‘tried’ and ‘tested’ cornerstone. For three and a half years he battles evil, and conquers. Jehovah says: “Yet I have set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951726/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 2:6</a>, <em>AS</em>) The stone of Zion is laid in completion in 1918. The King not only is now present but has proved himself the victorious one of God’s choice by ousting from heaven Satan and all his demon forces.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu"> 5. How do we differentiate between ‘laying the stone in Zion’ and the bringing of it forth?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Zion is God’s capital organization erected in heaven, made up of Christ Jesus and the anointed spiritual children of Jehovah, whereas the new world is organized to embrace that which is for the benefit of man, earth’s new society, those who will be subjects under the supervision of God’s royal house, which is the governing agency in heaven. However, it is important to note that the foundation of the new world was brought forth at the time of the dedication of Jesus at the Jordan river, after which time he began to preach “the kingdom of heaven is at hand”; and three and a half years later the laying of the “stone” in miniature took place. So it is also in the major fulfillment. In 1914 Christ commenced to exercise his power as earth’s rightful ruler by moving against Satan, and three and a half years later (1918) offered himself as king to his professing people. In the three and a half years the King broke the power of the ruler of this present system of things.</p>

Earth’s greatest event then took place, for that is when the Most High God instructed his Son to ‘rule in the midst of his enemies’. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950561/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1, 2</a>) Then it was that action commenced in heaven to bring forward the Kingdom rule, this new power which will rule all nations.

The 40-year period of time (from 1878 to 1918) was foretold in Scripture prophecy, and generally has been referred to as the “Elijah” or “John the Baptist” work, and so named because it constitutes a large-scale, modern-day fulfillment of their prophetic works. “The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Even as it it written in Isaiah the prophet, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way; the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ye ready the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950561/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Mark 1:1-3</a>, <em>Am.

Stan. Ver.</em>) The way must be ‘prepared’ before the King appears. During the 40 years before 1918, as in the days of John the Baptist, the message delivered was strong, clear, comforting to the poor in spirit, denunciatory of proud doers and testifying to the Christ of God. The anointed people of God for more than 30 years before 1914 were announcing the nearness of the end of the “Gentile times”, and called upon the professed people of God to be ready for Jehovah’s service. Message after message was publicly announced, several millions of textbooks were published, many more millions of tracts were circulated—all to call the people’s attention to the fulfillment of prophecy and the urgency of being awake and watchful. The untiring, unselfish, wholehearted ministry of these faithful Christians was known to the “master” of the household, and he recognized them.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu">10.

When the first president of this Society ended his earthly course in 1916, some who had been associated with the Lord’s anointed rebelled against the servants of God. Their covetous hearts found expression in evilspeaking against God’s loyal children, saying that the Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society was no longer being used by the Lord, that they had the light and the servants of God should follow them. Amidst all this contention, evilspeaking, hard sayings, treacherous actions, betrayals and the persecutions and trials of World War I the faithful anointed continued to feed the household with proper spiritual food; and not once did they fail to publish the <em>Watch Tower</em> magazine.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu">11. What other great event happened in the year 1918, and with what results to the servants of God?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> The church was certainly being tried, from without and from within. Then in 1918 the Lord Jesus Christ appeared at the temple for judgment. His angels gathered out of his Kingdom class those who were offending and working iniquity. “The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and them that do iniquity, and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.

He approved these loyal servants, for regardless of all the problems, hindrances, trials and persecutions the anointed had gone right on with the work of feeding the sheep—and this always through the Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>THE “FAITHFUL AND WISE SERVANT”</strong></p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu">12.

He shall make him ruler over all his goods.’ This servant’s privileges and responsibilities are now greatly enlarged, for, whereas he had been caring for the household in general, now added duties were laid upon him. He was appointed to have the complete management of all the master’s goods, the administration of all the property, possessions, lands and wealth. What could this now mean? What were the “goods”, “possessions,” “property” entrusted to this “faithful and wise servant”? Surely we immediately think of the greatest and <span id="page230" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="230" data-before-text="230"></span>most precious possession of the new world’s King, and that is, the Kingdom. But how could the Kingdom be given into the servant’s custody? Certainly it could not be that part of the Kingdom in heaven itself, for the anointed remnant is yet on earth. We find that this is exactly what it has to do with, the interests of the glorious Kingdom as they pertain now to this earth. That is, those Kingdom interests which are visible. Can it therefore really mean that the returned master who comes as earth’s new ruler has made this “faithful and wise servant” ruler over <em>all</em> the present earthly interests of his kingdom? That is exactly what it states, and certainly no less. ‘He shall make him ruler over all his possessions.’ Not only do we believe this, but give thanks to God and Christ day and night for his loving-kindness to the children of men.</p>

(Read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021255/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">James 1:27</a>.) We can also volunteer to help clean and maintain our Kingdom Hall. No one forces us to do these things. Love for God and our brothers moves us to <strong>“offer [ourselves] willingly.”</strong>​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021255/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 110:3</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6">Baptized Witnesses can support the congregation in additional ways. Spiritually qualified brothers can serve as ministerial servants and, in time, as elders. Both brothers and sisters may actively support the preaching work by serving as pioneers. Some Witnesses can assist by helping to build places of worship or by moving to an area where a congregation needs help in other ways.</p><h3 class="du-color--purple-600 du-fontSize--base du-margin-top--8" id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>2.</strong> <strong>How can we use our material resources to support the congregation?</strong></h3><p id="p8" data-pid="8">We can <strong>“honor Jehovah with [our] valuable things.”</strong> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102021255/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:9</a>) We count it a privilege to contribute money and other resources to support the local congregation and the worldwide preaching work.

<br/><strong>Box title:</strong> EARLY CONVENTIONS THAT GAVE IMPETUS TO THE PREACHING WORK</h2>
<ul><li><p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="su">            <strong>1919, Cedar Point, Ohio, U.S.A.</strong> The program highlighted that a Christian’s vocation was “to announce the incoming glorious kingdom of Messiah.” An announcement was made that a new magazine, <em>The Golden Age,</em> would be published for use in directing people to the Kingdom. To organize and give impetus to the work, a service director would be appointed for each class, or congregation, of Bible Students.</p></li><li><p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="su">            <strong>1922, Cedar Point, Ohio.</strong> During the discourse entitled “The Kingdom,” the speaker urged: “Advertise, advertise, advertise the King and his Kingdom.” One of those present, Anna E. Zimmerman, later recalled: “Our mission was now loud and clear​—to advertise the King and the Kingdom, and we went forth from that convention and did just that.”</p></li><li><p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="su">            <strong>1931, Columbus, Ohio.</strong> The Bible Students adopted a new name​—Jehovah’s Witnesses. That name clearly identified the responsibility of those who worship Jehovah, namely, to proclaim his name and Kingdom.</p></li><li><p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="su">            <strong>1935, Washington, D.C.</strong> The “great multitude,” or “great crowd,” was identified as consisting of individuals who have the prospect of living forever on earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102014245/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Rev. 7:9-17</a>; <em>King James Version</em>) With their understanding thus clarified, Jehovah’s people discerned that the scope of the preaching work before them was indeed great.</p></li></ul>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"><strong>11, 12.</strong><strong> What did <em>The Watch Tower</em> in 1920 say as to when the work that Jesus foretold would be done?</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><strong><sup>11</sup></strong></span> <strong>Printed publications.</strong> Through the pages of <em>The Watch Tower,</em> the significance of the work Jesus foretold​—namely, the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom—​became clearer and clearer. Consider some examples from the early 1920’s.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> What message would be proclaimed in fulfillment of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102014245/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>? When would that work be done? The July 1, 1920, issue of <em>The Watch Tower,</em> in the article entitled “Gospel of the Kingdom,” explained the message, stating: “The good news here is concerning the end of the old order of things and the establishment of Messiah’s kingdom.” The article clearly showed when this message would be preached, saying: “This message must be delivered between the time of the great world war [World War I] and the time of the ‘great tribulation.’” Hence, the article noted: “Now <span id="page64" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="64" data-before-text="64"></span>is the time . . . to proclaim far and wide in Christendom this good news.”</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu"><strong>13.</strong><strong> How did <em>The Watch Tower</em> in 1921 appeal to the willing spirit of anointed Christians?</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> Would God’s people be pressured into doing the work that Jesus foretold? No. The article “Be of Good Courage,” in the March 15, 1921, issue of <em>The Watch Tower,</em> appealed to the willing spirit of anointed Christians. Each one was encouraged to ask himself: “Is it not my greatest privilege, as well as my duty, to participate in this work?” The article went on to say: “We feel assured that when you do see it [as a privilege to share in the work] you will be like Jeremiah, in whose heart the word of the Lord was ‘as a burning fire shut up in [his] bones,’ urging him on so that he could not refrain from speaking.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102014245/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jer. 20:9</a>) That warm encouragement reflected the confidence that Jehovah and Jesus have in loyal Kingdom supporters.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu"><strong>14, 15.</strong><strong> In 1922, <em>The Watch Tower</em> urged anointed Christians to reach others in what way?</strong></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><strong><sup>14</sup></strong></span> How should true Christians reach others with the Kingdom message? The short but powerful article entitled “Service Essential,” in the August 15, 1922, issue of <em>The Watch Tower,</em> urged anointed Christians to take part in “actively carrying the printed message to the people and talking to them at their doors, giving the witness that the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><strong><sup>15</sup></strong></span> Clearly, from 1919 on, Christ has used his faithful and discreet slave to emphasize repeatedly that a Christian’s privilege and duty on earth is to proclaim the Kingdom message. How, though, did the early Bible Students respond to the encouragement to share in the work of Kingdom proclamation?</p><h2 id="p22" data-pid="22"><strong>“The Faithful Will Be Volunteers”</strong></h2>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu"><strong>16.</strong><strong> How did some of the elected elders react to the idea that all should share in the ministry?</strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> In the 1920’s and 1930’s, some resisted the idea that <em>all</em> anointed Christians should share in the ministry. The November 1, 1927, <em>Watch Tower</em> explained what was happening: “There are those today in the church [congregation] occupying the responsible position of elder . . . who refuse to encourage their brethren to have part in the service, and who refuse to participate in the service themselves. . . . They scoff at the suggestion of going from door to door to carry the message of God, his King and his kingdom, to the people.” The article pointedly said: “The time has come for the faithful to mark such and to avoid them, and to say to them that no longer will we entrust such men with the office of eldership.”<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1102014245/2">c</a></p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu"><strong>17, 18.</strong><strong> How did most in the congregations respond to the direction from headquarters, and how have millions responded over the past 100 years?</strong></p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><strong><sup>17</sup></strong></span> Happily, most in the congregations responded enthusiastically to the direction from headquarters.

In the next few chapters, we will discuss <em>how</em> they have preached​—the methods and the tools they have used—​and <em>what</em> the results have been. First, though, let us discuss <em>why</em> millions have shared in this Kingdom-preaching work voluntarily, despite living in a me-first world. As we consider why, we do well to ask ourselves, ‘Why do I share the good news with others?’</p>

<strong>Young People Who Are Like Refreshing Dewdrops</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Bible tells of faithful young men and women, as well as youths and small children, who set sterling examples in serving God. A “company of young men” as refreshing as dewdrops is foretold in the book of Psalms. It also tells of “young men” and “virgins” praising the name of Jehovah.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002682/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 110:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2002682/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 148:12, 13</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>A Place for Youths to Thrive</strong></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The dewdrop simile is fitting, for dew is linked to abundance and blessing.

In this time of Christ’s presence, young Christians willingly and eagerly offer themselves in great numbers.

But the so-called Christian nations did not submit willingly to Jehovah’s newly enthroned King.

On May 8, 1918, the editor of the <em>Watch Tower</em> magazine and a number of his fellow workers were arrested amid war hysteria. Later, on June 21, they were sentenced to many years of imprisonment in the federal penitentiary in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.A. Only after the war had ended and they had spent nine months in prison were these ministers of God’s Kingdom admitted to bail.

<strong>Happiness That Comes from a “Willing Spirit”</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“MAY I HELP?” These three small, kind words express much about an individual. What do they show? A “willing spirit.” Assisting someone or sharing in a meaningful work brings immeasurable joy and happiness to an individual. Many today are receiving a great deal of happiness from sharing in the worldwide work that Jesus commanded. What is that? “And this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977326/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>) Yes, the <em>1977 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses</em> shows that, in obedience to this command, 2,248,390 manifested this willing spirit during 1976 and spent 359,258,019 hours sharing this “good news” with others in 210 different lands and islands of the sea. Truly, a marvelous fulfillment of the prophetic words of David when he said: “Your people will offer themselves willingly on the day of your military force”!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977326/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 110:3</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This spirit of willingness has always been found among the worshipers of Jehovah, from Abel down to lovers of righteousness today. Jehovah has greatly blessed this willingness on the part of his people. How grateful we are that he has afforded us opportunity to express it, to our own happiness! Those today who have this spirit can appreciate Jesus’ own words when he said that “there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977326/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>) Have you experienced this?

<strong>Right Motive in Serving God</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> Just as there was a great contrast between the pompous, self-seeking clergy of Jesus’ day and the apostles who associated with him for the love of the truth, so today there is a great difference between the paid clergy of Christendom and those who voluntarily teach and preach as Jehovah’s witnesses. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964403/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 23:5-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964403/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Mic. 3:11</a>) Illustrating this is the comment of a former minister as reported in the <em>Saturday Evening Post,</em> November 17, 1962: “We were not troubled by just this incident, or just our church, but by what the ministry in general had come to mean. We thought of my fellow ministers in our area. All considered themselves Christians. Yet we seemed to be competitors—for the largest membership increase, the most impressive building, the most prominent prospective members . . . Some politicked shamelessly <span id="page335" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="335" data-before-text="335"></span>for the friendship of others who might assist in their promotion to more prominent churches. Certainly we never discussed theological questions or how to meet better the spiritual needs of our communities. At ministerial meetings the talk was mostly about buildings, salaries or membership-campaign gimmicks . . . This was not the ministry to which I had felt a call.” Although he still believed in Jesus Christ, he quit the ministry because he felt his life would be wasted as a recreation director or on what seemed to him to be little more than a Sunday-morning, mutual-admiration society.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 4. What was Jesus interested in? What did Paul have to say about the right motive for service?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Surely just having a large increase in members or having a financially affluent congregation or the largest church was not what interested Christ or those who served with him. Jesus was interested in finding those who would worship God in spirit and in truth, rather than in having large crowds come to hear him preach soothing sermons. In fact, he pointed out that the road that would lead to destruction would be the broad one, but the road to life would be narrow and straight and difficult to follow. Even so, the apostle Paul recognized that there were some who served God with the wrong motive. As he said, “some are preaching the Christ through envy and rivalry.” That seems to be the case now when modern-day ministers compete for large buildings or large church attendances. However, Paul went on to say, “but others also through good will. The latter are publicizing the Christ out of love . . . but the former do it out of contentiousness, not with a pure motive.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964403/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Phil. 1:15-17</a>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 5. How should real interest in true worship be shown?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Jehovah does not only look on the service a person renders or his position, but he looks on the heart to determine the motive of those serving him. So it is up to each Christian to consider his personal motive for serving God, whether it is for personal reasons or out of rivalry or a spirit of competition, or out of love and with goodwill and a pure motive. Do not let your “service” be that of a formal worshiper content as long as nothing is required of him. Such ones even begrudge taking the time to discuss their faith. As the former clergyman referred to previously complained, “The people would rather hear about <em>their</em> idea of Christianity than Christ’s . . . Not only didn’t they want to hear about it; they didn’t want to talk about it.” He found that those teaching Sunday-school classes balked at further instruction, and when he tried to develop a church-wide program of small discussion groups in members’ homes to develop them spiritually, no more than ten persons ever attended, and within two months the program was dead. This certainly is a far cry from the Christianity Jesus taught when he said: “You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.” Jesus set the lead by showing that true worship is demonstrated by service.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964403/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 22:37</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>WILLING SERVICE OF JEHOVAH</strong></p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 6. What attitude do thousands of Christians show today?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Just as the psalmist long ago foretold, there are men on the earth today who desire to serve Jehovah whole-souled. David prophesied: “Your people will offer themselves willingly on the day of your military force.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964403/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 110:3</a>) They show a keen interest in learning and studying God’s Word. They are happy to talk about the Scriptures and are moved by a heartfelt desire to serve Jehovah. As a result they dedicate their lives to Jehovah and symbolize it by public baptism. This was the simple, early Christian form of becoming a disciple, and <span id="page336" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="336" data-before-text="336"></span>it is the same method that is practiced by Jehovah’s witnesses today. It is wonderful to see thousands taking this step each year. In fact, during 1963, 62,798 individuals worldwide were baptized in symbol of their dedication of their lives to Jehovah to share in the ministry. They are not serving for financial advantage anymore than the early apostles were. Nor are they deterred by the lack of interest shown by the people generally, but they serve for the joy of representing Jehovah and advancing Kingdom interests. They serve for love of God and love of neighbor. They recognize the truthfulness of Jesus’ words, “You cannot slave for God and for Riches,” and so they put the Kingdom interests and the ministry first in their lives.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964403/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 6:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964403/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 9:18</a>.</p>

<strong>Why Be Baptized?</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> It is said prophetically of Jehovah’s people that during the “last days” and just prior to the battle of Armageddon, they would ‘offer themselves willingly on the day of his military force.’ Jehovah is especially pleased when they willingly and obediently discern his will and follow through diligently to do it. Yet some, for various reasons, hesitate to be baptized. They have partial knowledge, they have some doubts, and, in some instances, it amounts to shirking responsibility. What should be done? First, there are those who feel that their knowledge is incomplete or that they are inadequate for Jehovah’s service. They would like to wait longer before taking the step of dedication and baptism. It is, of course, proper that each one entering into a covenant relationship with Jehovah have a basic knowledge of the truth and, through faith and the eye of understanding, have a proper conception of Jehovah and his righteous principles; but we <span id="page331" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="331" data-before-text="331"></span>have many examples in the Scriptures of those who immediately dedicated themselves and were baptized with just the basic knowledge of the truth. It is not always how much you know, but how much you love what you know.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962403/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 110:3</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 7.

Hence, there is no reason to feel inadequate. One may not have natural ability and may feel somewhat timid, or perhaps his moral background has not been the best. What Jehovah is asking is that you believe him when he says that “everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved.” He will train you, he will instruct you in righteousness. He will bring you on to maturity; but you must be willing to keep transforming your mind according to his will. Everlasting life is the reward for doing so.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962403/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rom. 10:13</a>.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 8.

Everlasting life is desired by them, and they enjoy the pleasant association of those in the New World society, but taking on the responsibility of preaching the good news and aiding others seems to be too much to ask of them. There are the friends and neighbors to think about, and there is the time it takes to call on the homes of the people and follow up the interest with back-calls and Bible studies. Also, there seem to be too many meetings to attend. But why should there be a delay because one shies away from responsibility or growing to Christian maturity? The apostle Paul states: “Let a man so appraise us as being subordinates of Christ and stewards of sacred secrets of God. Besides, in this case, what is looked for in stewards is for a man to be found faithful.” Lazy people shy away from work. Also, trying to protect one’s reputation with others by refusing to declare himself with God’s people is prideful and dangerous.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962403/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Cor. 4:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 9.

This is specious reasoning and misusing Jehovah’s patience. Listen to the timely words of Peter under divine inspiration: “Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, what sort of persons ought you to be in holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion, awaiting and keeping close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah.” No, do not be misled by wrong thinking, but bestir yourself and begin to carry out your responsibilities before Jehovah.

There is a certain spirit of independence that is present in their mind. They do not wish to be restricted in their freedom, not realizing that actually they are putting themselves into bondage to their own reasoning and to this world. And sometimes, to justify delay on their part, little points of objection are raised which in themselves are insignificant, but are magnified out of proportion so that the overall issue and God’s true worship are placed in the background. Pride, a strong ego, the spirit of this world and a growing tendency today <span id="page332" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="332" data-before-text="332"></span>to figure everything out for oneself and to believe only what one can see cause the spirit of independence to take root and resist the natural desire of man to get to know Jehovah and to render sacred service to him in a dedicated relationship. Do not let an independent spirit of this world hold you back. On the other hand, “if the Son sets you free, you will be actually free.” Further, “for such freedom Christ set us free. Therefore stand fast, and do not let yourselves be confined again in a yoke of slavery.” Let your love for Jehovah cause you to give yourself to him in obedient service.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962403/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 8:36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962403/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Gal. 5:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962403/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 2 Pet. 2:19-21</a>.</p>

<strong>Like Jehovah’s Dewdrops Among Many Peoples</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Just as dewdrops are many, so, today, those associating with Jehovah’s “dewdrops” and becoming like dewdrops themselves are exceedingly many, their numbers at the present time increasing some hundred a day and totaling well over nine hundred thousand now. Concerning these the psalmist David prophesied: <span id="page607" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="607" data-before-text="607"></span>“You have your company of young men just like dewdrops.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962728/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 110:3</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">But in particular are God’s people like dew in their refreshing and life-giving activities. Concerning this quality of Jehovah’s literal dewdrops we are told: “The value of this blessing cannot be adequately appreciated by the Western reader; but in Palestine . . . rain rarely, if ever, falls from April to September and, the heat of the sun being at the time very strong, all vegetation would be parched and dried up were it not for the copious dews which fall during the night . . . during the months of April, May, August and September, and after the early and before the latter rains.”—McClintock &amp; Strong’s <em>Cyclopædia.</em></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Concerning these dews of Palestine, <em>Newsweek,</em> August 26, 1957, after quoting <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962728/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Genesis 27:28</a>, had the following to say: “Despite a few such scattered hints in the Bible, the agricultural importance of dew has been ignored in recent centuries. Textbooks carefully explain how water in a plant is transported upward from the roots; a reverse process, the intake of the dew and its movement downward, is never mentioned.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“Now a modern Israeli scientist, who was inspired by the Bible to study dew, has established that this nocturnal deposit of water may spell the difference between a bountiful harvest and drought-ridden starvation. . . . He tells how a water spray simulating dew brought full recovery to wilting citrus trees unirrigated for many rainless months. His bedewed cucumbers were half again as plump as unbedewed ones. Most vegetables . . . grow faster, and yield more when ‘dew’ irrigated . . . Absorption can be so pronounced, he reports, that the soil around the roots will become moist, giving the plant an added reservoir to draw from the next morning.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Surely, just as Jehovah provided literal dewdrops for the refreshment and life of vegetation, so he has provided symbolic dewdrops to serve for the refreshment and life of those who are “hungering and thirsting for righteousness.” To accomplish their purpose, these who are likened to dewdrops must go forth, searching for men of goodwill and, upon finding them, offer them the refreshing waters of life, in keeping with the prophetic invitation: “The spirit and the bride keep on saying: ‘Come!’ And let anyone hearing say: ‘Come!’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962728/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 5:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962728/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Rev. 22:17</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The fact that the dew falls ever so gently shows that these Christian ministers are to be kind and gentle in bringing the truth to the people. And just as the dew keeps falling regularly every evening, during its season, so these Witnesses must be regular, not spasmodic, in serving as refreshing dewdrops, especially in faithfully conducting Bible studies with the people in their homes, so that these can become refreshed and revived and take their stand for Jehovah and join in serving, like dewdrops themselves, to bring refreshment to still others.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Surely this is a most happifying work in which to be engaged! During the month of October these Christian witnesses will bring refreshment to the people by offering the <em>Awake!</em> magazine on a subscription basis.</p>

<strong>Exercising Patience</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Although we are no longer looking forward to the presence of the Lord since the <span id="page206" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="206" data-before-text="206"></span>start of the sign’s fulfillment in 1914, still we do need to exercise patience until the preaching work is thoroughly accomplished and Jehovah says it is enough at Armageddon. When James said we should exercise patience, this was not meant to be an inactive period of waiting, but instead should be an exercise of faith and hope by sharing with others the truths we have learned, at the same time having confidence in Jehovah’s Word and the early carrying out of his purposes. As the psalmist foretold, Jehovah’s people are willing in the day of his power. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961243/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ps. 110:3</a>) They are happy to be able to share in his service, and many families have even sold their homes and given up their secular work and moved out to new territories where their ministerial activity has been greatly appreciated by the people of good will they now serve.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">19. What good Scriptural counsel should we follow, and why?</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> These sincere Christians realize the wisdom of the counsel given by Jesus: “No man that has put his hand to a plow and looks at the things behind is well fitted for the kingdom of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961243/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Luke 9:62</a>) So instead of looking back at the old-world system and the temporary advantages or promotions that it offers, they look ahead to the blessings of the new world and keep their eye on the Kingdom goal, putting forth every effort to advance the Kingdom interests by ministerial activity. They follow the counsel: “By endurance on your part you will acquire your souls [or, ‘future lives’].” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961243/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Luke 21:19</a>) They realize that the wonderful gift of life in the new world is worth working for patiently, so they are not discouraged. They understand that even though many Bible studies may need to be conducted before one comes to appreciate the truth, this is all a part of the work, the dividing of the sheep and the goats, that Jesus foretold, and they are happy to have a share in it. They look forward to the time when this work will be done and when all who live will know Jehovah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961243/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Jer. 31:34</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">20. What is involved in obtaining Jehovah’s blessing on our preaching work?</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> As long as a person keeps doing the preaching and teaching work the way Jehovah directs through his organization, it will not be in vain but will have Jehovah’s blessing. Always look to him for guidance and pray for his assistance by means of his spirit. As Paul explained the minister’s relationship to God: “What, then, is Apollos? Yes, what is Paul? Ministers through whom you became believers, even as the Lord granted each one. I planted, Apollos watered, but God kept making it grow; so that neither is he that plants anything nor is he that waters, but God who makes it grow.” The scripture goes on to explain that one will reap from the ministry according to what he puts into it, saying: “But each person will receive his own reward according to his own labor.” Do you value the privilege you have to be one of God’s fellow workers? If so, put forth every effort to make your ministry good in his sight. “For we are God’s fellow workers. You people are God’s field under cultivation, God’s building.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961243/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:5-9</a>) As a part of God’s field under cultivation, are you making growth to spiritual maturity? Do not be like a sucker on a vine, always taking in nourishment, but never producing fruitage; but rather study, attend congregation meetings, and put forth real effort to be a good teacher, growing strong in the truth, prepared to produce fruit as a fellow worker of God. Then the words of Paul will apply to you: “Consequently, my beloved brothers, become steadfast, unmovable, always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord, knowing <span id="page207" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="207" data-before-text="207"></span>that your labor is not in vain in connection with the Lord.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961243/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:58</a>.</p>

<strong>The Great 1958 Assembly</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The sight of New York’s two largest stadiums filled with singing witnesses of Jehovah is still in the future, but it will <span id="page246" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="246" data-before-text="246"></span>become a reality during the eight days from July 27 to August 3. Then the neighborhood around the stadiums will hear these righteous-loving, peaceful people singing the praises of the great God of the universe.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In the meantime preparations for the gathering are under way. The chartering of planes, boats, trains and buses has been arranged. All is in readiness for a mass movement of delegates across oceans and continents toward one place—New York city. Soon a house-to-house search throughout New York will get under way to find places for the delegates to stay during the assembly. These accommodations in private homes will be in addition to what has been arranged for in the city’s many hotels.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Plans are being made for two cafeterias at the stadiums for feeding the crowds of conventioners. These will be operated entirely by delegates who volunteer their services. It is estimated that for all the duties involved in operating the cafeterias, as well as the many other assembly departments, at least twenty-five to thirty thousand volunteers will be needed. Since the delegates are all members of the New World society they will not hold back from volunteering their services but will offer themselves willingly, just as they have offered themselves willingly for the service of preaching and teaching. It is written: “Your people will offer themselves willingly on the day of your military force.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958283/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 110:3</a>) This is his day of military force in heaven. It is the day when his dedicated servants on earth gladly offer themselves for his service. The duties connected with assemblies of his people are forms of such service. They are rendered in the interest of the New World society. The delegates will therefore want to show the same willingness to serve the interests of the New World society today as they expect to show after the coming battle of Armageddon, when God’s people will be the only human inhabitants on earth.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The conventioners will find that the two stadiums are within easy walking distance of each other. Little more than a bridge separates them. Both can be conveniently reached by subway from almost any part of New York. The IND line passes by both stadiums, stopping first at the Polo Grounds and then at Yankee Stadium. The IRT line passes next to Yankee Stadium and then has a short branch that runs over to the Polo Grounds.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>WHY THEY COME</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">There are good reasons why Jehovah’s witnesses want to come to this great international assembly. The principal reason is that assemblies such as this are spiritual feasts. It was promised by the prophet Isaiah that Jehovah’s servants “shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them will lead them, even by springs of water will he guide them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958283/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 49:10</a>, <em>AS</em>) Jehovah’s people do not hunger spiritually or thirst for truth. Neither does the <span id="page247" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="247" data-before-text="247"></span>scorching heat of God’s fiery judgments fall upon them, because they obey him.</p>

<strong>High Priest</strong><br/><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"><strong>The High Priesthood of Jesus Christ.</strong> The Bible book of Hebrews points out that Jesus Christ, since his resurrection and entry into heaven, is “a high priest according to the manner of Melchizedek forever.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002023/66/0" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Heb 6:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002023/66/1" data-bid="67-2" class="b"> 7:17,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002023/66/2" data-bid="67-3" class="b"> 21</a>) To describe the greatness of Christ’s priesthood and its superiority over the Aaronic priesthood, the writer shows that Melchizedek was both a king and a priest by designation of the Most High God, and not by inheritance. Christ Jesus, not of the tribe of Levi, but of Judah and of the line of David, did not inherit his office by descent from Aaron, but obtained it by direct appointment of God, as did Melchizedek. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002023/67/0" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Heb 5:10</a>) In addition to the promise recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002023/68/0" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Psalm 110:4</a>: “Jehovah has sworn (and he will feel no regret): ‘You are a priest to time indefinite according to the manner of Melchizedek!’” which appointment makes him a heavenly King-Priest, Christ also possesses Kingdom authority by reason of his descent from David.

<strong>Melchizedek</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>Christ’s Priesthood Typified.</strong> In a notable Messianic prophecy the sworn oath of Jehovah to David’s “Lord” is: “You are a priest to time indefinite according to the manner of Melchizedek!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002970/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps 110:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002970/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 4</a>) This inspired psalm gave the Hebrews reason to regard the promised Messiah as the one in whom the office of priest and king would be combined.

But Jehovah also revealed to David that a lasting priest would come. David wrote: “Jehovah has sworn (and he will feel no regret): ‘You are a priest to time indefinite according to the manner of Melchizedek!’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989084/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 110:4</a>) What was behind this sworn word of God that amounted to a personal covenant between Jehovah and the coming Priest?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Melchizedek had been king of ancient Salem, which evidently was on the site where later the city Jerusalem (a name incorporating “Salem”) was built. The account of Abraham’s dealings with him highlights that he was a king who worshiped “the Most High God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989084/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Genesis 14:17-20</a>) Yet, God’s statement at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989084/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 110:4</a> shows that Melchizedek was also a priest, making him a unique person.

For example, he says that it was Jesus Christ who was “called by God a high priest according to the manner of Melchizedek.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989084/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Hebrews 5:4-10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989084/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 6:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989084/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 7:17,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989084/9/3" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> 21, 22</a>) Though Melchizedek obviously had human parents, there is no record of his genealogy. So rather than Jesus’ inheriting the office of priest according to a recorded lineage from Melchizedek, his appointment came directly from God. Jesus’ priesthood will not be passed to a successor, for “he remains a priest perpetually.” This is so, for the benefits of his priestly service will be eternal. We can truly be blessed in having a priest who “is able also to save completely those who are approaching God through him” and to instruct and guide faithful ones eternally.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989084/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Hebrews 7:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989084/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 15-17,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989084/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 23-25</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 9, 10.

In the same context where he mentioned this covenant for a priest like Melchizedek, David wrote: “The utterance of Jehovah to my Lord is: ‘Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.’” We can thus see that Jesus​—David’s Lord—​was to have a place in heaven with Jehovah, which occurred at his ascension.

Paul urges the Hebrews to hold on to confessing Jesus, the great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, that they may find mercy. The Christ did not glorify himself, but it was the Father who said: “You are a priest forever according to the manner of Melchizedek.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990119/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Heb. 5:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990119/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Ps. 110:4</a>) First, Christ was made perfect for the position of high priest by learning obedience through suffering, in order to become responsible for everlasting salvation to all those obeying him. Paul has “much to say and hard to be explained,” but the Hebrews are still babes in need of milk, when, in fact, they ought to be teachers. “Solid food belongs to mature people, to those who through use have their perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong.” The apostle urges them to “press on to maturity.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990119/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Heb. 5:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990119/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990119/16/2" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 6:1</a>.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">14.

Their hope, which is as “an anchor for the soul, both sure and firm,” has been established by Jesus’ entry “within the curtain” as Forerunner and High Priest according to the manner of Melchizedek.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990119/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">6:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990119/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 19</a>.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">15.

Melchizedek’s blessing of Abraham thus extended to the unborn Levi, and this showed that the Levitical priesthood was inferior to that of Melchizedek. Further, if perfection came through the Levitical priesthood of Aaron, would there be need for another priest “according to the manner of Melchizedek”? Moreover, since there is a change of priesthood, “there comes to be of necessity a change also of the law.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990119/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">7:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990119/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 11, 12</a>.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">16.

Because they kept dying, its priests were many, but Jesus by “continuing alive forever has his priesthood without any successors. Consequently he is able also to save completely those who are approaching God through him, because he is always alive to plead for them.” This High Priest, Jesus, is “loyal, guileless, undefiled, separated from the sinners,” whereas the high priests appointed by the Law are weak, having first to offer sacrifices for their own sins before they can intercede for others. So the word of God’s sworn oath “appoints a Son, who is perfected forever.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990119/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">7:24-26,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990119/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 28</a>.</p>

Thus God became an everlasting Father to the resurrected Jesus Christ, and this one, being raised incorruptible, became the everlasting Son of his heavenly Life-Giver, Jehovah God.

He was not a Hebrew, an Israelite or a Levite. God’s servant, “Abram the Hebrew,” met him while on his way back from warfare in which Abram had rescued his nephew Lot from marauders. The event occurred between the years 1943 and 1933 B.C.E., long before the nation of Israel with its priesthood was formed. The account reads:</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">“Then the king of Sodom went out to meet [Abram] after he returned from defeating Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, to the Low Plain of Shaveh, that is, the king’s Low Plain. And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine, and he was priest of the Most High God. Then he blessed him and said: ‘Blessed be Abram of the Most High God, Producer of heaven and earth; and blessed be the Most High God, who has delivered your oppressors into your hand!’ At that Abram gave him a tenth of everything.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974167/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Gen. 14:17-20</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">The Bible does not give the genealogy of Melchizedek nor does it record his death.

Furthermore, Christ lives forever and has no successors. Therefore, Christ is High Priest, not by succession from Melchizedek, but his priesthood is only in a “manner” <span id="page159" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="159" data-before-text="159"></span>like that of that king-priest of Salem.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974167/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Heb. 7:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974167/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 15-17</a>.</p>

According to this, Melchizedek was the prefiguring of a still greater king, one even greater than David, one whom even David would be obliged to call “my Lord.” This prefigured king could be no one else but the Messiah, the “seed” of God’s “woman.” So, under the power of God’s holy spirit, David wrote, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974037/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Psalm 110:1-4</a>:</p>

For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him and to whom Abraham apportioned a tenth from all things, is first of all, by translation, ‘King of Righteousness,’ and is then also king of Salem, that is, ‘King of Peace.’ In being fatherless, motherless, without genealogy, having neither a beginning of days nor an end of life, but having been made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.”</p><p id="p107" data-pid="107" class="qu">19. How was Melchizedek “made like the Son of God” in the matter of priesthood, and so on what did Jesus’ priesthood depend?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[107]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> How was Melchizedek “made like the Son of God” or used as an illustration of Jesus Christ the Son of God? In that Jehovah God used Melchizedek as a pattern when speaking about an oath that He was going to make in behalf of his Son Jesus Christ. God inspired King David to say, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101973016/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Psalm 110:1-4</a>: “The utterance of Jehovah to my Lord is: ‘Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.’ . . . Jehovah has sworn (and he will feel no regret): ‘You are a priest to time indefinite according to the manner of Melchizedek!’” So, as in the case of Melchizedek, the priesthood of Jesus Christ was not made to rest upon human descent and inheritance. He did not need to get his priesthood either through Melchizedek or through the priestly family of Aaron of the tribe of Levi. Jesus’ priesthood rested upon the oath of Jehovah God and upon his being resurrected incorruptible from the dead to heavenly life at the right hand of God.</p>

In so doing Melchizedek also blessed Abraham’s yet unborn “seed” in whom all the nations of the earth will be blessed. Melchizedek laid the credit for Abraham’s military victory to “the Most High God, Producer of heaven and earth.” He blessed the Most High God because He had delivered the oppressors <span id="page238" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="238" data-before-text="238"></span>of Abraham into his hand. Abraham took note of that fact, and for that reason he felt indebted to the Most High God. He recognized Melchizedek as being “priest of the Most High God.” On this account he gave to Melchizedek a tithe or tenth part of the spoils of victory over the oppressive enemies. All the recaptured goods Abraham returned to the original owners. Thus no person on earth could claim that he had made Abraham materially rich. He trusted in the blessing that the “priest of the Most High God” had pronounced upon him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968282/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gen. 14:21 to 15:1</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>PRIEST “ACCORDING TO THE MANNER OF MELCHIZEDEK”</strong></p><p id="p80" data-pid="80" class="qu">17.

The priests of the false gods of Babylon, Assyria, Egypt and Canaanland went on ministering to their deities, but Melchizedek disappeared from their midst in mystery. But the Most High God did not forget his priest, the king of Salem. More than four hundred years later he caused the brief record of Melchizedek “priest of the Most High God” to be written down in the Torah, the inspired book written by Moses, in that part thereof now known as Genesis. More than four hundred years after that (or about 1070 B.C.E.) Jehovah God the Most High called Melchizedek to mind in a most surprising way.

David was a descendant of the patriarch Abraham, “the friend of God.” King David was a lover and worshiper of Jehovah, the God of Abraham. Jehovah the Most High God had enabled King David to capture Mount Zion, the citadel of Jerusalem, about the year 1070 B.C.E. There on that ancient Mount Zion King David set up his capital city, and built his royal palace, and there he brought the most sacred piece of religious furniture, the ark of Jehovah’s covenant, the symbol of Jehovah’s presence with his chosen people.

Sometime after this Jehovah inspired King David as a prophet and moved him to write down a psalm. It is now numbered as the 110th Psalm in the Bible’s book of Psalms, Hebrew edition. In it Jehovah God foretold someone to come who would be a Lord even over King David. So in the psalm King David acknowledges the lordship of this coming one and foretells what office he will hold, and where, and what he will do.

Yet, only fifty-four days later, on the morning of the religious festival of Shabuoth, or Pentecost, on Sivan 6 at Jerusalem, that question of high importance to us today was authoritatively answered, under inspiration of the Most High God. Before then this controversial figure Jesus had been nailed to a stake till dead on Friday, Nisan 14, and had been resurrected from the dead on Sunday morning, Nisan 16, and had ascended to heaven forty days from then, on Thursday, Iyyar 25. There are many more than the two or three eyewitnesses to the truthfulness of all this. But ten days after Jesus’ ascension <span id="page240" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="240" data-before-text="240"></span>to heaven came that most outstanding day of Pentecost, Sunday, Sivan 6, 33 C.E. Before nine o’clock that morning a miracle occurred. God’s holy spirit was poured out, with a visible manifestation, upon one hundred and twenty disciples of Jesus who were waiting in an upper room in Jerusalem. In further evidence of this, they all began speaking in many foreign, non-Jewish languages, telling about the magnificent things of God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968282/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Acts 2:1-4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1968282/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 1:1-15</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[84]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> As news of this got around Jerusalem, thousands of Pentecost celebrators gathered to become eyewitnesses of the miraculous spectacle.

Was not the priesthood of the Jewish people established by the Most High God, the one alone whose name is Jehovah? Yes! That ancient priesthood was established in the family of the Levite Aaron, the brother of the prophet Moses. Aaron became the first high priest and his sons became the underpriests. This Aaronic priesthood was put in office in the year 1512 B.C.E., after Jehovah God delivered his chosen people from slavery in Egypt.

Or, do you envision, perhaps, a Buddhist or Hindu priest carrying on his duties in the temple of his religion? Are any or all of these men priests of the true God? Furthermore, the Bible speaks of a new priesthood. Would it be, as some of the religions of Christendom claim, that the Jewish priesthood of Aaron and his descendants was the old priesthood and was superseded by the priesthood of the various faiths of Christendom, for example, the priesthood of the Roman Catholic Church with their head the pope, who is known as the Pontifex Maximus?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="ss"><strong>HEAD OF THE NEW PRIESTHOOD</strong></p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">First of all, it must be said that Jesus Christ is the Chief Priest of the Most High God. His priesthood superseded the Aaronic priesthood but he did not obtain his priesthood through descent from them, nor was his priesthood an extension or continuation of the Aaronic priesthood. It was <em>new.</em> King David had said by inspiration: “The utterance of Jehovah to my Lord is: ‘Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.’ Jehovah has sworn (and he will feel no regret): ‘You are a priest to time indefinite according to the manner of Melchizedek!’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966004/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966004/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 4</a>) Jesus was born in the tribe of Judah and the family line of David; so he had no descent from the tribe of Levi as did the high priests Annas and Caiaphas, who entered into the Most Holy of the temple on earth because they were men of flesh, blood and bones.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">After Nisan 16, 33 C.E., Jesus, resurrected in the spirit, was no longer a man of flesh and blood; he was rewarded by his Father for his faithfulness with an immortal spiritual organism. After his resurrection he made various appearances to his disciples by miraculously materializing a body, but at the end of forty days he ascended to his Father in heaven, and there in the presence of Jehovah the Almighty God he presented the value of his sacrifice as “the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966004/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 1:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966004/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 4:23, 24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966004/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Acts 1:1-11</a>) This fact proves that he did not take back his sacrificed humanity.

At that time God brought him forth as his enthroned, crowned King, fully authorized to start ruling in the midst of his enemies.

<strong>Why Two Covenants for Kingdom Power?</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">David himself under inspiration showed that the position to be held at a later date by God’s Son would embrace more than anything he could pass on to him, and that is why he spoke of him prophetically as “my Lord.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964566/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1</a>) Concerning the kingdom that this one would inherit it was foretold in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964566/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Daniel 7:13, 14</a>: “I kept on beholding in the visions of the night, and, see there! with the clouds of the heavens someone like a son of man happened to be coming; and to the Ancient of Days he gained access, and they brought him up close even before that One. And to him there were given rulership and dignity and kingdom, that the peoples, national groups and languages should all serve even him. His rulership is an indefinitely lasting rulership that will not pass away, and his <span id="page478" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="478" data-before-text="478"></span>kingdom one that will not be brought to ruin.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">So after Jesus had faithfully finished his earthly ministry, God “raised him up from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above every government and authority and power and lordship and every name named, not only in this system of things, but also in that to come.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964566/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Eph. 1:20, 21</a>) At that time, in the year 33 C.E., <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964566/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 110:1</a> applied, which says: “The utterance of Jehovah to my Lord is: ‘Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.’” After nearly nineteen centuries, at the end of the “appointed times of the nations,” or in 1914 C.E., Jehovah issued the further command recorded in the following verse, saying to his King-Son: “Go subduing in the midst of your enemies.” So Jesus’ position as king is something far more than anything that David ever had.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>COVENANT FOR HEAVENLY KINGDOM</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Does that ruling position of Jesus include anything else? Yes, it does. Just two verses later in the same psalm, David was inspired to say: “Jehovah has sworn (and he will feel no regret): ‘You are a priest to time indefinite according to the manner of Melchizedek!’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964566/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 110:4</a>) Here, then, was another legal promise concerning the coming Messiah that God had made under oath, first recorded in David’s time. Not only would Jesus’ kingdom be superior to that of David, but he would be a priest as well as a king, something that could never be under the Davidic covenant because God’s law to Israel maintained a strict separation between kingship and priesthood. The very nature of this special office held by Melchizedek made it something that could not be passed on to anyone as a human successor of his. It did not come into existence again in God’s arrangement until God’s due time to make Jesus a spiritual king and priest. For this reason, it is not even mentioned again in the Scriptures until Paul discussed the subject in his letter to the Hebrew Christians, written about 61 C.E.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">‘But,’ someone may object, ‘how can it be said that the covenant for a kingly priesthood gives Jesus the right to a heavenly kingdom and priesthood when Melchizedek was also a man, just like David?’ Well, Jesus was not and is not the heir of Melchizedek. However, there were certain circumstances surrounding Melchizedek that appear to have been ordered by God precisely for a prophetic purpose. They showed that Melchizedek’s office was not dependent on human relationships. Paul alludes to these circumstances in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964566/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Hebrews 7:3</a>: “In being fatherless, motherless, without genealogy, having neither a beginning of days nor an end of life [in that none of these things were recorded], but having been made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.” So, too, Jesus’ being God’s High Priest does not result from any human connections; it is not because of his genealogy. While Jesus remained on earth as a man he could not become a Jewish priest at all, because the law covenant was still in effect until after his death and this limited the Jewish priesthood strictly to the members of Aaron’s house in the tribe of Levi. But Jesus became a spiritual priest.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Moreover, the apostle Paul understood that Jesus could be perfected in this spiritual office only by being raised from a sacrificial death and exalted to God’s right hand in the heavens, as is shown by the fact that Paul applies David’s prophetic words concerning Melchizedek to Jesus Christ, who did not appoint himself or seek the honor, saying: “Christ did not glorify himself by becoming a high priest, but was glorified by him who spoke with reference <span id="page479" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="479" data-before-text="479"></span>to him: ‘You are my son; I, today, I have become your father.’ Just as he says also in another place: ‘You are a priest forever according to the manner of Melchizedek.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964566/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Heb. 5:5, 6</a>.</p>

He shows that “not all who spring from Israel are really ‘Israel.’ Neither because they are Abraham’s seed are they all children . . . That is, the children in the flesh [by ordinary procreation] are not really the children of God, but the children by the promise are counted as the seed,” even as Isaac was a child of God’s promise, being born when Abraham and Sarah were “as good as dead” as far as giving birth to a son was concerned. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963243/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Heb. 11:12</a>) Then, with further quotations from the Hebrew Scriptures, Paul proves that God has the absolute right to choose whom he will, and that those ancient prophets foretold that God would ultimately choose a people not previously recognized, as Hosea wrote: ‘I will say to those not my people: “You are my people, the sons of the living God.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963243/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Hosea 2:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963243/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 1:10</a>) With further quotations, he <span id="page205" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="205" data-before-text="205"></span>then proves that “people of the nations,” Gentiles, obtained the ‘righteousness resulting from <em>faith,’</em> which righteous standing fleshly Israel failed to obtain because, says Paul, Israel “pursued it, not by faith, but as by works,” that is, the works of the Law. Finally, Paul quotes what both Moses and Isaiah recorded as spoken by God against Israel: “I will incite you people to jealousy through that which is not a nation,” and, “I was found by those who were not seeking me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963243/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Deut. 32:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963243/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Isa. 65:1</a>)—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963243/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Rom. 9:6-8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963243/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 25, 26,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963243/15/2" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 30-32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963243/15/3" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> 10:19, 20</a>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">14.

For instance, Paul shows that the high priest who would provide the only acceptable sacrifice, something far better than animal sacrifices, would not be a Levitical priest, as required by Israel’s law. How do we know? Because, says Paul, their Scriptures made it “abundantly clear that with a similarity to <em>Melchizedek</em> there arises another priest, who has become such, not according to the law of a commandment depending upon the flesh [or fleshly descent], but according to the power of an indestructible life, for in witness it is said: ‘You are a priest forever according to the manner of Melchizedek.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963243/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Heb. 7:15-17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963243/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Ps. 110:4</a>) Again, Stephen, in his defense before the <em>Sánhedrin,</em> quoted from Isaiah’s prophecy, where a dwelling place for God is foreshadowed of a different and higher kind than Israel’s beautiful stone temple.

<strong>The Legal Foundations of the New World</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> The first reason lies in the fact that God’s oath to Abraham is a <em>legal</em> foundation of the new world. Now, though the prophecies speak of only one foundation cornerstone in a structural way, yet in the fulfillment of these prophecies it is specifically stated that other stones are added. These other stones are proved to be in line with the same requirements as laid down for the chief cornerstone, and are found worthy of being joined thereto in the closest possible association, like stones that fit so well that you cannot insert the blade of a penknife in between. Writing to the Christian believers, who have the “living hope” of sharing with Christ in the incorruptible heavenly inheritance, Peter writes: “Coming to him [Christ] as to a living stone, . . . you yourselves also as <em>living stones</em> are being built up a spiritual house for the purpose of a holy priesthood.” So the associated foundations are apostolic: “The wall of the city also had <span id="page182" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="182" data-before-text="182"></span>twelve foundation stones, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:4, 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/35/1" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> Rev. 21:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/35/2" data-bid="36-3" class="b"> 19</a>, <em>NW;</em> see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Ephesians 2:20-22</a>.) This is parallel to Paul’s argument that, though the original promise to Abraham spoke of only one seed, “‘And to your seed,’ who is Christ,” he then shows that all who are “baptized into Christ” and are in union with him “are really Abraham’s seed, heirs with reference to a promise.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Gal. 3:16,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/37/1" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> 26-29</a>, <em>NW</em>) These structural foundations were ‘legally guaranteed’ by God’s oath in support of his promise to Abraham.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">21.

This time it is regarding the office of high priest.

Finally, Paul discloses the secret of the even greater superiority of Jesus, when he says that Jehovah appointed Jesus to be high priest by <em>“the word of the sworn oath,”</em> in fulfillment of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Psalm 110:4</a> (<em>AS</em>), which reads: “Jehovah hath sworn, and will not repent: thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Heb. 7:20, 21,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/42/1" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 28</a>, <em>NW</em>) This “sworn oath” is another <em>legal</em> foundation of the new world, in addition to God’s oath to Abraham.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">22. Why did God provide for a new covenant, and how is it one of the new world’s legal foundations?</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> Did you notice that Paul said that by Jesus’ becoming a high priest by reason of the sworn oath, it really meant that Jesus was “the one given in pledge [guarantee, security] of a better covenant”? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Heb. 7:22</a>, <em>NW</em>) That “better covenant” is the <em>new covenant,</em> and this fact brings us to the third reason in our list. Is it one of the <em>legal</em> foundations of the new world? Indeed it is, as the apostle goes on to clearly prove in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Hebrews, chapters 8 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/44/1" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> 9</a>. He shows that the new covenant succeeds where the former one made with the fleshly house of Israel failed. Quoting from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, where the terms of the new covenant are set forth, Paul explains that God found fault with both the former (Law) covenant and the people under it, as evidenced in the fact that God said of them: “They did not continue in my covenant, so that I stopped caring for them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Heb. 8:9</a>, <em>NW</em>) The former covenant proved inadequate to provide the real remedy and failed to produce a people for Jehovah’s name. In contrast, the new covenant is altogether superior, as Paul shows in detail in the two chapters mentioned (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Hebrews 8 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/47/1" data-bid="48-2" class="b"> 9</a>), and makes the point that Jesus is “the mediator of a correspondingly better covenant, which has been <em>legally established</em> upon better promises.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Heb. 8:6</a>, <em>NW</em>) The new covenant really does produce a people who sincerely delight to do God’s will because his law is written ‘in their minds and upon their hearts.’ It produces a people whose consciences are cleansed through Christ’s shed blood, the adequate remedy, thus enabling them to “render sacred service to the living God” and ultimately gain “the everlasting inheritance” and, with Christ, <span id="page183" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="183" data-before-text="183"></span>form part of the new world’s government.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Heb. 9:14, 15</a>, <em>NW.</em></p>

By this expression Jehovah meant his new covenant with his new nation of spiritual Israel and for which Jesus Christ is the Mediator, the Greater Moses. To quote Rotherham’s translation of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Psalm 50:5</a>: “Gather yourselves unto me—ye my men of loving-kindness, who have solemnised my covenant over sacrifice.” It is not over <span id="page313" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="313" data-before-text="313"></span>the sacrifice of each saint or person of loving-kindness that this covenant is solemnized, but it is over the one sacrifice of the Mediator Jesus Christ, and the covenant is a national covenant. It is the new covenant made with the new theocratic organization, the Christian congregation. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Ps 50 verse 16</a> of the psalm God speaks of it as his covenant, saying to the wicked hypocrites and apostates: “What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?”</p><p id="p72" data-pid="72" class="qu">28.

These saints or holy ones, these people of loving-kindness, Jehovah God brings into the new covenant through the Mediator Jesus. He forgives them their sins through Jesus’ sacrifice, and he consecrates them or installs them into his service as priests, underpriests whose High Priest is Christ Jesus. He anoints them with his spirit to be such consecrated priests.<a id="footnotesource4" data-fnid="4" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1952365/3">d</a> From then on they are obligated to offer the sacrifices of praise and obedient service to God all their days in the flesh on earth, “seven days,” so to speak.</p><p id="p73" data-pid="73" class="qu">29.

He was accepted, and from that moment, being begotten of the spirit and sealed as a new creature, he is a partaker of the divine nature, the human nature (Abrahamic seed) being the thing sacrificed.” (May, 1881, page 2, under “Some Better Thing for Us”, ¶ 2) But now we appreciate more clearly that Jesus, at the time he presented himself to John to be baptized in Jordan river, did not consecrate himself to the priesthood and install himself in the sacrificial office. It was God who glorified him by making him a royal High Priest. God did this by the sworn oath which he had prophetically given at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Psalm 110:4</a>: “Jehovah hath sworn, and will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever after the manner of Melchizedek.” (<em>AS,</em> marginal reading; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Heb. 5:4-6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/45/1" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> 7:15-17,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/45/2" data-bid="46-3" class="b"> 20-22</a>) Since Jesus was miraculously born one of God’s chosen people and was then presented to God in babyhood by Mary as her first-born son, we can avoid confusion by calling Jesus’ coming to do God’s will his dedication of himself to God.</p><p id="p74" data-pid="74" class="qu">30.

In what way? Just as Moses on the first day of the consecration ceremony decked his brother Aaron in glorious priestly robes and anointed him with the holy anointing oil to be the high priest, so God anointed Jesus with the holy spirit (symbolized by a dove descending upon him) and he let his voice be heard from heaven saying: “This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Matt. 3:13-17</a>, <em>NW</em>) By dedicating himself it was not something which Mary had done for him in his infancy before he had knowledge <span id="page314" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="314" data-before-text="314"></span>and understanding to appreciate it. No, but now at thirty years of age it was something which Jesus willingly did for himself.

The family of the elder son, in whom the title to the throne inhered, at length became extinct, and the descendants of the younger son succeeded to the title. . . . the table in Matthew gives the genealogy of Joseph and exhibits him as heir to the throne of David, while the table in Luke gives the genealogy of Mary and shows Jesus to be the ACTUAL son of David. . . . Jesus, according to Luke, is grandson of Heli, Mary’s father, and thus a lineal descendant of David. . . . In the genealogy as given in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950485/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew, chapter 1</a>, appears the entry, ‘After the carrying away to Babylon, Jechoniah begat Shealtiel.’ The 2 genealogies are intelligible, if this notice in Matthew be understood as a broad declaration in genealogical form denoting LEGAL, succession to the throne. The title passed from Jechoniah on his death to Shealtiel, a lineal descendant of David.” Under “Jesus Christ” the same Dictionary says (p. 303, col. 1): “The Messiah was to be the son of David; and so Joseph, his <em>legal</em> father, and probably mother, his actual mother, were descended from David. . . . [col. 2] The enrollment of the Jews, however, evidently took place after the Jewish method, by which each father of a household was registered, not at his dwelling place, but at the place where his family belonged in view of its ancestry. Hence Joseph had to go to Bethlehem, the original home of David. Mary accompanied him.”</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">McClintock &amp; Strong’s <em>Cyclopædia</em> (1882) says, under ‘Genealogy” (page 773, col. 2, of Volume III): “Grotius . . . supposes that Luke traces the NATURAL Pedigree of Christ, and Matthew the LEGAL. This he argues on two grounds: . . . Dr. Barrett . . . states his own hypothesis, viz., that Matthew relates the genealogy of Joseph, and Luke that of Mary. He supposes a sufficient reason, that after Matthew had given his genealogical table another should be added by Luke, fully to prove that Christ, according to the flesh, derived his descent from David, not only by his supposed father Joseph, but also by his real mother Mary. . . . In constructing their genealogical tables, it is well known that the Jews reckoned wholly by males, rejecting where the blood of the grandfather passed to the grandson through a daughter, the name of the daughter herself, and counting that daughter’s husband for the son of the maternal grandfather (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950485/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Numbers 26:33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950485/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 27:4-7</a>) . . . The evangelist Luke has critically distinguished the REAL from the LEGAL genealogy by a parenthetical remark: ‘Jesus being (as was reputed) the son of Joseph (but in reality) the son of Heli,’ or his grandson by his mother’s side.”—page 774, col. 1.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">If Mary told her husband Joseph that the angel Gabriel had advised her that God would give her son Jesus the throne of his father David (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950485/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 1:32</a>), then we can be sure that Joseph, who proved himself a godly, obedient man, would readily adopt Jesus as his legal heir as concerns his interests in the title to the throne of David. <em>The Watchtower</em> said Joseph <em>could</em> do this, because the Bible does not directly state or record that he did so, though this is implied. But by natural birth through David’s great-granddaughter Mary Jesus was naturally the “son of David”, and thus naturally Jesus inherited rights to the throne of David; it was in full harmony with Jesus’ NATURAL descent from David that Gabriel could tell Mary that God would give Jesus the throne of his NATURAL father David.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In the Bible genealogies that seem dry to the average reader are very important; God would not have cluttered up his Word with genealogies if they were not important, especially this one on David’s line. Ofttimes a point that seems small and insignificant is very important and vital, but may be entirely overlooked by the superficial, reader. Hence <em>The Watchtower</em> went, as you say, “so far afield in his attempt to prove a point that needs no proof.” God gives attention to and is faithful to fine points, and it magnifies him to bring out these fine points and show how accurate he is. Hence it was a real requirement for Jesus to become the “son of David.” that he be a NATURAL descendant of that ancient king. If Jesus had been of another family than David’s, the mere anointing of Jesus with the holy spirit would not have made him the “son of David”. His consecrated followers are also anointed with holy spirit to reign with him, but these are not spoken of as “sons of David” in Scripture; they have a connection with David only as they become members of Christ’s body. No genealogy is given of King Melchizedek, but Jesus, because he was anointed with holy spirit, is not Scripturally spoken of as the “son of Melchizedek”, but by God’s oath he is made a “priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek”. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950485/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 110:4</a>) Correspondingly Jesus, in being the “seed of Abraham”, was also naturally a descendant of the patriarch. All these things add to the proof of Jesus’ identity.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sj">Sincerely yours,</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sj">WATCH TOWER BIBLE &amp; TRACT SOCIETY</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"></p>

How? Well, with the dead bodies of these opposers and fighters against Jehovah’s universal sovereignty he purposed to make a gory feast for “all the birds that fly in midheaven.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101975075/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Revelation 19:17, 18</a>) The bodies of the slain will not molder in honorable burial places.

So it is reasonable to expect that God will dispose of excess bodies by other means.</p>

If your sons will keep my covenant and my reminders that I shall teach them, their sons also forever will sit upon your throne.’ For Jehovah has chosen Zion; he has longed for it as a dwelling for himself: ‘ . . .

In this way he, although David’s son, would become David’s Lord. He could become David’s Lord only by becoming a heavenly King, seated at God’s right hand in the heavens. He would become a priest for David, and since David was only a king but no priest, Jesus would again become more than David; he would become a King-Priest like ancient Melchizedek, king of Salem.</p><p id="p89" data-pid="89" class="qu">29.

Nineteen centuries ago seems like long, long ago to us, but to the beginningless, endless Jehovah God, to whom a thousand of our years are as but one day, nineteen hundred years ago is as less than two days ago. More than ever the actions of all the nations since the year 1914 call for the settling of the supreme issue, the vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty over earth as well as heaven. To that end there is the present need of the royal government of his King like Melchizedek.</p>

If Christ is at Jehovah’s right hand, would that not mean that Jehovah is at Christ’s left?—R. C., Australia.</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955491/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 110</a> views Jehovah as speaking to Christ, Jehovah being referred to in the third person and Christ in the second person. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955491/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps 110 Verse 1</a> (<em>AS</em>) reads: “Jehovah saith unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand.” <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955491/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps 110 Verse 5</a> states: “The Lord at thy right hand will strike through kings in the day of his wrath.” “Thou” and “thy” refer to Christ, so “Lord” in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955491/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps 110 verse 5</a> refers to the Lord Jehovah. Hence the psalm does first speak of Christ as at Jehovah’s right hand, then later refers to Jehovah as being at Christ’s right hand.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">However, being at the right hand does not necessarily mean literal location, any more than do Jesus’ illustrative words mean the sheep are now literally always located at his right and the goats literally at the left. It is no more literal than is the sitting position mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955491/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 110:1</a>. Jesus did not literally sit from the time of his resurrection and ascension to heaven until 1914, when he stood up as the enthroned King. The sitting position merely meant that he was inactive as far as assuming the kingly duties is concerned. Also, the right-hand position is not necessarily to be viewed as literal, but symbolical. The right side indicates the place of preference, of excellence, of favor and approval. The left-hand position, as in the illustration of the sheep and goats, is the side of disapproval and disfavor. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955491/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 10:2</a> expresses the sense, when it says: “A wise man’s heart is at his right hand; but a fool’s heart at his left.” Or, “The wise man’s mind makes for his success; the fool’s mind makes for his failure.” (<em>AT</em>) Here the right represents success, the left failure. It would be absurd to try to apply this text to the literal heart position, for it is to the left, whether the person is wise or a fool. Following this rule of excellence of the right hand, the aged Jacob laid his right hand upon Joseph’s younger son Ephraim and gave him the superior farewell blessing, while he laid his left hand upon the older boy Manasseh and gave him an inferior blessing. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955491/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Gen. 48:14-20</a>) In harmony with this, Christ Jesus himself is prophetically pictured as saying to his heavenly Father: “In thy presence is fulness of joy; in thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955491/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 16:11</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Therefore, when we do not try to take a literal view of matters there is no difficulty in Jehovah and Christ’s being at each other’s right hand, as shown at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955491/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 110:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955491/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 5</a>. Each has the position of preference and excellence with the other.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>● At</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955491/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 7:9</strong></a> <strong>Paul talks as though he once lived before the law covenant existed, and that he was living when it started. Since that was centuries before his lifetime, how are Paul’s words to be understood?—D. S., United States.</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Paul’s argument is that the law, by making sin known, made the sinfulness of men manifest. It convicted them as being sinners, and sin merited death. So the law brought sin to life and made those under the law deserving of death. An imperfect man, unable to keep the law perfectly, was convicted as a sinner and worthy of death. It is in this setting that Paul wrote, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955491/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Romans 7:9</a> (<em>NW</em>): “I was once alive apart from law; but when the commandment arrived, sin came to life again, but I died.” Before the law was given he speaks of himself as alive, but when the law came into effect it brought sin to life and it convicted him to death.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">But how could this be true in the case of the apostle Paul? The law covenant went into effect fifteen centuries before he was born. He was not “alive apart from law” or living when the law arrived. However, Paul was a fleshly descendant of Abraham, to whom God said: “In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955491/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Gen. 22:18</a>) Abraham was God’s friend and was justified in God’s sight because of his faith. While yet unborn in the loins of Abraham, Paul had a hope of life through faith. But 330 years after Abraham died, the law covenant was added to the divine promise made to Abraham. This law covenant made it plainly appear that Abraham’s fleshly descendants, the twelve tribes of Israel, were sinners and transgressors. <span id="page415" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="415" data-before-text="415"></span>Paul was born under this law covenant, and he being unable to justify himself to life by the works of the law covenant, his hope of life by it died.</p>

How? Well, with the dead bodies of these opposers and fighters against Jehovah’s universal sovereignty he purposed to make a gory feast for “all the birds that fly in midheaven.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101975075/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Revelation 19:17, 18</a>) The bodies of the slain will not molder in honorable burial places.

He will execute judgment among the nations; he will cause a fullness of dead bodies.” Or: “smashing their skulls, he heaps the wide world with corpses.” (<em>Je</em>) Quite evidently there will be many more bodies strewn over the earth as a result of the war at Har–Magedon than there will be scavenger birds enough to dispose of them all in a reasonable time for human health reasons. So it is reasonable to expect that God will dispose of excess bodies by other means.</p>

He set sun, earth, and moon in place, all in proper relation one to another, so that our earth is provided with warmth and light, night and day, the seasons and the tides.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 5.

Also, much has been learned about the fine-tuning of natural forces in the universe. Thus, in an article entitled “The Designed ‘Just So’ Universe,” a professor of mechanical engineering observed: “It is quite easy to understand why so many scientists have changed their minds in the past 30 years, agreeing that it takes a great deal of faith to believe the universe can be explained as nothing more than a fortuitous cosmic accident.

There is, for example, the miracle involved in the God-given abilities of speaking and listening, as well as those of writing and reading. Many people have those abilities. You also have a wondrous masterpiece of construction​—the upright human frame. Why, the design and balance of your body, its mechanical functions and its chemistry, inspire awe. Beyond that, the amazing nerve connections that enable your mind and your senses to function find no parallel in what scientists have achieved. In fact, human achievements are possible only because of the mind and senses with which mankind is endowed. Even the most trained and capable engineer could not have manufactured anything as beautiful and useful as the ten marvelously designed levers​—your fingers and thumbs. Ask yourself, ‘Could impressive works of art and construction have been made without the skillful use of God-given fingers?’</p>

Jehovah promised to bless Abraham’s seed and said that they would take possession of the gate of their enemies. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009202/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Gen. 22:17, 18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009202/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Ps. 105:8, 9</a>) In the initial outworking of those promises, Abraham’s seed became the nation of Israel. That nation was long enslaved in Egypt, but then “God remembered his covenant with Abraham” and delivered them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009202/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ex. 2:24</a>) Jehovah’s subsequent dealings with them show just how generous he is.

More than 1,500 years after he delivered the Israelites from Egypt, God sent his only-begotten Son to earth. The majority of the Jews rejected Jesus and allowed him to be executed. Then Jehovah formed a new nation, a spiritual one, “the Israel of God.” Along with Christ, that nation makes up the spiritual seed of Abraham, which Jehovah foretold he would use to bless mankind.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009202/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Gal. 3:16,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009202/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009202/16/2" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 6:16</a>.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">11.

<strong>Christendom’s Spiritual Famine</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Tithing or the giving of one tenth of one’s income applied only to the Jews. It was one of the decrees in the Law of Moses. By his death Christ abolished that Law so that not even Jewish Christians are <span id="page242" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="242" data-before-text="242"></span>obliged to keep the decrees such as tithing. Says the Bible: “By means of his flesh he abolished the hatred, the Law of commandments consisting in decrees.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957282/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eph. 2:15</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Nor is the passing of a collection plate the Christian way. We remember how Jesus once observed a widow dropping two small coins into the treasury chest in the temple. But this chest was not passed around; it was fixed.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The use of bingo, raffles and other gambling methods is contrary to the Bible rule for Christians: “We have renounced the underhanded things of which to be ashamed.” When the Israelites began sacrificing to some of the pagan deities of gambling, God told them: “Ye that forsake Jehovah, . . . that prepare a table for Fortune, and that fill up mingled wine unto Destiny; I will destine you to the sword.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957282/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:2</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957282/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isa. 65:11, 12</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">By stressing money raising and neglecting spiritual food, the clergy have brought about a situation that is similar to the time in Israel when God’s prophet said: “The priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet they lean upon Jehovah, and say, Is not Jehovah in the midst of us?” Jesus’ words to those who used God’s temple for commercial purposes are apt today: “‘My house will be called a house of prayer,’ but you are making it a cave of robbers.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957282/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mic. 3:11</a>, <em>AS;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957282/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 21:13</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sn"><strong>When clergymen take honorary titles such as “Father” and “Reverend,” are they following the Bible’s example?</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The use of honorary titles shows how the clergy have turned away from using the Bible as their guidebook, for nowhere in the Bible does a Christian call himself “reverend.” Only once in the King James Bible does the word “reverend” occur. Then it is applied to God alone: “Holy and reverend is his name.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957282/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 111:9</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The use of the honorary title “Father” came up in Jesus’ day. As found in the Knox Catholic translation of the Bible, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957282/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 23:8, 9</a>, Christ laid down the rule for all true Christians to follow: “You are not to claim the title of Rabbi; you have but one Master, and you are all brethren alike. Nor are you to call any man on earth your father; you have but one Father, and he is in heaven.”</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn"><strong>Should Christendom’s clergy participate in political affairs and controversies of the nations?</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">By dispensing political fodder and mixing in politics the clergy have exposed their flocks to a spiritual famine. Christ never served politics as spiritual food; he even refused a popular draft to make him political leader: “Jesus, realizing they were about to come and seize him to make him king, withdrew again into the mountain all alone.” Christ’s reason was clear: “I am no part of the world.” “My kingdom is no part of this world.” So true worship is, as the Bible says, “to keep oneself without spot from the world.” The clergy mix in politics and even ask God’s blessing on armies and navies. But God’s Word declares: “Adulteresses, do you not know that the friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever, therefore, wants to be a friend of the world is constituting himself an enemy of God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957282/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 6:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957282/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 17:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957282/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 18:36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957282/10/3" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> Jas. 1:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957282/10/4" data-bid="11-5" class="b"> 4:4</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sn"><strong>When clergymen and parishioners pray for this world, are they following Christ’s example?</strong></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Even in prayer the clergy are not serving spiritual food. The clergy pray for this world. But Christ prayed: “I make request, not concerning the world, but concerning those you have given me.” Why did Jesus not pray for this world? Because he knew that the Devil, not Jehovah <span id="page243" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="243" data-before-text="243"></span>God, is the god of this world, as the Bible clearly shows: “The god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers.” “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” Spiritually famished persons pray for this world, but Bible-fed Christians obey the Bible command: “Do not be loving either the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957282/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">John 17:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957282/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 4:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957282/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 1 John 5:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957282/11/3" data-bid="12-4" class="b"> 2:15</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p>

<strong>Do Christians Take Honorary Titles?</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Creature-flattering titles make men look lofty in the eyes of other men. They arouse fear of men. They take away from the fear of Jehovah God. This disgusts God. How do we know? The authority is none other than God’s own Son who told the title-craving <span id="page262" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="262" data-before-text="262"></span>Pharisees: “You are those who declare yourselves righteous before men, but God knows your hearts; because what is lofty among men is a disgusting thing in God’s sight.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955321/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 16:15</a>, <em>NW</em>) How disgusting, then, it must be to Almighty God when men flatter one another with a title such as “Reverend”—one of the most popular honorary titles in Christendom!</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Really, is any man worthy of the designation “Reverend”? The way to answer this question is to go to the Bible. Do we find any examples of a man’s being called “Reverend”? Not one! In fact, the word “reverend” occurs in the King James, the American Standard and the Rotherham Version Bible just once; and then it is applied only to Jehovah God: “Holy and reverend is his name.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955321/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 111:9</a>, <em>AS</em>) Yet today clergymen arrogate to themselves a term applying only to God. And even “Reverend,” for many clergymen, does not sound illustrious enough, so they embellish it and call themselves “Right Reverend,” “Very Reverend” or “Most Right Reverend.” Can you honestly picture in your mind Christ Jesus in a long, flowing ecclesiastical robe warmly receiving from his followers high-sounding titles? In truth, it would be difficult to discover in all history any person whose life record and personal habits conflicted more openly with ecclesiastical display than Jesus of Nazareth! Declared Jesus: “I do not accept glory from men.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955321/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 5:41</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">It would have been a disgusting thing in God’s sight had Jesus accepted the honorary titles that were in vogue in his day. Do you know what happened when anyone tried to dub Jesus with an honorary title? Let us go to the Bible: “A certain ruler questioned him, saying: ‘Good Teacher, by doing what shall I inherit everlasting life?’ Jesus said to him: ‘Why do you call me good? Nobody is good, except one, God.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955321/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Luke 18:18, 19</a>, <em>NW</em>) Why did Jesus, who certainly was a teacher and of all men one who could qualify as good, rebuke the man for calling him “Good Teacher”? Because he was using “Good Teacher” as a formalistic title, for in his heart he did not really believe that Jesus was a good teacher; otherwise he would have accepted Jesus’ teaching. But he spurned Jesus’ counsel. He deserved the rebuke, a rebuke that unquestionably showed honorary titles do not befit Christians.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>THE TITLE “FATHER”</strong></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Did you ever read in the Bible of one Christian’s calling another “Father” as an honorary title? Search as diligently as you can, and you will find that not even the apostles bore the title “Father.” No authority for using the title “Father” for Christians is given in the Scriptures. Indeed, the title is expressly condemned! By whom? By Christ himself! Speaking of the title-loving clergy of his day, Jesus said: “They like the most prominent place at evening meals and the front seats in the synagogues, and the greetings in the marketplaces and to be called ‘Rabbi’ [“My great one; My excellent one,” <em>footnote</em>] by men. But you, do not you be called ‘Rabbi’, for one is your teacher, whereas all you are brothers. Moreover, do not call anyone your father on earth, for One is your Father, the heavenly One.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955321/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 23:6-9</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Did Jesus mean what he said? Certainly! He was not uttering idle words. Does it take a mental giant to understand his command? No, his words need no special interpretation, for Jesus was speaking no parable. He was giving clear-cut instructions about creature-exalting titles: “Do not call anyone your father on earth.”</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The Roman Catholic clergy water down the force of Jesus’ command by saying that his words cannot be taken literally, otherwise <span id="page263" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="263" data-before-text="263"></span>we could not call our male parent “father.” Is their reasoning sound? Hardly! Read the context. From the setting it is unmistakably clear that Jesus was not condemning the use of “father” for the male parent, for he himself repeatedly referred to the male parent as “father.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955321/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 15:4-6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955321/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 19:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955321/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 21:31</a>) His condemnation was of the honorary title.</p>

<strong>The Triumph of Clean, Undefiled Worship</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Let us all understand this matter clearly, the way the true God gives us to understand it: There can be no compromise between true Christianity and the religion of this world. Before bringing the Israelites into the land of Palestine which he had promised them, God made this matter perfectly clear to them. At the beginning of their forty-year journey there he said to them: “In all things that I have said unto you take ye heed: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth. . . . I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee. Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods. They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me; for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.” In the face of that divine statement who <span id="page661" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="661" data-before-text="661"></span>can object to the slogan that false, worldly religion is a snare and is worked as a racket?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Jehovah successfully brought the Israelites into the Promised Land and cleared many of their pagan enemies out of it. Then his servant Joshua, the successor of Moses, saw good, now that he was old and about to pass off the scene, to remind them of Jehovah’s refusal to compromise with the religion of his enemies. Joshua commanded them: “That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow down yourselves unto them; but cleave unto Jehovah your God, as ye have done unto this day.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951805/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ex. 23:13,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951805/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 31-33 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951805/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> Josh. 23:7, 8</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">18, 19.

That principle or rule of action holds true for God’s true people today, for the things that had to do with the natural Israelites of old serve as a warning example to us who are living at the end of Christendom’s system of things. Let Christendom go on indulging in such compromises with the gods of paganism and with the blasphemies against the truth of Jehovah God. As, for instance, when non-Catholic countries send ambassadors, ministers or chargés d’affaires to the court of Vatican City and these, though not Roman Catholics, are obliged to bend the knee or bow to the pope and address him as “Your Holiness”. When Protestant and Jewish politicians electioneer in order to win over the Catholic vote, they, too, take up the titles of the Catholic god and call him “Holy Father”. When commercial radio announcers, in order to tickle the ears of their Catholic audience, comment on the activities of the Roman Hierarchy, they address them as “Reverend”, “His Reverence,” “Father,” etc., so glorifying the mighty ones of sectarianism.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951805/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isaiah 57:15</a> (<em>Dy</em>) Jehovah God says: “Thus saith the High and the Eminent that inhabiteth eternity: and his name is Holy.” To Jehovah God alone Jesus addressed the words: “Holy Father, keep them in thy name whom thou hast given me.” And to his disciples he said: “Call none your father upon earth; for one is your father, who is in heaven.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951805/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">John 17:11 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951805/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Matt. 23:9</a>, <em>Dy</em>) And only once do Protestants find in their King James Version and American Standard Version Bibles the word “reverend”, and there it is applied to Jehovah God, in these words: “Holy and reverend is his name.

Wisdom is the ability to use knowledge successfully to solve problems, ward off danger, and attain certain goals. It involves sound judgment. The beginning, the first part, the foundation of such wisdom, is the fear of Jehovah. Why? Because all creation is the work of his hands. It is dependent on him. He endowed humankind with free will but not with the ability to direct their own steps successfully apart from his guidance.

<strong>How Real Is God to You?</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">If God is truly real to us, his very qualities will cause us to fear to displease him. The Bible says that “the fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom” and that it “means the hating of bad.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981122/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 111:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981122/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Prov. 8:13</a>) Does this mean having merely a reverential fear of Jehovah? Does it mean more than simply having a wholesome respect for God? We can have a <span id="page7" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>reverential fear of those in divinely appointed positions of responsibility and we can have a wholesome respect for all honest persons. But to have the fear of Jehovah means far more than that. The apostle Paul writes: “Let us continue to have undeserved kindness, through which we may acceptably render God sacred service with godly fear and awe. For our God is a consuming fire.” That fact should surely make us careful not to incur God’s displeasure, for to do so would mean that we would be in danger of being consumed by him!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981122/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Heb. 12:28, 29</a>.</p>

<strong>Humbly Conform to Jehovah’s Way for Salvation</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Humility is a quality that can be cultivated. First of all, a person must have the desire to be humble. This inclination is certainly enhanced by reading the Bible. In it we learn that “God opposes the haughty ones, but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974485/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jas. 4:6</a>) We come to appreciate that Jehovah wants us “to be humble in walking with” him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974485/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Mic. 6:8</a>, <em>NW,</em> 1960 edition) So our desire to please God makes us want to develop the quality of humility.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 6.

We are to have a proper fear of him, that is, an awesome respect, a fear to displease him, knowing that what he requires of us is right.

<strong>Fear of God’s Anger is Wisdom</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">It is to our interest, therefore, to consider the nature, that is, the characteristics or basic principles of God’s anger, how he manifests it, and why and how God’s anger can be harmonized with his being love. Then, too, we can appreciate more clearly why fearing God, that is, fearing to displease him or to arouse his righteous anger, is truly the course of wisdom.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971441/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 111:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971441/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Prov. 9:10</a>.</p>

How could the psalm thus apply? Will any unprejudiced person claim that the natural Jews or Israelites are a happy people, an outstandingly happy people, because some of them in various lands do enjoy a material prosperity and prominence? Are they even happy religiously? The true-to-fact answer must be No! There is a vital, critical reason why they do not fulfill the description of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 112</a>: it is because they neither fear Jehovah nor keep his commandments but persist in hiding his very name and trust in human traditions and follow the commandments of men in place of the Word and the commandments of the one living and true God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 15:1-9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Isa. 29:13, 14</a>) Who, then, is the class of people, the collective “man” of our day, to whom <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 112</a> points prophetically? We are not left to ourselves to make an answer that might call forth the indignant cry of partiality, racial prejudice or national pride! The divine Inspirer of the psalm himself supplies the unerring answer, using one of his writers of the Bible to quote from this psalm and apply it to the class of people whom God himself had in mind. It is the spiritual Israelites, those who are Jews inwardly, of whom there is a remnant of some thousands yet on earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rom. 2:28, 29</a>) In 1931, that they might be correctly identified before all the world, they embraced the name marked out in the Holy Bible and that has since become notable throughout the earth, Jehovah’s witnesses.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Cor. 9:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Ps. 112:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Isa. 43:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/10/3" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 12</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 5.

O the happiness of one fearing Jehovah, in His commands he hath delighted greatly.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 112:1</a>, <em>Yg</em>) According to this, Jehovah’s witnesses should be the happiest people on earth in 1955 and ever after. And is their happiness really such as to excite comment like that of the psalmist? Yes. Never was the world more unhappy, for it is in its “time of the end” and it looks forward in dread of what it sees coming. Never have Jehovah’s witnesses been happier, for they know from the prophecies of God’s Word that they are living in the “time of the end” of this joyless world, now that God’s kingdom for which they have long prayed has been set up in the hands of Jesus Christ, who is at the right hand of God in the heavens.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 21:28</a>.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 6. With what attribute is their happiness associated, and why?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Their happiness is not of a frivolous kind; it has a solid foundation. It is associated with the highest wisdom, the wisdom that is from above. It is because they fear Jehovah that they have this heavenly wisdom. The psalm preceding the one we are considering closes with the words: “The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 111:10</a>, <em>AS</em>) Some understand the expression “beginning of wisdom” to mean the principal thing, the crowning feature, of all true wisdom. Fearing Jehovah begins real wisdom; we must have that fear of our Creator at the very start and we must retain that fear of him uppermost always.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 7. (a) What does fear of Jehovah do as respects the fear of man? (b) How is his name to be treated, and by whom is it so treated?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Having that fear makes it impossible that we fear man, for the fear of both at the same time cannot exist. The fear of the One makes a person wise for gaining everlasting life in the endless new world; the fear of the other is a foolishness that ends with the fool’s everlasting destruction in Gehenna. The most fearless man ever on earth said to his disciples: “Do <span id="page750" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="750" data-before-text="750"></span>not become fearful of those who kill the body but can not kill the soul; but rather be in fear of him that can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 10:28</a>, <em>NW</em>) So fear of Jehovah counteracts and removes the fear of man and devil or of what these can do to us by God’s permission. Jehovah’s witnesses recognize Him as reverend, that is, as the one to be feared, and they bear and utter his name in a reverent manner. As the psalm preceding the one now under examination says: “Holy and reverend is his name.” Or, “Holy and to be revered is his name.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 111:9</a>, <em>AS; Ro; RoPss</em>) His is a “glorious and fear-inspiring name,” and it is because so-called “Christendom” as well as Jewry does not fear his name and carry out his law that it suffers the way it does. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Deut. 28:58, 59</a>, <em>NW</em>) Jehovah has assigned great achievements and fear-inspiring things to his name. All peoples ought to praise it, but his holy name is respected as reverend and fear-inspiring only by men of good will among all the peoples and nations.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Chron. 17:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Ps. 99:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/17/2" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> Mal. 1:14</a>, <em>Yg; Ro.</em></p>

<strong>Conquer Your Fears!</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The last two global wars were fought presumably to remedy the basic cause for fears. But alas!

To science goes the glory for the gutted cities, the maimed soldiers, the tortured women and children, the death of millions. Certainly it will take science a long, long time to save as many lives as it has destroyed and may yet destroy in this present generation. Science is by no means the conqueror, but rather the creator, of fear. How true the saying, the scientific, social, political, commercial, military and religious leaders of this world promise the people freedom from fear, while at the same time they themselves are slaves of corruption and fear!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951440/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Pet. 2:19</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Now, is there no remedy? No escape from these killing and fearful conditions? Indeed there is, but not in the schemes of men. The great Teacher, Christ Jesus, extends the invitation: “Come to me, all you who are toiling and loaded down, and I will refresh you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951440/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 11:28</a>, <em>NW</em>) All who will sincerely accept this extension of mercy will have great peace of mind. “Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951440/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 26:3</a>) Such ones take up the song and jubilantly sing: “God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will we not fear.” “Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid: for Jehovah, even Jehovah, is my strength and song; and he is become my salvation.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951440/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 46:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951440/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Isa. 12:2</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">If you put full trust and confidence in Jehovah God, and refuse to rely on princely leaders of men or their armored chariots of war, you will not worry over world conditions or the threat of another global war. These are faithful sayings: “The fear of man bringeth a snare; but whoso putteth his trust in Jehovah shall be safe.” “In God have I put my trust, I will not be afraid; what can man do unto me?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951440/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 146:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951440/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Isa. 31:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951440/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Prov. 29:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951440/5/3" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> Ps. 56:11</a>, <em>AS</em>) By exercising faith in Jehovah and exhibiting love for his kingdom, you can conquer all worldly fears. “This is the conquest that has conquered the world, our faith.” “There is no fear in love, but perfect love throws fear outside, because fear exercises a restraint. Indeed, he that is under fear has not been made perfect in love.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951440/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 John 5:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951440/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 4:18</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Here is another secret for successfully overcoming worry: “The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951440/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 111:10</a>, <em>AS</em>) If you fear this Most High and Lofty One you will study his precious Word the Bible and you will obey his righteous commandments. “You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951440/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 8:32</a>, <em>NW</em>) In turn, this not only will give you peace of mind now, but will lead you toward the new system of things which will shortly replace the present, where boundless freedom from every sort of fear will be yours forever and ever.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Just think of it! No more sighing, no more crying, no more dying. No fear of cold and hot wars. No fear of inflations or depressions. A beautiful paradise full of peace, goodness, love and joy. A new world over which Jehovah God will reign supreme! Hope placed in such removes all fear over the collapse and destruction of the present satanic system.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"></p>

This suggests that <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009203/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 112</a> can refer to a composite group made up of many individuals.

They take “very much delight” in studying God’s Word and in obeying his commandments. That includes the command to preach the good news of the Kingdom throughout the earth.

As a group, those with an earthly hope will be preserved through the coming “great tribulation” to form “a new earth” in which “righteousness is to dwell.” In time, Armageddon survivors “will be blessed” even more. They will be on hand to welcome back millions of resurrected ones. What a thrilling prospect! Eventually, those who take “very much delight” in God’s commandments will grow to human perfection and enjoy forever “the glorious freedom of the children of God.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009203/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009203/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Rom. 8:21</a>.</p>

<strong>How Your Life Can Have Greater Meaning</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Is that a bad thing? No, for awareness that our conduct matters to God adds meaning to our lives. It encourages us to be better individuals​—certainly a worthwhile goal. “Happy is the man in fear of Jehovah, in whose commandments he has taken very much delight,” says <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000521/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 112:1</a>. Reverential fear of God and heartfelt obedience to his commandments can give our lives greater meaning.</p>

She had become involved in all types of illicit sex, as well as spiritism and stealing. She then began to study the Bible and saw the need to listen to and fear Jehovah. She says: “Knowing Jehovah is the best thing that has happened to me. Jehovah helped me so much in finding the truth and happiness. I feel I owe so much to him because he opened my eyes and gave me the chance really to think and find him. I now want to help other people find this happiness.”</p>

<strong>Meeting the Divine Requirement of Obedience</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> The dictionary defines obedience in this way: “Act or fact of obeying, or state of being obedient.” To obey is “to be ruled or controlled by; to follow the guidance, operation, etc. of; as, to obey reason; to obey the law of gravitation.” The Bible has a way of <span id="page426" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="426" data-before-text="426"></span>putting it: “The conclusion of the matter, everything having been heard, is: Fear the true God and keep his commandments.

Still we obey the laws concerning gravity, and every day of our short life we have a fearful respect for this force. We do it as a part of living, accepting it, and rarely do you hear anyone complain; yet it is rigid and exacting. If we would understand God’s requirements as well as we do gravity’s operation, we would find <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1970522/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 112:1</a> describing our attitude: “Happy is the man in fear of Jehovah, in whose commandments he has taken very much delight.”</p>

This fills the congregations with such a colorful variety, people with the refreshing quality of being unafraid to be their natural, uninhibited selves. One of the enjoyments of young children is their lack of fear of what others think of them. Jesus loved children and their ways.

Do we want to be happy? We can be. How? There are twenty-four happinesses or beatitudes in the Psalms that tell us the secret of how to be happy with the happiness that will never end. It is instructive for us to hear some of these beatitudes! The very book of Psalms opens with a beatitude, “Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked ones, and in the way of sinners has not stood and in the seat of ridiculers has not sat. But his delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1, 2</a>) The beatitude in the Second Psalm is one that not only world rulers but all of us under the shadow of Armageddon ought to heed: “Serve Jehovah with fear and be joyful with trembling. Kiss the son, that He may not become incensed and you may not perish [from] the way, for his anger flares up easily. Happy are all those taking refuge in him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Ps. 2:11, 12</a>.</p><p id="p98" data-pid="98" class="qu">38.

There is every reason for you to do so if you are a fearer of the One most high over all the earth, the God who alone has the name Jehovah. By practicing the fear of him you can entertain the best of prospects for 1955 and for all the years ahead, prospects of prosperity with happiness. That means a prosperity that will benefit you in heart as well as body and mind, for it is a spiritual prosperity that gives happiness now and leads to endless happy life in the righteous new world, the foundation for which God has now laid. When we come to know and appreciate that real prosperity with happiness comes from Jehovah God and is guaranteed to those who fear him, we cannot hold back from exclaiming “Hallelujah!” for that cry means “Praise Jehovah!”</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 2. How does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/69/0" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Psalm 112</a> open, and what marks it as unusual?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> “Hallelujah. Happy is the man that feareth the LORD, that greatly delighteth in his commandments.” That is the way the inspired song, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 112</a>, opens, according to the translation by a Jewish scholar of the last century.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1954923/0">a</a> “Hallelujah.

Another thing that marks this psalm as unusual is that it is an alphabetic psalm or acrostic psalm, in which each of its lines begins with a letter of the Hebrew alphabet of twenty-two characters in their regular order. Thus there are twenty-two lines to the psalm. Two letters of the Hebrew alphabet serve as initial letters to each of the first eight verses and three as initials to each of the last two verses. In this respect it is like the preceding psalm and it is its twin in structure.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 3.

It points forward and identifies the happy man or class of men in our own time. That is, it foretells not merely one individual, but a man in a collective sense, a composite man made up of many members who are alike happy for a common reason. Are you a member of this happy collective “man”? Or are you keeping company with this “man” in the most pleasant of companionships? To know, consider the psalm.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 4.

How could the psalm thus apply? Will any unprejudiced person claim that the natural Jews or Israelites are a happy people, an outstandingly happy people, because some of them in various lands do enjoy a material prosperity and prominence? Are they even happy religiously? The true-to-fact answer must be No! There is a vital, critical reason why they do not fulfill the description of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 112</a>: it is because they neither fear Jehovah nor keep his commandments but persist in hiding his very name and trust in human traditions and follow the commandments of men in place of the Word and the commandments of the one living and true God.

We are not left to ourselves to make an answer that might call forth the indignant cry of partiality, racial prejudice or national pride! The divine Inspirer of the psalm himself supplies the unerring answer, using one of his writers of the Bible to quote from this psalm and apply it to the class of people whom God himself had in mind. It is the spiritual Israelites, those who are Jews inwardly, of whom there is a remnant of some thousands yet on earth.

Their everlasting destiny is in this earth cleansed and everywhere made a “garden of Eden” or “paradise of delight.” They will remain in it for all time. They become mighty in it, but not just automatically. No, but because the Jehovah-fearing spiritual remnant have ‘become their father through the good news.’ This remnant have preached to them the good news concerning the Kingdom and now they obey Jehovah’s command to inculcate his words in this seed of theirs.

Hence the upright ones are those spiritual Christians who form the Jehovah-fearing “man.” The remnant still on earth of this “man” are part of the “seed of Abraham” in whom all the families of the earth are to bless themselves. Already the remnant have become a means of blessing to this rising generation of “other sheep.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ps. 71:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 145:4</a>) As they are an “upright” class, the seed or generation that they father stand in direct line for a blessing. “All the day he is gracious and lending, and his seed is for a blessing.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ps. 37:26</a>, <em>Yg</em>) But remember, too, that the seed or generation of the upright ones are prospective children of the “Everlasting Father,” Jesus Christ, who is primarily the Abrahamic seed of blessing.

Maintaining their Jehovah-fearing integrity during that trialsome “little while,” they will be blessed with receiving at Jehovah’s hand the grant of the right to everlasting happiness in the earthly paradise.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Matt. 25:40;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> Rev. 20:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/34/2" data-bid="35-3" class="b"> 7-15</a>, <em>NW.</em></p>

Due to the great number of them now within the New World society, into which they have flocked in their hundreds of thousands, they already occupy a strong position in the earth.

The only thing that will work for deliverance from death and destruction by Jehovah’s executional forces then will be his righteousness.

He has the treasure of the ministry or service of God’s Word; and what on earth could be more honorable than that? He stores up treasures in heaven by living and working to gain God’s approval and blessing and a worthiness to receive the fulfillment of God’s promises. He lays up a foundation for what are riches in the new world. He is “safely treasuring up for [himself] a right foundation for the future, in order that [he] may get a firm hold on the real life.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:17-19</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Matt. 6:20, 21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/41/1" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> Rom. 8:15-17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/41/2" data-bid="42-3" class="b"> 2 Cor. 4:1-8</a>.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">16.

It means that the results of his righteous acts will be permanent, not being wiped out at Armageddon, whereas the works of this wicked world will be burned up in that war and their effects be completely obliterated. By sticking to righteousness he keeps his integrity toward Jehovah, whom he fears, and by his being preserved for life in the New World righteousness is preserved in the earth, where we pray that God’s will may be done the same as it is up in heaven. The earth as God’s creation is properly the place for righteousness. The way of the defiers of Jehovah will vanish and their wickedness will vanish from the earth.

For instance, the <em>American Standard Version</em> renders it: “Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is gracious, and merciful, and righteous.” Historically, this was true of the spiritual remnant in 1919. At that time they were lying in the darkness of bondage and oppression under the great organization of darkness, mystic Babylon. They had been taken into captivity to the nations of this world during the years of World War I and deprived of their right of freely and fearlessly worshiping God according to his Word. The darkness of religious misunderstanding and of this captive condition was dispelled in 1919, when Jehovah God rose as a light to them and sent his Son Jesus Christ to free them from this spiritually killing bondage in Babylon and to put them back in their proper place and freedom inside God’s organization as his fearless witnesses. The prophet Micah had been used to foretell this: “Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy [Babylon]: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, Jehovah will be a light unto me.

Thus various other renderings of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Ps 112 verse 4</a> by other competent translators read as follows: “He hath arisen in darkness a light to the upright.” (<em>RoPss</em>) “Unto the upright he shineth as a light in the darkness.” (<em>Soncino</em>) “For the upright ones he arises [as] a light in the darkness.” (<em>C. Kautzsch,</em> German) “In the midst of the darkness he arises like a light for the upright hearts.” (<em>Maredsous,</em> French) “As a light in darkness he shines for the good.” (<em>Bover-Cantera,</em> Spanish) “In the darkness he beams as the light for the upright ones.” (<em>Nácar-Colunga,</em> Spanish) The “man” that meets this description is under obligation to do as Jesus said: “You are the light of the world. . . .

Some give in a patronizing or begrudging way. It is not pleasant to receive help from one who makes you feel inferior or who makes you feel that you are a nuisance or a burden. By contrast, how refreshing it is to receive help from someone who is gracious. Jehovah is the outstanding example of a gracious, happy Giver.

For <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Ps 111 verse 4</a> of the preceding psalm says: “Jehovah is gracious and merciful.” (<em>AS</em>) And Jehovah, when declaring his name to Moses at Mount Sinai in Arabia, himself said: “Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and gracious.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Ex. 34:6</a>, <em>NW</em>) The man that fears him copies him in these qualities by exercising them toward others. We need to exercise these qualities toward others, even as the heavenly Father did to us: “You must accordingly be complete, as your heavenly Father is complete.” “Continue becoming compassionate, just as your Father is compassionate.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Matt. 5:48;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/57/1" data-bid="58-2" class="b"> Luke 6:36</a>, <em>NW</em>) The fearer of Jehovah can copy him and display these qualities closely by endeavoring to enlighten the bedarkened “other sheep” and bringing them to the theocratic organization of light. However, he must also be gracious and merciful to his own brothers within the New World society, that all there may get along together in peace, harmony, purity and mutual helpfulness.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/58/0" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Eph. 4:1-3</a>.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">21.

The goodness of any of his creatures, including Jesus Christ himself, must all be borrowed from Jehovah God. Jesus himself said so, when he rejected the title “Good Teacher” by saying: “Why do you call me good? Nobody is good, except one, God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Luke 18:18, 19</a>, <em>NW; AS</em>) To the extent that the fearer of Jehovah copies him in kindness and generosity, he becomes good like him. “Good is the man—gracious and lending.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/60/0" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Ps. 112:5</a>, <em>Yg</em>) “The good man is gentle and gives.” (<em>Fenton</em>) Jehovah himself is gracious, gentle in dealing, undeservedly kind, and thus he gives to earth’s inhabitants, to wicked people and good, to righteous people and unrighteous. He is the Befriender of the poor and needy. The “man” that fears him makes it his aim to imitate him in these regards. He gives generously of his spiritual gifts, not expecting a material reward; and he does so gently, not trying to embarrass anyone, not threatening or reproaching or addressing in abusive terms even the ones that refuse the good news of the Kingdom unselfishly preached to them. He gives generously of the best thing he has to offer, the lifesaving Kingdom message. This course of action cannot help but mean blessing for his seed or generation, for it is by means of this very “good news” that he fathers this seed, even in his old age, so to speak. Long ago the <span id="page755" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="755" data-before-text="755"></span>psalmist stated the fact: “I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.

The Lord will laugh at him; for he seeth that his day is coming. For the arms of the wicked shall be broken; but Jehovah upholdeth the righteous.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 37:12, 13,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 17</a>, <em>AS</em>) It is wise to laugh fearlessly from this standpoint, for divine wisdom says to the heedless fools of this world: “I also will laugh in the day of your calamity; I will <span id="page759" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="759" data-before-text="759"></span>mock when your fear cometh; when your fear cometh as a storm, and your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish come upon you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Prov. 1:26, 27</a>, <em>AS</em>) So the present roar of the adversaries against us does not frighten us, but with loving, strong, healthy hearts braced on Jehovah we go forward unafraid bearing witness to his kingdom all the world over.

The apostle Paul quoted them and applied them to his fellow Christians at the time they were giving aid to their needy brothers in Christ. He said: “(Just as it is written: ‘He has made a distribution, he has given to those of little means, his righteousness continues forever.’ Now he that abundantly supplies seed to the sower and bread for eating will supply and multiply the seed for you to sow and will increase the products of your righteousness.) In everything you are being enriched for every kind of generosity.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Cor. 9:9-11</a>, <em>NW</em>) The generosity of the Jehovah-fearing Christian does not limit itself to giving material things to needy brothers, but concerns itself greatly with distributing the Kingdom news to all “men of good will,” the scattering abroad of the seed of Kingdom truth upon those whose hearts are like good, productive ground.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 9.

These are the kind of poor Jesus sent his followers to hunt and feed, saying: “You received free, give free.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 10:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 5:3</a>, <em>NW</em>) What they are able to “give free” must be the spiritual riches that God has bestowed upon them free, because, as regards material riches, God has chosen the “ones who are poor respecting the world to be rich in faith.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Jas. 2:5</a>, <em>NW</em>) By giving the Kingdom message instead of giving mere money or material things they reach those who are really “poor in spirit,” “conscious of their spiritual need,” rather than just the self-seeking poor of this world who do not care to belong to Jehovah. Thus the unappreciative worldly poor who prefer to belong to Satan the “god of this system of things” are screened out.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">10.

We never go without a compensation that more than repays us. Why not? In answering, the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 112:5</a> bear repeating: “Good is the man—gracious and lending.” (<em>Yg;</em> page 754, ¶21) It is to the poor and needy that the “man” lends, not only hoping for no interest on the loan from the poor receiver, but not hoping for any material return at all. From where, then, does his compensation come? Listen: “He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto Jehovah, and his good deed will he pay him again.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Prov. 19:17</a>, <em>AS</em>) In having pity and giving to the spiritually poor without receiving <span id="page760" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="760" data-before-text="760"></span>material repayment, does one really lend to Jehovah? Yes; and that is because the poor, especially the poor in spirit, the ones conscious of their spiritual need and craving spiritual relief, really belong to Jehovah. That is why he has said: “He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker; but he that hath mercy on the needy honoreth him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Prov. 14:31</a>, <em>AS</em>) Jehovah pronounces it a sin to oppress or neglect them.

<strong>Prospects of Fearers of Jehovah for 1955</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> Jehovah God is the only one really good within himself, he being goodness personified. The goodness of any of his creatures, including Jesus Christ himself, must all be borrowed from Jehovah God. Jesus himself said so, when he rejected the title “Good Teacher” by saying: “Why do you call me good? Nobody is good, except one, God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Luke 18:18, 19</a>, <em>NW; AS</em>) To the extent that the fearer of Jehovah copies him in kindness and generosity, he becomes good like him. “Good is the man—gracious and lending.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/60/0" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Ps. 112:5</a>, <em>Yg</em>) “The good man is gentle and gives.” (<em>Fenton</em>) Jehovah himself is gracious, gentle in dealing, undeservedly kind, and thus he gives to earth’s inhabitants, to wicked people and good, to righteous people and unrighteous. He is the Befriender of the poor and needy. The “man” that fears him makes it his aim to imitate him in these regards. He gives generously of his spiritual gifts, not expecting a material reward; and he does so gently, not trying to embarrass anyone, not threatening or reproaching or addressing in abusive terms even the ones that refuse the good news of the Kingdom unselfishly preached to them. He gives generously of the best thing he has to offer, the lifesaving Kingdom message. This course of action cannot help but mean blessing for his seed or generation, for it is by means of this very “good news” that he fathers this seed, even in his old age, so to speak. Long ago the <span id="page755" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="755" data-before-text="755"></span>psalmist stated the fact: “I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread. All the day long he dealeth graciously, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Ps. 37:25, 26</a>, <em>AS</em>) What a happy family they all are within the New World society!</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">22. According to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/73/0" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Psalm 112:5</a>, why should the New World society be a well-conducted organization?</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> The New World society of the Jehovah-fearing “man” and of his seed or generation must be a well-conducted organization. We should expect it to be, for <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/62/0" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Psalm 112:5</a> says of him: “He will guide his affairs with justice.” (<em>Le</em>) “He shall guide his affairs with discretion.” (<em>Kirkpatrick</em>) “Who conducts his business with justice.” (<em>AT; Mo</em>) “He shall sustain his affairs with justice.” (<em>Ro</em>) That is, he uses good judgment in conducting the affairs and safeguarding the interests of the New World society. He uses discretion in his choices of things; and in the appointing of overseers and of ministerial servants with the congregation of Jehovah’s sheep he tries to determine the divine will and select and empower men who have the spirit of God, men of Scriptural viewpoint, men with a sense of justice, and men who are progressive and concerned with making the organization prosper and increase to Jehovah’s glory. He is alert to the spiritual needs of the New World society and is always busy in making provision for these, that the members of the Society may all be kept in good spiritual condition, equipped to “contend for victory in the right contest of the faith” and strong and zealous to carry out Jehovah’s commandments with delight and do unitedly the work He lays upon the organization. Without partiality the “man” endeavors to help, educate and fit every member alike to be an active witness of Jehovah, a preacher of the good news of God’s established kingdom from door to door.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/63/0" data-bid="64-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:12</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">23, 24. (a) Who try to move the Jehovah-fearing “man”? (b) But can he and will he be moved, and why or why not?</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> In the case of a society thus guided, maintained and regulated what should we expect for 1955 and for the years following? Our reply comes from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Psalm 112:6</a> (<em>AS</em>): “For he shall never be moved; the righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance.” In 1955 or at any time before the end of the battle of Armageddon the righteous fearer of Jehovah God cannot expect to escape the assaults and persecutions of this world; “in fact, all those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/65/0" data-bid="66-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:12</a>, <em>NW</em>) The wicked of this world will try to make him totter, trying to involve him in conflicts with the political governments and bringing him into courts and passing laws making it illegal for him and his seed to exist, all this in order to move him out of the way and have his righteous, charitable activities suppressed and so bring about his spiritual death and destruction. But till now the enemy have been unable to move him off the earth or out of the field of witnessing, and they will be unable to do so in 1955 or at any later time. This spiritual Israelite “man” practices the fear of Jehovah, for which reason he will not be allowed to totter in his integrity.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> As it was prophetically stated for Jesus Christ so it is stated for his follower: “I have set Jehovah always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/66/0" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Ps. 16:8</a>, <em>AS</em>) Jehovah, in whom he takes refuge, is his high tower and defense. His hope and citizenship are in Mount Zion above, where the King Jesus Christ reigns. Jehovah and his Mount Zion can never be moved. Most certainly, then, neither can Jehovah’s worshipers. He will shake all Devil-engineered, man-made things, the human kingdoms and the <span id="page756" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="756" data-before-text="756"></span>corrupt earth and the wicked seas of humanity, to their complete removal; but never will he let those who fear him be removed from the earth. The way he proceeds means destruction to his haters but life in the new world to his lovers. “The way of Jehovah is a stronghold to the upright; but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity. The righteous shall never be removed; but the wicked shall not dwell in the land.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954923/67/0" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Prov. 10:29, 30</a>, <em>AS.</em></p>

No doubt, the righteous will experience increased opposition as the end draws closer. Such hatred will reach a climax in the worldwide attack of Satan the Devil in his role as Gog of Magog.

Do you want this freedom? You may still remember the saying that was popularized not so long ago: “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” This saying was taken up by the late president of the United States of America,<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1954924/0">a</a> but well over two hundred years before him it appeared in a book published early in the seventeenth century.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1954924/1">b</a> But did that saying provide the solution?

Faced with frightful possibilities, mankind have developed no fear of fear itself. Hence they enter the year 1955 with fear and dark foreboding, with no formula for realizing that one of the Rooseveltian “Four Freedoms” known as the “freedom from fear.” Rather, a greater bondage to the heartless slave driver Fear is certain to fasten upon them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 21:25, 26</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="qu"> 2.

That is why there will be one class on earth that will enjoy freedom from fear during 1955 and all the years to follow. That class is the “man” described in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 112</a>, that man that fears Jehovah and that delights in His commandments, together with the seed or generation of this righteous, upright man. What this psalm in its <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps 112 seventh verse</a> says of this collective “man” or class of persons will be true during 1955, yes, true until the victorious end of the battle of Armageddon: “He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in Jehovah.” (<em>AS</em>) He faces the new year fearlessly. The tidings or news about the world is all evil these days; there is nothing consoling about it. Added to this, in God’s own Word there are no good tidings for this world, but only doom by the execution of God’s vengeance against the wicked. The Jehovah-fearing “man” already knows this and so is not disturbed by the trend of world events and the ominous future that is shaping up for this world. From God’s prophecies he knows that this world under Satan must end shortly at the climax of this “time of the end,” to be followed by a bright new world of all good things.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="qu"> 3. How does he not “fear the roar of the bad,” and what course against fear does he follow?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[28]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> Even if “evil tidings” come under the form of threats from the enemy, this does not make the fearer of Jehovah afraid. “He will not fear the roar of the bad,” as one translator renders the verse. (<em>Fenton</em>) He knows that God Almighty, his Protector, is more powerful than the combined forces of the enemy, seen and unseen. Strengthened with this knowledge, he cannot get afraid, but fearlessly goes on doing his Christian work in obedience to God’s commands, declaring His name and bearing witness to His kingdom by Jesus Christ. He refuses to get afraid of what worldly rulers and peoples get afraid of. He follows God’s instructions, namely: “Even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are happy. However, do not become afraid of what they are afraid of, neither become agitated. But sanctify the Christ as Lord in your hearts, always ready to make a defense before anyone that demands of you a reason for the hope in you, but doing so together with a mild temper and deep respect.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:14, 15</a>, <em>NW</em>) “What they fear you shall not fear, nor shall you dread! But the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts—him shall you call holy; he shall be your fear, and he your dread!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 8:12, 13</a>, <em>AT</em>) Hence the Jehovah-fearing man is not scared into following the course the world recommends and thinks practical. In fearing the Most High Jehovah the man’s superior wisdom stands forth. Worldly fears do not paralyze him with terror, but he does all he can to dispel such fears from the people of good will by giving them the Bible message of peace and comfort.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="qu"> 4. How is his heart fixed and led to trust in Jehovah?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> “His heart is fixed, trusting in Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 112:7</a>, <em>AS</em>) By Bible prophecy Jehovah has warned his fearer concerning the fate of this world and concerning the enemy assaults against him. So the man has prepared his heart for the coming of these things that he may not give way to fear or be stumbled and confused. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 16:1-4</a>) <span id="page758" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="758" data-before-text="758"></span>He has taken time to study God’s Word and practice its teachings and thus build up a confidence and trust in Jehovah. Hence his heart does not fluctuate between Jehovah and this world; it remains steadfastly fixed with Jehovah. He keeps a complete heart toward God. His heart never turns to the idols of this world. He has familiarized himself with Jehovah’s promises and has observed how the Promiser has fulfilled them toward his faithful fearer. Knowing the fate that awaits this world, he realizes there is no safety in it and that it cannot win in its fight against Almighty God. He trusts in the certain Winner. Free from torment with worldly fears, he is happy.</p>

<strong>Freedom from Fear in 1955</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> “His heart is fixed, trusting in Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 112:7</a>, <em>AS</em>) By Bible prophecy Jehovah has warned his fearer concerning the fate of this world and concerning the enemy assaults against him. So the man has prepared his heart for the coming of these things that he may not give way to fear or be stumbled and confused. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 16:1-4</a>) <span id="page758" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="758" data-before-text="758"></span>He has taken time to study God’s Word and practice its teachings and thus build up a confidence and trust in Jehovah. Hence his heart does not fluctuate between Jehovah and this world; it remains steadfastly fixed with Jehovah. He keeps a complete heart toward God. His heart never turns to the idols of this world. He has familiarized himself with Jehovah’s promises and has observed how the Promiser has fulfilled them toward his faithful fearer. Knowing the fate that awaits this world, he realizes there is no safety in it and that it cannot win in its fight against Almighty God. He trusts in the certain Winner. Free from torment with worldly fears, he is happy.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu"> 5.

He has his heart braced upon the unbeaten and unbeatable God. Neither fears that men express for the fate of their own system of things and what this will mean to mankind nor the threats that the adversaries make against the New World society cause his heart to tremble and vacillate. It is upheld by Jehovah because of his love for Him. He is stronghearted in his love and attachment to the righteous new world that God has promised. He has no spiritual heart disease in these critical, difficult times when men are lovers of pleasures more than of God and have merely the form of godly devotion but not their hearts in it. So copy his example. To keep from worry and from the tyranny of fear strengthen your heart in its love and devotion to Jehovah. The rest will follow: Love will throw out fear.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 John 4:18</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 6.

But that is no cause for alarm, especially if you know whom you love. If you love someone you will do anything, yes, suffer and endure anything, for that one. If you love Jehovah and know him, take his viewpoint toward the adversaries. Take his estimate of them. Believe in his prophecy concerning them. Then fear of the adversaries will depart. Just now the adversaries may look quite frightful in their numbers and their increased power to harm Jehovah’s witnesses and the New World society. But look at the harm that God can do to them, and also to you, more harm than they can do to you. Do not, then, be afraid of them. Do not quit preaching because of them, but just go on letting your heart be sustained and upheld by Jehovah’s spirit and his Word.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 7.

Strong assurance of this is given us in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 112:9</a>: “He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the needy, his righteousness standeth fast for aye; his horn shall be exalted with honour.” (<em>RoPss</em>) To whom these words apply is certain. The apostle Paul quoted them and applied them to his fellow Christians at the time they were giving aid to their needy brothers in Christ. He said: “(Just as it is written: ‘He has made a distribution, he has given to those of little means, his righteousness continues forever.’ Now he that abundantly supplies seed to the sower and bread for eating will supply and multiply the seed for you to sow and will increase the products of your righteousness.) In everything you are being enriched for every kind of generosity.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Cor. 9:9-11</a>, <em>NW</em>) The generosity of the Jehovah-fearing Christian does not limit itself to giving material things to needy brothers, but concerns itself greatly with distributing the Kingdom news to all “men of good will,” the scattering abroad of the seed of Kingdom truth upon those whose hearts are like good, productive ground.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 9. Who are the “poor” to whom the fearers of Jehovah give, and why?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> The earth today teems with people materially poor, but the poor to whom the wise fearer of Jehovah gives are those who are “poor in spirit,” that is, “conscious of their spiritual need” and hence disposed to accept the satisfying Kingdom message. These are the kind of poor Jesus sent his followers to hunt and feed, saying: “You received free, give free.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 10:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 5:3</a>, <em>NW</em>) What they are able to “give free” must be the spiritual riches that God has bestowed upon them free, because, as regards material riches, God has chosen the “ones who are poor respecting the world to be rich in faith.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Jas. 2:5</a>, <em>NW</em>) By giving the Kingdom message instead of giving mere money or material things they reach those who are really “poor in spirit,” “conscious of their spiritual need,” rather than just the self-seeking poor of this world who do not care to belong to Jehovah. Thus the unappreciative worldly poor who prefer to belong to Satan the “god of this system of things” are screened out.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">10. In giving to such poor, to whom are they really lending, and why?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> The poor and needy are not able to repay us fully in material ways for the spiritual gifts we give them free, but this does not beggar us. We never go without a compensation that more than repays us. Why not? In answering, the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 112:5</a> bear repeating: “Good is the man—gracious and lending.” (<em>Yg;</em> page 754, ¶21) It is to the poor and needy that the “man” lends, not only hoping for no interest on the loan from the poor receiver, but not hoping for any material return at all. From where, then, does his compensation come? Listen: “He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto Jehovah, and his good deed will he pay him again.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Prov. 19:17</a>, <em>AS</em>) In having pity and giving to the spiritually poor without receiving <span id="page760" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="760" data-before-text="760"></span>material repayment, does one really lend to Jehovah? Yes; and that is because the poor, especially the poor in spirit, the ones conscious of their spiritual need and craving spiritual relief, really belong to Jehovah. That is why he has said: “He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker; but he that hath mercy on the needy honoreth him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Prov. 14:31</a>, <em>AS</em>) Jehovah pronounces it a sin to oppress or neglect them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Deut. 24:14, 15</a>) Their dependence is upon Him: “The meek also shall increase their joy in Jehovah, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Isa. 29:19</a>, <em>AS</em>) The poor and needy who belong to Jehovah cannot pay back materially; so Jehovah undertakes the indebtedness of these who belong to him.</p>

For this reason the free and generous giver serves a purpose in God’s works and has a proper and useful place among earth’s inhabitants; he has a good reason for being alive and for being preserved by divine power. He wins the appreciation of God and also of grateful men and so is loved for his work’s sake.

It has had literature printed and distributed either free or at a nominal contribution that merely covered the cost of producing and distributing. To all who wished to attend them, the meetings and conventions of Jehovah’s witnesses have always been open under the public declaration, “Seats free—no collection!” The religious clergy who charge for admission or for seats and who pass the collection plate one or more times during religious services have expressed sorrow that Jehovah’s witnesses advertise a “Seats free—no collection!” rule for religious meetings. (See <em>The Watch Tower,</em> January 1, 1914, page 5.) Jehovah has blessed this principle of giving free or at bare cost and holding meetings with no money collections, in order to put out more Bible information. For an organization the size of the Society, the output of Bibles and Bible literature each year is enormous, and the number of hours Jehovah’s witnesses give free to the work of distribution and the number of Bible studies they conduct free in homes of interested people each year are remarkable.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> In 1955 Jehovah’s witnesses want to have the biggest distribution of literature yet in any one year, because the time shortens to get out the lifesaving message, now that the world destruction at the battle of Armageddon gets ever closer. Working economically, we can do more than others because we try to have as little overhead in expenses as possible. We can achieve the greatest results by the generous giving of the lovers of Jehovah, particularly in terms of time and energy freely spent in distributing and scattering abroad the Kingdom message. According to God’s rule, we can be sure we shall be the happier because of giving the more and doing it free of charge.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">16.

Its being exalted with honor denotes victory for us, in vindication of Jehovah’s power which backs us up. Trusting in him and keeping toward him an integrity that warrants our trusting in him, we can say: “My horn hast thou exalted like the horn of the wild-ox: . . . Mine eye also hath seen my desire on mine enemies, mine ears have heard my desire of the evil-doers that rise up against me.

But men are forced to recognize the divine source of that honor. Ultimately the honor of lasting victory will be ours, but even now we enjoy the <span id="page762" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="762" data-before-text="762"></span>honor of being in Jehovah’s service as his witnesses. The great crowd of persons of good will who are already thronging Jehovah’s house to serve and worship him there are also a glory and honor to the Jehovah-fearing spiritual class who have labored to father this earthly seed or generation. As the apostle Paul said of the brothers at Thessalonica whom he had fathered by means of the good news that he had preached to them: “For what is our hope or joy or crown of exultation—why, is it not in fact you?—before our Lord Jesus at his presence? You certainly are our glory and joy.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 Thess. 2:19, 20</a>, <em>NW</em>) By our continuing to give the Kingdom good news freely and generously to the poor and needy, that honor of increased membership in the New World society at God’s temple is bound to be added to until Jehovah exalts our horn as victors at Armageddon.</p>

<strong>Freedom from Fear in 1955</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Never shall we bow in disgraceful defeat. The divine promise to the righteous giver and distributor to the poor is: “His horn shall be exalted with honor.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ps. 112:9</a>, <em>AS</em>) The horn is a symbol of strength and power, a warning to all would-be assailants. Its being exalted with honor denotes victory for us, in vindication of Jehovah’s power which backs us up. Trusting in him and keeping toward him an integrity that warrants our trusting in him, we can say: “My horn hast thou exalted like the horn of the wild-ox: . . . Mine eye also hath seen my desire on mine enemies, mine ears have heard my desire of the evil-doers that rise up against me. The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ps. 92:10-12</a>, <em>AS</em>) The honor with which the horn is exalted comes from God, not from men. But men are forced to recognize the divine source of that honor. Ultimately the honor of lasting victory will be ours, but even now we enjoy the <span id="page762" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="762" data-before-text="762"></span>honor of being in Jehovah’s service as his witnesses.

As the apostle Paul said of the brothers at Thessalonica whom he had fathered by means of the good news that he had preached to them: “For what is our hope or joy or crown of exultation—why, is it not in fact you?—before our Lord Jesus at his presence?

Why does the wicked, at seeing this, grieve?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> The wicked haters of Jehovah have gloated over seeing us under oppressions, injustices, bans and proscriptions, but their gleeful gloating is turning to chagrin and dismay at seeing the increasing honor that Jehovah confers upon his people who fear and serve him and magnify his name. Ah well, this was all foretold in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 112:10</a> (<em>AS</em>): “The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.” The wicked is destined to see this crowning victory and honor of Jehovah’s witnesses before he is destroyed. He is ill-willed and has no love of righteousness and hence does not rejoice at the exalted horn of Jehovah’s righteous fearers. This is why he seeks to destroy the spiritual prosperity of the restored spiritual Israelites and their companions of good will. He takes offense at Jehovah’s goodness to his people. He wants the worldly favor and success and the divine favor and spiritual prosperity also, but he cannot have both at the same time. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Jas. 4:4</a>) He does not scatter abroad and give the Kingdom message to the poor. So he is discontented. His consciousness of being rich in worldly goods and favor does not fully satisfy him, for he has only the form of godliness but proves false to its power to transform the heart and make one truly happy. Eaten up with envy at the spiritual prosperity of the witnesses, he grieves.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">18. Why does the wicked gnash his teeth, and when and how will he melt away?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> The wicked cannot overthrow the spiritual prosperity of those who fear Jehovah. He gnashes or grinds his teeth at the sight he is obliged to behold, but that is all he can do in his rage. He cannot truly harm the righteous or destroy the New World society. He suffers torment now, not only from the preaching of the good news of God’s established kingdom but also at the prosperity of Jehovah’s witnesses. In 1955 he will keep on grinding his teeth in his rage and prepare to join the great Gog of Magog in his world-wide pre-Armageddon assault on the New World society. When Jehovah stops that furious, malicious assault by the “war of the great day of God the Almighty,” the wicked crowd will still not see the desire of their eyes but will have one last look at a sight grievous to their eyes, the enduring prosperity of Jehovah’s witnesses and the triumph of the New World society on earth. Then the wicked will ‘melt away,’ yes, melt like a snail that leaves a slimy trail. They will melt like a snail, which, as it moves, “dissolves into slime.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954924/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ps. 58:8</a>, <em>RS; Mo</em>) Just as a snail is halted by the salt sprinkled about its haunts, what can the slimy wicked do against the fearers of Jehovah who are like the “salt of the earth”? Nothing, only melt away in an inglorious end at the <span id="page763" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="763" data-before-text="763"></span>grand display of Jehovah’s battle power at Armageddon.</p>
