Next the reader is assured that ‘Jail seems to be the proper background for the witnesses. Their “Judge” Rutherford was in jail when their founder “Pastor” Charles Taze Russell died in 1916,’ and that he was sent there because of sedition and obstructing the draft. However, everyone knows that the United States did not have any sedition or draft act in 1916.

Note their view of matters:</p><p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="si"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"></span>“I saw a cleric jostle a Watchtower Witness and exclaim, ‘Damn you . . . ’ We clamped them into prisons because of their views on military service and their stubborn refusal to submit to the draft. . . . We lectured them publicly about their attitude toward the American flag and the American way. We took them to task for their opposition to blood transfusions. . . . We preached against them and warned our people about them. . . . I have done <em>no horoscopy</em> on this, but since the startling Witnesses are here to stay I can only hope that <em>it is in the stars</em> that <em>they will also modify their incredible stand</em> against saluting the American flag, cooperating with the government and <em>respecting other churches . . . ”</em><a id="footnotesource16" data-fnid="16" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966683/15">d</a> (Italics ours)</p><p id="p65" data-pid="65" data-rel-pid="[117]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"><sup>25</sup></span> To this Babylonish plea to the stars for conformity Jehovah’s witnesses published their answer in <em>The Watchtower</em> of 1958, pages 83, 84.

As to the future course of action by Jehovah’s witnesses, this is not ‘in the stars’; it is not to be seen by scanning the starry creation of Jehovah. In fact, attempts to foretell events by the stars or anyone’s trusting in claimed ‘influence’ of the stars is contrary to Jehovah’s Word. Not to the stars in the visible heavens, but to the God in the heaven of heavens do we look for our future.”—See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966683/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Isaiah 47:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966683/46/1" data-bid="47-2" class="b"> 13</a>.</p><p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="ss"><strong>APOSTATES AVOID USING DIVINE NAME</strong></p><p id="p118" data-pid="118" class="qu">26, 27.

Apostate leaders have Babylonishly pressured Bible translators to take out the divine name. Observe the following unfair attack upon Jehovah’s witnesses made by <span id="page569" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="569" data-before-text="569"></span>a Presbyterian seminary professor, accusing them of being inconsistent in their restoration of the divine name in their <em>New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures.</em> He charged they were of “Arian theology” (antitrinitarian) and thus colored their translation in an antitrinitarian way when they restored <em>Jehovah</em> in some texts where the Greek word <em>kýrios</em> (Lord) appeared without a definite article and not at other places.</p>

<strong>Championing Jehovah’s Godship in Spite of Babylonish Hostility</strong><br/><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[69]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Following another Babylonish practice of hiding the personal name of the Deity, the three false comforters do not use the divine name, <em>Jehovah,</em> once in any of their many speeches, whereas Job uses <span id="page527" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="527" data-before-text="527"></span>the name <em>Jehovah</em> five times. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Job 1:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/52/1" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> 12:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/52/2" data-bid="53-3" class="b"> 28:28</a>) In the account of Abraham their forefather the name <em>Jehovah</em> is used some seventy times from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Genesis chapters 12 to 24</a> inclusive.

Such spirits or demons were unable to materialize like the faithful angels did in communicating with Abraham. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Gen. 18:1-8</a>) This meant that the demons had to resort indirectly to divination and oracles. “In inspirational or natural divination the agent is professedly under the immediate influence of some spirit or god who enables the diviner to see the future and to utter oracles embodying what he sees. . . . It can be proved that among the ancient Babylonians and Egyptians the view prevailed that not only oracles but also omens of all kinds are given to men by the gods and express the minds of these gods.”<a id="footnotesource13" data-fnid="13" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966643/12">a</a> Note that in Eliphaz’s first speech he appeals to one of his Babylonish-like, spiritistic experiences to support his argument. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Job 4:15-17</a>) Never did Abraham or Job have such demonistic experiences to deny the Godship of Jehovah who guided them directly.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="ss"><strong>MAN, THE MORTAL—RESURRECTION HOPE</strong></p><p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="qu">20.

He understood man to be a living soul. He rejected the Babylonish view that man has an immortal soul. Job believed that man is mortal and, when man dies, he is dead.

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page502" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="502" data-before-text="502"></span><strong>Understanding What the Spirit Is</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">GOD’S written Word is a treasure-house of wisdom, but how can a person benefit from its riches unless he applies himself to studying it and to seeking an accurate understanding of it? Good counsel regarding this is given at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 4:7</a>: “Wisdom is the prime thing. Acquire wisdom; and with all that you acquire, acquire understanding.”</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Knowing the various meanings of expressions used in the Bible is an important factor in acquiring understanding. The word “spirit,” for example, has at least seven different meanings. Unless a person knows these meanings he cannot gain an accurate understanding of the Scripture texts in which the word is used.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the Hebrew and Greek languages from which the Bible was translated, the word “spirit” carries the basic thought of something windlike, something that is invisible and forceful like air in motion. For this reason Jehovah God, Jesus Christ and angels are called spirits. They cannot be seen by man but they have power that can be made perceptible to man by the effects it produces in the earth. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 4:24</a> we are told that “God is a Spirit,” and at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:45</a> the resurrected Jesus Christ is called “a life-giving spirit.” Regarding angels, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:7</a> states: “He makes his angels spirits.”</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Hebrew word for spirit is <em>ruʹahh</em> and the Greek word is <em>pneuʹma.</em> Some Bible translations render the Hebrew word <em>n<sup>e</sup>shamahʹ</em> as spirit at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 26:4 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Proverbs 20:27</a>, but more careful translations use the word “breath” here rather than spirit. This word <em>n<sup>e</sup>shamahʹ</em> is the one that is used at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Genesis 2:7</a> for the vital breath that was put into Adam at the time of his creation. Its use here indicates that what God blew into the nostrils of Adam was literal breath. However, the active life force that God gave him, causing him to have a conscious existence, was his <em>ruʹahh</em> or spirit. This active life force is not specifically mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 2:7</a>, but it is referred to elsewhere.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 6:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 7:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Eccl. 12:7</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The life force or principle of life in earthly creatures that is sustained by breathing is one of the meanings of spirit. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 27:3</a>, the word is used with this meaning. “While my breath is yet whole within me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils.” The Hebrew word <em>n<sup>e</sup>shamah</em>ʹ is used for the literal breath in this scripture, whereas <em>ruʹahh</em> is used for spirit, or life force.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Sometimes the word spirit indicates a person’s mental disposition. This is something that cannot be seen, but it manifests itself in a visible way by a person’s expressions or actions. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 34:18</a>, mental disposition is clearly indicated by the word spirit: “Jehovah is near to those that are broken at heart; and those who are crushed in spirit he saves.” As a rock is crushed with a hammer so does a repentant person feel crushed when God’s Word brings home to him the gravity of his sins. He humbly seeks forgiveness as did the people who were “stabbed to the heart” with guilt feelings from what Peter said to them at Pentecost. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 2:37</a>) So “crushed in spirit” indicates the mental disposition of a person who has become <span id="page503" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="503" data-before-text="503"></span>conscious of his sins and of his spiritual need.</p>

<strong>Part Two</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> In the face of this it is foolish for the clergy of Christendom to argue that those in Sheol or Haʹdes are still alive as immortals and are dead only in the sense of being separated from God. The psalmist David does not agree with those clergymen, for he says to Jehovah God: “Where can I go from your spirit, and where can I run away <span id="page48" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="48" data-before-text="48"></span>from your face? If I should ascend to heaven, there you would be; and if I should spread out my couch in Sheol, look! you would be there.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ps. 139:7, 8</a>) Confirming that fact, King David’s son Solomon said, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:11</a>: “Sheol and the place of destruction are in front of Jehovah. How much more so the hearts of the sons of mankind!” Just as Jehovah knows what is in the hearts of men, so he knows who are in Sheol.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">18.

If they dig down into Sheol, from there my own hand will take them; and if they go up to the heavens, from there I shall bring them down.” Here, because of height, the heavens are contrasted with Sheol because of depth. How could men ever dig into Sheol? Only because Sheol is in the earth where men live and dig graves.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">19. What does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/63/0" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Job 26:5-7</a> show regarding God’s knowledge of Sheol?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> Those in Sheol or Haʹdes are not beyond the knowledge and power of Jehovah. This fact is emphasized by the deathly sick Job, when he spoke of earth’s Creator in these words: “Those impotent in death keep trembling beneath the waters and those residing in them. Sheol is naked in front of him, and the place of destruction has no covering [from him]. He is stretching out the north over the empty place, hanging the earth upon nothing.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Job 26:5-7</a>) Thus Sheol has no covering with which to hide its dead from God’s eyes, but it lies naked before him. He knows who are there.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">20, 21. Because of what facts about those in Sheol did Job pray, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Job 14:12-15</a>, for God to hide him there?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> Away back there in the sixteenth century before our Common Era patient Job knew that those dead in Sheol are really dead; they feel no pain, even as they experience no pleasure, and are not conscious of anything at all. With good reason, then, Job prayed that his painful and shameful sickness might be terminated soon in death and that he might be laid in Sheol, out of sight from the staring eyes of men. Hence he prayed to Jehovah God:</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> “Man also has to lie down and does not get up [by his own power]. Until heaven is no more they will not wake up, nor will they be aroused from their sleep. O that in Sheol you would conceal me, that you would keep me secret until your anger turns back, that you would set a time limit for me and remember me! If an able-bodied man dies can he live again? All the days of my compulsory service I shall wait, until my relief comes. You will call, and I myself shall answer you. For the work of your hands you will have a yearning.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Job 14:12-15</a>.</p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">22. By his words in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/65/0" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Job 14:12-15</a>, how did Job show he did not believe Sheol to be a “land of no return”?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> Judged by these words, Sheol (Haʹdes, <em>LXX</em>) was not a “land of no return” to Job. It was not a place in which the dead ones were forgotten, abandoned, by God. Instead, the God of Job remembered those in Sheol, and in his own set time he would call forth those in that common grave of mankind, awakening them from their death state as if awakening them from a natural sleep. For that reason the painfully sick Job was willing for God to take his life then and there, to end his terrible sufferings in the flesh, and to lay him away in death in Sheol. Job felt that God was angry with him. So if God let Job be buried out of sight in Sheol, Job could be kept secret until God’s anger had passed away and the time came for God to be favorable to those in Sheol and to resurrect them from death to life under favorable conditions.</p>

<strong>Abaddon</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In Hebrew the word <em>ʼavad·dohnʹ</em> means “destruction” and may also refer to “the place of destruction.” It appears in the original Hebrew text a total of five times, and in four of the occurrences it is used to parallel “the burial place,” “Sheol,” and “death.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000007/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps 88:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000007/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Job 26:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000007/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 28:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000007/1/3" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> Pr 15:11</a>) The word <em>ʼavad·dohnʹ</em> in these texts evidently refers to the destructive processes that ensue with human death, and these scriptures indicate that decay or destruction takes place in Sheol, the common grave of mankind.

This is demonstrated by the fact that the Hebrew word <em>ʼavad·dohnʹ</em> (destruction) is used twice to parallel “Sheol.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001160/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Job 26:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001160/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Pr 15:11</a>) The prophet Zephaniah spoke of the destruction of Assyria, whereas Ezekiel said that the Assyrians would go down to Sheol. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001160/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Zep 2:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001160/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Eze 32:21, 22</a>) When speaking of the destruction of the rebels Dathan and Abiram, Moses wrote that they went down “alive into Sheol.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001160/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Nu 16:31,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001160/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 33</a>) Since Sheol in the Bible denotes the common grave of mankind from which there will be a resurrection, it is evident that not all destruction​—not even all destruction at the hand of God—​is necessarily eternal.</p>

<strong>Part Two</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> In the face of this it is foolish for the clergy of Christendom to argue that those in Sheol or Haʹdes are still alive as immortals and are dead only in the sense of being separated from God. The psalmist David does not agree with those clergymen, for he says to Jehovah God: “Where can I go from your spirit, and where can I run away <span id="page48" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="48" data-before-text="48"></span>from your face? If I should ascend to heaven, there you would be; and if I should spread out my couch in Sheol, look! you would be there.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ps. 139:7, 8</a>) Confirming that fact, King David’s son Solomon said, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:11</a>: “Sheol and the place of destruction are in front of Jehovah. How much more so the hearts of the sons of mankind!” Just as Jehovah knows what is in the hearts of men, so he knows who are in Sheol.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">18. What does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/62/0" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Amos 9:1, 2</a> show about the reach of God’s spirit?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> In illustration of how his spirit or active force can reach to all places, even to Sheol, Jehovah God says, in the prophecy of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Amos 9:1, 2</a>: “No one fleeing of them will make good his flight, and no one escaping of them will make his getaway. If they dig down into Sheol, from there my own hand will take them; and if they go up to the heavens, from there I shall bring them down.” Here, because of height, the heavens are contrasted with Sheol because of depth. How could men ever dig into Sheol? Only because Sheol is in the earth where men live and dig graves.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">19. What does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/63/0" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Job 26:5-7</a> show regarding God’s knowledge of Sheol?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> Those in Sheol or Haʹdes are not beyond the knowledge and power of Jehovah. This fact is emphasized by the deathly sick Job, when he spoke of earth’s Creator in these words: “Those impotent in death keep trembling beneath the waters and those residing in them. Sheol is naked in front of him, and the place of destruction has no covering [from him]. He is stretching out the north over the empty place, hanging the earth upon nothing.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Job 26:5-7</a>) Thus Sheol has no covering with which to hide its dead from God’s eyes, but it lies naked before him. He knows who are there.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">20, 21. Because of what facts about those in Sheol did Job pray, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Job 14:12-15</a>, for God to hide him there?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> Away back there in the sixteenth century before our Common Era patient Job knew that those dead in Sheol are really dead; they feel no pain, even as they experience no pleasure, and are not conscious of anything at all. With good reason, then, Job prayed that his painful and shameful sickness might be terminated soon in death and that he might be laid in Sheol, out of sight from the staring eyes of men. Hence he prayed to Jehovah God:</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> “Man also has to lie down and does not get up [by his own power]. Until heaven is no more they will not wake up, nor will they be aroused from their sleep. O that in Sheol you would conceal me, that you would keep me secret until your anger turns back, that you would set a time limit for me and remember me! If an able-bodied man dies can he live again? All the days of my compulsory service I shall wait, until my relief comes. You will call, and I myself shall answer you. For the work of your hands you will have a yearning.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Job 14:12-15</a>.</p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">22. By his words in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/65/0" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Job 14:12-15</a>, how did Job show he did not believe Sheol to be a “land of no return”?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> Judged by these words, Sheol (Haʹdes, <em>LXX</em>) was not a “land of no return” to Job. It was not a place in which the dead ones were forgotten, abandoned, by God. Instead, the God of Job remembered those in Sheol, and in his own set time he would call forth those in that common grave of mankind, awakening them from their death state as if awakening them from a natural sleep. For that reason the painfully sick Job was willing for God to take his life then and there, to end his terrible sufferings in the flesh, and to lay him away in death in Sheol. Job felt that God was angry with him. So if God let Job be buried out of sight in Sheol, Job could be kept secret until God’s anger had passed away and the time came for God to be favorable to those in Sheol and to resurrect them from death to life under favorable conditions.</p>

<strong>United Against Nations in the Valley of Decision</strong><br/><p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[96]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"><sup>27</sup></span> What do these symbolic locusts look like? John says: “And the likenesses of the locusts resembled horses prepared for battle; and upon their heads were what seemed to be crowns like gold, and their faces were as men’s faces, but they had hair as women’s hair. And their teeth were as those of lions; and they had breastplates like iron breastplates. And the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running into battle. Also, they have tails and stings like scorpions; and in their tails is their authority to hurt the men five months.” From this description we note that the remnant of Jehovah’s anointed witnesses were brought forth in 1919 for warfare, a spiritual warfare from that year till the actual outbreak of the “war of the great day of God the Almighty,” commonly called Armageddon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Rev. 16:14-16</a>) Hence they looked like horses, which in Bible times were used for warfare. “The horse <span id="page719" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="719" data-before-text="719"></span>is something prepared for the day of battle,” says <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Proverbs 21:31</a>.</p><p id="p97" data-pid="97" class="qu">28. What is denoted by the crowns on the locusts’ heads, their having hair like women, and their having breastplates like iron ones?</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[97]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="28"><sup>28</sup></span> The symbolic locusts are royal warriors, as denoted by the goldlike crowns upon the locusts’ heads; for by being anointed with God’s spirit they have been made “joint heirs with Christ” and have been assigned a crown and throne in Christ’s kingdom of a thousand years. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Rom. 8:16, 17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Luke 22:28-30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/29/2" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> Rev. 3:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/29/3" data-bid="30-4" class="b"> 21</a>) During this time of spiritual warfare with Christendom these symbolic locusts are mere humans gifted with intelligence, as denoted by their “men’s faces.” Like Hebrew warriors in the field who did not have barbershop facilities, they let their head of hair grow to the length of women’s hair, so that they had a hairy mane and looked like lions for fierceness. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 Chron. 12:8</a>) Appropriately, then, “their teeth were as those of lions,” that could devour solid food, flesh, like the strong judgment message of God’s vengeance against Christendom. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Heb. 5:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/31/1" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 3:1, 2</a>) Their hearts, the organs of love for God and for his righteousness, hence hearts that know no fear but are courageous, are well protected as if by impenetrable breastplates of iron. So they never lose love and courage.</p><p id="p98" data-pid="98" class="qu">29. How do the symbolic locusts make a terrific noise, and for how long are they authorized to torment men not having the seal?</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[98]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="29"><sup>29</sup></span> Like a huge swarm of winged locusts that are capable of flying for a thousand miles or more, they unitedly make a noise that sounds like a squadron of war chariots rattling along to the beat of many horses’ hoofs into the battle. It is a terrific sound. The symbolic locusts shout as from the house-tops and let God’s judgment message be heard over a vast distance in the territory that they cover. Fear of the enemy does not soften down their message to a mere whisper. Jehovah’s war declaration must be sounded loudly. He is responsible for the hurting of feelings that the message causes to the ones who are stung by it. For the brief time interval till Armageddon breaks out, “five months,” as it were, the symbolic locusts must use their scorpion-like tails, God’s Word, “the sword of the spirit,” and must strike men against whom God’s judgment is directed. It is not God’s time to spare feelings. His enemies have to be exposed and notified of coming judgment.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Eph. 6:17</a>.</p><p id="p99" data-pid="99" class="qu">30. Who is king over the symbolic locusts, and what do his names in Hebrew and Greek mean and show?</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[99]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"><sup>30</sup></span> The symbolic locusts must follow their King, Jesus Christ. John says of them: “They have over them a king, the angel of the abyss. In Hebrew his name is Abadʹdon, but in Greek he has the name Apollyon.” The resurrected heavenly Jesus Christ is the “angel of the abyss,” for he holds the “keys of death and of Haʹdes.” In the finale of the universal war of Armageddon he will bind and pitch Satan the Devil and his spirit demons into the abyss of deathlike inactivity. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Rev. 20:1-3</a>) When Jesus was on earth as a man, he was a Hebrew, and now in his capacity as Jehovah’s royal Executioner he is called by the Hebrew name Abadʹdon, which means Destruction. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Job 26:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 28:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/34/2" data-bid="35-3" class="b"> 31:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/34/3" data-bid="35-4" class="b"> 12:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/34/4" data-bid="35-5" class="b"> 14:19</a>) In the Greek in which the inspired Christian Scriptures were written his similar title is Apollyon, which means Destroyer. This name clearly shows that he comes to the throne at God’s right hand to rule first in the midst of his enemies and to destroy them in execution of Jehovah’s righteous judgment, Jehovah’s judicial decision against them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Jas. 4:12</a>.</p><p id="p100" data-pid="100" class="qu">31. (a) How, like locusts, do the Witnesses move forward, and of what quality is this indicative? (b) What keeps them united?</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[100]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="31"><sup>31</sup></span> The symbolic locusts who must proclaim the judgment message before the judgment is executed in the “low plain of the decision” have Jesus Christ as their King, but he is invisible. They have no <span id="page720" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="720" data-before-text="720"></span>visible king any more than literal locusts have: “The locusts have no king, and yet they go forth all of them divided into groups.” For the reason that they move forward in groups or swarms, they are “instinctively wise,” although being among the “smallest” things on earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Prov. 30:24,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/36/1" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 27</a>) The symbolic locusts, the anointed witnesses of Jehovah, move forward united, grouped according to their local congregations. But this is not due to any locust instinct. It is due to the heavenly wisdom imparted by God’s spirit. Also, their following their heavenly King Jesus Christ as the Leader whom God had enthroned is what keeps them united in their attack upon the men not sealed. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Rev. 7:2-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/37/1" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> 9:4</a>) Willingly, obediently, they subject themselves to his command; and this is what may also be pictured by the fact that the symbolic locusts “had hair as women’s hair,” since a woman’s long hair naturally is a sign of her subjection, a sign of having authority on her head.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/38/1" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/38/2" data-bid="39-3" class="b"> Ps. 110:3</a>.</p>

<strong>The Bible—A Reliable Source of Truth</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">About 3,500 years ago, the Bible stated that the earth is suspended “upon nothing.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2020003/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 26:7</a>) This differed greatly from the myths that described the earth as floating on water or being carried by a giant tortoise. Some 1,100 years after the book of Job was written, people continued to believe that the earth could not just hang in midair; it had to have something to rest upon. Only three hundred years ago, in 1687, Isaac Newton published his work on gravity and explained that the earth is held in orbit by an invisible force. This scientific milestone confirmed what the Bible had stated more than 3,000 years earlier!</p>

<strong>Earth</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><strong>The Bible’s Harmony With Scientific Facts.</strong> The Bible, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001239/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Job 26:7</a>, speaks of God as “hanging the earth upon nothing.” Science says that the earth remains in its orbit in space primarily because of the interaction of gravity and centrifugal force. These forces, of course, are invisible. Therefore the earth, like other heavenly bodies, is suspended in space as if hanging on nothing. Speaking from Jehovah’s viewpoint, the prophet Isaiah wrote under inspiration: “There is One who is dwelling above the circle of the earth, the dwellers in which are as grasshoppers.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001239/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Isa 40:22</a>) The Bible says: “He [God] has described a circle upon the face of the waters.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001239/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Job 26:10</a>) The waters are limited by his decree to their proper place.

<strong>Who Made the Laws That Govern Our Universe?</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>2. What Holds the Heavenly Bodies in Place?</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">To Aristotle, the universe was packed full. He saw the earth and its atmosphere as composed of four elements​—earth, water, air, and fire. The universe beyond was filled with crystalline spheres, all composed of an eternal substance he called ether. The heavenly bodies were attached to the invisible spheres. Aristotle’s idea long appealed to most men of science, for it seemed to fit a basic assumption: An object must rest on or be attached to something, or else it will fall.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">What about the Bible? It contains a record of the words of a faithful man named Job, who said about Jehovah: “He is . . . hanging the earth upon nothing.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011489/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 26:7</a>) Such a notion would surely have struck Aristotle as preposterous.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">In the 17th century C.E., some 3,000 years after Job’s day, prevailing scientific theory held that the universe was filled, not with crystalline spheres, but with a kind of fluid. Late in that century, though, physicist Sir Isaac Newton proposed a completely different idea. Gravity, he said, caused an attraction between the heavenly bodies. Newton had come one step closer to understanding that the earth and other heavenly bodies did indeed hang in empty space, what would appear to humans as “nothing.”</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Newton’s theory about gravity met with a great deal of opposition. It was still hard for many scientifically minded men to envision that stars and other heavenly bodies were not held in place by something substantial. How could our massive earth or the heavenly orbs simply hang there in space? The idea struck some as supernatural. Since Aristotle’s day, most men of science had believed that space must be filled with <em>something.</em></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Of course, Job knew nothing of the invisible means by which the earth is held in a stable orbit around the sun. What, then, led him to say that our planet hangs “upon nothing”?</p>

<strong>Are You Prepared to Talk on the Bible?</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">A <em>scientist,</em> or an individual interested in science, may be quite surprised to learn that, some 2,200 years before men in general accepted the fact that the earth is round, the Hebrew prophet Isaiah wrote: “There is One [God] who is dwelling above the circle of the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977801/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isa. 40:22</a>) The Hebrew word here rendered “circle” is <em>hhug,</em> which may also be rendered “sphere,” according to Davidson’s <em>Concordance.</em> Moreover, a scientifically inclined person will probably agree with the Bible if he is shown <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977801/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Job 26:7</a>, which says that God is “hanging the earth upon nothing.” After all, scientists know that the earth has no visible means of support.</p>

<strong>Is the Bible Simply a Product of Human Wisdom?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Was the Bible influenced by such ideas? No. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975161/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 26:7</a> we read: “[God] is stretching out the north over the empty place, <em>hanging the earth upon nothing.”</em> This accurate statement has long impressed Bible scholars. One of such, F. C. Cook, wrote in the nineteenth century: “It presents a singularly strong protest against superstitions prevalent among all heathens . . . Job knows nothing of solid foundations on which the broad expanse of earth is supported. How Job knew the truth, demonstrated by astronomy, that the earth hangs self-poised in empty space, is a question not easily solved by those who deny the inspiration of Holy Scripture.”</p>

Since the God of creation runs or rules the great establishment as a whole, he must also be the ruler of the earth. His rulership, not that of human creatures on the earth, is the true, original, rightful rulership for the earth. A Creator should run his own creation. Man had nothing to do with creating this earth as his everlasting home. On this vital point the same questions deserve to be put to modern-day scientists and evolutionists that were put to the patriarch Job by God respecting the creation of the earth.

The above-named Greek-English lexicon defines this word as meaning (a) argument of disproof or refutation; (b) generally, cross-examining, testing, scrutiny, especially for purposes of refutation; (c) catalogue, inventory. The Greek word thus has to do with bringing forth evidence that demonstrates something, particularly something contrary to what appears to be the case. It thus makes evident what has not been discerned before and so refutes what appears to be the case. In this way real things that are not beheld but that have to be studied out are able to appear to our appreciation.</p><p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu">13.

If, instead of being a Roman Catholic forbidden back there to read the Holy Bible, Columbus was a Jew as claimed by many, he may have read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962923/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:22</a> concerning the roundness of the earth: “There is One who is dwelling above the circle of the earth, the dwellers in which are as grasshoppers, the One who is stretching out the heavens just as a fine gauze, who spreads them out like a tent in which to dwell.” Also, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962923/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 26:7</a>: “He is stretching out the north over the empty place, hanging the earth upon nothing.” Now Columbus was no astronaut like those of today who have orbited the earth in outer space and have seen with their eyes the sphericalness of the earth. But by three main lines of argument drawn (1) from natural reasons, (2) from theories of geographers, and (3) from the reports and traditions of seagoing men, Columbus reasoned and discerned that our earth must be a sphere. For instance, he could see that the moon was round; that the eclipse of the moon was circular; that, when incoming ships rise up over the distant horizon, the masts of sailing vessels appear first and the hull last. In these ways there was demonstrated to him very evidently a real fact about the earth, though he had not seen it. Acting on this evident demonstration, he sailed due west and discovered the West Indies and South America. His faith triumphed.</p><p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu">14. What kind of faith was that of Columbus, but what sort of faith is that illustrated in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962923/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Hebrews, chapter 11</a>?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> However, Columbus’ faith was not a spiritual faith.

They all had faith in the coming of, not the so-called new world of America, but the new world under the promised Seed of God’s “woman.” <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962923/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:3</a> says: “By faith we perceive that the systems of things were put in order by God’s word, so that what is beheld came to be out of things that do not appear.”</p><p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">15.

But we, as Bible students, because of our practical faith, cannot see how the “systems of things,” or “what is beheld” by our naked eyes, created themselves out of nothing and came into existence in any other way than by an intelligent, all-powerful God of inexhaustible energy and wisdom. We are not blind. We can see the “evident demonstration” that Almighty God Jehovah is and always has been, so that “by faith we perceive that the systems of things were put in order by God’s word.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962923/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Rom. 1:20-23</a>.</p>

<strong>Finding the Truth That Makes Men Free</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> But you will probably next say, How do we know there has been a fairly accurate transmission of these ancient records in the Bible? Perhaps many mistakes that greatly distort the records have been made during the ages. The remarkable thing is that the Bible has experienced comparatively little corruption of text in spite of the imperfect copyists. Furthermore, the way the Bible is written, using plain language, everyday illustrations and prophetic symbols that are common in ordinary life, has made possible translations into many languages without distorting the dynamic power of the original messages. This could not be accomplished with any other book, whether philosophic or religious, because such books lose a large percentage of their original force in the first translations. This ability of the Bible to retain a high degree of the force of its original messages further testifies to the brilliance of the master mind behind it, its one Author, the True God. Note the conclusion of the outstanding Biblical scholar, Sir Frederic Kenyon, on the correctness of the text of the Bible: “The interval then between the dates of original composition and the earliest extant evidence becomes so small as to be in fact negligible, and the last foundation for any doubt that the Scriptures have come down to us substantially as they were written has now been removed. Both the <em>authenticity</em> and the <em>general integrity . . .</em> <span id="page589" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="589" data-before-text="589"></span>may be regarded as finally established.”—<em>The Bible and Archaeology,</em> 1940, by F.

Furthermore, it is the most reliable ancient history book on earth. Archaeology confirms many of its legal and historic accounts. For example, the Bible was the first reporter of the Tower of Babel fiasco in Mesopotamia in the Middle East. Archaeology has found what may be this Tower’s ruins. Geology, which is a scientific study of the earth and its life, likewise confirms the Bible’s order of creation and its record of the deluge of Noah’s time. No inaccuracy of Biblical data in a historical or scientific way has been proved. For example, over three thousand years ago the Bible mentioned that the earth is suspended in space. Just hear its account of this: “He [God] is stretching out the north over the empty place, hanging the earth upon nothing.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959722/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 26:7</a>) Then more than two thousand year before Columbus sailed to America from Spain to prove the earth to be round, the Bible had already stated it to be round. This ancient Book of Freedom says: “There is One who is dwelling above the circle of the earth, the dwellers in which are as grasshoppers.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959722/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isa. 40:22</a>) The chemical product of glass is mentioned as being used more than three thousand five hundred years ago, because the Bible said in Job’s day: “Gold and glass cannot be compared to it [wisdom].” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959722/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 28:17</a>) True chemical knowledge was also known in King Solomon’s time three thousand years ago.

The idea that heavenly bodies are, in effect, suspended in empty space upon nothing was unknown to them. Thus, their explanations often suggested that tangible objects or substances held the earth and other heavenly bodies aloft.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">For example, one ancient theory, perhaps originated by people who lived on an island, was that the earth was surrounded by water and that it <em>floated</em> in these waters. The Hindus conceived that the earth had several foundations, one on top of the other. It rested on four elephants, the elephants stood on an enormous tortoise, the tortoise stood on an immense serpent, and the coiled serpent floated on universal waters. Empedocles, a Greek philosopher of the fifth century B.C.E., believed that the earth rested upon a whirlwind and that this whirlwind was the cause of the motion of the heavenly bodies.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Among the most influential views were those of Aristotle. Although he theorized that the earth is a sphere, he denied that it could ever hang in empty space. In his treatise <em>On the Heavens,</em> when refuting the notion that the earth rests on water, he said: “It is not the nature of water, any more than of earth, to stay in mid-air: it must have something to rest upon.”<sup>4</sup> So, what does the earth “rest upon”? Aristotle taught that the sun, the moon, and the stars were attached to the surface of solid, transparent spheres. Sphere lay nestled within sphere, with the earth—immobile—at the center. As the spheres revolved within one another, the objects on them—the sun, the moon, and the planets—moved across the sky.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Aristotle’s explanation seemed logical. If the heavenly bodies were not firmly attached to something, how else could they stay aloft? The views of the revered Aristotle were accepted as fact for some 2,000 years. According to <em>The New Encyclopædia Britannica,</em> in the 16th and 17th centuries his teachings “ascended to the status of religious dogma” in the eyes of the church.<sup>5</sup></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><span id="page20" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>With the invention of the telescope, astronomers began to question Aristotle’s theory. Still, the answer eluded them until Sir Isaac Newton explained that the planets are suspended in empty space, held in their orbits by an invisible force—gravity. It seemed incredible, and some of Newton’s colleagues found it hard to believe that space could be a void, largely empty of substance.<a id="footnotesource4" data-fnid="4" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1101997028/3">d</a><sup>6</sup></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">What does the Bible have to say on this question?

In addition to the references by Ezekiel and James, the book is quoted by the apostle Paul. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990079/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 5:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990079/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 3:19</a>) Powerful proof of the book’s inspiration is given in its amazing harmony with the proved facts of the sciences.

What holds up the moon, the sun, and the stars? These questions have intrigued humans for thousands of years. In regard to the earth, the Bible has a simple answer. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101990566/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 26:7</a> it says that God is “hanging the earth upon nothing.” In the original Hebrew, the word for “nothing” (<em>beli-mahʹ</em>) used here literally means “not any thing,” and this is the only time it occurs in the Bible.

One ancient view was that the earth was supported by elephants standing on the back of a giant turtle.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Aristotle, a famous Greek philosopher and scientist of the fourth century B.C.E., taught that the earth could never hang in empty space. Instead, he taught that the heavenly bodies were each fixed to the surface of solid, transparent spheres. Sphere lay nestled within sphere. The earth was innermost; the outermost sphere held the stars. As the spheres revolved one within another, the objects on them​—the sun, the moon, and the planets—​moved across the sky.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The Bible’s statement that the earth actually ‘hangs upon nothing’ predated Aristotle by over 1,100 years. Yet, Aristotle was considered the foremost thinker of his day. His views were still taught as fact almost 2,000 <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>years after his death! As <em>The New Encyclopædia Britannica</em> says, in the 16th and 17th centuries C.E., Aristotle’s teachings “ascended to the status of religious dogma” in the eyes of the church.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Sixteenth-century philosopher Giordano Bruno dared to challenge the concept that the stars “are as it were embedded in a single cupola.” He wrote that it was “a ridiculous notion which children might conceive, imagining perhaps that if [the stars] were not attached to the celestial surface by a good glue, or nailed with stoutest nails, they would fall on us like hail.” But disagreeing with Aristotle was a dangerous game in those days​—the church had Bruno burned alive for spreading his unorthodox ideas about the universe.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong><em>In the Cosmic Soup</em></strong></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">With the invention of the telescope, astronomers in growing numbers began to question Aristotle. If the sun, the moon, and the stars were not attached to spheres that spin around the earth, then what could hold them up and move them around? Seventeenth-century mathematician René Descartes thought he had the answer. He agreed with Aristotle that the space between us and the other heavenly bodies could not be empty. So he postulated that the universe was filled with a transparent fluid​—a sort of cosmic soup.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">This theory seemed to solve two problems. For one, it provided something to ‘hold up’ the heavenly bodies; they were all suspended in the soup! For another, it helped explain the motions of the planets. Descartes held that the planets were caught in the grip of whirlpools, or vortices, in the fluid, which made them swirl around in their orbits. This “Theory of Vortices,” as it was termed, may strike us as rather fanciful today. But it was the dominant theory in the study of the universe for more than a century in some countries.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Many scientists preferred it to the newcomer: Isaac Newton’s law of universal gravitation, published in 1687. Newton asserted that the planets did not need mechanical, tangible objects or substances to hold them aloft. It was the force of gravity that governed their motions and held them locked in their orbits. In effect, they hung in empty space upon nothing. Many of Newton’s colleagues scoffed at his notion of gravity. And even Newton himself found it hard to believe that space was a void, largely empty of substance.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Nonetheless, Newton’s views eventually won out. Today, it is all too easy for us to forget that this question of what holds up the planets stirred heated debate among learned and brilliant scientists some 32 centuries <em>after</em> the Bible stated with elegant simplicity that the earth is ‘hanging upon nothing.’ How could Job have known to phrase things just that way? Why would he say that nothing of substance holds up the earth, when it took the “experts” well over 3,000 years to arrive at the same conclusion?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong><em>Why Is the Bible So Ahead Of Its Time?</em></strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The Bible gives the logical answer.

The tropical year, which concerns the return of the seasons, the interval between two consecutive returns of the sun to the vernal equinox, is 365 days, 5 hours, <span id="page476" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="476" data-before-text="476"></span>48 minutes and 46 seconds, on the average. This figure is the one used in solar-year calendar reckoning, and its fractional nature has caused much difficulty in accurate calendar making.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The axis of the earth tilts 23° 27ʹ away from a perpendicular to the earth’s orbit. The gyroscopic effect of rotation holds the earth’s axis in the same direction relative to the stars regardless of its location in its orbit around the sun (with only a slight eccentricity). This brings about the seasons.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The earth’s atmosphere, composed principally of nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor and other gases, extends over 600 miles (966 kilometers) above the earth’s surface.

Having created all necessary things, Jehovah saw that they were “very good,” and “proceeded to rest” or desist from other earthly creative works.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Gen. 1:31–2:2</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Man’s habitation on earth is also permanent.

God’s purpose, therefore, is for the earth to be the habitation of man in perfection and happiness with eternal life.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Ps. 37:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/36/1" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 115:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/36/2" data-bid="37-3" class="b"> Isa. 45:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/36/3" data-bid="37-4" class="b"> Rev. 21:3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">That this is the purpose of Jehovah God, sacred to him and not to be thwarted, is indicated when the Bible says: “And by the seventh day God came to the completion of his work that he had made . . . And God proceeded to bless the seventh day and make it sacred, because on it he has been resting from all his work that God has created for the purpose of making.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Gen. 2:2, 3</a>) The seventh or rest day is not shown in the Genesis account as ending, as in the case of the other six days. The apostle Paul explained that the rest day of God had been continuous right through Israelite history down to his own time and had not yet ended. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Heb. 3:7-11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/38/1" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> 4:3-9</a>) God says the seventh day was set aside as sacred to him. He would carry out his purpose toward the earth inviolate; it would be fully accomplished during that day, with no necessity of further creative works toward the earth during that time.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>BIBLE’S HARMONY WITH SCIENTIFIC FACTS</strong></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The Bible, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Job 26:7</a>, speaks of God as “hanging the earth upon nothing.” Science says that the earth remains in its orbit in space primarily due to the interaction of gravity and centrifugal force. These forces, of course, are invisible. Therefore the earth, as other heavenly bodies, is suspended in space as if hanging on nothing. Speaking from Jehovah’s viewpoint, the prophet Isaiah says: “There is One who is dwelling above the circle of the earth, the dwellers in which are as grasshoppers.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Isa. 40:22</a>) The Bible says: “He [God] has described a circle upon the face of the waters.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011207/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Job 26:10</a>) The waters are limited by his decree to their proper place.

These forces, of course, are invisible. Therefore the earth, like other heavenly bodies, is suspended in space as if hanging on nothing. Speaking from Jehovah’s viewpoint, the prophet Isaiah wrote under inspiration: “There is One who is dwelling above the circle of the earth, the dwellers in which are as grasshoppers.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001239/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Isa 40:22</a>) The Bible says: “He [God] has described a circle upon the face of the waters.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001239/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Job 26:10</a>) The waters are limited by his decree to their proper place. They do not come up and inundate the land; neither do they fly off into space.

Before land surfaces appeared, the surface of the entire globe was one circular (spherical) mass of surging waters.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001239/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Ge 1:2</a>.</p>

However, which of the space-age scientists could ever build or send into orbit a space ship the size of our earth, create the miracle of life on the space ship itself, and clothe it with beauteous plant, bird, fish and animal life, each kind perpetuating itself through millenniums of time? Which of them could begin to design anything so wonderful as perfect man?

None of them can fathom Jehovah’s power by which “he has stirred up the sea,” or produce the tempestuous wind by which “he has polished up heaven itself.” They probe at the fringe of his creation, while ignoring the Creator himself. It is just as integrity-keeping Job exclaimed: “Look! these are the fringes of his ways, and what a whisper of a matter has been heard of him!”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961603/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 26:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961603/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 12-14</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Though scarcely a whisper concerning God is to be heard among space-age intellectuals, he is not without witnesses to his power and glory, even in this materialistic twentieth century.

In this Job pictured the modern-day witnesses of Jehovah, who in a time of testing A.D. 1918 hesitated for a brief season to witness boldly and uncompromisingly in vindication of Jehovah’s great name.

Good counsel regarding this is given at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 4:7</a>: “Wisdom is the prime thing. Acquire wisdom; and with all that you acquire, acquire understanding.”</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Knowing the various meanings of expressions used in the Bible is an important factor in acquiring understanding. The word “spirit,” for example, has at least seven different meanings. Unless a person knows these meanings he cannot gain an accurate understanding of the Scripture texts in which the word is used.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the Hebrew and Greek languages from which the Bible was translated, the word “spirit” carries the basic thought of something windlike, something that is invisible and forceful like air in motion. For this reason Jehovah God, Jesus Christ and angels are called spirits. They cannot be seen by man but they have power that can be made perceptible to man by the effects it produces in the earth. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 4:24</a> we are told that “God is a Spirit,” and at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:45</a> the resurrected Jesus Christ is called “a life-giving spirit.” Regarding angels, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:7</a> states: “He makes his angels spirits.”</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Hebrew word for spirit is <em>ruʹahh</em> and the Greek word is <em>pneuʹma.</em> Some Bible translations render the Hebrew word <em>n<sup>e</sup>shamahʹ</em> as spirit at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 26:4 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Proverbs 20:27</a>, but more careful translations use the word “breath” here rather than spirit. This word <em>n<sup>e</sup>shamahʹ</em> is the one that is used at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Genesis 2:7</a> for the vital breath that was put into Adam at the time of his creation. Its use here indicates that what God blew into the nostrils of Adam was literal breath. However, the active life force that God gave him, causing him to have a conscious existence, was his <em>ruʹahh</em> or spirit. This active life force is not specifically mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 2:7</a>, but it is referred to elsewhere.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 6:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 7:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Eccl. 12:7</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The life force or principle of life in earthly creatures that is sustained by breathing is one of the meanings of spirit. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 27:3</a>, the word is used with this meaning. “While my breath is yet whole within me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils.” The Hebrew word <em>n<sup>e</sup>shamah</em>ʹ is used for the literal breath in this scripture, whereas <em>ruʹahh</em> is used for spirit, or life force.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Sometimes the word spirit indicates a person’s mental disposition. This is something that cannot be seen, but it manifests itself in a visible way by a person’s expressions or actions. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 34:18</a>, mental disposition is clearly indicated by the word spirit: “Jehovah is near to those that are broken at heart; and those who are crushed in spirit he saves.” As a rock is crushed with a hammer so does a repentant person feel crushed when God’s Word brings home to him the gravity of his sins. He humbly seeks forgiveness as did the people who were “stabbed to the heart” with guilt feelings from what Peter said to them at Pentecost. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963605/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 2:37</a>) So “crushed in spirit” indicates the mental disposition of a person who has become <span id="page503" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="503" data-before-text="503"></span>conscious of his sins and of his spiritual need.</p>

<strong>Integrity</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong><em>Job.</em></strong> Job, who evidently lived in the period between the death of Joseph and the time of Moses, is described as a man who had “proved to be blameless [Heb., <em>tam</em>] and upright, and fearing God and turning aside from bad.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002182/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 1:1</a>; see <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200002182/3">JOB</a>.) That human integrity forms part of the issue between Jehovah God and Satan is clear from God’s questioning his Adversary about Job when Satan appeared during an angelic assembly in the courts of heaven. Satan imputed false motive to Job’s worship of God, alleging that Job served not out of pure devotion but for selfish benefits. He thereby placed in question Job’s integrity to God. Permitted to divest Job of his vast possessions and even of his children, Satan failed to crack Job’s integrity. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002182/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Job 1:6–2:3</a>) He then claimed that Job was selfishly willing to endure the loss of possessions and children as long as he could save his own skin.

On my justness I have laid hold, and I shall not let it go; my heart will not taunt me for any of my days.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002182/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Job 27:5, 6</a>) His maintaining integrity demonstrated that God’s Adversary was a liar.</p>

<strong>Job, Book of</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Importance.</strong> The book of Job is essential, in conjunction with <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002476/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 3:1-6</a> and other scriptures, in revealing the great issue of the righteousness of God in his exercise of sovereignty as well as the manner in which the integrity of God’s earthly servants is involved in the issue. This issue Job did not understand, but he, nevertheless, did not allow his three companions to make him doubt that he had been a man of integrity. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002476/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 27:5</a>) He did not understand why his calamity came upon him, since he was no practicer of sin. He was off balance on the matter of self-justification, no doubt being pushed farther in that direction by the constant charges of his three companions. He was also mistaken in insisting on receiving an answer from God as to why he was suffering, when he should have realized that no one can rightly say to Jehovah: “Why did you make me this way?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002476/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ro 9:20</a>) Nevertheless, Jehovah mercifully answered Job, both through his servant Elihu and by speaking to Job from the windstorm. The book <span id="page84" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="84" data-before-text="84"></span>therefore strongly drives home the wrongness of attempting to justify oneself before God.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002476/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 40:8</a>.</p>

<strong>Everlasting Life on Earth—A God-Given Hope</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> During the time period between the lives of Abraham’s great-grandson Joseph and the prophet Moses, there lived a man named Job. The Bible book of Job, likely composed by Moses, explains why Jehovah allowed Job to suffer and how the matter turned out for him. However, the book of Job is not merely an account about one man’s trials; it centers on issues of universal importance. The book provides insight into Jehovah’s righteousness in exercising his sovereignty, and it reveals that the integrity and life prospects of all of God’s earthly servants are involved in the issue raised in Eden. Although Job did not understand this issue, he did not allow his three companions to make him think that he had failed as an integrity keeper. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2009601/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Job 27:5</a>) This should strengthen our faith and help us to realize that we can maintain our integrity and uphold Jehovah’s sovereignty.</p>

Although not an Israelite, Job was a worshiper of Jehovah, something that Jehovah drew to Satan’s attention. God’s statement that “there is no one like him in the earth, a man blameless and upright,” reveals that there was no other outstanding servant of God living at that time. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986164/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 1:8</a>) Thus, Job’s testing by Satan must have occurred while his distant cousins, the Israelites, were in slavery in Egypt​—sometime during the years following the death of the outstanding integrity keeper Joseph in 1657 B.C.E. and before Moses entered upon his course of integrity.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 3.

But how could he have learned about Job’s testing? Well, after Moses was forced to leave Egypt in 1553 B.C.E. he settled in Midian, not far from the land of Uz. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986164/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Exodus 2:15-25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986164/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Acts 7:23-30</a>) <span id="page11" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>At that time, Job was living out the final 140 years of life with which Jehovah blessed him.

However, Job would have known something about Jehovah’s dealings with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. This is because Job was evidently a descendant of Abraham’s brother Nahor, through Nahor’s firstborn son Uz. Furthermore, the brother of Uz was Bethuel, the father of Isaac’s wife Rebekah and the great-grandfather of Joseph. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986164/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Genesis 22:20-23</a>) Job no doubt came to treasure whatever knowledge he had of Jehovah’s communications with Abraham and his descendants, and he was anxious to please Jehovah. Thus Job became a man of outstanding integrity, a man blameless and completely devoted to Jehovah.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 5. What, in particular, makes Job’s integrity so outstanding?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Not long after Joseph’s death in Egypt, Job’s integrity became a subject of controversy between Jehovah God and Satan in the invisible heavens. Yet Job had no knowledge of this controversy that centered around his integrity. And it is, in particular, his ignorance regarding why he was suffering that makes his unbreakable integrity so remarkable. For the benefit of all God’s servants afterward, however, Jehovah had Moses record the details of the controversy regarding Job’s integrity.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>The Issue of Job’s Integrity</strong></p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 6.

But it is not a new one.

Raiding Sabeans take off with Job’s 1,000 oxen and 500 she-asses, killing all their attendants except one. Next, Satan sends a fire from heaven to consume Job’s 7,000 sheep along with their attendants, sparing only one of the men. Then Satan causes three bands of Chaldeans to take off with Job’s 3,000 camels, killing all but one of the attendants. Finally, Satan sends a great wind that strikes the house where Job’s ten children are feasting, and they all die. Afterward, in quick succession, the survivors of these disasters report the terrible news to Job.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986164/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Job 1:13-19</a>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 9.

Even if Job understood who had caused them, they would be difficult to bear. But he did not. He did not know that he was the center of a controversy in heaven and that Jehovah was using him to demonstrate that there are people who will hold to their integrity despite all the unjust suffering that Satan may bring upon them. Yet, stricken with grief and even thinking that somehow God was responsible for his losses, Job said: “Jehovah himself has given, and Jehovah himself has taken away. Let the name of Jehovah continue to be blessed.” Yes, “in all this Job did not sin or ascribe anything improper to God.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986164/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Job 1:20-22</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">10.

But Satan does not give up. He now challenges that if he is given the opportunity to strike Job physically, Job will curse God to his face. Trusting in Job’s integrity even to this extent, Jehovah gives permission, only warning Satan not to take Job’s life. So Satan ‘strikes Job with a malignant boil from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986164/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Job 2:1-8</a>) Job is reduced to such a disgustingly miserable state that his relatives and friends shy away, and former acquaintances mock him.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986164/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Job 12:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986164/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 17:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986164/15/2" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 19:13-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986164/15/3" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> 30:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986164/15/4" data-bid="16-5" class="b"> 10-12</a>.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">11.

Eliphaz’ speech, as well as the speeches of his companions that follow, is made up largely of accusations. After each of his accusers speaks, Job, in turn, answers, refuting their arguments.

They often state actual facts, but the setting and application are wrong. Satan used the same tactic against Jesus. Quoting a scripture that says that God’s angel would protect his servant from harm, Satan invited Jesus to prove he was God’s son by hurling himself down from the temple.

Paul, in writing to the Corinthians, says: “No temptation has taken you except what is common <span id="page370" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="370" data-before-text="370"></span>to men.

In this organization Jehovah has provided mature, properly trained, faithful overseers in every Christian congregation that are willing to help with any problem that we may have that interferes with our worship of God. They are ever ready to offer counsel from the Scriptures on how we should walk and the way we should talk so as to be identified as Jehovah’s integrity-keepers. Let us note what our relationship to these theocratically appointed overseers should be as set forth in Hebrews: “Remember those who are taking the lead among you, who have spoken the word of God to you, and as you contemplate how their conduct turns out imitate their faith.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Heb. 13:7</a>) Overseers must walk circumspectly before God, because Jehovah holds them responsible too. Of him that has much, more will be required.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Luke 12:48</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> We have many examples of men and women who maintained their integrity when put to the test. In their lives we can see illustrated examples of wholeheartedness to Jehovah God. We recognize that a pupil learns faster by having what he hears demonstrated, and that was the way that Christ Jesus taught his apostles and disciples. So if we watch the conduct of our overseers in the organization, then it will help us to maintain our uprightness.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Hebrews chap. 11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Matt. 11:1</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>EXAMPLES ANCIENT AND MODERN</strong></p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">16.

Satan tried to destroy Job’s integrity. Job lost first his material possessions, then his family whom he dearly loved. Finally he was plagued with disease and sickness. But in spite of Job’s losses and the wrong influence brought to bear against him, he endured it and proved Satan the Devil a liar. Job’s attitude was: “Until I expire I shall not take away my integrity from myself!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 27:5</a>) So God blessed him.

Do not underrate the Devil. He knows our weakest spot. He knows what may shake our faith. For some it may be the loss of material things, which would cause them to work harder to make more money to regain what they had before or to get as much as someone else. He may strike through loved ones, turning them against you because of your love for Jehovah God. If because of our love for Jehovah we lose the love of those dear to us, it should not affect our pure worship to Jehovah God. It should simply deepen our appreciation of the wonderful promise from God to provide a hundredfold. Jesus said: “Truly I say to you men, No one has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the sake of the good news who will not get a hundredfold.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Mark 10:29, 30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Matt. 10:37</a>.</p>

<strong>Why Do the Righteous Suffer?</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">At a meeting of the angelic sons of God in heaven Jehovah asked Satan: “Have you set your heart upon my servant Job, that there is no one like him in the earth, a man blameless and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad?” The fact that God called Job’s faithfulness to Satan’s attention indicates there was a contention as to whether human creatures would keep integrity to God. Satan’s reply proves that there was such an issue, for right away he makes excuses for Job’s faithfulness. He asserts that Job serves God because of the material blessings received and not because he loves him. He suggests: “‘For a change, <span id="page264" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="264" data-before-text="264"></span>thrust out your hand, please, and touch everything he has and see whether he will not curse you to your very face.’ Accordingly Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Look! Everything that he has is in your hand. Only against him himself do not thrust out your hand!’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 1:7-12</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Job maintained a righteous course despite everything the Devil could do; he proved that he served God because he loved him and wanted to be pleasing in his sight. Job believed in the integrity of his course, and so proclaimed to his accusers: “Until I expire I shall not take away my integrity from myself!”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Job 27:5</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Men of integrity have always been willing to suffer for what they believed in. Some have even sacrificed their lives because of love for a person or a country. The Bible records example after example of other persons that have had strong love for Almighty God. Above everything else, they wanted to live a righteous life in order to be an honor to God and thus prove the Devil’s claim that he could turn all human creatures away from God to be a lie. Although pursuing a course of righteousness has resulted in their suffering a great deal, they have maintained a proper attitude.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>PROPER ATTITUDE TOWARD SUFFERING</strong></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">It is true that in itself suffering does not bring happiness; but if one knows that a loved one is benefited or made happy, then he can rejoice even in the suffering. That is why the apostles, after receiving a flogging for preaching the good news of the Kingdom, “went their way from before the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy to be dishonored in behalf of his name.” They were obeying God’s command to preach and they knew that this was pleasing to him. Therefore they were happy, for, as the scripture says, “if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are happy.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Acts 5:40, 41;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 3:14</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">This helps one to appreciate what Jesus meant when he said in the sermon on the mount: “Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing against you for my sake. Rejoice and leap for joy, since your reward is great in the heavens.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 5:10-12</a>) When a Christian keeps integrity to God and suffers because of it he rejoices in the knowledge that he is proving the Devil a liar and is thus making Jehovah’s heart rejoice. Although the suffering does not make him happy, the fact that it contributes to the vindication of God’s name does. Then, too, one can rejoice because of the reward that is promised to the faithful.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Prov. 27:11</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Everyone today is bound to experience suffering because of living amid this wicked system of things and being subject to inherited imperfections due to sin. The righteous can also expect to suffer because of keeping integrity to God. But they can take heart and rejoice, for there is a new world of God’s making that is now so very close at hand. There suffering will be no more, for God promises that “he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be any more.” So never let present suffering embitter you. Look to the future. Yes, place your hope and confidence in God’s promised new world, where there will be no suffering.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Rev. 21:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 2 Pet. 3:13</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"></p>

Miserable comforters they turned out to be. One after the other, all three argued with Job to convince him that he was a religious hypocrite just as Satan had argued before <span id="page61" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="61" data-before-text="61"></span>God. They pressed their argument that Job had all along been a sinner and therefore God was punishing him. Job rightly denied this. He refused to give up his claim on his past integrity and said to these accusers: “It is unthinkable on my part that I should declare you men righteous! Until I expire I shall not take away my integrity from myself!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101975064/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Job 27:5</a>) In spite of Job’s claim to having been a man of integrity all along till this time of his illness, Job did not feel that Jehovah was exercising His universal sovereignty in a wrong, oppressive way. Job did not rebel against God for letting him suffer loss, sickness and false accusations in this way, in spite of the fact that he had faithfully served and worshiped the Universal Sovereign, Jehovah.</p>

So he defended the way he lived and acted. For example, he avoided all forms of idolatry; he treated others with kindness and dignity; he kept morally clean, cherishing his marriage; and above all, he remained loyally devoted to the only true God, Jehovah. Thus Job was able to say with his whole heart: “Until I die, I will not renounce my integrity!”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502019375/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Job 27:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502019375/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 31:1, 2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502019375/24/2" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> 9-11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502019375/24/3" data-bid="25-4" class="b"> 16-18,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502019375/24/4" data-bid="25-5" class="b"> 26-28</a>.</p><img src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/ijwia/2020/60" data-img-small-src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/ijwia/2020/61" alt="Job stands before Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar" width="300" height="169" class="south_center" />

<strong>Job, Book of</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The companions of Job said that God punishes the wicked. This is true. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012422/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Pet. 2:9</a>) But they concluded that all suffering one undergoes is a result of sins on that one’s part—that God is thereby administering punishment to him. Suffering, they said, is an evidence that an individual has specially sinned. They spoke untruthfully concerning God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012422/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 42:7</a>) They slandered Him. As they presented God, he was lacking in mercy. Their claim was that God has no delight in the integrity-keeping man and that he has no trust in His servants, even in angels. This denies the many Scriptural statements revealing Jehovah’s love for his intelligent servants. An example of God’s <span id="page940" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="940" data-before-text="940"></span>confidence and trust in his faithful worshipers is seen in his conversation with Satan, in which he called attention to Job and expressed the greatest confidence in Job’s loyalty when he let the Devil test Job. Note, however, that he protected Job’s life. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012422/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 2:6</a>) The Christian writer James expressly says of God’s dealings with Job, “that Jehovah is very tender in affection and merciful.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012422/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jas. 5:11</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>IMPORTANCE</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The book of Job is essential, in conjunction with <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012422/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 3:1-6</a> and other scriptures, in revealing the great issue of the righteousness of God in his exercise of sovereignty, and the manner in which the integrity of God’s earthly servants is involved in the issue. This issue Job did not understand, but he, nevertheless, preferred to endure suffering and death rather than turn away from God by violating his law. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012422/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 27:5</a>) He did not understand why his calamity came upon him, seeing he was no practicer of sin. He was off balance on the matter of self-justification, no doubt being pushed farther in that direction by the constant charges of his three companions. He was also mistaken in insisting on receiving an answer from God as to why he was suffering, when he should have realized that no one can rightly say to Jehovah: “Why did you make me this way?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012422/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rom. 9:20</a>) Nevertheless, Jehovah mercifully answered Job, both through his servant Elihu and by speaking to Job from the windstorm. The book therefore drives home strongly the wrongness of attempting to justify oneself before God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012422/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 40:8</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>AUTHENTICITY AND VALUE</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Ezekiel refers to Job, and James makes mention of him.

It also reveals much about the beliefs and customs of patriarchal society.

Job was a good example. Because he made good decisions, he could say: “My heart will not condemn me as long as I live.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102017561/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 27:6</a>) When Job spoke of his “heart,” he referred to his conscience, his sense of right and wrong. David, though, ignored his conscience at times and disobeyed Jehovah. Afterward he felt so guilty that it was as if his heart were “striking him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102017561/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Samuel 24:5</a>) This was David’s conscience telling him that what he had done was wrong.

He was careful to listen to his conscience, letting it guide his actions and decisions. Thus, he could say with real satisfaction that his conscience did not condemn him with shame and guilt. Notice the contrast between Job and David. When David showed disrespect for Saul, Jehovah’s anointed king, “afterward David’s heart kept striking him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102008061/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Samuel 24:5</a>) Those sharp pangs of conscience surely benefited David, teaching him to avoid such disrespect thereafter.</p>

According to the Jewish rabbi Rashbam, this method was used when a superior adjured an inferior, such as a master his servant or a father his son, who also owes him obedience. And according to another Jewish scholar, Abraham Ibn Ezra, it was the custom in those days for a servant to take an oath in this manner, placing his hand under his master’s thigh, the latter sitting upon his hand.
