<strong>Lasting Rule Depends on Promoting True Worship</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Now firmly established in his kingdom, <em>David lost no time in promoting the worship of God among the people, putting the interests of Jehovah’s worship first.</em> Since the days of High Priest Eli the ark of the <span id="page540" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="540" data-before-text="540"></span>covenant had not been at the Tabernacle built by Moses. For many years it had been kept in a home at Kiriath-jearim (Baale-judah). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Sam. 4:1 to 7:2</a>) David now had the Ark carried up to Mount Zion and placed in a tent in the city of David. <em>He made arrangements for the worship of God</em> by appointing ten Levites and two priests to serve before the Ark and <em>took the lead himself in true worship,</em> on that day composing and singing a new psalm, saying: “Give thanks to Jehovah, you people; call upon his name, make his deeds known among the peoples! . . . ‘Jehovah himself has become king!’ . . . Give thanks to Jehovah, you people, for he is good, for to time indefinite is his loving-kindness.” To this song the people said Amen.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Chron. 15:1 to 16:36;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 13:1-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 2 Sam. 6:1-19</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">David did not take the glory and credit to himself as Israel’s real king, but <em>he recognized that he ruled in the name of Jehovah on “Jehovah’s throne.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:23</a>) And <em>the people were encouraged to recognize this</em> in the psalm of Korah’s sons:</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="si">“Jehovah is great and much to be praised in the city of our God, in his holy mountain. Pretty for loftiness, the exultation of the whole earth, is Mount Zion on the remote sides of the north, the town of the grand King. . . . May Mount Zion rejoice, may the dependent towns of Judah be joyful, on account of your judicial decisions. March around Zion, you people, and go about it, count its towers. Set your hearts upon its rampart, inspect its dwelling towers, in order that you may recount it to the future generation.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 48:1-14</a>; see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 76:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">“To obey is better than a sacrifice,” God’s prophet Samuel had told disobedient King Saul. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Sam. 15:22</a>) <em>David recognized that obedience to God is required of even a king if his rulership is to last.</em> Would his dominion be removed like his predecessor Saul’s?

Jehovah responded in appreciation through his prophet Nathan:</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="si">“I shall prove to be with you wherever you do go, and I will cut off all your enemies from before you; and I shall certainly make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones that are in the earth. . . . ‘And Jehovah has told you that a house is what Jehovah will make for you. . . . I shall certainly raise up your seed after you, which will come out of your inward parts; and I shall indeed firmly establish his kingdom. He is the one that will build a house for my name, and I shall certainly establish the throne of his kingdom firmly to time indefinite. I myself shall become his father, and he himself will become my son. When he does wrong, I will also reprove him with the rod of men and with the strokes of the sons of Adam. As for my loving-kindness, it will not depart from him the way I removed it from Saul, whom I removed on account of you. And your house and your kingdom will certainly be steadfast to time indefinite before you; your very throne will become one firmly established to time indefinite.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964647/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Sam. 7:1-17</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">What a blessing from the Universal Sovereign!

Jerusalem is one that is built like a city that has been joined together in oneness, to which the tribes have gone up, the tribes of Jah, as a reminder to Israel to give thanks to the name of Jehovah.” This “grand King” is said to be “residing in Jerusalem” and to be the loving Protector of its people. “Jerusalem​—as mountains are all around it, so Jehovah is all around his people from now on and to time indefinite.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983206/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 48:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983206/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 122:2-4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983206/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 135:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983206/5/3" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> 125:1, 2</a>.</p>

The Israelites were privileged to do so three times a year—to celebrate the festival of unfermented cakes, the festival of harvest and the festival of ingathering. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969322/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Ex. 23:14-17</a>) When the temple stood in Jerusalem, anticipation ran high as the multitudes approached that city. Having <span id="page275" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="275" data-before-text="275"></span>an elevation of almost 2,600 feet, it was indeed “pretty for loftiness, the exultation of the whole earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969322/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Ps. 48:1, 2</a>) There at the temple one could hear the reading of Jehovah’s Word, observe the priests in action and hear the many musical instruments and Levitical voices blended in songs of praise to Jehovah. Services at the earlier tabernacle were highly beneficial spiritually, too, and so no wonder David exclaimed: “I rejoiced when they were saying to me: ‘To the house of Jehovah let us go.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969322/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Ps. 122:1</a>.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">16.

When they gather together for instruction in God’s Word, they incite one another to love and fine works. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969322/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Heb. 10:24, 25</a>) At such meetings they receive encouragement, even as Christians in Antioch did nineteen centuries ago, Luke reporting: “Judas and Silas, since they themselves were also prophets, encouraged the brothers with many a discourse and strengthened them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969322/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Acts 15:30-32</a>) Association with fellow believers also sharpens them up spiritually, for the Scriptures state: “By iron, iron itself is sharpened. So one man sharpens the face of another.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969322/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Prov. 27:17</a>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">17.

In commenting on a question, endeavor to express the idea in your own words, for it is rarely sufficient merely to read an answer from a Christian publication. Understanding what is meant therein is important. The Ethiopian eunuch to whom Philip preached might have been able to answer some queries about Isaiah’s prophecy, for he was reading it. He could read what it said. But he was unable to understand what was meant in one of its Messianic prophecies. The deeper meaning was obscure to him until Philip, starting with the particular scripture, “declared to him the good news about Jesus.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969322/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Acts 8:26-39</a>) Similarly today, a person who thinks deeply and listens carefully to the expressions of others at Christian meetings may come to understand a difficult Biblical matter. How wise it is, therefore, to reason actively on the information furnished at such a gathering by means of a Biblical discourse, a demonstration or other presentation.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">18, 19. What encouragement is there for those who are shy and find it difficult to express themselves verbally at Christian meetings?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Yet, it is difficult for some persons to comment, to express themselves. They are shy and would rather remain silent, letting others speak. However, such individuals <span id="page276" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="276" data-before-text="276"></span>can be encouraged by the fact that others with similar feelings have made spiritual progress. Paul lovingly told Timothy: “God gave us not a spirit of cowardice, but that of power and of love and of soundness of mind. Therefore do not become ashamed of the witness about our Lord.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969322/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">2 Tim. 1:7, 8</a>) Surely, Jehovah, “who daily carries the load for us” and who “cannot possibly allow your foot to totter,” will help you to express your faith verbally at Christian meetings and elsewhere.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969322/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Ps. 68:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969322/50/1" data-bid="51-2" class="b"> 121:3</a>.</p>

<strong>Death of a Dynasty</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">There is also a modern-day parallel that magnifies the importance of this prophecy. This “shining one” is spoken of as one “disabling the nations” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965485/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 14:12</a>), as one making “the productive land like the wilderness” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965485/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa 14:17</a>), and as one whose fall brings “the whole earth . . . to rest, . . . free of disturbance,” and causes people to “become cheerful with joyful cries” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965485/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa 14:7</a>). Consider the record of modern-day Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion under its invisible ruler, Satan the Devil. The leaders of Babylon the Great have represented God as a three-headed trinitarian monstrosity, an eternal-torment fiend, and have led the peoples of the earth to worship other false gods. They have exalted themselves with high-sounding titles. They have put their trust in materialism and military might and not in God or his Word, the Bible. By Concordats with dictators, by wars prosecuted in the name of religion, especially of “Christian” religion, they have disabled the nations, destroyed the productiveness of land, slaughtered the flower of manhood of the nations and brought extreme misery and <span id="page406" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="406" data-before-text="406"></span>sadness. What happened to Babylon and its dynasty of kings is a sure-to-be-fulfilled pattern of the annihilation of Babylon the Great, to the relief and joy of people of all nations.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">How did the situation come about, that the Babylonian dynasty of kings could entertain such ambitious visions? Well, the “king of Babylon” had enjoyed phenomenal success in defeating the nations. This projected him like a meteor to the position of Third World Power. As Isaiah tells us, he struck peoples “in fury with a stroke incessantly” and subdued nations “in sheer anger with a persecution without restraint” for not submitting voluntarily to world domination by Babylon. No earthly power was able to restrain him. He was like a woodcutter to the nations, cutting down their kings just like trees. He disabled the nations and put them in abject slavery to Babylon. He agitated the earth, making the kingdoms rock and bringing productive land to a wilderness, as, for example, when he finally destroyed Jerusalem and transported the people of Judah to Babylon, leaving the land desolate of man and domestic animal. He had no intention whatsoever of letting his prisoners go home, forever.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965485/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 14:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965485/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965485/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 16, 17</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The earlier successes of the “king of Babylon” did not satisfy him. He could have no rest until he overthrew the kings of Judah, since these sat on “Jehovah’s throne” at Jerusalem as the earthly representatives of God’s theocratic rule. As long as the throne at Jerusalem existed, the king of Babylon could not fully exalt his god Marduk. Ah, if he could but dethrone these kings of Judah, put them under his feet, then he would indeed be exalted to the heavens, above the stars, for in Bible prophecy the kings of the royal line of David were likened to stars. Representing Jehovah, they had a brilliance, a royal glory. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965485/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Num. 24:17</a>) <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965485/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm forty-eight</a> speaks of the temple located in the city of Zion, on an elevated place near the palace of the Judean kings. To this place Jehovah commanded all Israel to come up three times a year. Thus it became the “mountain of meeting.” The psalmist says: “Jehovah is great and much to be praised in the city of our God, in his holy mountain. Pretty for loftiness, the exultation of the whole earth, is Mount Zion on the remote sides of the north, the town of the grand King [Jehovah].” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965485/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps 48:1, 2</a>) If Babylon’s king could only displace these “stars,” then he would, in his own eyes and the eyes of the Babylonians, occupy a position “upon the mountain of meeting, in the remotest parts of the north,” comparable to that of Jehovah, who established these kings on Zion.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">To the ancient pagan world, the king of Babylon would make himself resemble the Most High. In effect, the Babylonian stargazers could see, as it were, a new star sparkling in the heavens with a brightness surpassing that of other stars. He would outshine the “stars of God.” When he took Zedekiah off the throne and destroyed Jerusalem with its temple of Jehovah, he felt he had reached this heavenly pinnacle.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965485/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Ki. 25:1-7</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>BABYLON’S DYNASTY THE “SHINING ONE” (LUCIFER)</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">At this point it is well to discuss the meaning of the Hebrew word <em>heilēlʹ,</em> translated “shining one.” It also means “brightness” and, according to some Hebrew-English Lexicons, the entire expression “shining one, son of the dawn” means “morning star,” which was the brightest star in the heavens. The English <em>Authorized Version</em> uses the name Lucifer, as does also the Roman Catholic Douay Version of the Bible. Both were following the Latin <em>Vulgate</em> translation, which uses Lucifer, meaning “Light Bearer.” Lucifer, <span id="page407" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="407" data-before-text="407"></span>however, is not the name of the king of Babylon. Lucifer, as a name, was applied to Satan the Devil by early uninspired religious writers of our Common Era. Notice that the Latin <em>Vulgate</em> uses the word <em>lucifer</em> again, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965485/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Peter 1:19</a>, and there applies it, not to Satan the Devil, but to the “day star” that was to arise for Christian hearts. So this term <em>heilēlʹ,</em> or <em>lucifer,</em> applies to Satan the Devil only as the earthly king of Babylon symbolizes that wicked spirit or reflects him. Of course, Satan the Devil was Babylon’s real god and invisible king, as well as being ruler over modern-day Babylon the Great.</p>

David not only maintained separateness from this cruel, immoral world of confused religionists, but he removed their contaminating influence by driving them right out from the God-given land of Israel.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Deut. 11:22-25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2 Sam. 8:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960041/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 14</a>.</p>

He worked through that one theocratic organization, not several. In time it was replaced by a new system, and for a new, visible theocratic organization Christ “gave gifts in men”, which men served in various capacities in the one theocratic arrangement.

Under the term “slave” Christ’s anointed followers of today are viewed as a class, a composite slave or composite servant. God himself so interprets matters: “Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952083/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa. 43:10</a>, <em>AS</em>) Note that many witnesses are called one servant. Under the term “domestics” those making up the slave class are viewed as individuals. They are spoken of as “body of attendants” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952083/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 12:42</a> (<em>NW</em>).

S. Lewis, renders it “companions”, that is, companion slaves. They are domestic slaves in the household of God and, as a united class or society, are termed “the faithful and discreet slave”. Similarly, when a number of domestics turn wicked and start to beat their <span id="page78" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="78" data-before-text="78"></span>fellow slaves these evildoers become the foretold “evil slave” class.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952083/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 24:48-51</a>, <em>NW.</em></p>

His word is never broken. His promises, though thousands of years old, are and will be carried into effect. In pre-Christian times Jehovah caused his prophets to have holy dreams and visions which were recorded by these servants, to the end that his faithful people at the appointed times should read and understand them, so providing them with knowledge, guidance and comfort. Often the servant who was given the vision did not perceive its meaning, the simple reason being that it was not for him but for others. Jehovah gives the vision and hides its meaning, and he it is who reveals the meaning thereof and to whomsoever he chooses. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951483/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 25:14</a>) And now, in the articles to follow, we shall learn that the Almighty Deliverer will set free all lovers of truth and righteousness, and rebuild his holy city (Zion, God’s organization) and make it “beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth”.

The day has now come for judgment, which means condemnation to the oppressors, deliverance to the oppressed, for the complete vindication of God’s faithful people and for the praising of his holy name. Therefore, of special importance are the visions and wonders seen by Daniel and recorded for these last days. They were not given for this faithful prophet’s guidance, but for a time when the saints of the Most High God would be living amidst terrible corruption and violence in the world; when they would be preserving unshaken attachment to the truth, though in a situation encompassed with difficulties and surrounded by temptations; at a time when they would be publicly confessing their faith, their worship and the prophecies in Jehovah’s holy service amid grave dangers, expressing God’s judgments in defiance of intemperate, powerful, and ruthless tyrants. During this time they would experience miraculous proofs of his undeserved kindness and protecting care.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> The visions and wonders recorded in the book of Daniel are for the comfort, encouragement and strength of the people of Jehovah, this despite the generally accepted view expressed by Bible commentators that all of them are to be understood as having a fulfillment over an extended period of thousands of years, furnishing a historical description of successive kingdoms and world empires, all of which are to be fulfilled before Messiah’s reign. It is now clearly revealed that a number of these visions were to enter upon their complete fulfillment when Christ’s kingdom began. Hence they are not pre-Kingdom prophecies, but apply when the Kingdom is set up. Once this fact is grasped and appreciated we shall get the force and application <span id="page399" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="399" data-before-text="399"></span>of these marvelous visions, and even learn of events taking place in heaven itself, which events have their effect upon God’s people and the nations of earth.

God causes his word to come to pass, and he reveals his sacred secrets to whomsoever he wishes. Grasp the importance of these fulfilled visions, realize their import, know that we are in the day of prosperity and the time of blessedness is here. God’s Servant is revealed to the nations by His witnesses on earth, and that Servant will have to be recognized before God’s favor will be granted them. There is no other way of obtaining a knowledge of the truth. “Bind thou up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples,” says Jehovah’s great Servant.

March around Zion, you people, and go about it, count its towers. Set your hearts upon its rampart. Inspect its dwelling towers, in order that you may recount it to the future generation.” (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001556/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Heb 12:22</a>.) This would be especially meaningful to Jews who would look up at the great stronghold of Jerusalem situated on an elevation higher than nearly any other major capital city in human history, with its mighty walls of defense. Through the prophet Zechariah, Jehovah speaks of himself as “a wall of fire all around” Jerusalem. This gives his people encouraging assurance that, while walls of stone can be broken down, Jehovah himself is really the defense of his servants.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001556/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ps 48:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001556/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 11-13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001556/24/2" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> Zec 2:4, 5</a>.</p>

<strong>Death and Hades to Give Up the Dead</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> A very personal question, therefore, suggests itself to us. It is this: If, sometime <span id="page40" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="40" data-before-text="40"></span>in the future, you and I die and get buried in a tomb or grave, will a resurrection, a return to life from the sleep of death, be granted to us according to God’s will? If so, how may we know? Who will be resurrected with us? Will any not be resurrected from the dead? This very question has caught the interest of many Jews, even though they hold to only the Hebrew Scriptures, the first part of what we call the Holy Bible.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">12.

They have imagined some wild and really gruesome things about it, such as widely scattered parts of human corpses whizzing through the air to join the other members to which they belonged in one body at death. The Bible presents no such frightful picture of the resurrection time, not even in the prophet Ezekiel’s vision of the valley of dry bones that Almighty God’s power brought together and clothed with living flesh again. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965041/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ezek. 37:1-10</a>) Far differently, by means of suitable symbols, the last book of the Bible gives us a picture of the earthly resurrection after the wicked powers in heaven and on earth have been chased away. This hope-inspiring vision enables us to determine who will take part in the earthly resurrection.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">13.

From before him the earth and the heaven fled away, and no place was found for them. And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and scrolls were opened. But another scroll was opened; it is the scroll of life. And the dead were judged out of those things written in the scrolls according to their deeds.

While such ones may use their position to make unjust gain at the expense of others, we should not yield to panicky fear, nor should we become envious of the prosperity that self-seeking men might enjoy. All they have is their material wealth. They boast about what they own and, instead of looking to the Creator for protection and security, trust in unstable material riches. The psalmist goes on to show clearly why we should not fear or envy any of such men. They will not live to time indefinite, nor is their wealth a lasting possession. He writes:</p>

<strong>A Riddle with a Comforting Answer</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Then comes the puzzling question: “Why should I be afraid in the days of evil, when the very error of my supplanters surrounds me?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979325/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 49:5</a>) Yes, should he give way to dread when days of suffering come to him on account of oppressive supplanters, men who would deprive him of his God-given rights? As the following <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979325/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps 49 verses 6-10</a> indicate, these “supplanters” were wealthy individuals. While such ones may use their position to make unjust gain at the expense of others, we should not yield to panicky fear, nor should we become envious of the prosperity that self-seeking men might enjoy. All they have is their material wealth. They boast about what they own and, instead of looking to the Creator for protection and security, trust in unstable material riches. The psalmist goes on to show clearly why we should not fear or envy any of such men. They will not live to time indefinite, nor is their wealth a lasting possession. He writes:</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“Those who are trusting in their means of maintenance, and who keep boasting about the abundance of their riches, not one of them can by any means redeem even a brother, nor give to God a ransom for him; (and the redemption price of their soul is so precious that it has ceased to time indefinite) that he should still live forever and not see the pit. For he sees that even the wise ones die, together the stupid one and the unreasoning one perish, and they must leave to others their means of maintenance.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979325/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 49:6-10</a>.</p>

The firstborn already belonged exclusively to Jehovah because he had saved them from being destroyed during the tenth plague upon Egypt. But now Jehovah wanted the tribe of Levi to serve at his sanctuary in exchange for the firstborn. However, a census revealed that there were 273 more of the Israelite firstborn than there were Levites. Therefore, to redeem these 273, the Israelites had to pay a ransom for each one. God was very strict in this transaction.

<strong>Atonement</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">As used in the Bible, “atonement” has the basic thought of “cover” or “exchange,” and that which is given in exchange for, or as a “cover” for, another thing must be its duplicate. Thus, anything making satisfaction for something that is lost or forfeited must be “at one” with that other thing, completely covering it as its exact equivalent. There must be no overlapping and no coming short. No imperfect human could provide such a covering or atonement to restore perfect human life to any or all of mankind. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000461/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps 49:7, 8</a>) To make adequate atonement for what was forfeited by Adam, a sin offering having the precise value of a perfect human life would have to be provided.</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991123/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Philippians 2:7</a>) Jehovah transferred the life-force and the personality pattern of his firstborn heavenly Son to the womb of a Jewish virgin named Mary. Holy spirit then ‘overshadowed her,’ guaranteeing that the child growing in her womb would be holy, absolutely free of sin. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991123/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Luke 1:35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991123/42/1" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 2:22</a>) As a man, he would be called Jesus.

For centuries Christendom’s theologians argued that it was paid to Satan the Devil. The fact is that mankind has been “sold under” sin and thus has come under the control of Satan. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991123/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Romans 7:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991123/45/1" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> 1 John 5:19</a>) Still, Jehovah, not Satan, “exacts punishment” for wrongdoing. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991123/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a>) Therefore, as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991123/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Psalm 49:7</a> explicitly states, the ransom is to be paid “to God.” Jehovah makes the ransom available, but after the Lamb of God has been sacrificed, the value of his ransom must be paid to God. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991123/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Genesis 22:7, 8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991123/48/1" data-bid="49-2" class="b"> 11-13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991123/48/2" data-bid="49-3" class="b"> Hebrews 11:17</a>.) This does not reduce the ransom to a pointless, mechanical exchange, as if money were taken out of one pocket and put in another. The ransom involves not so much a physical exchange as a legal transaction. By insisting that a ransom be paid​—even at great cost to himself—​Jehovah affirmed his unwavering adherence to righteous principles.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991123/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">James 1:17</a>.</p>

<strong>Why Did Jesus Christ Call Himself the “Amen”?</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">So the human race needed to be released from enslavement to sin. Only by being ransomed from this slavery could they become reconciled to God. Since Adam had forfeited perfect human life, the ransom price would have to be the exact equivalent​—perfect human life. No imperfect descendant of Adam could pay this valuable price. That is why the Bible says: “A person can never redeem himself; he cannot pay God the price for his life, because the payment for a human life is too great. What he could pay would never be enough to keep him from the grave, to let him live forever.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101978649/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 49:7-9</a>, <em>Today’s English Version.</em></p>

<strong>“Good News”—Even for Our Day!</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">When Adam violated God’s law, he lost perfect human life for himself and for his unborn offspring. Thus the entire human race came into slavery to sin and death. A ransom price was needed to free the human family from this slavery. That price had to be the exact equivalent of what Adam lost through his disobedience​—perfect human life.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">No human effort could provide this valuable price. The hopelessness of doing so is well described by the inspired psalmist: “Not one of them can by any means redeem even a brother, nor give to God a ransom for him; (and the redemption price of their soul is so precious that it has ceased to time indefinite) that he should still live forever and not see the pit.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977002/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 49:7-9</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">However, through a miracle Jehovah God provided what was needed. By means of his holy spirit, he transferred the life of his only-begotten Son from the heavens to the womb of the Jewish virgin Mary. Hence, this one, who came to be called Jesus Christ, could be born “holy,” free from sin. The angel Gabriel made this clear when saying to Mary: “Holy spirit will come upon you, and power of the Most High will overshadow you. For that reason also what is born will be called holy, God’s Son.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977002/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Luke 1:35</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Being perfect as was Adam when created, Jesus could offer up his life in sacrifice, thereby furnishing the needed ransom price. In effect, he stepped in for the human race, taking upon himself the penalty that sinful mankind deserves​—death. Explaining this, the apostle Peter wrote: “He himself bore our sins in his own body upon the stake, in order that we might be done with sins and live to righteousness. And ‘by his stripes you were healed.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977002/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:24</a>) Since that time humans have been given the opportunity to accept, on God’s terms, the benefits of this ransom provision.</p>

In the Law covenant God plainly commanded: “If a fatal accident should occur, then you must give soul for soul, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, branding for branding, wound for wound, blow for blow.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974039/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Exodus 21:23-25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974039/42/1" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> Deuteronomy 19:21</a>) In other words, like should go for like, something of equal value for something of equal value. So an uncondemned human life would have to go for a human life that had come under condemnation. This is why it is written in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974039/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Psalm 49:6-10</a>: “Those who are trusting in their means of maintenance, and who keep boasting about the abundance of their riches, not one of them can by any means redeem even a brother, nor give to God a ransom for him; (and the redemption price of their soul is so precious that it has ceased to time indefinite) that he should still live forever and not see the pit.

There is nothing else to do but look to the Messianic King whom Jehovah God swore to make a “priest to time indefinite according to the manner of Melchizedek!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974039/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Psalm 110:1-4</a>) This one should be the “seed” of God’s heavenly “woman,” the seed whom God appoints and enables to bruise the head of the wicked one symbolized by that “serpent” in Eden. If this one were not to provide the redemptive ransom for all mankind, then there is no help for us humans, <span id="page117" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="117" data-before-text="117"></span>no outlook for eternal life in a righteous new order under Jehovah God. So, then, the animal sacrifices that were offered on Israel’s “day of atonement” down to the first century C.E. must be pictorial; they must picture prophetically the needed ransom sacrifice that was to be offered by the Messiah who becomes the Melchizedekian priest, the Bruiser of the serpent’s head.</p>

<strong>Is Perfect Health in a Perfect Environment Possible?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">To gain true health, something more than medical treatment and a good environment is needed. As anyone who has gone to a doctor can tell you, medical services, while sometimes helpful, do not bring perfect health. Nor are people who live out in the country, away from the heavy pollution of the cities, free from the deterioration of old age. Mankind today staggers under the inherited burden of sin, and it is this that produces sickness and eventually results in death. No imperfect human can liberate himself or anyone else from this condition.

The firstborn already belonged exclusively to Jehovah because he had saved them from being destroyed during the tenth plague upon Egypt. But now Jehovah wanted the tribe of Levi to serve at his sanctuary in exchange for the firstborn. However, a census revealed that there were 273 more of the Israelite firstborn than there were Levites. Therefore, to redeem these 273, the Israelites had to pay a ransom for each one.

Hence the deliverance of Jonah was a prophetic picture of the resurrection of the Son of God from the dead. After his resurrection the “keys of death and of Haʹdes” were given to Jesus Christ, that he might be God’s Agent in raising all the others who are in Haʹdes or Sheol and in the condition of death. No man can, by his own means and arrangements, escape death and Sheol or Haʹdes, the grave that is common to dead mankind in the dust of the earth.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">10.

Likewise, those who die and are buried in Sheol or Haʹdes cannot come up out of that place of death and decay by their own power. The deathly diseased prophet Job spoke of this inability of man when he mournfully said: “The eye of him that sees me will not behold me; your eyes will be upon me, but I shall not be. The cloud certainly comes to its end and goes away; so he that is going down to Sheol will not come up.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 7:8, 9</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">11.

That is why numbers of Bible translators render these two words into English as “the grave” (not, a grave). The <em>Authorized Version</em> or King James Bible Version renders the Hebrew word Sheol as “the grave” thirty-one times and as “the pit” three times, and the Greek word Haʹdes as “grave” once (in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:55</a>). But for centuries the religious clergy of Christendom have taught that Haʹdes is a place of fiery torment. So now our question is, What is the condition of people who are dead in Sheol or Haʹdes? Are they consciously alive as immortals, or are they really dead and out of existence? What does God’s own Word, the Holy Bible, not the clergy of Christendom, say in answer to this question?</p>

Without his death we would have no hope of regaining the state of sinlessness and perfection originally possessed by our forefather Adam. We would have no hope of seeing the day when death no longer would terminate every human life-span. We would have no hope of experiencing a release from captivity to death by means of a resurrection. His life as a perfect human was given up as a ransom for us.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">To ransom means to redeem from captivity or punishment by paying a price. A ransom buys back or releases, delivering a person from distress and trouble. Because our forefather Adam broke the law of God he missed the mark or standard of righteousness that God had set for all his creatures. Since no one can “produce someone clean out of someone unclean,” Adam’s offspring inherited the sinful condition he came into by his act of disobedience. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963726/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 14:4</a>) From his day down to our day all his descendants have been born in sin and have been subject to death. “Through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963726/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12</a>) Was there any means by which man might be delivered from sin and death? Yes, but it was not up to man to decide how such deliverance could be had; it could be only by the making of atonement in harmony with God’s righteous law. Since, by his disobedience to God, Adam had lost the right to perfect human life for himself and his offspring, what he lost could be regained by obedient ones in God’s due time only if a ransom price were paid that was equal to what had been lost. A corresponding ransom was required to satisfy God’s just law.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">No descendant of Adam has been able to provide the required ransom price because none has been sinless and perfect. “Not one of them can by any means redeem even a brother, nor give to God a ransom for him; (and the redemption price of their soul is so precious that it has ceased to time indefinite) that he should still live forever and not see the pit.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963726/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 49:7-9</a>) Only God could provide it, but he was under no obligation to do so. It was an act of kindness, undeserved by Adam’s descendants, that God lovingly did provide a ransom price for them. The price was his only-begotten Son whose life he transferred from the heavens to the womb of Mary so that his Son would be born a perfect human. With Jesus’ life-force coming from heaven rather than from Adam by means of procreation, he was free from the effects of Adam’s sin. He was sinless.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">By giving up his perfect human life, Jesus Christ paid the necessary ransom price that corresponded in value with the life of Adam before Adam sinned. “For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, a man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a corresponding ransom for all.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963726/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:5, 6</a>) Once the ransom was paid, another such sacrifice for sins was unnecessary. “Neither is it in order that he should offer himself often, as indeed the high priest enters into the holy place from year to year with blood not his own. Otherwise, <span id="page605" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="605" data-before-text="605"></span>he would have to suffer often from the founding of the world. But now he has manifested himself once for all time at the conclusion of the systems of things to put sin away through the sacrifice of himself.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963726/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 9:25, 26</a>.</p>

Thus, anything making satisfaction for something that is lost or forfeited must be “at one” with that other thing, completely covering it as its exact equivalent. There must be no overlapping and no coming short. No imperfect human could provide such a covering or atonement to restore perfect human life to any or all of mankind.

<strong>Why Did Jesus Christ Call Himself the “Amen”?</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">So the human race needed to be released from enslavement to sin. Only by being ransomed from this slavery could they become reconciled to God. Since Adam had forfeited perfect human life, the ransom price would have to be the exact equivalent​—perfect human life. No imperfect descendant of Adam could pay this valuable price. That is why the Bible says: “A person can never redeem himself; he cannot pay God the price for his life, because the payment for a human life is too great. What he could pay would never be enough to keep him from the grave, to let him live forever.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101978649/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 49:7-9</a>, <em>Today’s English Version.</em></p>

<strong>A Nation That Entered a Covenant with God</strong><br/><p id="p40" data-pid="40" data-rel-pid="[83]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="34"><sup>34</sup></span> We can see the reason for this. In the Law covenant God plainly commanded: “If a fatal accident should occur, then you must give soul for soul, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, branding for branding, wound for wound, blow for blow.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974039/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Exodus 21:23-25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974039/42/1" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> Deuteronomy 19:21</a>) In other words, like should go for like, something of equal value for something of equal value. So an uncondemned human life would have to go for a human life that had come under condemnation. This is why it is written in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974039/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Psalm 49:6-10</a>: “Those who are trusting in their means of maintenance, and who keep boasting about the abundance of their riches, not one of them can by any means redeem even a brother, nor give to God a ransom for him; (and the redemption price of their soul is so precious that it has ceased to time indefinite) that he should still live forever and not see the pit. For he sees that even the wise ones die.” There must be a corresponding ransom, and none of the sin-laden Israelites could provide that in order to redeem the perfect life that was forfeited by Adam.</p><p id="p84" data-pid="84" class="qu">35.

There is nothing else to do but look to the Messianic King whom Jehovah God swore to make a “priest to time indefinite according to the manner of Melchizedek!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974039/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Psalm 110:1-4</a>) This one should be the “seed” of God’s heavenly “woman,” the seed whom God appoints and enables to bruise the head of the wicked one symbolized by that “serpent” in Eden. If this one were not to provide the redemptive ransom for all mankind, then there is no help for us humans, <span id="page117" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="117" data-before-text="117"></span>no outlook for eternal life in a righteous new order under Jehovah God. So, then, the animal sacrifices that were offered on Israel’s “day of atonement” down to the first century C.E. must be pictorial; they must picture prophetically the needed ransom sacrifice that was to be offered by the Messiah who becomes the Melchizedekian priest, the Bruiser of the serpent’s head.</p>

<strong>Is Perfect Health in a Perfect Environment Possible?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">To gain true health, something more than medical treatment and a good environment is needed. As anyone who has gone to a doctor can tell you, medical services, while sometimes helpful, do not bring perfect health. Nor are people who live out in the country, away from the heavy pollution of the cities, free from the deterioration of old age. Mankind today staggers under the inherited burden of sin, and it is this that produces sickness and eventually results in death.

The firstborn already belonged exclusively to Jehovah because he had saved them from being destroyed during the tenth plague upon Egypt. But now Jehovah wanted the tribe of Levi to serve at his sanctuary in exchange for the firstborn. However, a census revealed that there were 273 more of the Israelite firstborn than there were Levites. Therefore, to redeem these 273, the Israelites had to pay a ransom for each one.

The mother of the prophet Samuel voiced that same fact when she said: “Jehovah is a Killer and a Preserver of life, a Bringer down to Sheol, and He brings up.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Sam. 2:6</a>) Mary, the mother of Jesus, spoke in praise to Jehovah with a similar thought in mind.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Luke 1:46-55</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>DEAD OR CONSCIOUSLY ALIVE—WHICH?</strong></p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">13.

That is why numbers of Bible translators render these two words into English as “the grave” (not, a grave). The <em>Authorized Version</em> or King James Bible Version renders the Hebrew word Sheol as “the grave” thirty-one times and as “the pit” three times, and the Greek word Haʹdes as “grave” once (in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:55</a>). But for centuries the religious clergy of Christendom have taught that Haʹdes is a place of fiery torment. So now our question is, What is the condition of people who are dead in Sheol or Haʹdes? Are they consciously alive as immortals, or are they really dead and out of existence? What does God’s own Word, the Holy Bible, not the clergy of Christendom, say in answer to this question?</p>

<strong>Why Such a Costly Ransom Price?</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">As is evident from the Mosaic law, such a ransom for humankind must result in a balancing​—on the scales of justice—​of what was forfeited. Adam lost perfect human life. Hence, the ransom price for the human race would have to be a perfect <span id="page431" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="431" data-before-text="431"></span>human life. Only a perfect human life could balance the scale of perfect justice. Not one of the descendants of Adam could provide such a precious price for himself or for anyone else. The incapability of mankind is well described in the Bible: “Not one of them can by any means redeem even a brother, nor give to God a ransom for him; (and the redemption price of their soul is so precious that it has ceased to time indefinite) that he should still live forever and not see the pit.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1975524/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 49:7-9</a>.</p>

<strong>Is Perfect Health in a Perfect Environment Possible?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">To gain true health, something more than medical treatment and a good environment is needed. As anyone who has gone to a doctor can tell you, medical services, while sometimes helpful, do not bring perfect health. Nor are people who live out in the country, away from the heavy pollution of the cities, free from the deterioration of old age. Mankind today staggers under the inherited burden of sin, and it is this that produces sickness and eventually results in death. No imperfect human can liberate himself or anyone else from this condition.

<strong>The Ransom, Marvelous Expression of Love and Justice</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> God’s legal requirement of perfect justice is evident in his law to Israel: “Soul will be for soul, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971323/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Deut. 19:21</a>) God’s exactness in this matter was illustrated also in his dealing with Israel when he selected a tribe for temple service to him. The firstborn already belonged exclusively to Jehovah because he had saved them from being destroyed during the tenth plague upon Egypt. But now Jehovah wanted the tribe of Levi to serve at his sanctuary in exchange for the firstborn. However, a census revealed that there were 273 more of the Israelite firstborn than there were Levites. Therefore, to redeem these 273, the Israelites had to pay a ransom for each one. God was very strict in this transaction. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971323/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Num. 3:39-51</a>) Also, if a person committed murder, no money or other ransom could be taken for the man; he had to die. He had to give soul for soul.

As far as man’s ability was concerned, relief was so far <span id="page272" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="272" data-before-text="272"></span>away that it was to time indefinite, actually beyond hope.</p>

<strong>Part Two</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> It was Almighty God, whose name is Jehovah, who miraculously brought up Jonah the prophet out of the belly of the huge fish on the third day. This same God, Jehovah, brought up his faithful prophet <span id="page46" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="46" data-before-text="46"></span>Jesus Christ out of the “heart of the earth” on the third day. Hence the deliverance of Jonah was a prophetic picture of the resurrection of the Son of God from the dead. After his resurrection the “keys of death and of Haʹdes” were given to Jesus Christ, that he might be God’s Agent in raising all the others who are in Haʹdes or Sheol and in the condition of death. No man can, by his own means and arrangements, escape death and Sheol or Haʹdes, the grave that is common to dead mankind in the dust of the earth.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">10.

Is it all in vain that you have created all the sons of men? What able-bodied man is there alive who will not see death? Can he provide escape for his soul from the hand of Sheol?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 89:47, 48</a>) For this reason those dedicated Christians today who will survive the coming battle of Armageddon and enter into a righteous new order on earth with the opportunity of never dying will survive only by means of God’s miraculous power of protection and preservation. Likewise, those who die and are buried in Sheol or Haʹdes cannot come up out of that place of death and decay by their own power. The deathly diseased prophet Job spoke of this inability of man when he mournfully said: “The eye of him that sees me will not behold me; your eyes will be upon me, but I shall not be. The cloud certainly comes to its end and goes away; so he that is going down to Sheol will not come up.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 7:8, 9</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">11.

Is it all in vain that you have created all the sons of men? What able-bodied man is there alive who will not see death? Can he provide escape for his soul from the hand of Sheol?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 89:47, 48</a>) For this reason those dedicated Christians today who will survive the coming battle of Armageddon and enter into a righteous new order on earth with the opportunity of never dying will survive only by means of God’s miraculous power of protection and preservation. Likewise, those who die and are buried in Sheol or Haʹdes cannot come up out of that place of death and decay by their own power. The deathly diseased prophet Job spoke of this inability of man when he mournfully said: “The eye of him that sees me will not behold me; your eyes will be upon me, but I shall not be. The cloud certainly comes to its end and goes away; so he that is going down to Sheol will not come up.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 7:8, 9</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">11.

For he sees that even the wise ones die, together the stupid one and the unreasoning one perish, and they must leave to others their means of maintenance.” Unlike a materialistic rich man, the inspired psalmist trusts in Almighty God Jehovah and says: “However, God himself will redeem my soul from the hand of Sheol, for he will receive me.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 49:15</a>.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">12.

O Jehovah, you have brought up my soul from Sheol itself; you have kept me alive, that I should not go down into the pit.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 30:2, 3</a>) Not only can this God of David keep a person from going down into death and the grave prematurely but he can also bring up the dead from Sheol or Haʹdes by means of a resurrection, just as he did in the case of his own Son Jesus Christ. The mother of the prophet Samuel voiced that same fact when she said: “Jehovah is a Killer and a Preserver of life, a Bringer down to Sheol, and He brings up.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Sam. 2:6</a>) Mary, the mother of Jesus, spoke in praise to Jehovah with a similar thought in mind.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Luke 1:46-55</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>DEAD OR CONSCIOUSLY ALIVE—WHICH?</strong></p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">13.

That is why numbers of Bible translators render these two words into English as “the grave” (not, a grave). The <em>Authorized Version</em> or King James Bible Version renders the Hebrew word Sheol as “the grave” thirty-one times and as “the pit” three times, and the Greek word Haʹdes as “grave” once (in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:55</a>). But for centuries the religious clergy of Christendom have taught that Haʹdes is a place of fiery torment. So now our question is, What is the condition of people who are dead in Sheol or Haʹdes? Are they consciously alive as immortals, or are they really dead and out of existence? What does God’s own Word, the Holy Bible, not the clergy of Christendom, say in answer to this question?</p>

<strong>Wise Sayings for the Modern Day</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> The stupid person does not keep God in mind or in view; the understanding person does. He is not only wise in fearing Jehovah; he is understanding. He is acting in accord with his godly fear. It was God <span id="page664" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="664" data-before-text="664"></span>himself who said: “Look! the fear of Jehovah—that is wisdom, and to turn away from bad is understanding.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957807/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Job 28:28</a>) The understanding person will not refuse a reproof and then ridicule: “The ridiculer you should strike, that the inexperienced one may become shrewd; and there should be a reproving of the understanding one, that he may discern knowledge.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957807/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Prov. 19:25</a>) A mere reproof, not a violent blow, is enough for an understanding person. In spite of all his wisdom, he may act indiscreetly or wrongly. For that reason he may from time to time need a reproof to bring him back to understanding. Encrusted in old age, King Solomon did not take heed to a mere reproof. Despite all the wisdom with which God had favored him, he turned to stupidity. Why? Because he left off understanding. How? He let his vision and his keen sense of his relationship to Jehovah God grow dull; he became like a beast. “Earthling man, although in honor, who does not understand, is indeed comparable with the beasts that have been destroyed.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957807/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Ps. 49:20</a>.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">23.

And respecting this thing he commanded him not to go after other gods, but he had not kept that which Jehovah had commanded.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957807/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">1 Ki. 11:9, 10</a>) The great wisdom from which Solomon fell to a death in God’s disfavor can be appreciated when we turn to the writings of Solomon that he composed under inspiration as one of Jehovah’s witnesses.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">24. Why should we never ridicule the things of God, and why will we try to make knowledge, wisdom and understanding a part of ourselves?</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> Let us never ridicule the things of God. The life-giving knowledge of the true God will never be got that way. One who understands his creative tie with God and his total dependence upon him will find it easy to know him. “The ridiculer has sought to find wisdom, and there is none; but to the understanding one knowledge is an easy thing.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957807/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Prov. 14:6</a>) Seeing, then, how knowledge, wisdom and understanding must be kept together, and how needful all three are to life and right conduct, we will try to make them an inseparable part of ourselves.

<strong>Animal Worship—Ancient and Modern</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">And note also the appeal the American Feline Society, an international organization <span id="page518" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="518" data-before-text="518"></span>that spends some $25,000 annually in popularizing the cat and in encouraging people to take care of stray cats, makes: “We need help urgently: More volunteers—more memberships—more substantial contributions.” The society also “urges you to become a member or contributor, thus furthering the cause of catdom.” Its president evinces a zeal and enthusiasm for his cause that is definitely religious and therefore a form of animal worship.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">And there are other worshipers of animals. Those who feel there must be a place in heaven for pets; those who are so concerned with the plight of lower animals that they are oblivious of God’s requirements or the miseries of their fellow men. Included among such are many among the vegetarians and antivivisectionists. Their zeal resembles that of the ancient Egyptians.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>THE BIBLE VIEWPOINT</strong></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">God gave man dominion over the lower animals. Animals were to be for man’s benefit, not man for the animals’. But neither was man to abuse his charges the way some vivisectionists do, nor to destroy them for sport as many modern Nimrods do. “A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast.” While man was yet in Eden God provided him with animal skins for clothing and after the Flood he gave man animal flesh for food.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955641/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Prov. 12:10</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The very organism of the lower animals, and especially their brains, is far inferior to those of man. Animals do not have understanding, they cannot reason, do not have a moral sense, are unable to worship Jehovah—all of which makes the worship of them by man appear all the more absurd. Only when man becomes degraded does he get down to the level of the brute. “Then I was stupid and knew nothing; a brute was I toward thee!” When King Nebuchadnezzar became insane he acted as a beast.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955641/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 73:22</a>, <em>AT.</em></p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Unreasoning animals were not made to live forever but to die. That is why the wicked are likened to them: “But these men, like unreasoning animals born naturally to be caught and destroyed, will” suffer destruction. “Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.” The Bible holds out no resurrection or heavenly hope for the brute creation.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955641/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Pet. 2:12</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955641/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 49:20</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Man was made to worship, not himself, not his equals, and certainly not his inferiors, but only one, Jehovah God: “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.” Those lacking in heart devotion to their Creator will become sentimental about creatures and serve them. Such is a form of worship.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955641/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 4:10</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">The fulfillment of such Bible prophecies as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955641/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew chapter 24</a> and; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955641/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-5</a> shows we are living in the last days. All that really matters now is obeying Jehovah’s commandment to ‘seek Jehovah, righteousness and meekness,’ and to help others to do so by preaching the “good news of the kingdom.” Christians, while not abusing or needlessly destroying lower animals for sport, will put first things first. They will give their hearts’ devotion to their Creator Jehovah God and will ‘keep on seeking first his kingdom and his righteousness.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955641/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Zeph. 2:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955641/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Matt. 24:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955641/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 6:33</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sd">You must not bow down to another god, because Jehovah is exclusively devoted to his name.

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page291" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="291" data-before-text="291"></span><strong>Appreciating Beauty</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE great Creator is a lover of beauty. His appreciation of it is apparent from the things he has made. Look where we will and we see nature, when unspoiled by humans, a thing of beauty; not to say anything about beauty in human form and features. It is right also that we appreciate beauty, that we have eyes for beauty and that we enjoy it. All such beauty, together with our faculty for enjoying it, may be said to be but another proof that “God is love.”</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">No question about it, “everything he has made pretty in its time.” That is also true of everything associated with the worship of God. In ancient times God ordained that the special structures used for his worship as well as their furnishings be exceedingly beautiful. No wonder the psalmist exulted: “Out of Zion, the perfection of prettiness, God himself has beamed forth.” “Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963360/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963360/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ps. 50:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963360/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 96:6</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Still another kind of beauty that the Creator gave his earthly creatures is that found in his Word. It is indeed a Book that is filled with beautiful sentiments, beautifully expressed. That is why one of Israel’s poets could say: “Melodies your regulations have become to me.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963360/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 119:54</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Great as may be the pleasure and enjoyment that we find in beauty, still God did not intend for us to make beauty our chief goal in life. He did not intend for us to forget ourselves in beauty, to take it so seriously that we would neglect our worship of God or that we would even break God’s laws so as to enjoy beauty.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">For one thing, let us never forget that under present imperfect conditions much beauty is transient, temporary. Of this God repeatedly reminds us in his Word: “All flesh is green grass, and all their loving-kindness is like the blossom of the field. The green grass has dried up, the blossom has withered; but as for the word of our God, it will last to time indefinite.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963360/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa. 40:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963360/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 8</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Not only is beauty transient, but it can very easily become a snare, and that in two ways: a snare to those possessing it and a snare to those hungering for it. Thus we read regarding the one that became Satan the Devil: “Your heart became haughty because of your beauty. You brought your wisdom to ruin on account of your beaming splendor.” The beauty of Absalom, a son of King David, without doubt had a part in turning his head, so that he tried to wrest the kingdom from his father: “Now compared with Absalom there proved to be no man so beautiful in all <span id="page292" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="292" data-before-text="292"></span>Israel as to be praised so much.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963360/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezek. 28:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963360/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2 Sam. 14:25</a>.</p>

<strong>International Praise to the One God</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[79]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> But a dead Jesus would not serve to vindicate himself as a Son of God faithful to the death nor to vindicate Jehovah God as universal Sovereign Lord with all power and dominion. Having this in mind, Jehovah in the Psalms foretold Jesus’ resurrection from the dead. The dead Jesus was buried in a nearby tomb in a rock and thus his soul, which he had poured out in death, went to Sheol or mankind’s common grave. But Jesus died with full hope of a resurrection, his hope being voiced in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 16:8-11</a>: “I have placed Jehovah in front of me constantly. Because [he] is at my right hand I shall not be made to totter. Therefore my heart does rejoice and my glory is inclined to be joyful. Also, <span id="page631" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="631" data-before-text="631"></span>my own flesh will reside in security. For you will not leave my soul in Sheol. You will not allow your man of loving-kindness to see the pit. You will cause me to know the path of life. Rejoicing to the full is with your face; there is pleasantness at your right hand forever.” That this and other prophecies of the Psalms might be carried out, Jehovah God brushed aside the Devil’s preventive efforts and raised Jesus from the dead, delivering him from Sheol on the third day. God rewarded him with a spirit body in place of the sacrificed human body, that he might know again the path of life and know pleasantness at God’s right hand forever.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Acts 2:22-31</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>THE CONGREGATION AND THE KINGDOM COVENANT</strong></p><p id="p80" data-pid="80" class="qu">20.

His work was to make known the name and the sovereignty of the one true God; it was to be the foremost witness of Jehovah, it was to gather about him a congregation of disciples, spiritual brothers, who should carry forward and finish on earth the work of Kingdom witnessing that he had begun. That was part of Jehovah’s will for Jesus, as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Psalm 40:8-10</a> foretold: “To do your will, O my God, I have delighted, and your law is within my inward parts. I have told the good news of righteousness in the big congregation. Look! my lips I do not restrain. O Jehovah, you yourself know that well. Your righteousness I have not covered over within my heart. Your faithfulness and your salvation I have declared. I have not hidden your loving-kindness and your trueness in the big congregation.” True to this prophecy that was written about him in the roll of God’s Bible Jesus proceeded to gather twelve apostles and other disciples round about him. To this “little flock” he was Jehovah’s Right Shepherd. But he himself was the “Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world,” and so, like the psalmist David, he could say to God his Father: “Jehovah is my Shepherd. I shall lack nothing. In grassy pastures he makes me lie down; by well-watered resting places he conducts me.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ps. 23:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p81" data-pid="81" class="qu">21.

No, this covenant concluded between Jehovah and the “loyal ones” is God’s promised “new covenant” with the house of spiritual Israel. The sacrifice upon which that new covenant is based is the ransom sacrifice of “the Son of man,” Jesus Christ.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985083/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Jeremiah 31:31-34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985083/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Matthew 24:30</a>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">15.

In sharp contrast stands a small remnant of truly dedicated, baptized disciples of the new covenant’s Mediator, Jesus Christ. They have proved to be spiritual Israelites. These loyal adherents to the new covenant are the “chosen ones” whom the Son of man gathers to himself by means of his angels. They carry out the obligations of the new covenant, “my covenant,” as God calls it. Because of their activity in support of God’s Kingdom by Jesus Christ, they have become a ‘sign’ to the whole world.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985083/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Isaiah 8:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985083/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Hebrews 2:13, 14</a>.</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982206/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Revelation 12:12</a>) It is a time when all professed disciples <span id="page18" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>of Christ must be put on judgment to determine the extent of their loyalty to that established kingdom. Will they be ardent preachers of that kingdom good news “in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations”? This transition period is also likened to a harvesttime for the separating of true Christians from the false ones. Just as Jesus prophesied in his parable of the wheat and the weeds (or, tares): “The harvest is a conclusion of a system of things, and the reapers are angels.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982206/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matthew 13:39</a>) Such angels are likely the ones used by the Sovereign Lord Jehovah to carry out his command as set out in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982206/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 50:5</a>: “Gather to me my loyal ones, those concluding my covenant over sacrifice [<em>Hebrew:</em> those cutting my covenant].”</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> To professed Christians who fail to pass the test of loyalty to the Kingdom, God says: “What right do you have to enumerate my regulations, and that you may bear my covenant in your mouth?”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982206/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 50:16</a>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">13, 14.

Rather, it is a national covenant. The Mosaic Law covenant made with the nation of Israel at Mount Sinai in Arabia was prophetically used to represent the new covenant made with the “holy nation” of spiritual Israel by means of the Greater Moses, Jesus Christ, as mediator. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982206/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>) On Passover night of 33 C.E. Jesus set up the Lord’s Supper, or Evening Meal, and said: “This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood, which is to be poured out in your behalf.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982206/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Luke 22:20</a>) So the new covenant was validated by the sacrificial blood as shed at the death of Jesus Christ.

The Greater-than-Hezekiah, Christ Jesus, has concluded “a covenant with Jehovah the God of Israel” on their behalf. He has renewed toward them the “new covenant,” with its provision for forgiveness of error, and has reactivated them for true worship.

Such must be gotten rid of! “Utensils” appropriate to Jehovah’s worship must be brought into service. As God’s will was revealed progressively to them, the anointed remnant were happy to purify their temple worship, so that they could report back to their King in the same way that the priests and Levites reported back to Hezekiah: “We have cleansed the whole house of Jehovah, the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils . . .

<strong>Covenants Between God and Man</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">It was similar zeal for Jehovah’s pure worship that moved the Levite Phinehas, a grandson of Aaron, to execute an Israelite <span id="page732" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="732" data-before-text="732"></span>and the Baal-worshiping Midianite woman that the man had taken for himself, contrary to the law of God. Because of this zeal Jehovah made with Phinehas a covenant of peace, promising him that the priesthood would remain in his family. It appears that he became a leader over the family of Korahites who guarded the entrances of the sacred tent and the camp. Since this was a covenant for the priesthood, it might be considered as part of the covenant with Levi. “Here I am giving him my covenant of peace. And it must serve as the covenant of a priesthood to time indefinite for him and his offspring after him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960885/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Num. 25:12, 13</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>THE KINGDOM COVENANT</strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Due to his faith and obedience, King David was singled out by Jehovah to become party to an outstanding covenant. It was a kingdom covenant that backed up the covenant with Abraham, for it made certain the fulfillment of the promise to bless all nations and families of the earth. “I shall certainly raise up your seed after you, which will come out of your inward parts, and I shall indeed firmly establish his kingdom.

Their being taken out of the nations as a people for God’s name fulfilled the purpose of the covenant. The perfect sin-atoning merit of Christ’s sacrifice makes possible for them the fulfillment of the promise: “I shall forgive their error, and their sin I shall remember no more.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960885/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Jer. 31:34</a>) On the basis of that sacrifice their errors and inherited sin are forgiven and righteousness is imputed to them so they can be begotten as spiritual sons of God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960885/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps. 50:5</a>.</p>

They held an international assembly that year, which was like a regathering of thousands of them, and they prepared for the greatest Christian work of witnessing to Jehovah God in all human history. With tears they sought his face of favor. They determined to keep their covenant with him, the “covenant with me [Jehovah] by sacrifice,” the new covenant based upon the human sacrifice of Jesus Christ.

Now the Kingdom of Judah under the rulership of the kingly house of David was about to be destroyed. Ezekiel prophesied of this coming ruin to the kingdom and destruction to Jehovah’s temple at Jerusalem, and of how the surviving Jews would be dragged off into exile in Babylon. His prophecies, however, did not leave the Jews and the Israelites in despair, for he foretold their united return from Babylon to restore Jehovah’s worship in their beloved homeland. He foretold that the Israelites of the north and the Judeans of the south were to be reunited as one nation under one leader, the son of David.

Having this in mind, Jehovah in the Psalms foretold Jesus’ resurrection from the dead. The dead Jesus was buried in a nearby tomb in a rock and thus his soul, which he had poured out in death, went to Sheol or mankind’s common grave. But Jesus died with full hope of a resurrection, his hope being voiced in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 16:8-11</a>: “I have placed Jehovah in front of me constantly.

You will not allow your man of loving-kindness to see the pit. You will cause me to know the path of life. Rejoicing to the full is with your face; there is pleasantness at your right hand forever.” That this and other prophecies of the Psalms might be carried out, Jehovah God brushed aside the Devil’s preventive efforts and raised Jesus from the dead, delivering him from Sheol on the third day. God rewarded him with a spirit body in place of the sacrificed human body, that he might know again the path of life and know pleasantness at God’s right hand forever.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Acts 2:22-31</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>THE CONGREGATION AND THE KINGDOM COVENANT</strong></p><p id="p80" data-pid="80" class="qu">20.

His work was to make known the name and the sovereignty of the one true God; it was to be the foremost witness of Jehovah, it was to gather about him a congregation of disciples, spiritual brothers, who should carry forward and finish on earth the work of Kingdom witnessing that he had begun. That was part of Jehovah’s will for Jesus, as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Psalm 40:8-10</a> foretold: “To do your will, O my God, I have delighted, and your law is within my inward parts.

To this “little flock” he was Jehovah’s Right Shepherd. But he himself was the “Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world,” and so, like the psalmist David, he could say to God his Father: “Jehovah is my Shepherd. I shall lack nothing.

When Armageddon comes, it will be soon enough, too soon for men who selfishly postpone taking the divine advice and acting. Then they will know what they were asking for, when they tauntingly asked us witnesses where this universal war was with its demonstration of God’s power and greatness.

And in this “time of the end” Jehovah’s goodness has widened out to all kinds of men, markedly so since 1931-1935, when the salvation of a “great crowd” of other sheep was revealed to be part of the divine program for this “time of the end” and when <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953924/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Revelation 22:17</a> took on a wider application: “And let anyone hearing say, ‘Come!’ And let anyone thirsting come; let anyone that wishes take life’s water free.”—<em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p75" data-pid="75" class="qu">23.

Since 1919 Jehovah the great Judge has been gathering such men of loving-kindness who are in this covenant, and now unitedly they must and do bless him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953924/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ps. 50:5</a>, <em>Ro; AS</em>) They partake also of his loving-kindness through the Kingdom covenant that he made with King David. Through Jesus Christ, the Greater David, he brings them into this Kingdom covenant, that they may reign with Christ in the heavenly kingdom and be a blessing to all obedient mankind. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953924/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Acts 13:34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953924/31/1" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> Isa. 55:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953924/31/2" data-bid="32-3" class="b"> Luke 22:28-30</a>) They must make known this Kingdom covenant, this divine expression of loving-kindness. In this way they make known that God’s kingdom by Christ is something he covenanted for and it is therefore a certainty, and that it will have as its King the One who earned the right to it by Jehovah’s favor. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953924/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Psalm 110:1</a> (<em>AS</em>) King David called this one his “Lord,” to show how much higher this Kingdom Heir of the line of David would be in his royal position. Those who are highly favored with being made his joint heirs have extraordinary reason for blessing the great Arranger of it all, Jehovah; and this earth over which they will reign is the proper place for them to begin blessing him. Doing this now has a powerful effect upon the great crowd of other sheep for their salvation, because, through <span id="page756" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="756" data-before-text="756"></span>the remnant, they learn of the Kingdom and assemble to it.</p>

Moses the mediator had inaugurated this covenant at <span id="page312" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="312" data-before-text="312"></span>Mount Sinai between Jehovah God and the Israelites, over the blood of animal sacrifices. Concerning this we read: “Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.” Or, to quote the <em>New World Translation:</em> “Consequently neither was the former covenant inaugurated without blood.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Heb. 9:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/38/1" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> Ex. 24:1-8</a>) According to this covenant inaugurated at Sinai certain consecrations took place, God himself consecrating or installing his priesthood. There was no individual covenant with God by which a person consecrated himself, but the covenant was made with the entire nation of Israel through an individual mediator, Moses. It was God’s covenant, proposed and offered by him, and he speaks of it as “the covenant which I made with their forefathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt”. So he speaks of the entire nation as being his wife and he their husband by virtue of this law covenant.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Heb. 8:8, 9</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Jer. 31:32</a>.</p><p id="p70" data-pid="70" class="qu">26. Besides “consecration”, what was the step of giving oneself to God also called, and how was this spoken of?</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[70]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="26"><sup>26</sup></span> We already noted that the step of giving oneself to God used to be spoken of as a consecrating of oneself. Correspondingly, at least till 1946<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1952365/1">b</a>, it used to be called making a covenant with God by sacrifice, because it was taken for granted that the one giving himself to God was due to be sacrificed with Jesus; so he was sacrificing all earthly things by his so-called “self-consecration”. He would apply to himself in a personal way <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Psalm 50:5</a>: “Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.” The sacrifice here was understood to mean the sacrifice of each one thus making a self-consecration. This covenant by sacrifice was taken to mean an individual’s act, something distinct from the ancient law covenant and from the new covenant which God promised to make through Jesus Christ as Mediator. For instance, away back in the issue of November, 1880, there was an article entitled “Beyond the Vail”, discussing the tabernacle and its veils or curtains. And in paragraph 5 it said: “Those who pass through this first ‘vail’ into the ‘holy place’ are the ones who fulfill their ‘covenant by sacrifice’ called saints. All believers coming through the ‘curtain’ are ‘called to be saints,’ but only those who obey the call and yield themselves sacrifices ‘make their calling and election sure’.” So it came about that each believer spoke about making a covenant with God at the time of consecrating himself. This has caused confusion of mind.<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1952365/2">c</a></p><p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="qu">27.

By this expression Jehovah meant his new covenant with his new nation of spiritual Israel and for which Jesus Christ is the Mediator, the Greater Moses. To quote Rotherham’s translation of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Psalm 50:5</a>: “Gather yourselves unto me—ye my men of loving-kindness, who have solemnised my covenant over sacrifice.” It is not over <span id="page313" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="313" data-before-text="313"></span>the sacrifice of each saint or person of loving-kindness that this covenant is solemnized, but it is over the one sacrifice of the Mediator Jesus Christ, and the covenant is a national covenant. It is the new covenant made with the new theocratic organization, the Christian congregation. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Ps 50 verse 16</a> of the psalm God speaks of it as his covenant, saying to the wicked hypocrites and apostates: “What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?”</p>

Jesus offered the Memorial cup to his disciples with the words: “This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood, which is to be poured out in your behalf.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 22:20</a>, <em>NW</em>) This same cup is the “cup of Jehovah” because the new covenant is the agreement or contract he makes in order to take out of all nations a “people for his name”. But it is Christ Jesus who acts as mediator between God and men by providing the sacrificial blood to put that new covenant into force, just as Moses slaughtered animal victims and sprinkled their blood in order to put the ancient Law covenant into force between God and fleshly Israel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Jer. 31:31-34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Acts 15:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/12/2" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> Ex. 24:1-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/12/3" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> Heb. 9:14-24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/12/4" data-bid="13-5" class="b"> 1 Tim. 2:5, 6</a>) The ones taken into this new covenant are the “people for his name”, beginning with the faithful Jewish remnant at Pentecost and later taking in the Gentile believers from the centurion Cornelius onward. All these Jehovah God anoints with his spirit, by this making them anointed ones or members of the “body of the Christ”. These God gathers to him, saying: “Gather yourselves <span id="page53" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="53" data-before-text="53"></span>unto me—ye my men of loving-kindness, who have solemnised my covenant over sacrifice [Christ’s sacrifice].” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 50:5</a>, <em>Ro</em>) This new covenant is an additional fact which shows that the privilege of drinking of the cup at the Memorial celebration is limited to those who are members of Christ’s body.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>HOW THE CUP IS SHARED</strong></p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">11. How did Jesus indicate there is another sense to the cup, making it the “cup of Jehovah” in which his followers might share?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> These members do not share in providing the blood of the new covenant. Only Jesus does that. By his blood he mediates the new covenant in their behalf. And so the body members could not in that sense be “sharing in the blood of the Christ”. How, then, can the apostle’s words be true: “The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a sharing in the blood of the Christ?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:16</a>, <em>NW</em>) Because this cup is the “cup of Jehovah” in still another sense. How so? In that it pictures the portion which Jehovah has poured. Jesus and his little flock of Kingdom joint heirs must drink it in order to prove their integrity to Him and their worthiness of the Kingdom. This is the cup to which Jesus referred when, shortly after introducing the Memorial, he prayed: “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me. Yet, not as I will, but as you will.” And, again: “My Father, if it is not possible for this to pass away except I drink it, let your will take place.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 26:39,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 42</a>, <em>NW</em>) And when Peter, to defend Jesus, wounded one of the men who came out to arrest him, Jesus said: “Put the sword into its sheath. The cup that the Father has given me, should I not by all means drink it?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">John 18:11</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">12.

But God’s will for Jesus did not end in his death. It also included the resurrection of Jesus from the dead to immortal life in heaven as a glorified Son of God, and so a saving of him out of death. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Heb. 5:7</a>) It was therefore for him a “cup of salvation” also, salvation for holding fast his integrity to his Father without sin. Here the words of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 116</a>, which applies in particular to Jesus Christ in Gethsemane, are fitting, because Jesus determined to drink the “cup of Jehovah” even to the death: “What shall I render unto Jehovah for all his benefits toward me? I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of Jehovah. I will pay my vows unto Jehovah, yea, in the presence of all his people. Precious in the sight of Jehovah is the death of his saints.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 116:12-15</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">13. What was it Jesus said that made it sure his followers would drink the cup with him? What about it made it hard to drink?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> But according to God’s will the cup which Jesus was given to drink he also shares with his little flock of Kingdom joint heirs. This he made sure when he said to two of his apostles who applied for specific seats in the Kingdom with him: “The cup I am drinking you will drink, and with the baptism with which I am being baptized you will be baptized. However, this sitting down at my right or at my left is not mine to give, but it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951045/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Mark 10:34-40</a>, <em>NW</em>) The cup which Jesus was then drinking and which his heavenly Father had poured and given him was God’s will for him. This will was recorded aforetime in the Holy Scriptures and it marked out suffering and a disgraceful death for him as if he were a sinner, a blasphemer and a reproach to Jehovah God. This latter feature was what made it so hard for Jesus to drink, so that he took the matter to his Father three times in prayer and then resigned himself to drinking <span id="page54" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="54" data-before-text="54"></span>this portion of the divine will. This course led to gaining the Kingdom.</p>

So from and after 1919 he used his great Servant to restore the remnant of spiritual Israel and he reorganized them to act as his witnesses in the momentous postwar period. He cleansed them from the unsightly religious soils that they had gotten while under Babylon’s power and influence. Thus he made it a clean organization worthy of receiving those who forsook Babylon in obedience to his command: “Away! away! go out thence; touch nothing unclean! Go out of the midst of her; keep yourselves pure, you who bear the vessels of the LORD [Jehovah]!” And since Jehovah God had taken his great power and was now reigning by his Servant-King Christ Jesus, he led his reorganized people to see that the only organization for them now to have and serve by was the theocratic organization, not democratic organization. Because of their repentance and return to him with faithful hearts, Jehovah made the remnant of spiritual Israelites part of his servant class, under his Chief Servant Christ Jesus. In that way they could serve as the “faithful and discreet slave” whom Jesus had foretold and whom he said he would appoint over all his earthly, visible belongings, the interests of the Kingdom.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951922/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 52:11</a>, <em>AT;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951922/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45-47</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 5.

(See <em>The Watchtower,</em> January 1, 1924, ¶¶ 11-32.) Nineteen centuries ago the early members of the Jewish remnant were also inclined to think that the gathering of the sheep of the Shepherd Christ Jesus was to be only from the Jewish nation, Samaritans and circumcised proselytes. For three and a half years after Jesus’ death, resurrection and ascent to heaven and the Pentecostal outpouring of the holy spirit, they confined their preaching about the Christ to these only and would not step into the home of an uncircumcised Gentile to tell him the good news.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>“LIGHT TO THE GENTILES”</strong></p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 6.

<strong>Do the Dead Need Your Help?</strong><br/><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">If it were true that such material offerings did benefit the dead, this would mean that God is interested in money. But he does not need anyone’s money or material possessions. Speaking through the inspired psalmist, God declares: “I will not take out of your house a bull, out of your pens he-goats. For to me belongs every wild animal of the forest, the beasts upon a thousand mountains. I well know every winged creature of the mountains, and the animal throngs of the open field are with me.

<strong>Make Friends for Yourselves</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> How can we make friends with Jehovah and his Son, and why is it urgent to do so now? In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">the book of Luke, the sixteenth chapter</a>, Jesus spoke a parable about a house servant, a steward who was about to lose his job and who showed practical wisdom in making friends with riches. The steward in Jesus’ parable did not receive a salary, as is the custom today. When dismissed from his job, he would have to beg or do menial work such as digging. Not being strong enough to dig and not wishing to beg, the steward reduced various debts that men owed his master. When he lost his stewardship, he thus had people who would welcome him into their homes; for he had made friends with them by means of riches. Now he would not have to earn a living in the hated way by digging or in a humiliating way by begging. He had a good eye to the future, and he acted with practical wisdom in using wealth or material goods for making friends. So Jesus Christ says that Christians should act with similar practical wisdom: “Also, I say to you, Make friends <span id="page109" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="109" data-before-text="109"></span>for yourselves by means of the unrighteous riches, so that, when such fail, they may receive you into the everlasting dwelling places.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Luke 16:9</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">17. (a) Of what are Jehovah and Jesus Christ possessors, and to what do many people fail to give thought? (b) In contrast with the uncertainty of riches and life in this world, what knowledge concerning God’s promises should prompt us to take the course of practical wisdom?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Jehovah God and Jesus Christ are the only possessors of “everlasting dwelling places.” They will receive into these “everlasting dwelling places” only their friends. In this day and age when many persons are deeply concerned and disturbed over housing shortages, the high cost of housing and high taxes on homes, they are likely to give little thought to the matter of securing for themselves everlasting dwelling places in God’s new world of righteousness. Not only is it a new world in which “righteousness is to dwell,” but it will be a world of which God assures us: “Death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be any more. The former things have passed away.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> Rev. 21:4</a>) This is what God has promised in his Word. Do you believe it? Jehovah’s words never fail, as Joshua told the Israelites: “You well know with all your hearts and with all your souls that not one word out of all the good words that Jehovah your God has spoken to you has failed. They have all come true for you. Not one word of them has failed.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Josh. 23:14</a>) Having God’s unfailing promise of a righteous new world, why, then, seek permanent dwelling places in this world? It would be futile even if we should try, for not only may riches vanish overnight, but one’s life is just as uncertain. So the course of practical wisdom is to use our material possessions in such a way as to make friends with the Builder of all things and Jesus Christ his Son, who said to his followers: “In the house of my Father there are many abodes. Otherwise, I would have told you, because I am going my way to prepare a place for you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">John 14:2</a>) Then when riches fail us, we can be assured of a loving welcome into the “everlasting dwelling places” of the new world.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">18. Why does money not buy God’s gifts, and who can be God’s friends?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Does this mean that God accepts bribes or that we can buy off God’s wrath? No, not at all. Ananias and Sapphira thought that they could buy God’s favor to the extent of having a big reputation. They failed to understand that handing over money to buy something for a selfish purpose could not be a friendly act toward God. Further, Simon, the one-time practitioner of magical arts, thought that he could buy the favors of God by the exchange of money. He found out otherwise, as Peter told him: “May your silver perish with you, because you thought through money to get possession of the free gift of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Acts 8:20</a>) No, money cannot buy God’s gifts; if that were so, then the rich would be at an advantage and could buy up reservations in God’s new world. But God is not mercenary; he is not partial. Anyone can make friends with God and His Son, even though his material possessions be small and insignificant.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">19. (a) How can money or material goods be used, then, in winning God’s friendship? (b) What is the proper use of one’s resources?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> How, then, do we use riches or material goods to make friends with God? Not to bribe God but to <em>glorify</em> God! God owns the whole world, and “the silver is mine, and the gold is mine,” says Jehovah. “To me belongs every wild animal of the forest, the beasts upon a thousand mountains.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Hag. 2:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/31/1" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> Ps. 50:10</a>) So we could not enrich God materially, but we can use our resources to glorify God, by telling others of his purposes, by giving him exclusive devotion and loyal love. When we encourage other persons to study the Bible, when we bring to them Bible-study aids, when we talk with them and help <span id="page110" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="110" data-before-text="110"></span>them understand God’s purposes and promise of a righteous new world—we are using our resources to glorify God.</p>

<strong>Do You Serve God or Expect God to Serve You?</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">For Jesus, serving God also meant keeping separate from the world: “I am no part of the world,” said he. It also meant <span id="page196" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="196" data-before-text="196"></span>keeping free from all sin: “Who of you convicts me of sin?” No one could.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961240/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 17:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961240/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 8:46</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Because Jesus so faithfully and unselfishly served his Father, Jehovah God rewarded him by ‘exalting him to a superior position,’ giving him “the name that is above every other name.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961240/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Phil. 2:9</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Not that God was in need of Jesus’ service or that he needs our service. For an eternity in the past Jehovah God had been perfectly self-contained before ever he created his Son; and if he did not need the service of his Son he certainly does not need our service. As the prophet quotes him: “If I were hungry I would not say it to you, for to me the productive land and its fullness belong.” No matter what we may be able to do in serving God we must recognize Jesus’ words as true: “When you have done all the things assigned to you, say, ‘We are good-for-nothing slaves. What we have done is what we ought to have done.’” But God in his unselfish love gives his creatures the privilege of serving him so as to prove themselves worthy of his blessings.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961240/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 50:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961240/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Luke 17:10</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">To serve God as Jesus did does not mean for us likewise to perform miracles, feed the multitudes, cure the sick and raise the dead. Such miracles, having served their purpose to establish the divine origin of Christianity, passed away. Neither does it mean for us to give our lives in sacrifice as a ransom. That is impossible because we are all sinners and, besides, Jesus provided a ransom once and for all time by his sacrifice.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961240/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Heb. 9:26</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">But we can serve God in imitation of Jesus by bringing honor to Jehovah God, making known his truth, his name, his Word and his kingdom. That commission Jesus gave to all his followers: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, . . . teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.” Each Christian therefore has the obligation to preach. That is why the apostle Paul exclaimed: “Woe is me if I did not declare the good news!” Do you think that commission was only for apostles, men like Paul? Then note that Paul also wrote: “Become imitators of me, even as I am of Christ.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961240/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961240/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 9:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961240/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 11:1</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Although very few professed Christians appreciate this truth, it is gradually beginning to dawn on the leaders of Christendom. Thus the 1958 Lambeth (London) Conference of Anglican bishops approximated the truth when it stated: “Evangelism is not to be thought of as the task of a select few. Baptism and confirmation constitute ‘the ordination of the laity’ for the task of evangelism. It is for every Christian to do what Andrew did for his brother—to say, ‘We have found the Messiah,’ and to bring him to Jesus.”—<em>Theology Today,</em> July, 1960.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">While preaching the good news of God’s kingdom is the best way in which we can serve God, we may not limit ourselves to it. Serving God also requires that, as we have opportunity, we “work what is good toward all.” And although we cannot live lives wholly free from sin as did Jesus Christ, to serve God acceptably we must continually strive against sin, lest it become a practice with us. At the same time we must keep ourselves “without spot from the world.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961240/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gal. 6:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961240/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Jas. 1:27</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">If we thus serve God instead of expecting him to serve us it will be reflected in our prayers. Then instead of limiting them to petitions for ourselves, our prayers will include praise and thanksgiving to God and petitions for others and in particular for the triumph of righteousness. And then our future in this space age will be, not confusion and destruction, but happiness and everlasting life.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961240/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 6:9, 10</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Did You Make an Acceptable Dedication to God?</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Even while the individual is changing his clothing and is preparing himself to enter into the water to be immersed, he manifests to himself and to all observers <span id="page125" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="125" data-before-text="125"></span>that he has made a decision to be forever afterward dedicated to Jehovah God through Jesus Christ. Such a decision is a solemn thing and evidently it is made in a prayerful mood, with one’s thoughts on the God who can read the heart. So whether one made such a decision of dedication long before the actual baptizing in water, or it was made during or after the baptismal talk, the incontrovertible fact remains that the individual made a dedication of himself from the heart in the presence of the Most High God, and that is the thing of primary importance.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">On the day of Pentecost when the apostle Peter told the Jews, who had been cut to the heart by the words that he preached to them, what to do, they followed his advice, repented, and were baptized on that day. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964126/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 2:37-41</a>) They had little time in advance of their actual water baptism to make the decision to follow in the footsteps of the Lord Jesus. This decision they did not make on bended knee in prayer in the privacy of their homes, which were located in scattered parts of the Roman Empire and even outside of it. They made their decision just prior to the water baptism that Peter encouraged them to undergo. They evidently made their decision standing up in the presence of the apostles, upon whom the holy spirit had been poured out that day.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">So one’s physical attitude, or one’s location at the time of making the decision of dedication, or whether it was done in one well-remembered specific prayer, does not determine the validity of the dedication vow that is thus made. The essential thing is that the dedication must be understood to be made to the Most High God through his Son, Jesus Christ, our Savior.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="ss"><strong>LIVING UP TO DEDICATION</strong></p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">When one dedicates himself to Jehovah God, he solemnly vows, or promises, to do the will of God forever. At baptism, therefore, he symbolizes this vow or promise to continue progressing in the Christian way. The responsibility to continue in that way of life rests upon each one who dedicates his life to God. He must live up to that dedication by doing what God has outlined in his Word. “Offer thanksgiving as your sacrifice to God, and pay to the Most High your vows.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964126/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 50:14</a>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">However, because a person does not live up to his dedication, it does not mean that his dedication was invalid. What it does mean is that he is simply not living up to that dedication! It represents failure to fulfill his vow, his promise, and not a failure to make a correct dedication and baptism in the first place. How serious this is can be seen from God’s Word: “Whenever you vow a vow to God, do not hesitate to pay it, for there is no delight in the stupid ones. What you vow, pay.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964126/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Eccl. 5:4</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">Thus, if one has slipped away from the faith to a degree, or may have even committed a grievous sin after he was baptized, this cannot be taken as an indication that his baptism must have been invalid and hence he must be rebaptized. In all likelihood it was not his dedication and baptism that were at fault. The trouble is his failure to live up to his promise to do God’s will.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">If any today find themselves practicing what is bad, or if they practiced badness some time after their dedication, they should not automatically look to rebaptism to correct the situation. The way to set oneself straight with Jehovah is to confess the wrongdoing to Jehovah in prayer and also to the judicial committee of the congregation, who will prayerfully and Scripturally handle the matter. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964126/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 John 1:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964126/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Jas. 5:16</a>) Whatever correction is administered will work toward the good of the one who has confessed his wrongdoing, <span id="page126" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="126" data-before-text="126"></span>as well as toward the good of the entire congregation.</p>

If they are in the new covenant with God, why do they hate God’s discipline and throw God’s words behind them? Millions upon millions of people and their hypocritical clergy in Christendom’s religious organizations today have actually thrown the words of God behind them. They have shown they are through with God’s Word but still call themselves Christians. They know, as well as anyone else, that one should not steal, that married people should not commit adultery nor single ones engage in fornication. But, they are well described by the words of the psalmist, ‘When they see a thief they are pleased with him.’ In their hearts they would like to be able to get away with such stealing themselves. Have you noticed that all false religious organizations wink at persons who are sharing with adulterers? These are not reprimanded or disfellowshiped from their religious organization. They continue to be “good” members in fine standing in the church organizations of Christendom. How many times have you read in your newspapers about a person’s third, fourth and fifth marriage while their former mates are still living? For such persons marriage becomes legalized adultery. In many Catholic-controlled countries people cannot get divorces on any grounds and so the adulterers just live with their mistresses and continue in good standing in their immoral religious systems.

No wonder the world empire of false religion is called “Babylon the Great, the mother of the harlots and of the disgusting things of the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969002/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rev. 17:5</a>) Do you want to belong to such a religious system?</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu">7, 8.

Most people look upon lying as something that does not do any harm. Here is where the breakdown in morals begins. The immorality of the religious, political and commercial system of things is appalling. Good morals are practically nil. The majority of the people in Christendom today, and probably the majority of people in other religious persuasions, think that God does not see what is going on and is not interested anyway. Jehovah expresses himself through his written Word, and someday he will speak very forcefully by actions. Jehovah goes on to say in this fiftieth psalm: “You imagined that I would positively become like you. I am going to reprove you, and I will set things in order before your eyes. Understand this, please, you forgetters of God, that I may not tear you to pieces without there being any deliverer.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969002/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 50:21, 22</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> You can say that “there is no God,” if you wish, and that “God is dead.” The evolutionist says, “I proved there is no God,” but that will not change matters.

<strong>Keeping the Organization of Public Servants Pure, Chaste</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> The facts and figures published year after year in editions of the <em>Yearbook</em> prove that the New World Society of Jehovah’s witnesses is carrying out the assignment to preach the good news of God’s kingdom for which God-fearing men and women have prayed for thousands of years. In carrying out this assignment the Society is rendering the greatest public service on earth today. From that standpoint the Society is an organization of public servants, <span id="page685" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="685" data-before-text="685"></span>even though not all of them give talks from the public platform.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> 4.

They may say, ‘Yes, Jehovah’s witnesses as a New World Society are undeniably rendering a public service on a worldwide scale, but what about the private lives of the individual witnesses of Jehovah? What kind of life do they live in their homes, in their secular business and inside their religious congregations? What about their morals in private, away from the public eye?’</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"> 5. What kind of answers to these questions should we expect on the part of the baptized persons in the New World Society, and why?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Those are proper questions. By their private lives how do Jehovah’s witnesses in the New World Society answer those questions? We should expect satisfying answers. Why so? Because each baptized person in the New World Society belongs to the Most High God of the universe. That is so because water baptism is a symbol of a person’s complete dedication of himself to Jehovah God through Jesus Christ. Without any limitations the New World Society of baptized Jehovah’s witnesses belongs to Him. That being so, Jehovah God requires that this organization of public servants be pure, chaste. Never would He give to this organization the assignment of preaching his Kingdom message worldwide unless this organization measured up to His divine requirements. Because his witnesses represent Him he is rightly concerned about their moral purity, their chastity, their right conduct. He is seriously interested in keeping the organization to which he gives such a responsible service assignment clean, pure, chaste, inasmuch as he refuses to use an unclean, impure organization.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964844/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 50:16-23</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>GIVING NO CAUSE FOR STUMBLING OTHERS</strong></p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"> 6.

They cannot preach and teach one thing and at the same time live contrariwise and expect to have God’s approval. Nobody can fool God, pull the wool over his eyes. He knows, his King Jesus Christ knows, and the angels know whether an individual is living in private contrary to what he publicly preaches and teaches. God has feelings. He keenly feels any reproach that is thus being heaped upon his own name, upon his beloved organization, upon his truth and upon the good news of His kingdom. So the private lives of his dedicated public servants are a concern to him. This stern fact makes it advisable for each public servant to walk worthily.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"> 7, 8. (a) Why did the apostle Paul keenly appreciate this fact?

It was well that he did so, for he was one of the most prominent public servants on earth of the Most High God. Paul knew that the chasteness of his private life ought to recommend to others the Christian message that he preached and taught. Also, the purity of what he taught ought to recommend his message to others and not be a stumbling block or hindrance. It ought to lead to a clean organization. In order to live, to preach and to serve for the unhindered advancement of his message of salvation, Paul was willing to suffer anything. So, after referring to himself and Timothy as ambassadors <span id="page686" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="686" data-before-text="686"></span>substituting for Christ, Paul made this statement:</p>

<strong>Dedication to God and Consecration</strong><br/><p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[71]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"><sup>27</sup></span> The “covenant with me by sacrifice” is not a personal covenant each believer makes, but is an organizational covenant. By this expression Jehovah meant his new covenant with his new nation of spiritual Israel and for which Jesus Christ is the Mediator, the Greater Moses. To quote Rotherham’s translation of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Psalm 50:5</a>: “Gather yourselves unto me—ye my men of loving-kindness, who have solemnised my covenant over sacrifice.” It is not over <span id="page313" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="313" data-before-text="313"></span>the sacrifice of each saint or person of loving-kindness that this covenant is solemnized, but it is over the one sacrifice of the Mediator Jesus Christ, and the covenant is a national covenant. It is the new covenant made with the new theocratic organization, the Christian congregation. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Ps 50 verse 16</a> of the psalm God speaks of it as his covenant, saying to the wicked hypocrites and apostates: “What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?”</p><p id="p72" data-pid="72" class="qu">28. How does a person get into this covenant with God by sacrifice?</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[72]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="28"><sup>28</sup></span> But those who have set themselves apart to God he begets with his spirit and so makes them his spiritual sons and a people for his name. These saints or holy ones, these people of loving-kindness, Jehovah God brings into the new covenant through the Mediator Jesus. He forgives them their sins through Jesus’ sacrifice, and he consecrates them or installs them into his service as priests, underpriests whose High Priest is Christ Jesus. He anoints them with his spirit to be such consecrated priests.<a id="footnotesource4" data-fnid="4" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1952365/3">d</a> From then on they are obligated to offer the sacrifices of praise and obedient service to God all their days in the flesh on earth, “seven days,” so to speak.</p><p id="p73" data-pid="73" class="qu">29. What, then, should we call Jesus’ coming to do God’s will, and why?</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[73]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="29"><sup>29</sup></span> Returning, now, to the question raised in paragraph 9 above, as to what we should call the step Jesus took when he came to do God’s will, <em>Zion’s Watch Tower</em> once stated: “In being born of a virgin, Jesus had taken ‘the seed of Abraham’ and so continued until he was 30 years of age when, in baptism, he consecrated his being to God a living sacrifice. He was accepted, and from that moment, being begotten of the spirit and sealed as a new creature, he is a partaker of the divine nature, the human nature (Abrahamic seed) being the thing sacrificed.” (May, 1881, page 2, under “Some Better Thing for Us”, ¶ 2) But now we appreciate more clearly that Jesus, at the time he presented himself to John to be baptized in Jordan river, did not consecrate himself to the priesthood and install himself in the sacrificial office. It was God who glorified him by making him a royal High Priest. God did this by the sworn oath which he had prophetically given at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Psalm 110:4</a>: “Jehovah hath sworn, and will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever after the manner of Melchizedek.” (<em>AS,</em> marginal reading; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Heb. 5:4-6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/45/1" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> 7:15-17,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/45/2" data-bid="46-3" class="b"> 20-22</a>) Since Jesus was miraculously born one of God’s chosen people and was then presented to God in babyhood by Mary as her first-born son, we can avoid confusion by calling Jesus’ coming to do God’s will his dedication of himself to God.</p><p id="p74" data-pid="74" class="qu">30. What evidence did Jesus receive of the acceptance of his dedication and of his being consecrated to God’s special will?</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" data-rel-pid="[74]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"><sup>30</sup></span> Immediately after he symbolized this dedication by being baptized in Jordan’s stream, Jesus received the evidence that God had accepted his dedication and was now consecrating him to his spiritual service as High Priest. In what way? Just as Moses on the first day of the consecration ceremony decked his brother Aaron in glorious priestly robes and anointed him with the holy anointing oil to be the high priest, so God anointed Jesus with the holy spirit (symbolized by a dove descending upon him) and he let his voice be heard from heaven saying: “This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Matt. 3:13-17</a>, <em>NW</em>) By dedicating himself it was not something which Mary had done for him in his infancy before he had knowledge <span id="page314" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="314" data-before-text="314"></span>and understanding to appreciate it. No, but now at thirty years of age it was something which Jesus willingly did for himself. By it he placed himself at God’s disposal, whatever God might reveal according to what was written in the roll of the book.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Luke 3:21-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952365/47/1" data-bid="48-2" class="b"> 4:14-21</a>.</p>

<strong>Will You “Give Away a Fault”?</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It is not uncommon for Christians to encounter such a response as they try to share Bible truths with their neighbors. The tendency to exalt oneself and to speak disparagingly of others is nothing new. Thousands of years ago the inspired psalmist represented Jehovah God as addressing “the wicked one” with these words: “Your mouth you have let loose to what is bad, and your tongue you keep attached to deception. You sit and speak against your own brother, against the son of your mother you give away [expose] a fault.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1980201/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 50:19, 20</a>, <em>NW; Rotherham.</em></p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When the name of someone in your family, an acquaintance or perhaps a particular ethnic group comes up in conversation, are you, too, inclined to “give away a fault”? Likely you will admit that it is very easy to find fault with others. Many who do so feel bad and would like to overcome the problem of chronic faultfinding. The Word of God can help in this respect. How so?</p>

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page483" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="483" data-before-text="483"></span><strong>Guard Against Giving Away a Fault</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">GOD’S Word, the Bible, encourages us to be generous, to be giving, and that with good reason, for it makes for happiness all around. But there is one kind of giving that it does not encourage. And what is that? The giving away of a fault of one’s brother, companion or intimate acquaintance.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963600/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 50:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963600/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Acts 20:35</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">You may be very careful not to spread false reports, and the idea of indulging in malicious slander or perjuring yourself by bearing false witness may seem abhorrent to you, and that is fine. But did you know that in connection with use of the tongue God requires even more as evidence of neighbor love?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963600/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ex. 20:16</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Concerning this we read at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963600/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 15:1-3</a>: “O Jehovah, who will be a guest in your tent? Who will reside in your holy mountain? He who . . . has not slandered with his tongue. To his companion he has done nothing bad, and no reproach has he taken up against his intimate acquaintance.” Yes, if you would have God’s friendship you may take up no reproach, whether true or not, against an intimate acquaintance.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">That God views the matter of indulging in harmful talk seriously can be seen from another psalm: “But to the wicked one God will have to say: ‘What right do you have to enumerate my regulations, and that you may bear my covenant in your mouth? Why, you—you have hated discipline, and you keep throwing my words behind you. You sit and speak against your own brother, against the son of your mother you give away a fault.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963600/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 50:16, 17,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963600/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 20</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Obviously, when the wicked one gives away a fault it is done in malice or ill will. More often than not, however, the ones giving away a fault are not enemies but those who profess to love one another. Husbands and wives often give away each other’s faults, letting outsiders know about things that should remain hidden. Then again, parents comment to others on the shortcomings of their children, at times even doing so in the presence of their children, to their hurt. Nor is this giving away of a fault unknown or absent from members of Christian congregations.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Not without good reason does God condemn such giving away of a fault. For one thing, it involves the betrayal of a trust, a confidence, for what is particularly condemned is the giving away of a fault of a brother, the taking up of a reproach <span id="page484" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="484" data-before-text="484"></span>against an <em>intimate acquaintance.</em> By reason of close association in the family, at one’s place of employment or of worship one gets to know others intimately, and so has opportunity to observe their shortcomings. Loyalty requires that the reproach be not spread. However, the first man Adam betrayed a glaring lack of loyalty to his wife when he volunteered the information that she had been the first to transgress, and his doing so was not motivated by any prior loyalty to God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963600/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 3:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963600/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 12</a>.</p>

Why is this important? Well, as we study the Scriptures, some of Jehovah’s actions may seem to be not quite right from our limited, imperfect viewpoint. The ancient Israelites fell into <span id="page4" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>that way of thinking and drew a wrong conclusion concerning Jehovah’s dealings with them. Notice what Jehovah said to them: “You people will certainly say: ‘The way of Jehovah is not adjusted right.’ Hear, please, O house of Israel. Is not my own way adjusted right?

Job needed to learn this lesson. During his time of suffering, Job struggled with despair and became somewhat self-centered. He lost sight of the bigger issues. But Jehovah lovingly helped him to broaden his viewpoint. By asking Job over 70 different questions, none of which Job could answer, Jehovah emphasized the limitations of Job’s understanding. Job reacted in a humble way, adjusting his viewpoint.​—<em>Read</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010761/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><em>Job 42:1-6</em></a><em>.</em></p>

The urgent need for a conclusive answer is pointed up by the steadily deteriorating conditions of our era. Disregard for the rule of law is everywhere evident, in private as well as in public life. A great upsurge of violence and vicious crime baffles the sociologists. As the current trend in human behavior casts its ominous shadow toward the future, what basis is there for believing that God will interfere to enforce righteousness and peace?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The expectation that God will act to put an end to all wickedness may be grounded upon a knowledge of God’s own qualities. He is the God of love and truth. One of his own inspired servants writes of him: “Anyone loving violence His soul certainly hates.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967161/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 11:5</a>) And in another place he informs us: “I, Jehovah, am loving justice, hating robbery along with unrighteousness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967161/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 61:8</a>) Would this God of righteousness forever endure what he hates?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In vindication of his own name the righteous God, Jehovah, is sure to act in his own due time against every evildoer, and that time is close at hand. He will not permit the wicked forever to get away with giving the impression that God approves of what they are doing. To the lawless, immoral ones Jehovah gives this warning notice: “These things you have done, and I kept silent. You imagined that I would positively become like you. I am going to reprove you, and I will set things in order before your eyes.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967161/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 50:21</a>) The long-suffering of God, intended to give full opportunity to evildoers to repent, has been misconstrued by some and they have lulled themselves into a dangerous complacency. There has been no swift retribution for their crimes, so they imagine that nothing will ever happen to them.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">But God knows their inmost thoughts. He knows what it is that keeps them going on in the evil way, and he exposes their erroneous thinking: “Because sentence against a bad work has not been executed speedily, that is why the heart of the sons of men has become fully set in them to do bad.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967161/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eccl. 8:11</a>) By their attitude, too, they betray a failure to consider the many positive warnings of God’s purpose to act.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>GOD’S PROMISES POINT TO END OF WICKEDNESS</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">True, we are living in days when wickedness is rampant and evildoers multiply, but Jehovah’s promises point to a complete end of wickedness. To the meek ones, for example, he gives this strong assurance: “Do not show yourself heated up because of the evildoers. Do not be envious of those doing unrighteousness. For evildoers themselves will be cut off, but those hoping in Jehovah are the ones that will possess the earth. And just a little while longer, and the wicked one will be no more; and you will certainly give attention to his place, and he will not be. But the <span id="page134" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="134" data-before-text="134"></span>meek ones themselves will possess the earth, and they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967161/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 37:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967161/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 9-11</a>.</p>

<strong>“Do Not Forget All His Doings”</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span id="page12" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> The writer of the fiftieth psalm says: “But to the wicked one God will have to say: ‘What right do you have to enumerate my regulations, and that you may bear my covenant in your mouth? Why, you—you have hated discipline, and you keep throwing my words behind you. Whenever you saw a thief, you were even pleased with him; and your sharing was with adulterers.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969002/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 50:16-18</a>) Many people claim to be Christian, but do they have any right to represent Jehovah God? If they are in the new covenant with God, why do they hate God’s discipline and throw God’s words behind them? Millions upon millions of people and their hypocritical clergy in Christendom’s religious organizations today have actually thrown the words of God behind them. They have shown they are through with God’s Word but still call themselves Christians. They know, as well as anyone else, that one should not steal, that married people should not commit adultery nor single ones engage in fornication. But, they are well described by the words of the psalmist, ‘When they see a thief they are pleased with him.’ In their hearts they would like to be able to get away with such stealing themselves. Have you noticed that all false religious organizations wink at persons who are sharing with adulterers? These are not reprimanded or disfellowshiped from their religious organization. They continue to be “good” members in fine standing in the church organizations of Christendom. How many times have you read in your newspapers about a person’s third, fourth and fifth marriage while their former mates are still living? For such persons marriage becomes legalized adultery. In many Catholic-controlled countries people cannot get divorces on any grounds and so the adulterers just live with their mistresses and continue in good standing in their immoral religious systems. They certainly have thrown God’s Word behind them. No wonder the world empire of false religion is called “Babylon the Great, the mother of the harlots and of the disgusting things of the earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969002/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rev. 17:5</a>) Do you want to belong to such a religious system?</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu">7, 8. What do forgetters of God overlook regarding God’s view of immorality and immoral persons?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> The psalmist goes on to say to forgetters of God: “Your mouth you have let loose to what is bad, and your tongue you keep attached to deception.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969002/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 50:19</a>) Lying is common. Most people look upon lying as something that does not do any harm. Here is where the breakdown in morals begins. The immorality of the religious, political and commercial system of things is appalling. Good morals are practically nil. The majority of the people in Christendom today, and probably the majority of people in other religious persuasions, think that God does not see what is going on and is not interested anyway. Jehovah expresses himself through his written Word, and someday he will speak very forcefully by actions. Jehovah goes on to say in this fiftieth psalm: “You imagined that I would positively become like you. I am going to reprove you, and I will set things in order before your eyes. Understand this, please, you forgetters of God, that I may not tear you to pieces without there being any deliverer.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969002/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 50:21, 22</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> You can say that “there is no God,” if you wish, and that “God is dead.” The evolutionist says, “I proved there is no God,” but that will not change matters. Jehovah speaks boldly through his Word to the immoral ones and all “forgetters of God,” and warns that he will tear them <span id="page13" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>to pieces. Despite all their howling when the war of Armageddon in the great day of God the Almighty strikes, there will be no deliverer. Then Jehovah will surely set things in order for the blessing of those who love righteousness.</p>

To such the psalmist says: “The one offering thanksgiving as his sacrifice is the one that glorifies me; and as for the one keeping a set way, I will cause him to see salvation by God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969002/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 50:23</a>) Are you keeping a set way, along with thousands of persons who are offering thanksgiving to Jehovah daily? Keep on glorifying Jehovah by preaching from house to house and encouraging people who love righteousness to study his Word. “Keeping a set way,” the righteous way, will cause an even greater crowd of people to sing God’s praises day and night and to see salvation.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu">10, 11.

Get acquainted with what he wants done and then do it. Jehovah says through the psalmist: “Do give ear, O my people, to my law; incline your ear to the sayings of my mouth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969002/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 78:1</a>) Is there any value in doing this? Are there benefits? Is there something to be gained? Is it rewarding to incline your ears and to listen to what God has to say and then do it? It certainly is! Not only will you personally profit by inclining your ears to the sayings of Jehovah’s mouth, but another good purpose is this: “In order that the generation to come, the sons that were to be born, might know them, that they might rise up and relate them to their sons, and that they might set their confidence in God himself and not forget the practices of God but observe his own commandments.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969002/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ps. 78:6, 7</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> How many people in Christendom today really want their children to “set their confidence in God himself”? Before you can instill such confidence in your children, you must learn about Jehovah and “not forget the practices of God.” How can your children know anything about God unless you yourself observe God’s commandments and teach them to your children?</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">12. Whose responsibility is it to teach children God’s commandments, and why?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Humankind is the creation of Jehovah God. He knows better how we should conduct our lives and live them than anyone else does. Educators and scientists think they know better how to teach and conduct the lives of children. Parents who believe the Word of God and observe God’s commandments, however, are the ones that have the responsibility. It cannot be given to the State. The Israelites were instructed to teach their children the things <span id="page14" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>that they saw and heard and to inculcate in the minds of their children the principles of truth and righteousness. The State is not doing this, and every year fewer people teach their children what the Bible counsels. Every person who professes to be a true Christian should say: “With your orders I will concern myself, and I will look to your paths. For your statutes I shall show a fondness. I shall not forget your word.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969002/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 119:15, 16</a>) How pointed and direct this advice! Have you concerned yourself as to what Jehovah’s statutes are? Do you want to know the orders of God and his regulations for proper living? Even in the normal processes of life most people recognize order and law and get acquainted with the rules of the land, but far more important are the laws that Jehovah has had written. These pertain to our living, and our children’s living, forever. We must show a fondness for His statutes, and we must not forget his Word, the Holy Bible. Teach them to your children.</p>
