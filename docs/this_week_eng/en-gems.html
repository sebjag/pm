(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001646/75/0" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Ne 9:38</a>) In these lists, the names given are not necessarily those of the individuals entering into the agreements, but they may refer to the houses involved, the ancestral head being named. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001646/76/0" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Ezr 10:16</a>.) This may be indicated by the fact that many of the names listed are the same as those listed as returning with Zerubbabel from Babylon some 80 years earlier. So, while those present may in some cases have had the same name as the ancestral head, they may have been merely representatives of the ancestral houses listed by those names.</p>

<strong>Seal</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Seal impressions could indicate ownership or authenticity and could prevent tampering with documents or other things that were sealed, including bags, doors, and tombs. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003866/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 14:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003866/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Da 6:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003866/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Mt 27:66</a>) When the prophet Jeremiah purchased a field, the copy of the deed bearing the signatures of witnesses was sealed, but a second copy was left open. Perhaps the sealing was done by folding the deed closed, tying it with a cord, and then putting a lump of wax or other soft substance on the cord and impressing the soft material with a seal. If later any question would arise about the accuracy of the open copy, the deed that had been sealed before witnesses could be produced. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003866/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jer 32:10-14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003866/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 44</a>) A person entrusted with the king’s seal could issue official decrees, the seal impression stamping the decrees as authentic. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003866/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1Ki 21:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003866/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Es 3:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003866/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003866/2/3" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 8:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003866/2/4" data-bid="3-5" class="b"> 8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003866/2/5" data-bid="3-6" class="b"> 10</a>) Affixing one’s seal to a document could signify an acceptance of the terms contained therein.

<strong>Genealogy</strong><br/><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">These genealogies were carefully preserved down to the start of the Common Era. This is proved by the fact that each family of Israel was able to go back to the city of its father’s house to be registered in response to Caesar Augustus’ decree shortly before Jesus’ birth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Luke 2:1-5</a>) Also, John the Baptist’s father Zechariah is noted as of the priestly division of Abijah and John’s mother Elizabeth as from the daughters of Aaron. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Luke 1:5</a>) Anna the prophetess is spoken of as “of Asher’s tribe.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Luke 2:36</a>) And, of course, the extensive listings of Jesus’ forefathers at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Matthew, chapter 1</a>, and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Luke, chapter 3</a>, make it <span id="page636" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="636" data-before-text="636"></span>clear that such records were kept in the public archives, available for examination.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">The historian Josephus gives testimony to the existence of Jewish official genealogical registers when he says: “Now, I am not only sprung from a sacerdotal family in general, but from the first of the twenty-four courses; and . . . of the chief family of that first course also.” Then, after pointing out that his mother was descended from Asamoneus, he concludes: “Thus have I set down the genealogy of my family as I have found it described in the public records, and so bid adieu to those who calumniate me.”—<em>The Life of Flavius Josephus,</em> par. 1.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">The official genealogies of the Jews were destroyed, not by King Herod the Great, as some have supposed, but by the Romans at the destruction of Jerusalern in 70 C.E. Since that time the Jews have been unable to establish their descent in even the two most important lines, David and Levi.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="ss"><strong>PROBLEMS IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF GENEALOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS</strong></p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">In determining relationships, often the context or a comparison of parallel lists or of texts from different parts of the Bible is necessary. For example, “son” may actually mean a grandson or merely a descendant. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Matt. 1:1</a>) Again, a list of names may appear to be a register of brothers, the sons of one man. On closer observation and by comparison with other texts, however, it may prove to be the register of a genealogical line, naming some sons and also some grandsons or later descendants. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Genesis 46:21</a> evidently lists both sons and grandsons of Benjamin as “sons,” as can be seen by a comparison with <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Numbers 26:38-40</a>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">The above situation is found even in the genealogies of some major families. For example, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 6:22-24</a> lists ten “sons of Kohath.” But in the eighteenth verse, and at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Exodus 6:18</a>, we find only four sons attributed to Kohath. And examination of the context shows that the listing of “sons of Kohath” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 6:22-24</a> is in reality part of a genealogy of <em>families</em> of the line of Kohath who had representative members present for appointment by David to certain temple duties.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">Conversely, “father” may mean “grandfather.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Dan. 5:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/51/1" data-bid="52-2" class="b"> 18</a>) In many places, such as at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 26:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/52/1" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> 1 Kings 15:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/52/2" data-bid="53-3" class="b"> 24</a>, and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">2 Kings 15:38</a>, the Hebrew word <em>ʼav</em> (father) also is used in the sense of “ancestor,” or “forefather.” Similarly, the Hebrew words <em>ʼem</em> (mother) and <em>bath</em> (daughter) are used occasionally for “grandmother” and “granddaughter” respectively.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">1 Ki. 15:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/54/1" data-bid="55-2" class="b"> 13</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="ss"><strong><em>Cities and plural names</em></strong></p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">In some lists a man may be said to be the “father” of a certain city, as at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 2:50-54</a>, where, for example, Salma is called “the father of Bethlehem” and Shobal “the father of Kiriath-jearim.” Evidently the cities of Bethlehem and Kiriath-jearim were either founded by these men or populated by their descendants. The same list reads, further: “The sons of Salma were Bethlehem and the Netophathites, Atroth-beth-joab and half of the Manahathites, the Zorites.” (Vs. 54) Here Netophathites, Manahathites and Zorites were evidently families.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Genesis 10:13, 14</a>, the names of Mizraim’s descendants have what appear to be plural forms. It has been suggested that they represent the names of families or tribes rather than individuals. However, it should be borne in mind that other names in dual or plural form, such as Ephraim, Appaim, Diblaim, Meshillemoth, and also the above-named Mizraim, son of Ham, each refer to one individual.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Gen. 41:52;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/57/1" data-bid="58-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 2:30, 31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/57/2" data-bid="58-3" class="b"> Hos. 1:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/57/3" data-bid="58-4" class="b"> 2 Chron. 28:12</a>.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="ss"><strong><em>Abbreviated lists</em></strong></p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">Often the Bible writers greatly abbreviated a genealogical list, evidently naming only family heads of the more prominent houses, or important personages, or persons most important to the particular history being considered. At times descent from a certain remote ancestor was apparently all that the chronicler was concerned with showing; therefore he could leave out many intermediate names.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">One example of such abridgment is found in Ezra’s own genealogy. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/58/0" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Ezra 7:1-5</a>) He records his descent from Aaron the high priest, but in a parallel listing at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 6:3-14</a>, several names appear in verses 7 to 10 that are dropped at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/60/0" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Ezra 7:3</a>. Likely Ezra did this to avoid unnecessary repetition and to shorten the long list of names. Still, the list was perfectly adequate to prove his priestly descent. Ezra says that he is the “son” of Seraiah, meaning that he was his descendant, for he must have been Seraiah’s great-grandson, or possibly his great-great-grandson. Seraiah was high priest and was killed by Nebuchadnezzar at the time of the exile to Babylon (607 B.C.E.), his son Jehozadak being taken into exile. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">2 Ki. 25:18-21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/61/1" data-bid="62-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 6:14, 15</a>) Joshua (Jeshua) the high priest, who returned seventy years later with Zerubbabel, was Seraiah’s grandson. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/62/0" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Ezra 5:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/62/1" data-bid="63-2" class="b"> Hag. 1:1</a>) Ezra traveled to Jerusalem sixty-nine years after that, which circumstance would make it impossible for Ezra to be Seraiah’s actual son and Jehozadak’s brother.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">Another thing that we learn from comparing genealogies here is that Ezra, though descended from Aaron through Seraiah, was evidently not from <em>that</em> line of Seraiah in which the office of high priest was hereditary, namely, from Jehozadak, but from a son born later to either Seraiah or Jehozadak. The high-priestly line from Seraiah ran through Joshua (Jeshua), Joiakim and Eliashib, the latter being high priest during the governorship of Nehemiah. Ezra, then, achieved his objective with his abridged genealogy, supplying just sufficient names to prove his position in the lineage of Aaron.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/63/0" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Neh. 3:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/63/1" data-bid="64-2" class="b"> 12:10</a>.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="ss"><strong>SOME REASONS FOR VARIATIONS IN GENEALOGICAL LISTS</strong></p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb">A son who died childless was often not named; in some cases the man may have had a daughter but no son, and the inheritance may have been transmitted through a daughter who, in marriage, went under another family head in the same tribe. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Num. 36:7, 8</a>) At times the genealogy may merge a less prominent family under another family head, so that such minor family is not listed. Therefore childlessness, transmission of inheritance through women, perhaps adoption, or failure to establish a separate ancestral house caused names to be dropped out of some of the genealogical lists, while new houses formed might add new names to the lists. It is obvious, therefore, that the names in a later genealogy might differ at many points from those in an earlier listing.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">A number of family heads may appear in what seems to be a list of brothers but which may actually include nephews, as in Jacob’s “adoption” of Joseph’s sons, Jacob saying: “Ephraim and Manasseh will become mine like Reuben and Simeon.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/65/0" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Gen. 48:5</a>) Later, therefore, Ephraim and Manasseh are counted alongside their uncles as tribal heads.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/66/0" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Num. 2:18-21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/66/1" data-bid="67-2" class="b"> Josh. 17:17</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/67/0" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Nehemiah, chapter 10</a>, presents a number of names attesting by seal a “trustworthy arrangement” to perform God’s commandments. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/68/0" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Neh. 9:38</a>) In these lists, the names given are not necessarily the names of the individuals entering into the agreements, but may refer to the houses involved, the ancestral head being named. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/69/0" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Ezra 10:16</a>.) This may be indicated by the fact that many of the names listed are the same as those listed as returning with Zerubbabel from Babylon some eighty years earlier. So, while those present may in some cases have had the same name as the ancestral head, they may have been merely representatives of the ancestral houses listed by those names.</p>

<strong>Sea</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">James’ brother Jude warns his fellow Christians of the great danger from wicked men who slip into the congregation with the purpose of bringing in moral defilement. He calls them “wild waves of the sea that foam up their own causes for shame.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013776/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Jude 4-13</a>) Jude may have had in mind an earlier expression of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013776/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Isaiah (57:20</a>) and may be figuratively describing such ones’ passionate, reckless disregard for God’s laws and their rushing against the divinely constituted moral barriers in their degraded, lustful course. As one commentator remarks: “. . . they cast forth <span id="page1462" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1462" data-before-text="1462"></span>to public view the mire and dirt of their excesses, . . . So these men foam out their own acts of shame, and cast them forth for men to see, and so to blame the Church for the ill-deeds of these professors.” (F. C. Cook, <em>Commentary</em> on Jude) Another says: “What they impart is as unsubstantial and valueless as the foam of the oceanside, and is in fact a proclamation of their own shame.”—Schaff-Lange, <em>Commentary</em> on Jude; compare Peter’s description of such men at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013776/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">2 Peter 2:10-22</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"></p>

They would also insist on observing the weekly sabbath day and the sabbath year every seventh year with its cancellation of all debts owed by their Israelite brothers. And as for the “house of our God,” the sixty-one-year-old rebuilt temple of Jerusalem, they imposed upon themselves a head tax of a third of a shekel (about 20c in silver) each year toward the expenses of the temple, to maintain the services rendered there.

How prone the fallen human flesh is to give in to materialism and to overlook the spiritual interests and benefits and thus to fall into a neglecting of God’s house! Governor Nehemiah found that out. After serving as governor for twelve years he returned to the royal palace of the Persian king, namely, “in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king of [conquered] Babylon.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Neh. 13:6</a>) Then after an absence from Jerusalem, the length of which he does not tell, he returned to Judah and Jerusalem with permission of the Persian king.

He had also become a relative of Tobiah and had assigned to his personal use one of the dining halls in the temple courtyard, where formerly supplies for the support of the temple servants used to be stored.

He let the contributions of the tenth parts or tithes of the Israelites drop off, so that the ministerial Levites did not receive the necessary material support. Many of these felt obliged to leave the temple work and go home to their Levite cities and work their garden lands roundabout for food supplies for themselves and their families.

And I began to find fault with the deputy rulers and say: ‘Why has the house of the true God been neglected?’ Consequently I collected them together and stationed them at their standing place.” He did not wait any longer for action by the deputy rulers but arranged that all the inhabitants of Judah bring in the tenth parts to the temple storehouses.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Neh. 13:10-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Num. 35:1-8</a>.</p><p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="qu">26.

<strong>Taxation</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>Taxes for Maintaining Jehovah’s Sanctuary.</strong> The service of the sanctuary was maintained through taxation. Obligatory tithing provided the major source of maintenance for the Aaronic priests and Levites, and on at least one occasion, they received a share of the war booty in accordance with a tax stipulated by Jehovah.

Jehoash, for example, called for “the sacred tax ordered by Moses.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004333/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2Ch 24:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004333/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 9</a>) The Jews of Nehemiah’s time obligated themselves to pay a third of a shekel (c. 75 cents) yearly for the service of the temple.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004333/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ne 10:32</a>.</p>

<strong>Neglect</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One of several Hebrew terms having the meaning “neglect” is the verb <em>pa·raʽʹ,</em> which literally means “loosen.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003210/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Nu 5:18</a>) It has the sense “go ungroomed” with regard to physical appearance (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003210/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Le 10:6</a>), “go unrestrained” with regard to conduct (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003210/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex 32:25</a>), and “neglect” or “shun” discipline.

Another Hebrew term to designate neglect literally means “slackness,” like that of a loose bow.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003210/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jer 48:10</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003210/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps 78:57</a>.</p>

Apparently realizing that this was such a time, Ezra and Nehemiah arranged for a day of fasting on the 24th of the month of Tishri. Again God’s Law was read, and the people made confession of their sins. Then the Levites reviewed God’s merciful dealings with his wayward people, made beautiful expressions of praise to Jehovah, and contracted “a trustworthy arrangement” attested by the seal of their princes, Levites, and priests.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998764/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Nehemiah 9:1-38</a>.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">11.

Clearly, they were determined ‘not to neglect the house of their God.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998764/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Nehemiah 10:32-39</a>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">12.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998764/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Revelation 7:15</a>) This involves regular heartfelt prayers for the advancement of Jehovah’s worship. Living in harmony with such prayers requires preparation for Christian meetings and participation in them, sharing in arrangements to preach the good news, and helping interested ones by returning and, if possible, conducting Bible studies with them. Many who do not want to neglect God’s house make financial contributions toward the preaching work and the maintenance of places of true worship. We may also be able to give our support to the building of urgently needed meeting places as well as to keep them clean and tidy. An <span id="page22" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>important way to show love for God’s spiritual house is to work for the peace of fellow believers and to assist any who are in need of material or spiritual help.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998764/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998764/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 28:19, 20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998764/17/2" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> Hebrews 13:15, 16</a>.</p>

<strong>Exercising Maturity—A Safeguard</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> It is certainly discernible that theocratically trained minds will render like judgment and will not let down guard and fall into the error of sin leading to pain, sorrow, suffering and eternal death. Why not let our course imitate that of faithful men who protected and guarded their souls carefully and remained in the favor of Almighty God even under trial? Maintaining integrity to God constitutes a safeguard of life. The joys and blessings of obedience bring security, contentment and self-sufficiency. Yes, it will enable one to build up a powerful shield of faith, as Paul described: “Above all things, take up the <span id="page404" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="404" data-before-text="404"></span>large shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the wicked one’s burning missiles.” Even though Satan may take away all our literature and even our Bible and put us into solitary confinement or subject us to vicious persecution, we will have a protection that he cannot penetrate. If we have taken in complete and accurate knowledge of Jehovah’s purposes as found in the sacred Word the Bible, if we have compared and analyzed it carefully with the help of mature brothers in association with the congregation, if we make decisions in advance on what to do under the varying circumstances that may come upon us, if we recall them and make practical decisions, we will safeguard ourselves against temptations that confront us continually.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966483/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Eph. 6:16</a>.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">20.

<strong>“According to His Custom”</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Of course, Jesus preached in many places besides the synagogues. He taught multitudes on the hillsides near the Sea of Galilee, and along its seashore. He did considerable talking to his disciples on the Mount of Olives, in private homes and at the temple. But on the sabbath day you would find Jesus teaching in the “house of our God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966001/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Neh. 10:39</a>) In proof of this, when Jesus was brought before the chief priest shortly before being put on the torture stake, he unhesitantly said to the chief priest who questioned him about his disciples and about his teaching: “I have spoken to the world <span id="page8" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span>publicly. I always taught in a synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and I spoke nothing in secret. Why do you question me? Question those who have heard what I spoke to them. See! These know what I said.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966001/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">John 18:19-21</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">12. (a) How do Jehovah’s witnesses today carry on with their preaching work? (b) How was the organization of early Christianity described by one historian?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Those people knew, and Jehovah’s witnesses today know, that the custom of Jesus during his three and a half years of ministering was to attend the meetings of God’s people regularly and to teach them God’s Word there. That is why Jehovah’s witnesses today meet regularly in their Kingdom Halls and preach and teach God’s Word, the Holy Bible, and make this their custom. They, too, “have spoken to the world publicly,” and the religious leaders of the day know it. More than 1,034,268 of Jehovah’s witnesses go from house to house customarily every month declaring the good news of God’s kingdom. You will find them going from house to house, studying the Bible in private homes with interested persons and in their Kingdom Halls. From the time a person dedicates his life to do Jehovah’s will and is baptized as Jesus was he must prove himself to be a minister of God as the early Christians did. In the book <em>Outline of History</em><a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966001/0">a</a> it says: “What is clearly apparent is that the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth was a <em>prophetic teaching</em> of the new type that began with the Hebrew prophets. It was not priestly, it had no consecrated temple and no altar. It had no rites and ceremonies. Its sacrifice was ‘a broken and a contrite heart.’ Its only organization was an organization of preachers, and its chief function was the sermon.”</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>A GOOD CUSTOM FOR US</strong></p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu">13. What good example did Jesus set in his ministry that is beneficial today?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> From the very time that Jesus began his ministry in the fall of 29 C.E. after his baptism, he never neglected his ministry, and he preached sermons in the house of God and in other public places. He set an excellent example for Christians today in that “we should not neglect the house of our God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966001/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Neh. 10:39</a>) We, too, need to learn and to teach. It is in the house of God that we learn the truth from God’s written Word, and this equips us to give better sermons as we disciple people of all nations of the world to the true Christian faith.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966001/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19</a>.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">14. How do Jehovah’s witnesses today make practical use of the time they spend together in congregation meetings?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Throughout the worldwide organization of Jehovah’s witnesses schools are organized, one in every congregation. This school is called Theocratic Ministry School. In it every one of Jehovah’s witnesses may be enrolled, as well as other people who wish to be. In this ministry school you can learn how to express yourself so as to teach. Each one takes his turn on the platform, men and women, and a brief sermon based on some Scripture text is spoken in the Kingdom Hall. Sometimes two or three people will have a Bible discussion on the platform as though it were in someone’s home. Bible sermons, public or private, are based on God’s Word. Using this manner of teaching, one can make disciples of people of all the nations. This is the way Jesus got his followers. Today Jehovah’s witnesses <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>use the same method to turn the hearts of men to their Creator, Jehovah God.</p>

<strong>Neglecting the House of the Creator of Heaven and Earth</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> A neglect in rendering all these necessary things to support the temple servants and to maintain the temple operations would be a neglecting of the house or temple of Jehovah God. Especially now, in the face of the attested “trustworthy arrangement” in writing and the oath and the liability to a curse from God as now undertaken by the Israelites, they <span id="page746" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="746" data-before-text="746"></span>should not again become guilty of such neglect. Nehemiah the governor of Judah included himself under the obligation when he said: “We [not, you] should not neglect the house of our God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Neh. 10:30-39</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>WORTH REMEMBERING AND OBSERVING</strong></p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">22.

How prone the fallen human flesh is to give in to materialism and to overlook the spiritual interests and benefits and thus to fall into a neglecting of God’s house! Governor Nehemiah found that out. After serving as governor for twelve years he returned to the royal palace of the Persian king, namely, “in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king of [conquered] Babylon.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Neh. 13:6</a>) Then after an absence from Jerusalem, the length of which he does not tell, he returned to Judah and Jerusalem with permission of the Persian king. He himself had not lost interest in God’s house, but sadly he found out that the people in Judah had lost interest.</p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">23. Whom had high priest Eliashib admitted to occupancy in the temple, and what did Nehemiah do about this?</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> Eliashib the high priest had admitted an enemy Ammonite, Tobiah, who had opposed the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem, into the temple. He had also become a relative of Tobiah and had assigned to his personal use one of the dining halls in the temple courtyard, where formerly supplies for the support of the temple servants used to be stored. This was contrary to God’s command in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 23:3-6</a>. What seemed all right to the temple high priest was tolerated by the people. But not by Nehemiah! He tells us: “It seemed very bad to me. So I threw all the furniture of Tobiah’s house outside the dining hall. After that I said the word and they cleansed the dining halls; and I proceeded to put back there the utensils of the house of the true God, with the grain offering and the frankincense.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Neh. 13:4-9</a>.</p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">24.

He let the contributions of the tenth parts or tithes of the Israelites drop off, so that the ministerial Levites did not receive the necessary material support. Many of these felt obliged to leave the temple work and go home to their Levite cities and work their garden lands roundabout for food supplies for themselves and their families. So what did Nehemiah do?</p><p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu">25. What did Nehemiah report doing about this?</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"><sup>25</sup></span> He reports: “I got to find out that the very portions of the Levites had not been given them, so that the Levites and the singers doing the work went running off, each one to his own field. And I began to find fault with the deputy rulers and say: ‘Why has the house of the true God been neglected?’ Consequently I collected them together and stationed them at their standing place.” He did not wait any longer for action by the deputy rulers but arranged that all the inhabitants of Judah bring in the tenth parts to the temple storehouses.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Neh. 13:10-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Num. 35:1-8</a>.</p><p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="qu">26.

<strong>Jerusalem</strong><br/><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb">Following the apostate Ahaz, his son, faithful King Hezekiah, did cleansing and repair work in the temple area and arranged a great Passover celebration that drew worshipers to Jerusalem from all over the land, the northern kingdom included.

In King Jehoiakim’s eighth year (620/619 B.C.E.) Judah came into vassalage to Babylon.

More exiles returned with priest-scribe Ezra in 468 B.C.E., bringing additional things “to beautify the house of Jehovah, which is in Jerusalem” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/75/0" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Ezra 7:27</a>), this by authorization of King Artaxerxes (Longimanus).

The Greek historians make no mention of Alexander’s entry into Jerusalem. Yet the city did come under Greek dominion and it is reasonable to assume that it was not completely bypassed by Alexander. Josephus, in the first century C.E., records the Jewish tradition that, upon approaching Jerusalem, Alexander was met by the Jewish high priest and was shown the divinely inspired prophecies recorded by Daniel foretelling the lightning conquests by Greece.

In 198 B.C.E. Antiochus the Great, ruling in Syria, after taking the fortified city of Sidon, captured Jerusalem, and Judah became a dominion of the Seleucid Empire. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/86/0" data-bid="87-1" class="b">Daniel 11:16</a>.) Jerusalem lay under Syrian rule for thirty years. Then, in the year 168 B.C.E., Syrian King Antiochus IV (Epiphanes), in his attempt to Hellenize completely the Jews, rededicated Jerusalem’s temple to Zeus (Jupiter) and profaned the altar by an unclean sacrifice. (1 Maccabees 1:57, 62; 2 Maccabees 6:1, 2, 5) This led to the Maccabean (or Hasmonean) revolt. After a three-year struggle, Judas Maccabaeus gained control of the city and temple and rededicated Jehovah’s altar to true worship on the anniversary of its profanation, Chislev 25, 165 B.C.E.—1 Maccabees 4:52-54; 2 Maccabees 10:5; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/87/0" data-bid="88-1" class="b">John 10:22</a>.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="sb">The war against the Seleucid rulers had not ended. The Jews appealed to Rome for help and thus a new power came on the Jerusalem scene in 161 B.C.E. (1 Maccabees 8:17, 18) Now Jerusalem began to come under the influence of the expanding Roman Empire. About 142 B.C.E., Simon Maccabeus was able to make <span id="page913" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="913" data-before-text="913"></span>Jerusalem the capital of a region ostensibly free from subservience to or taxation by Gentile nations.

<strong>Jerusalem</strong><br/><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb">Following the apostate Ahaz, his son, faithful King Hezekiah, did cleansing and repair work in the temple area and arranged a great Passover celebration that drew worshipers to Jerusalem from all over the land, the northern kingdom included.

In 732 B.C.E., eight years after Assyria’s conquest of the northern kingdom of Israel, Assyrian King Sennacherib made a scythelike sweep through Palestine, diverting some troops to threaten Jerusalem.

(See ARCHAEOLOGY, p. 110.) At any rate, the city’s strength lay not in its defensive systems and supplies, but in the protective power of Jehovah God, who said: “And I shall certainly defend this city to save it for my own sake and for the sake of David my servant.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">2 Ki. 19:32-34</a>) The miraculous destruction of 185,000 Assyrian troops sent Sennacherib scurrying back to Assyria. <span id="page912" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="912" data-before-text="912"></span>(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/58/0" data-bid="59-1" class="b">2 Ki. 19:35, 36</a>) When the campaign account was recorded in the Assyrian annals, it boasted of Sennacherib’s shutting Hezekiah up inside Jerusalem like a ‘bird in a cage,’ but made no claim of capturing the city.—See SENNACHERIB.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">The reign of Manasseh (716-661 B.C.E.) brought further wall construction along the Kidron Valley.

In King Jehoiakim’s eighth year (620/619 B.C.E.) Judah came into vassalage to Babylon. Jehoiakim’s revolt three years later provoked a successful Babylonian siege of Jerusalem, looting of the city’s treasures and the deportation of the then king, Jehoiachin, and other citizens.

Unlike the Assyrians, the Babylonian king moved no replacement peoples into the conquered region. A period of seventy years of desolation set in, even as prophesied.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/72/0" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Jer. 25:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/72/1" data-bid="73-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 36:21</a>.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sb">In the “first year” (evidently as ruler over Babylon) of Cyrus the Persian (538/537 B.C.E.) the royal decree went forth freeing the exiled Jews to “go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and rebuild the house of Jehovah the God of Israel.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/73/0" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Ezra 1:1-4</a>) About 50,000 repatriates made the long trip to Jerusalem, carrying temple treasures with them. They arrived in time to celebrate the festival of booths in Tishri (October/November) 537 B.C.E.

More exiles returned with priest-scribe Ezra in 468 B.C.E., bringing additional things “to beautify the house of Jehovah, which is in Jerusalem” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/75/0" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Ezra 7:27</a>), this by authorization of King Artaxerxes (Longimanus).

This rebuilding was in fulfillment of Daniel’s prophecy and marked the start of the seventy prophetic “weeks” involving the coming of the Messiah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/79/0" data-bid="80-1" class="b">Dan. 9:24-27</a>) Despite harassment, in the short space of fifty-two days, in the year 455 B.C.E., they ringed Jerusalem with a wall and gates.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/80/0" data-bid="81-1" class="b">Neh. 4:1-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/80/1" data-bid="81-2" class="b"> 6:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/80/2" data-bid="81-3" class="b"> 7:1</a>.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sb">Jerusalem was now “wide and great, [but] there were few people inside it.” (Neb. 7:4) Following the public reading of Scriptures and celebrations in the “public square that was before the Water Gate” on the E side of the city (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/81/0" data-bid="82-1" class="b">Neh. 8:1-18</a>), arrangements were made to build up the city’s population by bringing in one Israelite out of every ten to dwell there. This was done by casting lots, but there were evidently volunteers additionally. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/82/0" data-bid="83-1" class="b">Neh. 11:1, 2</a>) A spiritual cleansing work was done to put the city’s population on a sound foundation as regards true worship.

Upon his return to Jerusalem, he found need for further cleansing.

The Greek historians make no mention of Alexander’s entry into Jerusalem. Yet the city did come under Greek dominion and it is reasonable to assume that it was not completely bypassed by Alexander. Josephus, in the first century C.E., records the Jewish tradition that, upon approaching Jerusalem, Alexander was met by the Jewish high priest and was shown the divinely inspired prophecies recorded by Daniel foretelling the lightning conquests by Greece. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/85/0" data-bid="86-1" class="b">Dan. 8:5-7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/85/1" data-bid="86-2" class="b"> 20, 21</a>) Whatever the case, Jerusalem seems to have survived the change in control free of any damage.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sb">Following Alexander’s death, Jerusalem and Judea came under the control of the Ptolemies, who ruled out of Egypt. In 198 B.C.E. Antiochus the Great, ruling in Syria, after taking the fortified city of Sidon, captured Jerusalem, and Judah became a dominion of the Seleucid Empire. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/86/0" data-bid="87-1" class="b">Daniel 11:16</a>.) Jerusalem lay under Syrian rule for thirty years. Then, in the year 168 B.C.E., Syrian King Antiochus IV (Epiphanes), in his attempt to Hellenize completely the Jews, rededicated Jerusalem’s temple to Zeus (Jupiter) and profaned the altar by an unclean sacrifice. (1 Maccabees 1:57, 62; 2 Maccabees 6:1, 2, 5) This led to the Maccabean (or Hasmonean) revolt. After a three-year struggle, Judas Maccabaeus gained control of the city and temple and rededicated Jehovah’s altar to true worship on the anniversary of its profanation, Chislev 25, 165 B.C.E.—1 Maccabees 4:52-54; 2 Maccabees 10:5; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012382/87/0" data-bid="88-1" class="b">John 10:22</a>.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="sb">The war against the Seleucid rulers had not ended. The Jews appealed to Rome for help and thus a new power came on the Jerusalem scene in 161 B.C.E. (1 Maccabees 8:17, 18) Now Jerusalem began to come under the influence of the expanding Roman Empire. About 142 B.C.E., Simon Maccabeus was able to make <span id="page913" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="913" data-before-text="913"></span>Jerusalem the capital of a region ostensibly free from subservience to or taxation by Gentile nations. Aristobulus I, Jerusalem’s high priest, even assumed the title of “King” in 104 B.C.E. He was not, however, of the Davidic line.</p>

<strong>Music</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Considerable importance was attached to the singing at the temple. This is evident from the many Scriptural references to the singers as well as from the fact that they were “set free from <span id="page453" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="453" data-before-text="453"></span>duty” common to other Levites in order to devote themselves wholly to their service.

<strong>Music</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The Bible gives very little information concerning the shape or construction of the more than a dozen different musical instruments that it mentions. Hence, most authorities draw heavily on what archaeologists have discovered about the instruments used by contemporary surrounding nations. However, this may not always be a reliable guide, since it appears that Israel excelled in music in comparison with her <span id="page1192" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1192" data-before-text="1192"></span>neighbors. Additionally, some have linked various instruments of Scripture to instruments used in modern times in the Middle East, which are supposed to have an ancient background. This, too, is conjectural.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The musical instruments of the Bible may be classified as follows:</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="si">String: harp, lute, zither, and others.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sv">Wind: bagpipe, flute, horn, pipe, trumpet, (possibly) nehiloth.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sv">Percussion: cymbals, sistrums, tambourine.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">(See individual articles on the above instruments for further information.)</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">There is no reason to believe that the musical instruments of Israel were crude in design, construction or sound production. The Bible notes that the harps and stringed instruments for temple use were of the choicest imported almug wood; the trumpets, in all probability, of silver. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Ki. 10:11, 12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Num. 10:2</a>) Undoubtedly, in the manufacture of the temple instruments, the most skilled craftsmen were employed.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Both the Scriptures and non-Biblical manuscripts dating from before the Common Era testify to the quality of the instruments as well as the competence of the Israelite musicians. The Dead Sea Scrolls state that a number of trumpets were assigned various complicated signals to be executed “as with one mouth.” This would require not only skilled musicians but also instruments so constructed that the pitch might be regulated in order to bring them all into tune with one another. Freedom from dissonance is indicated by the inspired account of the music at the inauguration of Solomon’s temple: “The [one hundred and twenty] trumpeters and the singers were <em>as one in causing one sound</em> to be heard.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Chron. 5:12, 13</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The Bible lists but four instruments as definitely being in the temple orchestra: trumpets, harps, stringed instruments (Hebrew, <em>neʹvel</em>) and cymbals. While this may not seem to be a complete orchestra by modern standards, it was never intended to be a symphony orchestra, but only to provide accompaniment for the singing at the temple. Such a combination of instruments would serve this purpose excellently.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Chron. 29:25, 26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Neh. 12:27,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/17/2" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 41, 42</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">As to the times when the sacred instruments performed, the Scriptures enumerate the following in connection with the trumpets: “In the day of your rejoicing and in your festal seasons and at the commencements of your months, you must blow on the trumpets over your burnt offerings and your communion sacrifices.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Num. 10:10</a>) After the temple music organization was established, it is likely that the rest of the instruments joined the trumpets on these and other special occasions. This conclusion, as well as the musical procedure followed, seems to be indicated by the order of events described as taking place when sacred services were revived by King Hezekiah after he had cleansed the temple: “At the time that the burnt offering started, the song of Jehovah started and also the trumpets, even under the direction of the instruments of David the king of Israel. And all the congregation were bowing down while the song was resounding and the trumpets were blaring—all this until the burnt offering was finished.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Chron. 29:27, 28</a>) The trumpets being “under the direction of the instruments of David” seems to denote that the trumpeters played in such a manner as to complement the other instruments rather than to overshadow them. The position of the entire body of musicians was “to the east of the altar.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Chron. 5:12</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="ss"><strong>VOCAL MUSIC</strong></p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">The singers at the temple were Levite males. Nowhere do the Scriptures speak of female vocalists at the temple. One of the Targums, too, clearly indicates that they were not present in the chorus. The fact that women were prohibited from even entering certain areas of the temple would seem to preclude their occupying any official position there.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">2 Chron. 5:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Neh. 10:39;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/21/2" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> 12:27-29</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Considerable importance was attached to the singing at the temple. This is evident from the many Scriptural references to the singers as well as from the fact that they were “set free from duty” common to other Levites in order to devote themselves wholly to their service. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Chron. 9:33</a>) Their continuance as a special group of Levites is emphasized by their being listed separately among those returning from Babylon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ezra 2:40, 41</a>) Even the authority of the Persian King Artaxerxes (Longimanus) was brought to bear in their behalf, exempting them, along with other special groups, from ‘tax, tribute and toll.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ezra 7:24</a>) Later, the king commanded that there was to be “a fixed provision for the singers as each day required.” Although Artaxerxes is credited with this order, most likely it was issued by Ezra on the basis of the power granted to him by Artaxerxes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Neh. 11:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Ezra 7:18-26</a>) Thus, it is understandable that, although the singers were all Levites, the Bible makes reference to them as a special body, speaking of “the singers and the Levites.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Neh. 7:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 13:10</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Apart from temple worship, other singers, men and women, are spoken of in Scripture. Examples of these are the male and female singers maintained by Solomon in his court; also, about two hundred singers of both sexes who, in addition to the Levitical musicians, returned from Babylon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Eccl. 2:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> Ezra 2:65;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/27/2" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> Neh. 7:67</a>) These non-Levitical singers, common in Israel, were employed not only to enhance various festive occasions but also to chant dirges in times of sorrow. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">2 Sam. 19:35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 35:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/28/2" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> Jer. 9:17,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/28/3" data-bid="29-4" class="b"> 20</a>) The custom of hiring professional musicians at times of joy and sadness appears to have continued into the time Jesus was on earth.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matt. 11:16, 17</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Although not as prominent as in the Hebrew Scriptures, music is not ignored or overlooked in the Christian Greek Scriptures. Instrumental music in connection with true worship is mentioned only in a figurative sense in the Greek Scriptures (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Rev. 14:2</a>); yet singing seems to have been quite common among God’s servants. Jesus and his apostles sang praises after the Lord’s Evening Meal. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Mark 14:26</a>) Luke tells of Paul and Silas singing when in prison, and Paul’s encouragement to fellow believers was to sing songs of praise to Jehovah.

In recording his inspired vision, John tells of various heavenly creatures singing to God and Christ.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Rev. 5:8-10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 14:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013065/34/2" data-bid="35-3" class="b"> 15:2-4</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong>NATURE OF BIBLICAL MUSIC</strong></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">The Israelites’ higher plane of morality and their superior literature, as exemplified by the poetry and prose of the Hebrew Scriptures, suggest that the music of ancient Israel most likely transcended that of her contemporaries. Certainly the inspiration for the music of Israel was far loftier than that of neighboring nations. Of interest is an Assyrian bas-relief wherein King Sennacherib is represented as demanding that King Hezekiah pay him as tribute both male and female musicians.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">It has long been held by some that Hebrew music was all melody, without harmony. However, the prominence alone of the harp and other stringed instruments in Israel weighs heavily against this assumption. It is almost inconceivable that a musician would play a multistringed instrument and fail to notice that a combination of certain tones was quite pleasing or that a specific series of notes as in an arpeggio produced a pleasant sound. An authority on the history of music, Kurt Sachs, states: “The deep-rooted prejudice that harmony and polyphony [two or more musical parts or voices combined] have been a <span id="page1193" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1193" data-before-text="1193"></span>prerogative of the medieval and modern West does not hold water.” He goes on to say that even among primitive cultures there are many examples of music running in fifths, fourths, thirds as well as in octaves, and that among these peoples, including certain pygmy tribes, there was a development of overlapping antiphony (alternate singing by two divisions of vocalists) into regular canon singing.</p>

Additionally, it was one of the principal cities of Judah (along with Jerusalem and Hebron), and this was not only because it had an excellent supply of water as compared with the surrounding region, thus allowing for both farming and grazing of herds and flocks, but also because important roads converged on it from several directions. From Egypt an ancient route led up by the “Way of the Wells” through Kadesh-barnea to Beer-sheba, being joined by another road over which traveled the camel caravans from the “Spice Kingdoms” of the Arabian Peninsula, heading for Philistia or Judah. From Ezion-geber, at the head of the Gulf of ʽAqaba, another route led up through the Arabah and then turned W, climbing the Ascent of Akrabbim to Beer-sheba. At Gaza, in the Philistine Plain, a road branching from the highway led SE to Beer-sheba. And, connecting it with the rest of Judah, a road ran from Beer-sheba to the NE, climbing the plateau up into the mountains of Judah to Jerusalem and points farther N.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000615/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ge 22:19</a>.</p>

This location is just a few kilometers from the suggested sites of ancient Lod and Hadid. “The valley plain of Ono” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003332/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ne 6:2</a>) possibly denotes the wide valley in which Kafr ʽAna lies. This “valley plain” has also been associated with “the valley of the craftsmen [<em>geh ha·chara·shimʹ</em>].” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003332/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ne 11:35</a>) But some scholars understand the Hebrew <em>geh ha·chara·shimʹ</em> to designate another location and transliterate it as a proper name, “Ge-harashim.”​—<em>JP;</em> compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003332/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1Ch 4:14</a>.</p>
