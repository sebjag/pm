<strong>Why Is It Good to Be Thankful?</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THE Holy Scriptures time and again encourage us to prove ourselves to be thankful persons. An appreciative spirit builds up others, promotes peace and adds to our own happiness. How different it is with thankless persons! Their many complaints and their selfish spirit give rise to discouragement and hurt feelings.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The thankful spirit that we should strive to cultivate is portrayed in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979725/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 92</a>. This psalm also reveals why cultivating an appreciative spirit is right and beneficial. We read: “It is good to give thanks to Jehovah and to make melody to your name, O Most High; to tell in the morning about your loving-kindness and about your faithfulness during the nights, upon a ten-stringed instrument and upon the lute, by resounding music on the harp. For you have made me rejoice, O Jehovah, because of your activity; because of the works of your hands I cry out joyfully.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979725/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 92:1-4</a>.</p>

At what other times can we thank Jehovah for his loving-kindness?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Talking about Jehovah and his loving-kindness is not just for occasions when we are trying to teach persons Bible truths. What about daily conversation? Jesus said: “Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977126/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 12:34</a>) If we truly appreciate God’s loving-kindness, that ought to show up in our daily speech. This was so with the psalmist who wrote: “It is good to give thanks to Jehovah and to make melody to your name, O Most High; to tell in the morning about your loving-kindness and about your faithfulness during the nights.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977126/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 92:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 9.

And they are particularly reluctant to express any personal involvement with God; to do so is viewed as unsophisticated or embarrassing. In part, this tendency may be due to the fact that they are, indeed, not personally involved with God. Yet, in view of how widespread this disinclination is, we can ask ourselves, ‘Have I been influenced by the world’s reluctance to speak about being involved with God or to show in conversation that he is part of my life and thinking?’ Jehovah certainly <em>is</em> part of our lives and should be in our thoughts. We regularly seek his blessing and guidance. So we should not hesitate to speak of him, referring to him in our conversation and indicating our interest in his acts and purposes.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu">10.

Remember, it is not difficult for persons to sense artificial or affected religiousness. Jesus condemned hypocritical Jewish religious leaders for displaying piety merely to be seen and heard. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977126/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 6:1-5</a>) Yet the Bible does urge us to praise and thank Jehovah constantly. So, while heeding the counsel of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977126/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matthew 6:1-5</a> and taking care not to sound <span id="page119" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="119" data-before-text="119"></span>self-righteous, we speak about him.

Perhaps the situation lends itself to speaking of God in a sincere and natural manner. Are you talking about a trip to relax at the seashore or mountains and to enjoy Jehovah’s creation? You appreciate the natural beauty and restfulness of what he has made, so why not mention that?</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">12.

Someone might speak with you about how you train your children, noting your success. Could your reply include a brief expression of thankfulness to God for his counsel that enables a person to be wise in this field? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977126/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 19:7</a>) Perhaps a workmate comments on your spending vacation time to attend a Christian convention instead of using it all for “pleasure.” You could sincerely reply that you enjoy learning more about the loving-kindness and will of your Maker.

<strong>Why Is It Good to Be Thankful?</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The thankful spirit that we should strive to cultivate is portrayed in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979725/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 92</a>. This psalm also reveals why cultivating an appreciative spirit is right and beneficial.

And who does not enjoy the peaceful, relaxing​—yet invigorating—​effect of a stroll in such surroundings? When you add to that the blessings of fresh air to breathe, the fragrance of flowers, and the songs of birds, it is not hard to agree with the declaration: “Because of the works of your hands I cry out joyfully.

These trees are known for their beauty and tasty fruit. Moreover, they keep on thriving for well over a hundred years.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">King Solomon of ancient Israel poetically described the stature of a beautiful Shulammite girl as resembling a palm tree. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007689/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Song of Solomon 7:7</a>) The book <em>Plants of the Bible</em> states: “The Hebrew word for the date palm is ‘tàmâr.’ . . . It became the Jews’ symbol of grace and elegance and was often bestowed by them to women.” For example, Solomon’s beautiful half sister was named Tamar. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007689/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Samuel 13:1</a>) Some parents still give that name to their daughters.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Beautiful women are not the only ones likened to a palm tree. The psalmist sang: “The righteous himself will blossom forth as a palm tree does; as a cedar in Lebanon does, he will grow big. Those who are planted in the house of Jehovah, in the courtyards of our God, they will blossom forth. They will still keep on thriving during gray-headedness, fat and fresh they will continue to be.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007689/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 92:12-14</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Figuratively speaking, those who serve God faithfully during their old age have much in common with the elegant palm tree. “Gray-headedness is a crown of beauty when it is found in the way of righteousness,” says the Bible. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007689/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 16:31</a>) Although their physical strength may falter with advancing years, elderly ones can retain their spiritual vitality by drawing sustenance through a regular study of God’s Word, the Bible. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007689/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 1:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007689/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Jeremiah 17:7, 8</a>) Thanks to their winsome words and their fine example, faithful older ones are a tremendous source of encouragement to others and keep bearing fruit year after year. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007689/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Titus 2:2-5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007689/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Hebrews 13:15, 16</a>) Like the date palm, elderly ones can thrive in their old age.</p>

A righteous person is like a palm tree in that he is upright in Jehovah’s eyes and keeps bearing “fine fruit,” which includes good works.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006523/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Matthew 7:17-20</a>.</p>

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page32" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="32" data-before-text="32"></span><strong>A Lesson From the Palm Tree</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“A GRACEFUL silhouette of unique beauty.” That is how one Bible encyclopedia describes the date palm. In Bible times and today, date palms beautify Egypt’s Nile Valley, and they provide refreshing shade around oases of the Negeb Desert.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Like most species of palm tree, the date palm has a striking upright stance. Some reach a height of 100 feet <strong>[30 m]</strong> and continue to bear fruit for 150 years. Yes, the date palm is very pleasing to the eye and amazingly fruitful. Each year it bears several clusters of dates. Just one cluster may contain well over 1,000 dates. Of dates, one authority wrote: “Those who . . . only know the date from the dried specimens of that fruit shown beneath a label in shop-windows, can hardly imagine how delicious it is when eaten fresh.”</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Fittingly, the Bible likens certain humans to palm trees. To be pleasing in God’s sight, like a fruitful palm tree, a person must be morally upright and must continue to produce good works. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001728/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 7:17-20</a>) For this reason, engraved figures of palm trees were used as decoration in both Solomon’s temple and Ezekiel’s visionary temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001728/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Kings 6:29,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001728/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 32,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001728/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001728/1/3" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> Ezekiel 40:14-16,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001728/1/4" data-bid="2-5" class="b"> 20,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001728/1/5" data-bid="2-6" class="b"> 22</a>) Thus, for one’s worship to be acceptable to God, one must have the desirable characteristics of a date palm. God’s Word explains: “The righteous himself will blossom forth as a palm tree does.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001728/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 92:12</a>.</p>

The fragrance and warm red color of the wood are very attractive, and its high resin content makes it resistant to decay and insect infestation. The trees are strikingly tall and massive, attaining a height of up to 120 feet <strong>[37 m]</strong> and a circumference of up to 40 feet <strong>[12 m]</strong>, and they have deep, strong roots. No wonder some modern foresters have described them as “the crowning glory of the plant world”!</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Bible writer Ezekiel prophetically likened the Messiah to a twig of a cedar, which God himself then plants. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999006/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezekiel 17:22</a>) In fact, the Hebrew word for “cedar” comes from a root meaning “to be firm.” Today, followers of the Messiah, Jesus Christ, likewise need to “stand firm in the faith, . . . grow mighty,” like a tall, resilient cedar. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999006/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 16:13</a>) How can this be accomplished? By firmly resisting unchristian influences and steadfastly enduring in a course of integrity and godly devotion. Those who do so are described in the Bible as “the righteous . . . [who] grow tall as a cedar on Lebanon.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1999006/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 92:12</a>, <em>The New English Bible.</em></p>

The annual crop of dates grows in immense drooping clusters, each weighing from thirty to fifty pounds (13.6 to 22.7 kilograms), and is harvested from June to September. The Arabs say that the palm tree has as many uses as the year has days. In addition to its fruit the leaves are used for thatching roofs, the sides of houses, for fences, mats, baskets, and even dishes. Its fibers are used to make ropes and boat rigging. The date seeds or kernels are ground up and fed to the camels. Wax, sugar, oil, tannin and resin are all obtained from the tree, and a potent drink called “arrak” is distilled from the sap.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Engraved carvings of the palm tree, with its erect form, beauty and fruitfulness, made an appropriate decoration for the inner walls and the doors of Solomon’s temple (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013293/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Ki. 6:29,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013293/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 32,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013293/12/2" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> 35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013293/12/3" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> 2 Chron. 3:5</a>), also the sides of the carriages used in the temple service (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013293/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Ki. 7:36, 37</a>); and palm trees were seen by Ezekiel as decorating the side pillars of the gates of the visionary temple, as well as in the inner walls and doors of the temple.

<strong>Why Is It Good to Be Thankful?</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="si">“When the wicked ones sprout as the vegetation and all the practicers of what is hurtful blossom forth, it is that they may be annihilated forever. But you are on high to time indefinite, O Jehovah. For, look! your enemies, O Jehovah, for, look! your own enemies will perish; all the practicers of what is hurtful will be separated from one another. But you will exalt my horn like that of a wild bull; I shall moisten myself with fresh oil. And my eye will look on my foes; my ears will hear about the very ones who rise up against me, the evildoers. The righteous himself will blossom forth as a palm tree does; as a cedar in Lebanon does, he will grow big. Those who are planted in the house of Jehovah, in the courtyards of our God, they will blossom forth. They will still keep on thriving during gray-headedness, fat and fresh they will continue to be, to tell that Jehovah is upright. He is my Rock, in whom there is no unrighteousness.”</p>

In fact, growth and maturity are desirable characteristics of all living things. The ravages of six thousand years of sin and imperfection that we see around us will soon be a thing of the past, and all obedient humans will enjoy life as it was intended, without the pain of old age and death. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007406/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 1:28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007406/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Revelation 21:4, 5</a>) At that time, “no resident will say: ‘I am sick.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007406/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 33:24</a>) Elderly ones will return to the days of their “youthful vigor,” and their flesh will “become fresher than in youth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007406/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 33:25</a>) For the present, however, all must contend with the Adamic inheritance.

At 84 years of age, she was “never missing from the temple, rendering sacred service night and day with fastings and supplications.” As a woman whose father was a non-Levite “of Asher’s tribe,” Anna could not literally live at the temple. Imagine what it must have taken for her to be at the temple daily from the time of the morning service to the time of the evening service! For her <span id="page22" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>devotion, however, Anna was richly rewarded. She was privileged to be on hand when Joseph and Mary brought the infant Jesus to the temple to be presented to Jehovah according to the Law. At the sight of Jesus, Anna “began returning thanks to God and speaking about the child to all those waiting for Jerusalem’s deliverance.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007406/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 2:22-24,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007406/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 36-38;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007406/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Numbers 18:6, 7</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu">5, 6.

A brother in his 80’s who attends Christian meetings regularly with his wife said: “We have cultivated the custom of going to the meetings. We don’t want to be anywhere else. Where God’s people are, that’s where we want to be. That’s where we feel comfortable.” What an encouraging example for all!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007406/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:24, 25</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> “If anything spiritual comes my way and I can be a part of it, I want to do so.” That is the motto of Jean, a Christian widow in her 80’s. “Of course, I have my sad moments,” she continues, “but why should everybody around me be sad when I am?” With eyes gleaming, she expressed the joy of visiting other lands for upbuilding spiritual occasions. On a recent trip, she told her companions, “I don’t want to see any more castles; I want to go out in the field ministry!” Although she did not know the local language, Jean was able to arouse people’s interest in the Bible’s message. In addition, for a number of years, she worked with a congregation that needed assistance, even though this meant learning a new language and traveling an hour each way to the meetings.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>Keeping the Mind Active</strong></p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 7. During his advanced years, how did Moses express his desire to grow in his relationship with God?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Experience in life comes with the passing of time. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007406/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 12:12</a>) Spiritual advancement, on the other hand, does not come automatically with age. Therefore, rather than merely relying on a reserve of knowledge acquired in the past, loyal servants of God strive to “increase in learning” as the years go by. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007406/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Proverbs 9:9</a>) When Jehovah commissioned him, Moses was 80 years old. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007406/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Exodus 7:7</a>) By his day, living to that age was evidently considered unusual, for he wrote: “In themselves the days of our years are seventy years; and . . . because of special mightiness they are eighty years.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007406/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 90:10</a>) Still, Moses never felt that he was too old to learn. After decades of serving God, enjoying many privileges, and carrying weighty responsibilities, Moses pleaded with Jehovah: “Make me know, please, your ways, that I may know you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007406/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Exodus 33:13</a>) Moses was ever desirous of growing in his relationship with Jehovah.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 8.

What he discerned through his study of “the books”​—possibly including Leviticus, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Hosea, and Amos—​moved him to seek Jehovah in fervent prayer. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007406/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Daniel 9:1, 2</a>) That prayer was answered with inspired information regarding the coming of the Messiah and the future of pure worship.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007406/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Daniel 9:20-27</a>.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu">9, 10.

Worth, a Christian elder in his 80’s, endeavors to keep up-to-date <span id="page23" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>with the spiritual food dispensed by “the faithful and discreet slave.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007406/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45</a>) He says, “I’m just absolutely in love with the truth, and I’m thrilled to see how the light of truth gets brighter and brighter.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007406/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Proverbs 4:18</a>) Similarly, Fred, who has spent more than 60 years in the full-time ministry, finds it spiritually stimulating to initiate Bible discussions with fellow believers. “I have to keep the Bible alive in my mind,” he says. “If you can make the Bible live​—make it meaningful—​and if you can fit what you are learning into ‘the pattern of healthful words,’ then you don’t just have isolated pieces of information. You can see how each piece sparkles in its proper place.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007406/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Timothy 1:13</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Being advanced in age does not necessarily preclude the learning of new and difficult concepts. People in their 60’s, 70’s, and even 80’s have overcome illiteracy or have learned new languages. Some of Jehovah’s Witnesses have done so with the objective of sharing the good news with people of different nationalities. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007406/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Mark 13:10</a>) Harry and his wife were in their late 60’s when they decided to assist in the Portuguese field. “Let’s face it,” says Harry, “any task in life becomes more difficult with age.” Still, with effort and persistence, they were able to conduct Bible studies in Portuguese. For many years now, Harry has also given district convention talks in his new language.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">11. Why consider the accomplishments of faithful older ones?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Of course, not everyone has the health or circumstances to take on such challenges. Why, then, consider what some older ones have accomplished? It is certainly not to suggest that all should strive to achieve the same things. Rather, it is in the spirit of what the apostle Paul wrote to the Hebrew Christians concerning faithful congregation elders: “As you contemplate how their conduct turns out imitate their faith.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007406/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:7</a>) When we contemplate such examples of zeal, we can be encouraged to imitate the strong faith that impels these older ones in their service to God. Explaining what motivates him, Harry, now 87 years of age, says, “I’d like to use my remaining years wisely and be as useful as possible in Jehovah’s service.” Fred, mentioned earlier, finds great satisfaction in caring for his Bethel assignment. He observes, “You have to find how you can best serve Jehovah and stick to it.”</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>Devoted Despite Changing Circumstances</strong></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">12, 13.

Nevertheless, it is possible to demonstrate godly devotion despite such changes. Barzillai the Gileadite is a fine example in this regard. At 80 years of age, he showed extraordinary hospitality to David and his army, providing them with food and lodging during Absalom’s rebellion. When David was returning to Jerusalem, Barzillai <span id="page24" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>escorted the entourage to the Jordan River. David offered to make Barzillai a part of his royal court. Barzillai’s response? “I am eighty years old today. . . .

Graceful, upright palm trees were a common sight in Oriental courtyards in Bible times. In addition to their decorative value, palms were prized for their abundant fruit, with some trees continuing productive for over a hundred years.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2004363/0">a</a> By remaining firmly planted in true worship, you can similarly <span id="page11" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>“go on bearing fruit in every good work.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004363/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Colossians 1:10</a>.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">4, 5. (a) What important fruitage do Christians need to produce?

<strong>Why Is It Good to Be Thankful?</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="si">“When the wicked ones sprout as the vegetation and all the practicers of what is hurtful blossom forth, it is that they may be annihilated forever. But you are on high to time indefinite, O Jehovah. For, look! your enemies, O Jehovah, for, look! your own enemies will perish; all the practicers of what is hurtful will be separated from one another. But you will exalt my horn like that of a wild bull; I shall moisten myself with fresh oil. And my eye will look on my foes; my ears will hear about the very ones who rise up against me, the evildoers. The righteous himself will blossom forth as a palm tree does; as a cedar in Lebanon does, he will grow big. Those who are planted in the house of Jehovah, in the courtyards of our God, they will blossom forth. They will still keep on thriving during gray-headedness, fat and fresh they will continue to be, to tell that Jehovah is upright. He is my Rock, in whom there is no unrighteousness.”</p>

<strong>Is It Gluttony?</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Thus it becomes clear that whether a person is gluttonous or not cannot be determined simply by his outward appearance. A number of factors may cause weight problems. Also, there are people who seem to enjoy much better health when they weigh a little more than what might be usual for others of similar body build. And it can be remembered that what is viewed as ideal as to one’s weight or shape varies considerably from place to place. Among some peoples, being quite slender is thought attractive and sound healthwise, whereas other nationalities and peoples view being plump as a mark of beauty or good health.​—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974202/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 92:14</a>.</p>

<strong>Insight on the News</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>Older, but Not Less Intelligent</strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn">● In contrast with modern emphasis on youth, the Bible often links wisdom with old age. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974522/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 12:12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974522/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974522/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 32:6, 7</a>) But does not old age bring a decline in mental ability? Some aged persons become senile. But a recent article in the Detroit “Sunday News” says that many psychiatrists, educators and gerontologists now view any automatic declining intelligence in old age as “a myth.” “There is plenty of evidence,” says University of Michigan professor Howard Y. McClusky, “that if life is rewarding and people continue to use their talents, they will keep growing intellectually regardless of age.” Compare this with the fine description at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974522/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 92:12-15</a>.</p>

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page489" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="489" data-before-text="489"></span><strong>Bearing Fruit in Old Age</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“THE righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree: . . . They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be full of sap and green: to show that Jehovah is upright.” While those words have particular application to those ‘planted as cedars in the house of Jehovah,’ the “little flock,” they undoubtedly enunciate a principle that applies to all Jehovah’s faithful servants, including the other sheep being gathered to the Right Shepherd today.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954602/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 92:12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954602/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 14, 15</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Among the faithful servants of Jehovah in times past of whom those words were true was Moses, whose active service to Jehovah began when he was eighty years old. Then for forty years he was used by Jehovah to bring honor to his name and miraculously to deliver, guide, instruct, protect and provide for God’s people, and we are told that at the age of 120 years, when he rehearsed Jehovah’s righteous acts and his requirements for his people before the Israelites on the plains of Moab, “his eye had not grown dim and his vital strength had not fled.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954602/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deut. 34:7</a>, <em>NW</em>) Yes, in a most literal sense the psalmist’s words proved true in Moses’ case. That Moses was indeed “old” at the age of eighty is apparent from the words of his psalm: “The years of our life are threescore and ten, or even by reason of strength fourscore.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954602/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 90:10</a>, <em>RS.</em></p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The poet-king David was another who kept bearing fruit in his old age, supervising the gathering of material for the temple, working out its details of construction and its extensive and elaborate form of worship, and singing Jehovah’s praise and giving instructions to his people. “I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.” Truly Jehovah’s goodness and loving-kindness did follow David all the days of his life.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954602/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 37:25</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Bearing fruit in old age was true also of Daniel. He, no doubt, was in his nineties when he fearlessly stood before Belshazzar and his wanton revelers and interpreted the ominous handwriting on the wall; and when, later, he defied the law of the Medes and the Persians to worship his God Jehovah and was delivered from the den of lions, at about which time he also wrote the book bearing his name.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Nor are such examples of fruit-bearing in old age limited to the Hebrew Scripture record. Does not Luke tell us about the faithful priest Zechariah, who in his old age was blessed not only with a son, John the Baptist, but also with the gift of prophecy? And what about the apostle Paul? Although “an aged man” and a prisoner, did he not keep on writing letter after letter, eight of them, of instructions to his brothers on the outside, at the same time making use of every opportunity to preach by word of mouth, thereby proving that the Word of God was not bound, making his last contribution to the Christian Greek <span id="page490" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="490" data-before-text="490"></span>Scripture canon, 2 Timothy, just shortly before his death?—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954602/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Philem. 9</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954602/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 1:5-7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954602/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Acts 28:31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954602/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 2 Tim. 4:6</a>.</p>

He said: “Not one word out of all the good words that Jehovah your God has spoken to <span id="page14" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>you has failed.

After Joshua’s death, however, “another generation began to rise . . . that did not know Jehovah or the work that he had done for Israel. And the sons of Israel fell to doing what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah and serving the Baals.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004363/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Judges 2:8-11</a>.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">17.

Yet, our faith in Jehovah and his promises is reinforced when we hear firsthand accounts of the “great work” that he has performed for his people in these last days. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004363/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Judges 2:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004363/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 2 Peter 1:16-19</a>) If you have been associated with Jehovah’s organization for many years, you may recall the time when there were very few Kingdom proclaimers in your region or country or when the preaching work faced stiff opposition. Over time, you have seen Jehovah remove certain obstacles and ‘speed up’ Kingdom growth.

He will sustain you.” This advice had a profound effect on Tolmina, one of Martha’s Bible students who was baptized in the early 1960’s. “When my husband died,” recalls Tolmina, “I felt very discouraged, but those words made me determined not to miss a single meeting. And Jehovah really did strengthen me to continue.” Tolmina has given the same advice to many of her own Bible students over the years. Indeed, by offering encouragement and recounting Jehovah’s upright dealings, you can do much to build up the faith of fellow believers.</p>

<strong>Vision of the “Time of the End”</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951484/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Daniel 12:5-7</a> continues: “Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river. And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders? And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.” The one clothed in linen here foreshadows Jesus Christ, and this is easily understood by the aid of other scriptures. “I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, a man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with pure gold of Uphaz: his body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as flaming torches, and his arms and his feet like unto burnished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951484/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Dan. 10:5, 6</a>, <em>AS</em>) “I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like unto a son of <span id="page407" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="407" data-before-text="407"></span>man, and he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951484/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Dan. 7:13</a>, <em>AS</em>) Christ Jesus is the one appointed by Jehovah over the waters, which are peoples, nations and tongues.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> Inquiry is made, “How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?” This pictures Jehovah’s people in these last days asking, “How long will these things continue?” The angel standing above the waters with hand upraised as though in an attitude of swearing to God is similar to the vision recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951484/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Revelation 10:5-7</a>, which is also for these last days: “And the angel that I saw standing on the sea and on the earth raised his right hand to heaven, and by the One who lives for ever and ever, who created the heaven and the things in it and the earth and the things in it and the sea and the things in it, he swore: ‘There will be no delay any longer; but in the days of the blast of the seventh angel, when he is destined to blow his trumpet, the sacred secret of God according to the good news which he declared to his own slaves the prophets is indeed brought to a finish.’”—<em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> The Lord Jesus Christ has the sovereignty over all peoples and nations from one extremity to the other; the expanse of waters is encompassed in his mighty rule. “And the seventh angel blew his trumpet.

<strong>Determining Weakness, Wickedness, and Repentance</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Usually, more than one person is affected by a sin. For example, an adulterer sins against God; he victimizes his wife and children; if his partner in sin is married, he victimizes her family; and he stains the good name of the congregation. How does he view all of that? Does he show heartfelt sorrow along with genuine repentance? Or does he manifest the spirit described in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995003/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Psalm 94</a>: “All the practicers of what is hurtful keep bragging about themselves. Your people, O Jehovah, they keep crushing, and your inheritance they keep afflicting. The widow and the alien resident they kill, and the fatherless boys they murder. And they keep saying: ‘Jah does not see; and the God of Jacob does not understand it’”?​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995003/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Psalm 94:4-7</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Likely, the sins handled in a congregation will not involve murder and killing. Yet the <em>spirit</em> manifested here​—the spirit of being ready to victimize others for personal benefit—​may become obvious as the elders investigate wrongdoing. This too is arrogance, the mark of a wicked man. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995003/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Proverbs 21:4</a>) It is totally the opposite of the spirit of a true Christian, who is willing to sacrifice himself for his brother.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995003/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">John 15:12, 13</a>.</p>

<strong>“This Is Our God”</strong><br/><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">The Scriptures prove conclusively that God does observe. “The One planting the ear, can he not hear? Or the One forming the eye, can he not look?” Of course he can, and, in time, he will execute justice, as the Bible psalmist goes on to show: “Jehovah is knowing the thoughts of men . . . And he will turn back upon them their hurtfulness and will silence them with their own calamity. Jehovah our God will <span id="page231" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="231" data-before-text="231"></span>silence them.” Happily, we are fast approaching the day when Jehovah God will clean this earth of all unrighteousness. How grateful we can be that our God is a lover of justice!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ps. 94:6-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 37:9-11</a>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="ss"><strong>MATCHLESS IN POWER</strong></p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">Jehovah also has unlimited power. Not only does Jehovah possess the power to destroy evildoers; he also has the ability to preserve his servants alive into a righteous new order. He demonstrated this long ago by wiping out a wicked system of things by a global flood and delivering righteously disposed Noah and his family into a cleansed earth. Showing the significance of that deliverance, Jesus Christ said: “Just as the days of Noah were, so the presence of the Son of man will be.” This, therefore, is an assurance that God will protect his people when he soon brings destruction upon this wicked system of things.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matt. 24:37;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 2 Pet. 2:9</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">Our God will then demonstrate his power in behalf of the survivors by initiating a miraculous program of physical healing. The eyes of the blind will be opened, the ears of the deaf will be unstopped, the lame will climb up just like a stag, the sick will be healed and the aged will grow progressively younger until once again they enjoy the vigor of youth. O what a happy time that will be! But what about those who have died during the past centuries of human history? Will they be denied these blessings? Jesus Christ supplied the answer when he said: “Do not marvel at this, because the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out.” Think of that! Resurrection from the dead!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">Do you wonder whether God has the power to perform these miracles? Well, stop and reason. Do not miracles occur every day? What happens when a seemingly lifeless seed, perhaps of corn, is placed in the ground? Why, in a few days it pushes upward and, in time, golden ears of corn appear on the stalk. Can man make a seed grow? Does he even understand the secret of growth? Of course not! It is a miracle! Yet God is responsible for similar miracles occurring all the time. One cuts his finger, and the wound miraculously heals. A person eats some food and before long it is transformed into flesh, bones, hair, nails and other body materials. God’s works are truly wonderful!</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">Therefore, is there not every reason to believe that God can also resurrect the dead and restore ailing mankind to perfect life? Yes, most certainly! Not only is He unsurpassed in wisdom, abundant in love and a lover of justice, but our God Jehovah is also matchless in power, truly a miracle-working God. For these reasons, we invite you to join with us as we “walk in the name of Jehovah our God to time indefinite, even forever.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Mic. 4:5</a>.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sd">Praise Jah, you people, for it is good to make melody to our God; For it is pleasant—praise is fitting. He is healing the brokenhearted ones, and is binding up their painful spots. He is counting the number of the stars; all of them he calls by their names. Our Lord is great and is abundant in power; his understanding is beyond recounting. Jehovah is relieving the meek ones; he is abasing the wicked ones to the earth. Respond to Jehovah with thanksgiving, you people; make melody to our God on the harp, the One who is covering the heavens with clouds, the One preparing rain for the earth, the One making the mountains to sprout green grass. To the beasts he is giving their food, to the young ravens that keep calling. Jehovah is finding pleasure in those fearing him, in those waiting for his loving-kindness.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ps 147:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 3-9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/26/2" data-bid="27-3" class="b"> 11</a>.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb"></p>

Far be it from His glory that He should have a son!” “How, when He hath no consort, should He have a son?” “It beseemeth not God to beget a son.”</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Of course, it would be foolish for anyone to limit the power of God by saying, ‘God <em>cannot</em> have a son.’ Truthfully, the Koran proclaims, “Verily, God is Almighty.” (2:19) He is the Creator of the universe, of heaven and earth and of the creatures in them. As God said to Abraham, that man of faith recognized by both Christians and Moslems, “Is anything too extraordinary for Jehovah?” A person who really is in submission to the Omnipotent God must agree with the prophet who said, “With God all things are possible.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965681/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 18:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965681/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Matt. 19:26</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">No Moslem denies that it is God who created humans and endowed them with power to have sons. Yes, God created Adam with power to have sons. Now, was it a blind man who invented and made the first camera? Or was it a deaf man who first thought of and fashioned the telephone? No, reasons Sir Isaac Newton, the English mathematician, physicist and astronomer. He said, “Was the eye contrived without skill in optics, or the ear without knowledge of sounds?” In support of the obvious answer the Bible says: “Understand, you who are unreasoning among the people; and as for you stupid ones, when will you have any insight? The One planting the ear, can he not hear? Or the One forming the eye, can he not look?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965681/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 94:8, 9</a>) The One who gave man power to have sons, can He not have a son? “Verily, God is Almighty.” The logical answer is an indisputable Yes, and that is why Abraham believed when God told him that he would have a son. With just elementary insight a reasoning person must agree: God <em>can</em> have a son.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>ADAM, “THE SON OF GOD”</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The word “son” means “a human male considered with reference to his parents or either of them; a male descendant.” Every male child or person has to be the son of someone who as father produced or generated his life. Thus, because Abdallah begot or generated the life of the one who became <span id="page550" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="550" data-before-text="550"></span>the prophet Mohammed, Mohammed is said to be “the son of Abdallah.” Now, what about the first forefather of Mohammed and of us all, the first man Adam—who was his father? Adam had no <em>human</em> father, but still he had to be the son of someone. Of whom? God was his father. Hence Adam must have been the son of God. Correctly, the Book containing the most ancient history of the human race says, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965681/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 3:38</a>, that Adam was “the son of God.”</p>

<strong>The Bible and Creation in the Light of Modern Science</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> In spite of this evidence, evolutionists who are atheists still believe that a living cell arose by accident. But even the most capable scientists with all their elaborate equipment have not succeeded in creating one tiny living cell! As one “distinguished authority on evolution” admitted: “No living chemist can shape a dinosaur, no living hand can start the dreaming tentacular extensions that characterize the life of the simplest ameboid cell.” (<em>Harper’s Magazine,</em> March 1964) If this cannot be done <span id="page587" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="587" data-before-text="587"></span>under the best of experimental conditions, it could hardly have happened by accident. The Bible correctly points to the source of life at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964722/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 36:9</a> when it says: “For with you [Jehovah] is the source of life.”</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> One might be tempted to think of a living cell as being so simple that it could accidentally arise out of inanimate matter. However, as one scientist said, each cell is “a system so intricate and delicate that its complete functioning has so far escaped our study.”<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1964722/2">c</a> Of its performance, he stated: “Each cell performs . . . activities with a precision that by comparison makes the running of even the finest watch a clumsy affair.” Another described a cell as “a little universe, formed of a host of self-propagating organisms, inconceivably minute and numerous as the stars of heaven.”<a id="footnotesource4" data-fnid="4" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1964722/3">d</a> A magazine declared: “The cell is as complicated as New York City.”<a id="footnotesource5" data-fnid="5" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1964722/4">e</a></p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">15. Show why anything organized demands an organizer.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> No one possessed of his senses would claim that New York, London, Moscow, Paris, Tokyo or other cities came into existence by themselves. As one physicist said: “No material thing can create itself.”<a id="footnotesource6" data-fnid="6" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1964722/5">f</a> But <em>one</em> living cell contains trillions of tiny units, each automatically performing functions more complicated than those performed in any city. Also, there are trillions of cells in just one adult human body! And we are asked to believe that this all came about by accident! No, nothing organized can ever come about by accident. If a housewife wanted to bake an apple pie, would she wait for some apples to fall off a tree accidentally into her oven, which accidentally happened to have flour, eggs and other ingredients in it, and then hope these would accidentally arrange themselves into a pie, which would accidentally cook itself just the right length of time? That would, of course, be ridiculous. But making a pie is simple compared to making living things, and if simple things cannot happen by accident, surely the infinitely more complex could not either.</p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">16. How do parts of the human body speak of a Creator?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Consider, too, parts of the human body such as the eye, so intricate it took scientists centuries to discover some knowledge of how it operates. The camera is a clumsy imitation of the eye, but it took the genius of inventors, the accuracy of mathematicians, the skill of craftsmen years to develop. Did the far more complicated human eye just happen to develop by itself because some blind jellyfish wanted to see? How did it know it wanted to see when it could not possibly have known what seeing was? No, the human eye is a marvel of creation, brought into existence by One who could already see, as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964722/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 94:9</a> says: “The One planting the ear, can he not hear? Or the One forming the eye, can he not look?”</p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">17, 18. How do modern inventions show the universe had a Creator?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> An astronaut comes back from orbiting the earth in a capsule of a few tons and is hailed as a hero. The scientists who devised the mechanism are lauded. What would they think if you declared that the thousands of pieces of metal just chanced to assemble themselves into a capsule and rocket, just happened to be filled with fuel, just happened to ignite when the man was accidentally in the capsule, and then the entire affair just chanced to go into orbit? They would dismiss you as a joker or a mental incompetent. Yet, Jehovah put the earth, weighing an estimated six and a half sextillion tons, into perfect orbit with millions of living things on it, with no reentry problems, no worries over oxygen supplies, no need to squeeze food from a tube or to be concerned about how to get rid of body <span id="page588" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="588" data-before-text="588"></span>wastes. And we are asked to believe that this just happened by itself!</p>

<strong>Be Taught by Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">When on earth Jesus proved himself to be the greatest instrument or Teacher this earth had ever seen. He had more knowledge and teaching ability than any other <span id="page343" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="343" data-before-text="343"></span>human before or since. He taught his people on the mountainside, on the seaside, in their homes, synagogues and the temple. As he himself testified: “Day after day I used to sit in the temple teaching.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 26:55</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">He trained a nucleus of disciples to be teachers, who, in turn, taught others. Yes, God by Jesus “gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as missionaries, some as shepherds and teachers, with a view to the training of the holy ones for ministerial work.” And so we read of the teaching activities of the apostles throughout the book of Acts.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Eph. 4:11, 12</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">We should not expect it to be different today, and it is not different. Just as the early Christian congregation had a governing body at Jerusalem that directed the teaching work, so today there is a governing body to be found in the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses that gives evidence of being used by Jehovah to teach his children. It uses legal societies for the purpose of publishing Bibles and Bible-study aids and for training ministers. It helps organize Christians into congregations so that they can discharge their obligations to be teachers of God’s Word. Today in 179 different lands and islands of the sea upward of 900,000 of these ministers are being taught of Jehovah and, in turn, teaching others.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="ss"><strong>HIS INSPIRED BOOK—THE BIBLE</strong></p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Jehovah’s chief instrument for teaching his people is his inspired Word, the Bible; even as was implied in the references to it in considering God’s other instrumentalities for teaching his people. As we read: “The One correcting the nations, can he not reprove, even the One teaching men knowledge? Happy is the able-bodied man whom you correct, O Jah, and whom you teach out of your own law.”</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">We might say that there are four basic fields of knowledge covered in the Bible. First there is history and prophecy, telling us what has happened and what will yet happen. Beginning when God was alone, these carry us to at least a thousand years in the future.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ps. 94:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 12</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">In addition to history and prophecy there is also much Bible teaching of basic truths or doctrines. Chief among these is that of the Kingdom by means of which God will vindicate his sovereignty. Second only to it is the Bible teaching of the ransom, why the Son of God died and how we can benefit from his death. Baptism and the resurrection are two other prominent Bible doctrines.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">Further, the Bible contains God’s righteous principles, both explicitly stated and implied. It tells us what God requires of us, what is right and what is wrong; what our duties are toward God and our fellow man; duties of husbands, wives, parents, children, overseers and ministerial assistants.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">God’s Word also gives us explicit instructions as to the commission of Christians to be teachers, ministers of God’s religion: how this preaching work is to be done, what is to be said and the manner in which to present it. In all this, God’s Word, by express commands, by showing us God’s example, and by the records made by the righteous and the wicked, teaches us what to do and what to avoid.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">For us to be taught of Jehovah we must have the fear of Jehovah and be meek, for a meek person is teachable. “Who, now, is the man fearful of Jehovah? He will instruct him in the way that he will choose.” Jehovah will “teach the meek ones his way.” Our attitude must be one of wanting to be taught: “Make me know your own ways, Jehovah; teach me your own paths.” “Teach me to do your will, for you are my God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 25:12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/17/2" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/17/3" data-bid="18-4" class="b"> 143:10</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">Truly this world gives evidence that it <span id="page344" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="344" data-before-text="344"></span>is not being taught by Jehovah. How foolish, in view of the fact that he has all wisdom and knowledge and is the greatest Teacher and Instructor in all the universe! Among his instrumentalities for teaching, as we have seen, are his “book of nature,” his providences, his holy spirit, his visible organization and his inspired Word. And he stands ready to teach all those who fear him and are meek.</p>

Do we want to be happy? We can be. How? There are twenty-four happinesses or beatitudes in the Psalms that tell us the secret of how to be happy with the happiness that will never end. It is instructive for us to hear some of these beatitudes! The very book of Psalms opens with a beatitude, “Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked ones, and in the way of sinners has not stood and in the seat of ridiculers has not sat.

<strong>Dispelling the Spirit of Complaint</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Jehovah is very well pleased with those who are interested in the poor of this world, because it is this class of people who listen to the message of the Kingdom. The psalmist said: “How happy is he that is attentive to the poor, in the day of calamity will Yahweh deliver him: Yahweh will preserve him and keep him alive and he shall be pronounced happy in the land, do not then give him up at the desire of his enemies!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953044/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 41:1, 2</a>, <em>Ro</em>) We certainly cannot quit preaching this gospel <span id="page55" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="55" data-before-text="55"></span>of the Kingdom just because it is the desire of our enemies. Rather, Jehovah’s witnesses will be pronounced happy if they keep these truths concerning Jehovah’s kingdom before the poor of the world, those who are sighing and crying because of the abominations of this old system. When we think of our brothers and sisters and of all the servants of God in other lands and how the enemy has kept them under assault, we should be very thankful to God for the freedom we have and should show our gratitude by preaching the gospel to a greater extent while we still have the opportunity. All should show their maturity by setting the right example in house-to-house witnessing, by conducting home Bible studies and by aiding the immature ones to be more consistent in their field service.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">10. Through what attitude and action respecting Jehovah’s organization may we be happy?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Never allow yourself to start complaining about the place you have in God’s organization. Instead be happy with the organization and stay in it. “How happy are the people who know the joyful sound! O Yahweh! in the light of thy countenance shall they firmly march along; in thy Name shall they exult all the day, and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953044/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 89:15, 16</a>, <em>Ro</em>) Jehovah’s people are very happy as they march along in holy array, keeping firm. All around the globe we hear God’s servants as they make a joyful sound of worship to Jehovah in holy formation. Each one must hold to his position and try to improve his efficiency in the service. There is no reason to have any doubts as to the outcome of the matter. God’s Word has revealed his purposes to us; so his faithful servants in the earth know what he is going to do, and they should march shoulder to shoulder, never breaking their ranks. We realize that some will make mistakes, but that is no reason for complaint. The thing to do is to correct the mistakes.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>HAPPY THROUGH CORRECTION</strong></p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">11. How is the person whom Jehovah corrects to keep happy for it?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> “How happy the man whom thou correctest, O Yah! and whom out of thy law thou instructest!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953044/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 94:12</a>, <em>Ro</em>) If we were not corrected and we kept on going in our wrong way, we should soon find ourselves back in the Devil’s organization. The only way we can have happiness is by being corrected and by staying in line with the new system of things in Jehovah’s organization. The God of the heavens is not going to come down to earth or send some angel to sit down with us to explain matters to us. No, it may be that our brother will do the talking. It may be our mother or our father. It may be a company servant or a circuit servant who brings us the corrective information. It may come through the <em>Watchtower</em> magazine. It will come from within Jehovah’s organization, and it is for the benefit of those in the organization. The correction may hurt; it may hit hard, and if you cannot take the correction you are going to lose your happiness. Of course, there is no joy at the moment the correction is given; but afterward when we see the error of our way and when we get back in line with God’s arrangements again, then we can rejoice and appreciate the value of the correction. “It is for discipline you are enduring. God is dealing with you as with sons. . . . True, no discipline seems for the present to be joyous, but grievous; yet afterward to those who have been trained by it it yields peaceable fruit, namely, righteousness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953044/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Heb. 12:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953044/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 11</a>, <em>NW</em>) The real servant of Jehovah will be glad for the correction; so it is true that a man who is corrected by Jehovah is happy.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">12. How should we not spurn correction, and why not?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Do not spurn correction. If someone <span id="page56" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="56" data-before-text="56"></span>comes to you and starts telling you that you are wrong about something, listen to him. Do not get excited right away and say: “Well, now let me tell you something.” No, the thing to do is to listen to that person if he has something on his mind he believes he should tell you. Think—maybe there is something wrong with you, and probably there is, because we are all born in sin and shaped in iniquity. There is one thing we know, that we want to remain in Jehovah’s organization. And if we are receiving a correction even though we have done no wrong, the correction still is not going to hurt us; but if we have done wrong, then the advice and counsel will be of great benefit to us and we shall not find ourselves slipping off into the Devil’s organization. If we ever find ourselves outside Jehovah’s organization because of wrongdoing, we can be sure we shall never enjoy the same happiness in the world that we enjoyed in his organization. Therefore we must always keep our minds on the things of God. We must make our minds over and keep on correcting ourselves.</p>

Do we want to be happy? We can be. How? There are twenty-four happinesses or beatitudes in the Psalms that tell us the secret of how to be happy with the happiness that will never end. It is instructive for us to hear some of these beatitudes! The very book of Psalms opens with a beatitude, “Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked ones, and in the way of sinners has not stood and in the seat of ridiculers has not sat. But his delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1, 2</a>) The beatitude in the Second Psalm is one that not only world rulers but all of us under the shadow of Armageddon ought to heed: “Serve Jehovah with fear and be joyful with trembling.

We can picture her father coming in, picking her up, and holding her in his arms until she falls asleep. Although the storm is still raging, her father’s comforting embrace makes her feel safe. When we face frightening trials, we may need our heavenly Father to hold us figuratively until the intense feelings pass. How can we receive such comfort from Jehovah?</p>

<strong>Is There a Way out of Unhappiness?</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Actually, whether we are truly happy or not depends greatly on us. That is why we need to have our thoughts under control. Otherwise, unpleasant memories, silly fancies or even wicked promptings will soon gain the upper hand. If we find ourselves in an unhappy frame of mind, we might well ask: What was I thinking about just before I suddenly became so downhearted? Of course, we can switch off a bad television program, but wrong thoughts, when there, are not so easily dismissed. However, what a blessing it is that we can pray for God’s help! By means of his holy spirit, or active force, Jehovah will gladly help us to keep our thoughts under control. The psalmist David once said: “When my disquieting thoughts became many inside of me, your own [Jehovah’s] consolations began to fondle my soul.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983161/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 94:19</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">If we implore Jehovah for help, for whatever reason, we must listen to him when he speaks to us. His infinite wisdom and love are reflected in the Scriptures, and counsel on every situation that we are likely to experience is clearly set forth in the Bible. Hence, our happiness can be restored or made sure if we apply Jehovah’s counsel in life. Jesus said: “Happy are those hearing the word of God and keeping it!”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1983161/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 11:28</a>.</p>

Since the policy of imposing fines of at least 2,500 pesetas was not having the desired effect, the Ministry of the Interior had consulted with the Ministry of Justice and had come up with the following recommendation:</p><p id="p350" data-pid="350" class="sb">“As a result, I urge Your Excellency on orders from His Excellency the Minister of the Interior, that you denounce to the Tribunals for Vagrants and Criminals such members of the said sect that should be caught <span id="page201" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="201" data-before-text="201"></span>carrying out such activities, so that these Tribunals in their case can find motives for taking action.

God’s own unchangeable time schedule calls for that in the near future. Therefore, we as his dedicated people are facing the most faith-testing experience in all the history of Jehovah’s witnesses from the time of Abel the first martyr for Jehovah down to the present “conclusion of the system of things.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961922/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rev. 16:14-16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961922/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Matt. 24:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961922/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 28:20</a>) The world <span id="page754" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="754" data-before-text="754"></span>population is increasing far faster than we are finding the “lost sheep” and bringing them into the safety of Almighty God’s organization.

The prayer of the persecuted, hated David is most suitable for us to offer now: “Instruct me, O Jehovah, in your way, and lead me in the path of uprightness on account of my foes. Do not give me over to the soul of my adversaries; for against me false witnesses have risen up, and he who launches forth violence.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961922/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 27:11, 12</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">15, 16.

They will try to make it so hard for us that the ordinary person of this old world would lose all hope for the future. They want to break down our faith in the ultimate fulfillment of God’s good promises for the future beyond this world of tribulation. That was how hard they made it for David, who was a prophetic type of Jesus Christ, the Son of David. Under the circumstances did David furnish us a good and correct example? He did.

But even while he was in the midst of a faith-testing situation he urged us to keep on hoping in Jehovah. By advising others to do so, he proved that he himself was doing so when such hoping was needed to uphold him in his godly integrity. He kept courageous.</p>

The Nazis maintained that the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses (Earnest Bible Students) were inimical and ‘disturbed the National Socialistic construction.’ When Jehovah’s witnesses went into the courts to fight for their rights and some were set free, the Reich’s Ministry of Justice prepared a lengthy opinion to ensure that Jehovah’s witnesses could not be freed, saying, in conclusion: “The courts must not fail on account of merely apparent legal formalities; but must seek and find ways in spite of the formal difficulties, to fulfill their high duties.” This meant that true justice could not be had. Ten thousand suffered in the concentration camps. They did not try to take the law into their own hands and rise up against the government.

The Nazis maintained that the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses (Earnest Bible Students) were inimical and ‘disturbed the National Socialistic construction.’ When Jehovah’s witnesses went into the courts to fight for their rights and some were set free, the Reich’s Ministry of Justice prepared a lengthy opinion to ensure that Jehovah’s witnesses could not be freed, saying, in conclusion: “The courts must not fail on account of merely apparent legal formalities; but must seek and find ways in spite of the formal difficulties, to fulfill their high duties.” This meant that true justice could not be had.

His all-seeing eyes range through the whole earth to locate those who are devoted to him that he might show his strength in their behalf. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951204/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Chron. 16:9</a>) What a God he is! Before him all the false gods must shortly bow in defeat at Armageddon. “For Jehovah is a great God, and a great King above all gods.” He is to be feared, rather than the totalitarian aggressors bent on world conquest for enthroning their political gods and form of religion everywhere. “For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods.” Those who make him their refuge and who trust in his strength credit him with godship and say: “For thou, Jehovah, art most high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951204/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Pss. 95:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951204/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 96:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951204/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 97:9</a>, <em>AS</em>) Because he supplies secret strength to his witnesses, they have been able to endure the most determined and fiendish persecution from human agents of the false gods. Greedy dictators craving world empire have punished those who would not join in idolizing them. But when these dictators went down, Jehovah’s witnesses have lived on and have found fresh strength to renew their witnessing to the “God of gods”. Today they gratefully exclaim: “Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; for his lovingkindness endureth for ever. Oh give thanks unto the God of gods; for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951204/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 136:1, 2</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>“A VERY PRESENT HELP”</strong></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="qu"> 5, 6. Because of the worsening trouble, in what prayers do the Catholic Hierarchy indulge? Why will God not answer such prayers?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[27]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> It appears to be human nature for people, when helpless in trouble, to appeal to their gods for aid and deliverance. For instance, in spite of the 1950 Holy Year, the world’s difficulties worsened to an alarming degree. So the pope of Vatican City in his encyclical of December 6 called on the Catholic world to engage in a novena of prayer for peace. Addressing the college of cardinals five days later, the pope called for a “general accord of intentions of all human hearts which, with the aid of God, may cause all the dangers which are threatening peace to disappear throughout the world”. (N. Y. <em>Times,</em> Dec. 12, 1950) But prayers to God are vain the intentions of which are contrary to his will. As <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951204/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">James 4:2, 3</a> (<em>Dy</em>) says: “You contend and war, and you have not, because you ask not. You ask, and receive not; because you ask amiss: that you may consume it on your concupiscences.” It is not God’s will at this time to establish world peace in order for the nations to return to normal. If he restored peace, the nations would only consume its benefits upon their concupiscences and selfish desires, showing they are “lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God”.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[27]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> The timetables of God’s Word set this period down as a time marked for international troubles, when there would be “on the earth anguish of nations, not knowing <span id="page178" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="178" data-before-text="178"></span>the way out because of the roaring of the sea and its agitation, while men become faint out of fear and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth”. For Christendom it was to be a time when “we looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health [by means of holy years, etc.], and behold trouble!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951204/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Luke 21:25, 26</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951204/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Jer. 8:15</a>) This is not the time for God to make peace for the nations of this world. So the efforts of the pope and his hierarchy to try their hand and pose as a mediator between the communist bloc and the democratic bloc will prove unavailing. Neither Catholics nor Protestants need expect help from God through them.</p>

How insignificant humans are when compared with the all-wise Creator of heaven and earth!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 8:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 3, 4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 19:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Just look around and observe the wisdom with which God designed our earthly home. What matchless beauty there is! Can anything compare with the glorious sunsets, snowcapped mountains, sandy beaches, green valleys, rushing rivers and colorful flowers? Take a deep breath of air. It is of just the right composition of gases to sustain life. How appropriate that man absorbs oxygen from the air but returns carbon dioxide, while plants take in the carbon dioxide, utilize it in producing life-sustaining products and return oxygen to the atmosphere!</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Everywhere around us such wisdom is manifest. Observe the miracle of growth. How wonderful is the way tiny seeds bloom into glorious arrays of fragrant blossoms! Taste the marvelous variety of delicious foods. Feel the warmth of the sun. Listen to the delightful songs of birds. No wonder the appreciative psalmist sang: “How many your works are, O Jehovah! All of them in wisdom you have made. The earth is full of your productions.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 104:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Prov. 3:19</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">And what of the greatest masterpiece of God’s earthly productions—man himself? With what wisdom our minds and bodies are constructed! How beyond comprehension is the reproductive process, whereby one infinitesimally small male sperm unites with a female egg to develop, according to God’s masterful design, into a living, breathing human creature! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 139:14-18</a>) Does not the wisdom of our God recommend him as the One whom we should worship? Therefore, accept the invitation: “O come in, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before Jehovah our Maker. For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasturage and the sheep of his hand.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965280/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 95:6, 7</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Although Jehovah’s infinite wisdom recommends him as a God worthy of our worship, his boundless love makes him even more desirable to us.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>ABUNDANT IN LOVE</strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Jehovah God showed love by taking on the responsibility of fathering earthly children. The exceptional quality of his love was demonstrated by providing this beautiful earth as their home and settling the first human pair in a gorgeously prepared section of it. Even when Adam and Eve rebelled against him, Jehovah continued to manifest his love by permitting them to live for a time so that we and the rest of mankind could come into existence and learn of his grand provisions. It is true that allowing sinful creatures to live has resulted in much trouble on earth, and even though wicked angels and evilly inclined <span id="page230" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="230" data-before-text="230"></span>men are the ones responsible, our loving Creator has often been the one unjustly blamed.

<strong>Beware of a Lack of Faith</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> The lesson, therefore, is that if we fall into the habit of failing to “listen to his own voice,” ignoring counsel from Jehovah through his Word and the faithful slave class, it will not be long before our hearts become callous, hardened. For example, an unmarried couple may get a little too intimate. What if they simply ignore the matter? Would that protect them from repeating what they did, or would that only make it easier for them to do it again? Similarly, when the slave class offers counsel on the need to be selective in our choice of music and entertainment, and so forth, do we gratefully accept it and make adjustments where necessary? Paul urged us ‘not to forsake the gathering of ourselves together.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998523/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:24, 25</a>) In spite of this counsel, some take a casual view of Christian meetings. They may feel that missing some of them or even omitting certain meetings entirely is inconsequential.</p>

<strong>Beware of Sin’s Hardening Effects!</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">How <em>does</em> sin gain such control over a person?

For this reason I became disgusted with this generation and said, “They always go astray in their hearts, and they themselves have not come to know my ways.” So I swore in my anger, “They shall not enter into my rest.”’”</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“The occasion of causing bitter anger” occurred at a place called both Meribah and Massah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986246/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 95:8</a>) There, shortly after their miraculous deliverance from Egypt, “the people fell to quarreling with Moses and saying: ‘Give us water that we may drink.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986246/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Exodus 17:2</a>) Remember, they had already seen ten devastating plagues on Egypt, the surging waters of <span id="page24" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>the Red Sea split apart, and manna falling from heaven. Yet they went “astray in their hearts.” They were absorbed too much by their own selfish desires to reflect on Jehovah’s works. So they did not ‘come to know God’s ways’ and develop confidence that Jehovah could provide for them under any circumstances. “Give us water!” they demanded, as if the God who split the sea were powerless. No wonder, then, that they later chose to believe the bad report of ten fearful spies who inspected the Promised Land.

However, Paul explains: “There remains a sabbath resting for the people of God. For the man that has entered into God’s rest has also himself rested from his own works, just as God did from his own.” The pattern of disobedience shown by Israel is to be avoided. “For the word of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two-edged sword . . . and is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990119/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Heb. 4:9, 10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990119/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 12</a>.</p>

<strong>Beware of a Lack of Faith</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> The lesson, therefore, is that if we fall into the habit of failing to “listen to his own voice,” ignoring counsel from Jehovah through his Word and the faithful slave class, it will not be long before our hearts become callous, hardened. For example, an unmarried couple may get a little too intimate. What if they simply ignore the matter? Would that protect them from repeating what they did, or would that only make it easier for them to do it again? Similarly, when the slave class offers counsel on the need to be selective in our choice of music and entertainment, and so forth, do we gratefully accept it and make adjustments where necessary?

No; for he took them away from the polytheistic surroundings of Egypt and also far from the idolatrous Canaanites, and under these conditions it should have been easier for them to go right since he had given them a witness of his Godship. They could now well show their sincerity and earnestness in worshiping Jehovah and obeying him. But this opportunity to cultivate pure worship they turned into a “day of temptation in the wilderness” for God by putting him to the test. They tried to make him compromise his principles of righteousness and not stick to his spoken word and his Law covenant with them or enforce its penalties. So thousands of them were laid low in the wilderness for yielding to temptations which they created for themselves by letting selfish desire rise in them and then yielding to these desires and rebelling against Jehovah God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Deut. 8:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/31/1" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/31/2" data-bid="32-3" class="b"> Ps. 95:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/31/3" data-bid="32-4" class="b"> Heb. 3:7-9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/31/4" data-bid="32-5" class="b"> 1 Cor. 10:9</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">18.

God was not asking Abraham to do something He himself would not do, for Abraham here pictured Jehovah God. In the great test of God as to the depths of his love for mankind he proved himself big-hearted enough to sacrifice his only-begotten Son Jesus Christ. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">John 3:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> Heb. 11:17-19</a>, <em>NW</em>) To explode Satan’s false charge against Job, God let Job be tried and proved Job’s loyalty. Likewise he lets Job’s counterpart, the Job class which begins with Jesus particularly, be tried and their loyalty and their worthiness of God’s reward be proved.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Jas. 5:10, 11</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">19.

For one thing, God does so by strengthening us to stand the trial he lets come upon us and also by forewarning us. Before letting the spirit drive Jesus into the wilderness to be tempted by Satan the heavenly Father filled the Son with the holy spirit and also opened up the heavens to his vision. He also audibly acknowledged him as his approved Son. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Matt. 3:13-17</a>) God does not let us work up a temptation innocently for ourselves by ignorance, as when his servant Paul warned married couples. They were well-meaning in having no sexual intercourse, but Paul advised otherwise, “that Satan may not keep tempting you [toward adultery] for your lack of self-regulation.” Paul warns that Christians who are determined to be rich contrary to Scriptural advice “fall into temptation and a snare and many senseless and hurtful desires which plunge men into destruction and ruin. For the love of money is a root of all sorts of injurious things”. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:1-5</a> and; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:9, 10</a>, <em>NW</em>) Jesus, too, warned against the deceptive power of wealth.

To protect a Christian novice against the weaknesses of himself, the apostle Paul instructed that no newly converted man was to be made a congregational overseer. Why not? “For fear that he might get puffed up with pride and fall into the judgment passed upon the Devil.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">1 Tim. 3:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951605/40/1" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> 6</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p>

<strong>Must Christians Observe the Sabbath?</strong><br/><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">The Fourth Commandment, however, is not without meaning for Christians.

By exercising faith in God’s provision for salvation; by desisting from selfish works and, instead, using our lives to glorify God. “The man that has entered into God’s rest has also himself rested from his own works [works at self-justification, selfish works], just as God did from his own” works of creation.

Naturally, by human birth, their “seed” would be Israelites or Jews, Hebrews. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Gen. 22:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/39/1" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> 26:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/39/2" data-bid="40-3" class="b"> 28:14</a>) Hence according to the natural order of things it was necessary for Jesus Christ to establish “God’s truthfulness” as regards those promises made to the three Hebrew patriarchs; how? By offering first to Jews the opportunity to receive the Abrahamic blessing and become the spiritual seed of Abraham. It was absolutely obligatory upon Jesus to respect the sworn oath of Jehovah God, because God had sworn with an oath that his promises to the patriarchs were truthful, and Jesus had to “verify” those promises.</p><p id="p111" data-pid="111" class="qu">43. (a) In order to keep what thing did Jehovah bring the descendants of the forefathers out of Egypt? (b) How did He strengthen his promises to the forefathers?</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" data-rel-pid="[111]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="43"><sup>43</sup></span> To the circumcised descendants of the patriarchs, Moses said: “It was because of Jehovah’s loving you, and because of his keeping the sworn statement that he had sworn to your forefathers, that Jehovah brought you out . . . from the hand of Pharaoh the king of Egypt.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Deut. 7:8</a>) God’s swearing to the patriarchs is further mentioned in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Psalm 105:7-11</a>,<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965801/1">b</a> which says: “He is Jehovah our God. His judicial decisions are in all the earth. He has remembered his covenant even to time indefinite, the word that he commanded, to a thousand generations, which covenant he concluded with Abraham, and his sworn statement to Isaac, and which statement he kept standing as a regulation even to Jacob, as an indefinitely lasting covenant even to Israel, saying: ‘To you I shall give <span id="page656" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="656" data-before-text="656"></span>the land of Canaan as the allotment of your inheritance.’”—See also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Genesis 24:6, 7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/42/1" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 50:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/42/2" data-bid="43-3" class="b"> Exodus 6:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/42/3" data-bid="43-4" class="b"> Jeremiah 11:4, 5</a>.</p>
