<strong>Telling “the Generation to Come”</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[28]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> Happily in every generation there have been those who did appreciate this responsibility, and who have faithfully passed on to the next succeeding generation their knowledge of the majesty and praiseworthiness of the Most High God. In doing so they have ranged themselves alongside such grand examples of parenthood as Noah, Abraham, Jacob and a host of others. Noah, for his part, trained and instructed <span id="page138" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="138" data-before-text="138"></span>his boys so well that during critical times they stood courageously by him and survived as members of a godly household. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964163/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 11:7</a>) Jehovah informs us why he made himself acquainted with Abraham in these words: “I have become acquainted with him in order that he may command his sons and his household after him so that they shall keep Jehovah’s way to do righteousness and judgment.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964163/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Gen. 18:19</a>) Today each parent who claims to have friendship with Jehovah God must, like Noah and Abraham, prove true to the purpose of this valued relationship.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="qu"> 4. What erroneous reasoning have many parents followed? How do we know they are gravely mistaken?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[29]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Some parents have mistakenly concluded, however, that it would be easier to wait until the child reaches physical maturity before trying to impart to him the instructions of the Creator. Already over 130 years ago some professed Christians were advancing the idea that “children ought not to be taught religion, for fear of having their minds biased to some particular creed; but they should be left to themselves, till they are capable of making a choice,—and, choose to make one.” (Adam Clarke’s <em>Commentary,</em> on <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964163/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Deut. 6:6-9</a>) God’s Word, on the other hand, instructs parents to “train up a boy according to the way for him; even when he grows old he will not turn aside from it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964163/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Prov. 22:6</a>) The real-life examples of young Josiah and young Timothy bear out the practicability of accepting divine guidance in this as in all other matters. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964163/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Chron. 34:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964163/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 2 Tim. 3:15</a>) Most parents have chosen to follow human wisdom, and this, in turn, has produced today’s bumper crop of youthful delinquents.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="qu"> 5. (a) On this subject, where does worldly wisdom lead us? (b) What does heavenly wisdom dictate?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[30]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> The plight of those who depart from the way of heavenly wisdom is indicated by these expressions by a professor of psychology reported in <em>The Telegram,</em> Toronto, December 11, 1952: “The constant and unquestioned authority of the family head is a thing of the past. It just doesn’t fit now. In the old days a chain of command was necessary. Survival depended on working together, sowing the seed and harvesting the crop. The father, or headman, demanded authority and got it. Now when authority is exercised, even rarely, it is resented. It’s just a new pattern which has developed. We’re not sure where we are, but we’ll find a way out.” Parents, you do not need to end up in a fog like that! Failure to wield the rod of parental authority means abdication of your God-ordained position in the household and opens the door to anarchy. God’s instruction on the subject is clear: “Chastise your son while there exists hope.” “The rod and reproof are what give wisdom; but a boy let on the loose will be causing his mother shame. Chastise your son and he will bring you rest and give much pleasure to your soul.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964163/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Prov. 19:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964163/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 29:15,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964163/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 17</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 6. Why is there no time to lose, and what must be determined upon?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Do not delay telling the new generation those vital things they must know. Before he reaches adulthood your child should be so imbued with true knowledge that he will be able to stand up to crucial tests of his faith applied by a hostile world. You have no time to lose. Recent history provided the spectacle of grown men being brainwashed and transformed into putty in the hands of their captors simply because they had never been given any real foundation for faith. A few years of teaching, therefore, will not suffice. A progressive program of training is called for, one that will mold your child’s life from infancy right through to adulthood.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>PROGRESSIVELY TELLING</strong></p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 7. When should the training of children commence? Explain.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> As soon as an infant opens its eyes and <span id="page139" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="139" data-before-text="139"></span>ears on the world it begins to record impressions. What kind of things does it hear? Loud, harsh talk, quarreling, confusion? Or quiet, kind, dignified speech and action? What kind of impressions are you parents making on the sensitive record of your child’s mind? As he later learns to speak and express himself, are you availing yourselves of the wonderful opportunities to begin shaping the young intellect? At home mother could go through some helpful Bible aid with the child, such as <em>From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained,</em> explaining its many illustrations and emphasizing that whether people are good or bad is determined by their obeying and pleasing God or disobeying and displeasing him. Then when father comes home from work the child can be invited to repeat what he has learned, and father will give encouragement by showing keen interest in his progress. To engage in such beneficial training only when you feel like it will produce but mediocre results. Make it part of your family schedule and experience the joy of seeing the first roots of divine truth taking firm hold in the soil of your child’s mind.</p>

<strong>“Keep Yourselves in Expectation of Me”</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> Noteworthy is the fact that, while Zephaniah proclaimed divine judgments against the civil “princes” of Judah (nobles, or tribal chiefs) and “the sons of the king,” he never mentioned the king himself in his criticism.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1996162/0">a</a> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996162/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Zephaniah 1:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996162/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 3:3</a>) This suggests that young King Josiah had already shown a propensity for pure worship, although, in view of the situation decried by Zephaniah, obviously he had not yet started his religious reforms. All of this suggests that Zephaniah prophesied in Judah during the early years of Josiah, who <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>reigned from 659 to 629 B.C.E. The energetic prophesying of Zephaniah undoubtedly heightened young Josiah’s awareness of the idolatry, violence, and corruption that prevailed in Judah at that time and encouraged his later campaign against idolatry.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996162/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 34:1-3</a>.</p>

<strong>What Teen-Agers Need from Their Parents</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The urge to attain wider freedom is a normal part of growing to adulthood​—a fact many parents are not ready to accept. From infancy their child relied and depended on them and they enjoyed it. Now their teen-ager changes from a spirit of complete dependence to one of greater self-reliance. This change in attitude is not bad. At a relatively young age, some teenagers begin to develop a grown-up outlook. A Biblical example is King Josiah. “While he was still a boy [of about 15], he started to search for the God of David.” At the age of about 25 he took aggressive action against false worship, which his father had promoted. This teen-ager had freedom to act on his own. Were his attitude and action bad merely because he was still young? No. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979242/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Chron. 34:1-8</a>) Also, the young man David’s motives, in inquiring about fighting Goliath, were good but were misunderstood by his older brother.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979242/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Sam. 17:26-28</a>.</p>

<strong>Studying the Word of Life</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Most of the kings who ruled Jehovah’s chosen people ignored this command. They failed to study the divine Word and to follow the guidance of its wise counsel. Relying upon their own wisdom, they led the people in the very way God warned them not to go. They foolishly turned from the path of obedience to God and sank into the stinking mire of idolatry. “They kept <span id="page522" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="522" data-before-text="522"></span>walking in the statutes of the nations whom Jehovah had driven out from before the sons of Israel, and in the statutes of the kings of Israel that they had made; and the sons of Israel went searching into the things that were not right toward Jehovah their God and kept building themselves high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen clear to the fortified city; and they kept setting up for themselves sacred pillars and sacred poles upon every high hill and under every luxuriant tree; and there on all the high places they continued to make sacrificial smoke the same as the nations whom Jehovah had taken into exile because of them, and they kept doing bad things to offend Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963642/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Ki. 17:8-11</a>.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 5.

Failing to feed their minds upon the spiritually nourishing truths Jehovah provided them, they became empty-headed like the dumb idols they foolishly worshiped. They saw nothing wrong with playing a double role as priests of Jehovah and priests of the despicable idols and the abominable high places. “‘For both the prophet and the priest themselves have become polluted. Also in my own house I have found their badness,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963642/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jer. 23:11</a>) One of the few exceptions to this waywardness was in the days of Jehoshaphat.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 6. Explain what wise thing the Levites did in Jehoshaphat’s time and why it was good for the nation.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> In Jehoshaphat’s time the Levites fulfilled their obligation to study God’s Word and to instruct the people in it. King Jehoshaphat made certain that they did. At his orders they went throughout the land on regular teaching circuits. This upbuilding work strengthened the people and helped them to walk the way of obedience to God. “They began teaching in Judah, and with them there was the book of Jehovah’s law; and they kept going around through all the cities of Judah and teaching among the people.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963642/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Chron. 17:9</a>) If this constructive effort to instruct the people in God’s Word had continued during the reigns of succeeding kings, the history of that nation would be greatly different from what it proved to be. Rulers like Jehoshaphat were too few in the royal line of twenty-three Judean rulers.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>FINDING THE BOOK OF THE LAW</strong></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 7, 8. (a) What were some of the noteworthy things Josiah did during his reign? (b) Why did the temple need repairing?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> The rule of Josiah was one of the most remarkable in the history of the Judean kingdom. What largely contributed to this was the written Word of God. Like Jehoshaphat, who ruled more than 250 years before him, Josiah had deep respect for that divine guide. Desiring to walk in the way of obedience to Jehovah, he instituted an intensive campaign to stamp out the abominable practice of idolatry that had eaten into the vitals of the nation during the reigns of his father and grandfather, Amon and Manasseh. Images were pulverized, the bones of Baal priests were burned on their altars and the altars pulled down.

They failed to study the divine Word and to follow the guidance of its wise counsel. Relying upon their own wisdom, they led the people in the very way God warned them not to go. They foolishly turned from the path of obedience to God and sank into the stinking mire of idolatry. “They kept <span id="page522" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="522" data-before-text="522"></span>walking in the statutes of the nations whom Jehovah had driven out from before the sons of Israel, and in the statutes of the kings of Israel that they had made; and the sons of Israel went searching into the things that were not right toward Jehovah their God and kept building themselves high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen clear to the fortified city; and they kept setting up for themselves sacred pillars and sacred poles upon every high hill and under every luxuriant tree; and there on all the high places they continued to make sacrificial smoke the same as the nations whom Jehovah had taken into exile because of them, and they kept doing bad things to offend Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963642/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Ki. 17:8-11</a>.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 5.

Failing to feed their minds upon the spiritually nourishing truths Jehovah provided them, they became empty-headed like the dumb idols they foolishly worshiped. They saw nothing wrong with playing a double role as priests of Jehovah and priests of the despicable idols and the abominable high places. “‘For both the prophet and the priest themselves have become polluted. Also in my own house I have found their badness,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963642/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jer. 23:11</a>) One of the few exceptions to this waywardness was in the days of Jehoshaphat.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 6.

King Jehoshaphat made certain that they did. At his orders they went throughout the land on regular teaching circuits. This upbuilding work strengthened the people and helped them to walk the way of obedience to God. “They began teaching in Judah, and with them there was the book of Jehovah’s law; and they kept going around through all the cities of Judah and teaching among the people.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963642/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Chron. 17:9</a>) If this constructive effort to instruct the people in God’s Word had continued during the reigns of succeeding kings, the history of that nation would be greatly different from what it proved to be.

What largely contributed to this was the written Word of God. Like Jehoshaphat, who ruled more than 250 years before him, Josiah had deep respect for that divine guide. Desiring to walk in the way of obedience to Jehovah, he instituted an intensive campaign to stamp out the abominable practice of idolatry that had eaten into the vitals of the nation during the reigns of his father and grandfather, Amon and Manasseh. Images were pulverized, the bones of Baal priests were burned on their altars and the altars pulled down. The sacred pole was pulled out of the temple and destroyed, as well as the chariots of the sun that had been used in sun worship. No longer would he permit the horses that were dedicated to the sun to enter the temple and defile it.

<strong>Studying the Word of Life</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Since the law of God required the king to read the Word of God, you may wonder why Josiah was shocked by the reading of the warnings in this sacred book as if he were hearing them for the first time. It is very possible that he was. He may not have had a copy of God’s Word to read. In view of the great number of Judean rulers who had <span id="page524" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="524" data-before-text="524"></span>been idolatrous, some fanatically so, such as Ahaz, Athaliah and Manasseh, it may well be that kings had left off the practice of having a personal copy of the law of God for regular reading. What Josiah knew about the law of God probably came to him by oral instruction from the Levites, who undoubtedly had copies in their possession. When at the age of fifteen “he started to search for the God of David his forefather,” he must have gone to faithful Levites for instruction about the God of David. It is not likely that those who had been close to his idolatrous father, Amon, in the royal court could have taught him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963642/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Chron. 34:3</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> That several copies of God’s Word did exist among the Levites at one time is indicated by the fact that in the days of Jehoshaphat the Levites took copies of the Law with them when going about the land on their teaching circuits. It is most unlikely that the wicked kings would have succeeded in destroying all existing copies. The very fact that Hilkiah recognized the book he found as the law of God indicates that he was familiar with God’s Word, and this undoubtedly was due to the Levites of his day being possessors of a copy. What made Hilkiah’s find so noteworthy in his mind was most likely due to the manuscript’s being the original book by the hand of Moses.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Since Josiah’s knowledge of the Word of God may not have come from personal study of the law of God but from what he was taught by the Levites, it is possible that what Shaphan read to him was heard by him for the first time. The frightful curses mentioned in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963642/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">the twenty-eighth chapter of Deuteronomy</a> coupled with the fact that they were read from the original manuscript would certainly impress Josiah with their importance.

Showing his great concern, he promptly dispatched a delegation of five persons to inquire of Jehovah through the prophetess Huldah. “Go, inquire of Jehovah in my own behalf and in behalf of the people and in behalf of all Judah concerning the words of this book that has been found; for great is Jehovah’s rage that has been set afire against us over the fact that our forefathers did not listen to the words of this book by doing according to all that is written concerning us.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963642/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Ki. 22:13</a>) Through the prophetess, Jehovah confirmed everything that was written in the book. “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘Here I am bringing calamity upon this place and upon its inhabitants, even all the words of the book that the king of Judah has read.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963642/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Ki. 22:16</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">16.

It was more than twenty years after his death when they became a reality for that stiffnecked nation. Babylonian armies marched through the land of Judah pillaging and destroying. The beautiful temple Solomon had built and the city of Jerusalem were demolished, leaving them a heap of rubble. Most of the people who survived were marched away to distant Babylon as captives, just as the book of Deuteronomy foretold: “Jehovah will march you and your king whom you will set up over you to a nation whom you have not known, neither you nor your forefathers.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963642/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Deut. 28:36</a>) All this came upon them because <span id="page525" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="525" data-before-text="525"></span>they had failed to study God’s Word and follow its instructions.</p>

<strong>Jehovah Gives the Victory</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">That same Sunday the local Baptist minister and his leading deacon came to the public talk and <em>The Watchtower</em> study. During the study they would snicker and poke one another to show their amusement at points of the discussion. At times they would raise their hands as if to take part in the study but then cover their mouths if the chairman looked their way. What the clergyman and his deacon did not know was that one of their members was just a few rows behind them, observing their antics. This young man had just been to a few Bible talks at the Kingdom Hall and was still a member of the church. After the study the clergyman saw this young man and said to him: “Let us get <span id="page479" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="479" data-before-text="479"></span>out of here. They twist the Scriptures to suit their own needs.” The young man replied: <em>“No thanks!</em> I have seen enough to know that Jehovah’s witnesses have the truth.”</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">When Jehovah’s people are courageous and keep trusting in him, he will give the victory: “Any weapon whatever that will be formed against you will have no success.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962568/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 54:17</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Pay Attention to Prophecy</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Manasseh was succeeded by his son Amon, who resumed pagan idolatry. He was murdered, but the people loyally stuck to the house of David and put his eight-year-old son Josiah upon the throne. Thus David’s line retained the throne, as God had prophesied. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Chron. 33:18-25</a>) At nineteen years of age King Josiah began to cleanse the whole kingdom of false worship. He paid attention to Jehovah’s prophets. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Chron. 34:1-7</a>) Therefore the Second World Power, Assyria, was never able to take Judah and Jerusalem into captivity. Josiah saw Assyria itself fall in 633 <span id="page603" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="603" data-before-text="603"></span>B.C.E., fulfilling the prophecy of Nahum concerning Nineveh, capital of Assyria, which was destroyed by the kingdom of Media and its allies. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Nah. 1:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 3:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/15/2" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/15/3" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> 7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/15/4" data-bid="16-5" class="b"> 1:15</a>) This proves that Jehovah the God of prophecy is true and is the Universal Sovereign.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Present at Nineveh’s fall was the commander of the Chaldean army, Nebuchadnezzar, son of King Nabopolassar, who had been a general of King Assurbanipal of Assyria. Nabopolassar had taken over the kingship of Babylon at the time Assurbanipal died. He was a Chaldean by descent, a Semite (the Assyrians were also Semites). He established a dynasty of kings that ended with Belshazzar. After the fall of Nineveh, Nebuchadnezzar was associated with his father in the kingship of Babylon.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1964728/1">b</a></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Josiah took six years to complete his work of cleansing the land of Judah and the temple of Jehovah at Jerusalem of false worship, which included Babylonish astrology and professional foretellers of events. While having Jehovah’s temple repaired, High Priest Hilkiah found the “book of Jehovah’s law by the hand of Moses.” This was doubtless the original book of the law written by Moses, which would cause a sensation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Chron. 34:8-15</a>) The book climaxed with the words: “And it must occur that just as Jehovah exulted over you to do you good and to multiply you, so Jehovah will exult over you to destroy you and to annihilate you; and you will simply be torn away from off the soil to which you are going to take possession of it. And Jehovah will certainly scatter you among all the peoples from the one end of the earth to the other end of the earth . . . ” On hearing this read, conscientious King Josiah was terrified.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Deut. 28:63-65;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 34:19</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Josiah with great earnestness sent High Priest Hilkiah with a delegation to “inquire of Jehovah in my own behalf and in behalf of what is left in Israel and in Judah concerning the words of the book that has been found, for great is Jehovah’s rage that must be poured out against us . . . ” God answered them through the prophetess Huldah in Jerusalem: “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘Here I am bringing calamity upon this place and its inhabitants, all the curses that are written in the book that they read before the king of Judah, due to the fact that they have left me and gone making sacrificial smoke to other gods, in order to offend me with all the doings of their hands and that my rage may pour forth upon this place and not be extinguished.’”</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">But Jehovah showed loving-kindness and considerateness to King Josiah, saying: “Here I am gathering you to your forefathers, . . . and your eyes will not look upon all the calamity that I am bringing upon this place and its inhabitants.”</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">King Josiah then held a meeting of all the people at the temple in Jerusalem, reading to them “all the words of the book of the covenant, which had been found at the house of Jehovah.” Then he led the people in concluding a covenant of faithfulness to Jehovah. The good results of the king’s respectfulness for Jehovah’s word and prophecy were: “All his days they did not turn aside from following Jehovah the God of their forefathers.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Chron. 34:21-33</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">After reigning thirty-one years, Josiah inadvisedly took action that resulted in his death, in 628 B.C.E. It came about in this way: The one-time First World Power, Egypt, had been overthrown by Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, and, after a revolt, had been reconquered by his son <span id="page604" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="604" data-before-text="604"></span>Assurbanipal. But Nineveh was later destroyed and southern Assyria and also the title to Egypt, Palestine and Syria had fallen to Babylonia under King Nabopolassar. Now, Nechoh (Necho), Pharaoh or king of Egypt, asserted himself against domination by Babylon, Assyria’s successor as the new world power. He led his armies northward toward Carchemish on the Euphrates River about fifty miles west of Haran.</p>

During the fifty-five years that Josiah’s grandfather, Manasseh, reigned and the two years that his father, Amon, ruled, the upkeep of the temple had been neglected, although it was used in the practice of idolatry for much of that period. It appears that some of the chambers or outer buildings of the temple had been ruined by idolatrous kings and needed to be rebuilt.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963642/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Chron. 34:8-11</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 9.

This was apparently the original copy that had been kept beside the ark of the covenant in the Most Holy of the temple. It may have been hidden during the time when idolatrous Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, was desecrating the temple with idols and persecuting the servants of Jehovah. According to Josephus, Manasseh killed many righteous men, including prophets. So intense was his wicked campaign that he is said to have filled Jerusalem with innocent blood. “There was also innocent blood that Manasseh shed in very great quantity, until he had filled Jerusalem from end to end.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963642/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Ki. 21:16</a>) In view of this fanatical persecution, it seems reasonable to conclude that a faithful high priest took the law of God from its customary place beside the ark of the covenant and hid it for its own protection.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">10, 11.

What Josiah heard when Shaphan read the sacred book to him left him shocked and frightened. “It came about that as soon as the king heard the words of the book of the law, he immediately ripped his garments apart.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963642/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Ki. 22:8-11</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> The scroll probably was the book of Deuteronomy, because that book contains dire warnings of what would happen to God’s covenant people if they failed to obey the law of God.

It is very possible that he was. He may not have had a copy of God’s Word to read. In view of the great number of Judean rulers who had <span id="page524" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="524" data-before-text="524"></span>been idolatrous, some fanatically so, such as Ahaz, Athaliah and Manasseh, it may well be that kings had left off the practice of having a personal copy of the law of God for regular reading. What Josiah knew about the law of God probably came to him by oral instruction from the Levites, who undoubtedly had copies in their possession. When at the age of fifteen “he started to search for the God of David his forefather,” he must have gone to faithful Levites for instruction about the God of David. It is not likely that those who had been close to his idolatrous father, Amon, in the royal court could have taught him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963642/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Chron. 34:3</a>.</p>

Give a possible explanation why Josiah acted as if what he heard was read to him for the first time, although the king was supposed to keep a copy of God’s Word and read it.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Since the law of God required the king to read the Word of God, you may wonder why Josiah was shocked by the reading of the warnings in this sacred book as if he were hearing them for the first time. It is very possible that he was. He may not have had a copy of God’s Word to read. In view of the great number of Judean rulers who had <span id="page524" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="524" data-before-text="524"></span>been idolatrous, some fanatically so, such as Ahaz, Athaliah and Manasseh, it may well be that kings had left off the practice of having a personal copy of the law of God for regular reading. What Josiah knew about the law of God probably came to him by oral instruction from the Levites, who undoubtedly had copies in their possession. When at the age of fifteen “he started to search for the God of David his forefather,” he must have gone to faithful Levites for instruction about the God of David. It is not likely that those who had been close to his idolatrous father, Amon, in the royal court could have taught him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963642/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Chron. 34:3</a>.</p>

<strong>Public Reading</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">After Israel entered the Promised Land, Joshua read aloud to the people “all the words of the law, the blessing and the malediction.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003576/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jos 8:33-35</a>) King Jehoshaphat dispatched princes, Levites, and priests to teach in the cities of Judah (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003576/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2Ch 17:7-9</a>), which teaching no doubt included public reading. Centuries later Josiah read in the hearing of all the people “the book of Jehovah’s law by the hand of Moses” that Hilkiah the priest found during temple repair work, doubtless the original book of the Law written by Moses.

<strong>Pay Attention to Prophecy</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Manasseh was succeeded by his son Amon, who resumed pagan idolatry. He was murdered, but the people loyally stuck to the house of David and put his eight-year-old son Josiah upon the throne. Thus David’s line retained the throne, as God had prophesied. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Chron. 33:18-25</a>) At nineteen years of age King Josiah began to cleanse the whole kingdom of false worship. He paid attention to Jehovah’s prophets. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Chron. 34:1-7</a>) Therefore the Second World Power, Assyria, was never able to take Judah and Jerusalem into captivity. Josiah saw Assyria itself fall in 633 <span id="page603" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="603" data-before-text="603"></span>B.C.E., fulfilling the prophecy of Nahum concerning Nineveh, capital of Assyria, which was destroyed by the kingdom of Media and its allies. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Nah. 1:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 3:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/15/2" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/15/3" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> 7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/15/4" data-bid="16-5" class="b"> 1:15</a>) This proves that Jehovah the God of prophecy is true and is the Universal Sovereign.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Present at Nineveh’s fall was the commander of the Chaldean army, Nebuchadnezzar, son of King Nabopolassar, who had been a general of King Assurbanipal of Assyria. Nabopolassar had taken over the kingship of Babylon at the time Assurbanipal died. He was a Chaldean by descent, a Semite (the Assyrians were also Semites). He established a dynasty of kings that ended with Belshazzar. After the fall of Nineveh, Nebuchadnezzar was associated with his father in the kingship of Babylon.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1964728/1">b</a></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Josiah took six years to complete his work of cleansing the land of Judah and the temple of Jehovah at Jerusalem of false worship, which included Babylonish astrology and professional foretellers of events. While having Jehovah’s temple repaired, High Priest Hilkiah found the “book of Jehovah’s law by the hand of Moses.” This was doubtless the original book of the law written by Moses, which would cause a sensation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Chron. 34:8-15</a>) The book climaxed with the words: “And it must occur that just as Jehovah exulted over you to do you good and to multiply you, so Jehovah will exult over you to destroy you and to annihilate you; and you will simply be torn away from off the soil to which you are going to take possession of it. And Jehovah will certainly scatter you among all the peoples from the one end of the earth to the other end of the earth . . . ” On hearing this read, conscientious King Josiah was terrified.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Deut. 28:63-65;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 34:19</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Josiah with great earnestness sent High Priest Hilkiah with a delegation to “inquire of Jehovah in my own behalf and in behalf of what is left in Israel and in Judah concerning the words of the book that has been found, for great is Jehovah’s rage that must be poured out against us . . . ” God answered them through the prophetess Huldah in Jerusalem: “This is what Jehovah has said, ‘Here I am bringing calamity upon this place and its inhabitants, all the curses that are written in the book that they read before the king of Judah, due to the fact that they have left me and gone making sacrificial smoke to other gods, in order to offend me with all the doings of their hands and that my rage may pour forth upon this place and not be extinguished.’”</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">But Jehovah showed loving-kindness and considerateness to King Josiah, saying: “Here I am gathering you to your forefathers, . . . and your eyes will not look upon all the calamity that I am bringing upon this place and its inhabitants.”</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">King Josiah then held a meeting of all the people at the temple in Jerusalem, reading to them “all the words of the book of the covenant, which had been found at the house of Jehovah.” Then he led the people in concluding a covenant of faithfulness to Jehovah. The good results of the king’s respectfulness for Jehovah’s word and prophecy were: “All his days they did not turn aside from following Jehovah the God of their forefathers.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Chron. 34:21-33</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">After reigning thirty-one years, Josiah inadvisedly took action that resulted in his death, in 628 B.C.E. It came about in this way: The one-time First World Power, Egypt, had been overthrown by Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, and, after a revolt, had been reconquered by his son <span id="page604" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="604" data-before-text="604"></span>Assurbanipal. But Nineveh was later destroyed and southern Assyria and also the title to Egypt, Palestine and Syria had fallen to Babylonia under King Nabopolassar. Now, Nechoh (Necho), Pharaoh or king of Egypt, asserted himself against domination by Babylon, Assyria’s successor as the new world power. He led his armies northward toward Carchemish on the Euphrates River about fifty miles west of Haran.</p>

Indeed a sign of humility! The king immediately commissioned a five-man delegation to inquire of Jehovah through the prophetess Huldah. The delegation brought back a report to this effect: ‘Calamity will come as a consequence of disobedience to Jehovah’s Law.

<strong>Achaia</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In 27 B.C.E., when Caesar Augustus reorganized the two provinces of Greece, Macedonia and Achaia, the name “Achaia” then applied to all the Peloponnesus and to part of continental Greece. The province of Achaia was under the administration of the Senate of Rome and was ruled through a proconsul from its capital Corinth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010073/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Cor. 1:1</a>) Other cities of the province of Achaia were Athens and Cenchreae. Achaia and its neighboring province to the N, Macedonia, <span id="page30" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="30" data-before-text="30"></span>were often linked together in common usage.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010073/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 19:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010073/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Rom. 15:26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010073/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 1 Thess. 1:7, 8</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In the year 15 C.E., in response to complaints over the severity of taxation, Tiberius placed Achaia and Macedonia under imperial control, to be governed from the province of Moesia. This continued until 44 C.E. when Emperor Claudius restored these provinces to senatorial control, thereby causing a proconsul again to take up governing powers in Corinth. Due to ignorance of these facts, in the past some critics objected to the Bible’s reference to Gallio as the “proconsul of Achaia,” before whom Paul was brought.

<strong>Gate, Gateway</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><strong>Gates of Jerusalem.</strong> In dealing with the gates of Jerusalem, it is well to remember that, from the time of its capture by David, the city developed and expanded, so that several walls or added portions of walls were built. We shall concern ourselves here mainly with the gates mentioned in the book of Nehemiah, which gives us the most complete description or listing. The gates named in Nehemiah’s record are gates that had been in the wall that was built prior to the eighth century B.C.E. and in the wall surrounding “the second quarter.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">2Ki 22:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/42/1" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 2Ch 34:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/42/2" data-bid="43-3" class="b"> Zep 1:10</a>) “The second quarter” was a northern part of the city bounded on the W and part of the N by Hezekiah’s wall (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">2Ch 32:5</a>) and joined by Manasseh’s wall, which continued on the NE and E.

<strong>Huldah</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When Josiah heard the reading of “the very book of the law” found by Hilkiah the high priest during the temple repair work, he sent a delegation to inquire of Jehovah. They went to Huldah, who, in turn, relayed the word of Jehovah, indicating that all the calamities for disobedience recorded in the “book” would befall the apostate nation. Huldah added that Josiah, because of having humbled himself before Jehovah, would not have to look upon the calamity but would be gathered to his forefathers and be taken to his graveyard in peace.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002101/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2Ki 22:8-20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002101/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 2Ch 34:14-28</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Some consider Huldah’s prophecy to be in error in view of Josiah’s death in an unnecessary battle. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002101/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2Ki 23:28-30</a>) However, the “peace” in which Josiah would be gathered to his graveyard is obviously in contrast with “the calamity” due to come upon Judah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002101/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2Ki 22:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002101/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 2Ch 34:28</a>) Josiah died prior to the coming of that calamity in 609-607 B.C.E., when the Babylonians besieged and destroyed Jerusalem. Additionally, that the expression ‘to be gathered to one’s forefathers’ does not necessarily exclude dying a violent death in warfare is indicated by the use of the comparable expression ‘to lie down with one’s forefathers’ with reference to a death in battle as well as a nonviolent death.​—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002101/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">De 31:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002101/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1Ki 2:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002101/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 22:34,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002101/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 40</a>.</p>

Pointing forward to this was the angelic announcement made to shepherds at Jesus’ birth: “Upon earth peace among men of good will.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013331/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Luke 2:14</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The peaceful message proclaimed by Jesus and his followers appealed to ‘friends of peace,’ that is, to persons desiring to be reconciled to God.

(Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013331/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Luke 1:79;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013331/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 3:3-6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013331/30/2" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> John 1:29-34</a>.) Their failure resulted in the destruction of Jerusalem by the Roman armies in 70 C.E.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013331/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Luke 19:42-44</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">However, even the Jews who did accept the “good news of peace” were sinners and needed to have their transgressions atoned for so as to enjoy peace with Jehovah God. Jesus’ death as a ransom sacrifice cared for this need. As had been foretold: “The chastisement meant for our peace was upon him, and because of his wounds there has been a healing for us.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013331/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Isa. 53:5</a>) Jesus’ sacrificial death on the torture stake also provided the basis for canceling the Mosaic law, which divided the Jews from the non-Jews. Therefore, upon becoming Christians, both peoples could be at peace with God and with one another. The apostle Paul wrote: “[Jesus] is our peace, he who made the two parties one and destroyed the wall in between that fenced them off. By means of his flesh he abolished the hatred, the Law of commandments consisting in decrees, that he might create the two peoples in union with himself into one new man and make peace; and that he might fully reconcile both peoples in one body to God through the torture stake, because he had killed off the hatred by means of himself. And he came and declared the good news of peace to you, the ones far off, and peace to those near, because through him we, both peoples, have the approach to the Father by one spirit.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013331/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Eph. 2:14-18</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013331/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Romans 2:10, 11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013331/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> Colossians 1:20-23</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The “peace of God,” that is, the calmness and tranquillity resulting from a Christian’s precious relationship to Jehovah God guards his heart and mental powers from becoming anxious about his needs. He has the assurance that Jehovah God provides for his servants and answers their prayers. This puts his heart and mind at rest. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013331/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Phil. 4:6, 7</a>) Similarly, the peace that Jesus Christ gave to his disciples, based on their faith in him as God’s Son, served to calm their hearts and minds. Although Jesus told them that the time was coming when he would no longer be with them personally, they had no reason to be concerned or to give way to fear. He was not leaving them without help, but promised to send them the holy spirit.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013331/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">John 14:26, 27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013331/36/1" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 16:33</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013331/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Colossians 3:15</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The peace that Christians enjoyed was not to be taken for granted.

Therefore, “shod with the equipment of the good news of peace,” they carried on their spiritual warfare. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013331/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Eph. 6:15</a>) Even within the congregation they waged warfare in overturning reasonings that were out of harmony with the knowledge of God, so that these reasonings did not damage their relationship with God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013331/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">2 Cor. 10:4, 5</a>) It was not a verbal fight or quarrel, not even when correcting those who had deviated from the truth. With reference to handling cases of those who had departed from a right course, the apostle Paul counseled Timothy: “A slave of the Lord does not need to fight, but needs to be gentle toward all, qualified to teach, keeping himself restrained under evil, instructing with mildness those not favorably disposed; as perhaps God may give them repentance leading to an accurate knowledge of truth, and they may come back to their proper senses out from the snare of the Devil, seeing that they have been caught alive by him for the will of that one.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013331/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">2 Tim. 2:24-26</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>PEACEFUL RULE</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The Son of God, as the one to have ‘the princely rule upon his shoulder,’ is called the “Prince of Peace.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013331/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Isa. 9:6, 7</a>) It is, therefore, noteworthy that Christ Jesus, while on earth, showed that his servants should not arm themselves for physical warfare, when saying to Peter: “Return your sword to its place, for all those who take the sword will perish by the sword.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013331/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Matt. 26:52</a>) Figuratively speaking, those who became Christians “beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears.” They learned war no more.

Regarding Solomon’s reign, the Bible reports: “Peace itself became his in every region of his, all around. And Judah and Israel continued to dwell in security, everyone under his own vine and under his own fig tree, from Dan to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013331/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">1 Ki. 4:24, 25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013331/48/1" data-bid="49-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 22:9</a>) As evident from other scriptures (compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013331/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Psalm 72:7, 8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013331/49/1" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> Micah 4:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013331/49/2" data-bid="50-3" class="b"> Zechariah 9:9, 10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013331/49/3" data-bid="50-4" class="b"> Matthew 21:4, 5</a>), this served as a pattern of what would take place under the administration of Christ Jesus, the One greater than <span id="page1281" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1281" data-before-text="1281"></span>Solomon (whose name means “peaceable”).—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013331/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Matt. 12:42</a>.</p>

Does not reflecting on the account of the kings in the Davidic line encourage us to imitate the examples of those who made Jehovah their confidence and avoid the conduct of those who did not? Second Chronicles stimulates us to give our exclusive devotion to the true God and remain faithful to him. Its message certainly is alive and exerts power.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005884/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:12</a>.</p>

If the forty-year period had begun during the reign of his grandfather, King Manasseh, especially from the time that King Manasseh was taken captive to Babylon by the king of Assyria, then the forty years might have ended during the reign of King Josiah. How so? Because the reign of King Manasseh lasted for fifty-five years, and his son Amon’s reign lasted for two years, and that of King Josiah for thirty-one years. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971006/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 33:10 to 34:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971006/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 19-28</a>) Josiah’s reign was good all the way through, and so the calamity due at the end of forty years was not allowed to come in his day.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971006/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Kings 22:11-20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971006/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 2 Chronicles 34:14-33</a>.</p><p id="p86" data-pid="86" class="qu">28.

No less so than in the ancient type, Christendom is filled with idolized things, with religious images and with nationalistic statues and emblems to which idolatrous devotions are paid. No less so than in the case of Jerusalem, Christendom has been filled with “innocent blood” in great quantity “from end to end.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971006/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Kings 21:16</a>) From its very beginning Christendom has been befouled with bloodshed. After the Roman emperor, Constantine the Great, had accepted the Christianity of his day, making it the religion of the State, yes, after he had presided over the religious Council of Nicaea, he had his oldest son put to death and thereafter his own wife, Fausta. In this way the very foundations of Christendom were befouled with blood.—<em>The Encyclopædia Britannica,</em> 11th Edition, Volume 6, page 989, paragraph 4.</p>

Also, Necho was heading to Carchemish to war “against another house,” not to war against Jerusalem. Moreover, God’s name was not involved, for Necho was taunting neither Jehovah nor his people. So it was bad judgment on Josiah’s part to battle against Necho. Can we see in this a lesson that we can apply? When faced with a problem, we do well to consider what Jehovah’s will may be in the matter.</p>

The Bible says that Necho’s words were “from the mouth of God.” Why, then, did Josiah go out to fight? The Bible does not say.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><strong><sup>16</sup></strong></span> How, though, would Josiah know that Necho’s words were from Jehovah? Well, he could have asked Jeremiah, one of the faithful prophets. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017326/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Chron. 35:23,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2017326/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 25</a>) But there is no record of his doing so. Also, Necho was heading to Carchemish to war “against another house,” not to war against Jerusalem. Moreover, God’s name was not involved, for Necho was taunting neither Jehovah nor his people. So it was bad judgment on Josiah’s part to battle against Necho. Can we see in this a lesson that we can apply? When faced with a problem, we do well to consider what Jehovah’s will may be in the matter.</p>

By turning back his people to the law of Jehovah God, Josiah tried to do what he could to prevent national calamity from coming upon them. When he inquired through the prophetess Huldah what the future held for his nation, Josiah was given this promise from God: “Here I am gathering you to your forefathers, and you will certainly be gathered to your own graveyard in peace, and your eyes will not look upon all the calamity that I am bringing upon this place.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">2 Ki. 22:20</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"><sup>30</sup></span> Josiah died from a wound received in battle at Megiddo. So it was not during the terrible calamity that was to come upon Jerusalem. After Josiah was fatally wounded, “his servants took him down from the chariot and had him ride in the second war chariot that was his and brought him to Jerusalem. Thus he died and was buried in the graveyard of his forefathers; and all Judah and Jerusalem were mourning over Josiah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">2 Chron. 35:22-24</a>) Not all the kings of Jerusalem who preceded Josiah were buried in the same place at Jerusalem, in the “burial places of the kings of Israel.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">2 Chron. 28:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/41/1" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> 21:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/41/2" data-bid="42-3" class="b"> 24:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/41/3" data-bid="42-4" class="b"> 32:33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965082/41/4" data-bid="42-5" class="b"> 16:14</a>.</p><p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">31, 32.

<strong>Burial, Burial Places</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Archaeological investigations give an idea of the type of burial places used in ancient times. Aside from simple earthen graves, in Palestine these were often vaults or chambers cut in the rock, often on hillsides. Elevated places seem to have been preferred. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Josh. 24:33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/33/1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 23:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/33/2" data-bid="34-3" class="b"> 2 Chron. 32:33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/33/3" data-bid="34-4" class="b"> Isa. 22:16</a>) The chamber might be for a single burial, the body being laid in an excavated place in the floor. Or it might be arranged for multiple burials, with long slots, large enough to accommodate one body each, cut into the sides of the chamber at right angles to the walls. The narrow opening through which the body was inserted was then covered with a stone cut to fit. In other cases a benchlike niche or shelf was cut into the rear and side walls (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Mark 16:5</a>) or there might be a double row of such shelves, thus increasing the capacity of the burial place. The tomb might even consist of more than one chamber, although the single chamber seems to have been the common type among the Jews. Where the body lay exposed on a shelf, it was, of course, necessary to seal off the entrance against the depredations of wild animals. Thus, the main entrance to the chamber was closed off with a large stone, at times hinged as a door, and occasionally with a circular one set in a track and rolled in front of the <span id="page269" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="269" data-before-text="269"></span>entrance. Such circular stones, not frequently found, might weigh as much as a ton or more.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Matt. 27:60;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/35/1" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> Mark 16:3, 4</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Simplicity marks the earlier Jewish burial places. They thus contrasted greatly with the pagan tombs, which often had paintings on the walls and other ornamentation. <em>The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge</em> (Vol. II, p. 308) comments: “Wherever in Jewish tombs rich ornamentation is found, foreign influence (generally Greek) is recognized . . . the stern opposition . . . to ancestor-worship discouraged adornment of burial-places, which thus differed widely from Egyptian and Phenician tombs. This and the lack of inscriptions make it difficult to determine the date of Jewish graves.” Although Jacob erected a pillar over Rachel’s grave, perhaps a single stone (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Gen. 35:20</a>), this seems to have simply been a marker, not a monument. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">1 Sam. 10:2</a>) A “gravestone” is also mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">2 Kings 23:17</a> as marking a burial spot. Jesus referred to tombs “not in evidence, so that men walk upon them and do not know it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Luke 11:44</a>) Due to the ceremonial defilement associated with the dead, burial places of the Jewish people were frequently whitewashed, thereby advising the passersby of their presence. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Matt. 23:27</a>) This whitewashing is said to have been done annually following the latter rains, prior to the Passover.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Following the death of an individual, the body was generally washed (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Acts 9:37</a>) and anointed with aromatic oils and ointments, which, if considered a type of embalming, was not the kind done by the ancient Egyptians.

J. G. Duncan in the book <em>Digging Up Biblical History</em> (1931, Vol. II, p. 186) writes: “As a rule the Hebrews, though they sometimes buried within the city walls, excavated their rock-tombs on a hill-slope near to their city. The presence of rock-tombs on one hill-slope is often a sure indication that the hill opposite or near had had a settlement on it, and, on the other hand, the absence of any indication of burials near a site is a sure proof that the site had not been occupied.” The cliffs surrounding Jerusalem abound with burial places. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Isaiah 22:16</a>.) The reference to the ”graveyard of the sons of the people” (“burial place of the common people,” <em>RS</em>) in the valley of Kidron is believed to refer to a graveyard for the poorer class.

The corpses of Saul and his sons were burned, the bones, however, remaining.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">1 Sam. 31:8-13</a>; note also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010830/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Amos 6:9, 10</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The ancient pyramids of Egypt were huge burial places for royal personages. The Great Pyramid covers an area of some thirteen acres (5.3 hectares) and is composed of 2,300,000 blocks of stone, each block weighing about two and a half tons (2.3 metric tons) on the average. The Egyptian belief in immortality of the soul was the prime reason for mummification, and they also made elaborate provisions of food, furniture and equipment for use by the deceased royalty in the “afterlife.”</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Also notable as burial places were the catacombs of Rome, used for both Jewish and Christian burials. The catacombs consisted of a network of subterranean passages with burial niches excavated in the walls of the passages. While the greater part of Rome remains unexcavated, it is believed that there are over five hundred miles (805 kilometers) of such passages or galleries, containing as many as two million graves. During times of intense persecution these Roman catacombs served as meeting places for the Christians.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">In the Hebrew Scriptures the words <em>qeʹver</em> and <em>q<sup>e</sup>vu·rah</em>ʹ are used to refer to burial places and are distinct in meaning from the Hebrew <em>sh<sup>e</sup>ʼohl</em>ʹ<em>,</em> which refers, not to an individual grave or graves but to the common grave of all mankind, gravedom. Likewise, in the Christian Greek Scriptures the Greek word <em>taʹphos,</em> the common word for burial place or grave, and the words <em>mneʹma</em> and <em>mne·meiʹon,</em> meaning “tomb” and “memorial tomb,” are distinct from the word <em>haiʹdes,</em> the Greek equivalent of <em>sh<sup>e</sup>ʼohl</em>ʹ.—See HADES; MEMORIAL TOMB; SHEOL.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Music</strong><br/><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Chanting might be said to be halfway between singing and speaking. In pitch it is rather monotonous and repetitious, with the emphasis being on rhythm. While chanting continues to be quite popular in some of the world’s leading religions, its use in the Bible appears to be limited to dirges, as in the case of David chanting a dirge over the deaths of his friend Jonathan and of King Saul.

<strong>Pay Attention to Prophecy</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">After reigning thirty-one years, Josiah inadvisedly took action that resulted in his death, in 628 B.C.E. It came about in this way: The one-time First World Power, Egypt, had been overthrown by Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, and, after a revolt, had been reconquered by his son <span id="page604" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="604" data-before-text="604"></span>Assurbanipal. But Nineveh was later destroyed and southern Assyria and also the title to Egypt, Palestine and Syria had fallen to Babylonia under King Nabopolassar. Now, Nechoh (Necho), Pharaoh or king of Egypt, asserted himself against domination by Babylon, Assyria’s successor as the new world power. He led his armies northward toward Carchemish on the Euphrates River about fifty miles west of Haran.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">King Josiah led his armies out, evidently to block the passage of the armies of Nechoh. Pharaoh Nechoh tried to dissuade Josiah, saying: “Refrain for your own sake because of God, who is with me, and do not let him bring you to ruin.” However, “Josiah did not turn his face away from him, but to fight against him he disguised himself and did not listen to the words of Necho from the mouth of God. So he came to fight in the valley plain of Megiddo.” Besides ignoring God’s warning, Josiah’s move was bad in that it favored Babylon, ever the enemy of Jerusalem. Josiah’s disguise did not shield him, for an Egyptian arrow found him and he died.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Chron. 35:20-25</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Josiah’s younger son Jehoahaz then ruled badly for three months and was captured by Pharaoh Nechoh, who made Jehoahaz’ older brother Eliakim king of Judah, changing his name to Jehoiakim. Jehoiakim’s unrighteous reign lasted eleven years.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Chron. 36:1-5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 23:30-37</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>JERUSALEM SUFFERS FOR IGNORING PROPHECY</strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">At the beginning of King Jehoiakim’s rule God sent word to His prophet Jeremiah that He would make His temple like the tabernacle set up in the city of Shiloh, forever bereft of the sacred ark of God’s covenant. So far had Judah drifted from the worship of Jehovah that the priests, prophets and people considered this true prophet treasonous and laid hold of Jeremiah, saying: “You will positively die.” But when Jeremiah made his defense before the princes of Judah, they found no basis for putting him to death and set him free for the time being.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Jer. 26:1-24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 7:1-34</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">In 625 B.C.E. Nebuchadnezzar became king of Babylon, the Third World Power. In that year he defeated Pharaoh Nechoh the king of Egypt in battle at Carchemish by the Euphrates River. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Jer. 46:1, 2</a>) In that year Jeremiah, by inspiration, foretold a seventy-year-long desolation of Jerusalem and the land of Judah for despising the word of Jehovah and his prophets. Jeremiah warned: “Therefore this is what Jehovah of armies has said, ‘For the reason that you did not obey my words, here I am sending and I will take all the families of the north, . . . even sending to Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will bring them against this land and against its inhabitants and against all these nations round about . . . And all this land must become a devastated place, an object of astonishment, and these nations will have to serve the king of Babylon seventy years.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Jer. 25:1-11</a>) The age-old enmity between these two cities was approaching unavoidable military clash, which will be discussed in the next article of this series.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">In the prophecy King Nebuchadnezzar was likened to a drinking cup of Jehovah’s rage. Jeremiah said: “This is what Jehovah the God of Israel said to me: ‘Take this cup of the wine of rage out of my hand, and you must make all the nations to whom I am sending you drink it. And they must drink and shake back and forth and act like crazed men because of the sword [of Nebuchadnezzar] that I am sending among them.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964728/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Jer. 25:15, 16</a>.</p>

<strong>Jehoiakim</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Daniel’s account (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002377/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1:1, 2</a>) states that Nebuchadnezzar came against Jerusalem and laid siege to it and that Jehoiakim, along with some of the temple utensils, was given into the Babylonian king’s hand. However, the account at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002377/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Kings 24:10-15</a> describes the siege of Jerusalem by the Babylonians and shows that Jehoiakim’s son Jehoiachin, whose reign lasted only three months and ten days, was the one who finally capitulated and went out to the Babylonians. It therefore appears that Jehoiakim died during the siege of the city, perhaps in the early part thereof. Jehovah’s prophecy through <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002377/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Jeremiah (22:18, 19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002377/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 36:30</a>) indicated that Jehoiakim was not to receive a decent burial; his corpse was to lie unattended outside the gates of Jerusalem, exposed to the sun’s heat by day and the frost by night. Just in what way Jehoiakim was ‘given into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002377/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Da 1:2</a>) is not revealed. It may have been in the sense of his dying under siege and of his son’s thereafter having to go out into captivity, so that Jehoiakim’s line suffered the loss of the kingship at Nebuchadnezzar’s hands. There is no way to confirm the Jewish tradition (recorded by Josephus) that Nebuchadnezzar killed Jehoiakim and commanded that his dead body be thrown outside Jerusalem’s walls. (<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> X, 97 [vi, 3]) By whatever means Jehoiakim’s death came, it appears that the copper fetters Nebuchadnezzar had brought along to bind Jehoiakim were not used as planned.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002377/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2Ch 36:6</a>.</p>

<strong>A Haughty Spirit Is Before Stumbling</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Here a lesson was given that should show the nations who try to destroy God’s Word by burning it or by grinding it up or by banning it from their realm that their efforts are futile and completely ineffective; that Jehovah’s Word stands forever and cannot be destroyed by wicked men. Jehovah said to Jeremiah: “Take again for yourself a roll, another one, and write on it all the first words that proved to be on the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah burned up. And against Jehoiakim the king of Judah you should say, ‘This is what Jehovah has said: “You yourself have burned up this roll, saying, ‘Why is it that you have written on it, saying: “The king of Babylon will come without fail and will certainly bring this land to ruin and cause man and beast to cease from it”?’ Therefore this is what Jehovah has said against Jehoiakim the king of Judah, ‘He will come to have no one sitting upon the throne of David, and his own dead body will become something thrown out to the <span id="page636" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="636" data-before-text="636"></span>heat by day and to the frost by night.

He dictated to his secretary “all the words of the book that Jehoiakim the king of Judah had burned in the fire; and there were added to them many more words like those.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964766/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jer. 36:27-32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964766/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 5:1-5</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>JUDAH BECOMES TRIBUTARY TO BABYLON</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">This was toward the end of the fifth year of King Jehoiakim’s rule and in the second year of Nebuchadnezzar, or in 624 B.C.E.

In the third year of this vassalage (not the third year of his reign, but the eleventh year), Jehoiakim rebelled and stopped paying tribute to Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar then came up a second time to punish Jehoiakim. That was in 618 B.C.E.—See <em>Harper’s Bible Dictionary,</em> by M. S. and J. L.

How, the Bible does not disclose. Because of his “detestable” acts his body was thrown outside Jerusalem’s walls.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964766/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Chron. 36:8</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>CAPTIVITY OF PRINCIPAL PEOPLE OF JUDAH</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Jehoiachin his son reigned only three months and ten days, a period of time so short as hardly to be taken into account in Jehovah’s words at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964766/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jeremiah 36:30</a>.

<strong>Jehoiakim</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Daniel’s account (1:1, 2) states that Nebuchadnezzar came against Jerusalem, laid siege to it, and that Jehoiakim, along with some of the temple utensils, was given into the Babylonian king’s hand. However, the account at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012327/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Kings 24:10-15</a> describes the siege of Jerusalem by the Babylonians and shows that Jehoiakim’s son Jehoiachin, whose reign lasted only three months and ten days, was the one who finally capitulated and went out to the Babylonians. It therefore appears that Jehoiakim died during the siege of the city, perhaps in the early part thereof. Jehovah’s prophecy through <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012327/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Jeremiah (22:18, 19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012327/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 36:30</a>) indicated that Jehoiakim was not to receive a decent burial; his corpse was to lie unattended outside the <span id="page880" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="880" data-before-text="880"></span>gates of Jerusalem, exposed to the sun’s heat by day and the frost by night. Just in what way Jehoiakim was ‘given into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012327/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Dan. 1:2</a>) is not revealed. It may have been in the sense of his dying under siege and of his son’s thereafter having to go out into captivity, so that Jehoiakim’s line suffered the loss of the kingship at Nebuchadnezzar’s hands. There is no way to confirm the Jewish tradition (recorded by Josephus) that Nebuchadnezzar killed Jehoiakim and commanded that his dead body be thrown outside Jerusalem’s walls. (<em>Antiquities of the Jews,</em> Book X, chap. VI, par. 3) By whatever means Jehoiakim’s death came, it appears that the copper fetters Nebuchadnezzar had brought along to bind Jehoiakim were not used as planned.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012327/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Chron. 36:6</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Following the siege of Jerusalem during Jehoiakim’s “third year” (as vassal king), Daniel and other Judeans, including nobles and members of the royal family, were taken as exiles to Babylon. There being no record of an earlier Babylonian exile, this appears to place the event in the short reign of Jehoiachin, Jehoiakim’s successor.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012327/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Ki. 24:12-16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012327/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Jer. 52:28</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">After Jehoiakim’s son Jehoiachin surrendered, Nebuchadnezzar elevated Jehoiachin’s uncle Zedekiah to the throne of Judah.

<strong>Jehovah, Enforcer of Prophecy</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">By this move of the people in the middle of the seventh month, Tishri or Ethanim, which would be near the Gregorian calendar date of October 1, 607 B.C.E., the land of Judah was left completely desolate, without human inhabitant or domestic animal. The timing of the enforcement of Jehovah’s prophecy here is remarkable. For it was in this seventh month Ethanim, on the tenth day, the day of atonement, that the trumpet was blown in a Jubilee year to “proclaim liberty in the land to all its inhabitants.” It began a sabbath year for the God-given land. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964886/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Lev. 25:8-22</a>) So exactly at the appropriate time of the year <span id="page734" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="734" data-before-text="734"></span>an uninterrupted run of sabbath years began, in compensation for all the sabbath years that the disobedient Israelites had failed to keep. The land was to enjoy, figuratively, a perfect number of sabbath years—seventy, during which time it was to be utterly desolate, without human inhabitant, a place to be shunned like a haunted place by passers-by. The record written later on, a testimony to Jehovah’s ability to enforce his word, reads:</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="si">“So he brought up against them the king of the Chaldeans, . . . And he proceeded to burn the house of the true God and pull down the wall of Jerusalem; . . . Furthermore, he carried off those remaining from the sword captive to Babylon, and they came to be servants to him and his sons until the royalty of Persia began to reign; to fulfill Jehovah’s word by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had paid off its sabbaths. All the days of lying desolated it kept sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964886/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Chron. 36:17-23</a>; compare also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964886/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Daniel 9:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The Jewish secular historian, Flavius Josephus, of the first century of our Common Era, corroborates the Bible account, writing about Jerusalem’s desolation:</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="si">He [the Chaldean historian Berosus in the third century B.C.E.] gives us a catalogue of the posterity of Noah, who adds the years of their chronology, from Noah himself to Nabulassar king of the Babylonians and Chaldeans, with an account of this king’s exploits. He tells us that he sent his son Nabuchodonosor with a mighty army into Egypt and Judea where, upon his being informed of a revolt, he reduced the people to subjection, set fire to our temple at Jerusalem, and carried off our whole nation in captivity to Babylon. After this our city lay desolate during an interval of seventy years, till the days of Cyrus, King of Persia.—Book 1, section 36, of <em>To Epaphroditus on the Antiquities of the Jews in Answer to Apion.</em></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="si">And such was the end of the nation of the Hebrews; it having twice gone beyond Euphrates. For the people of the ten tribes were carried out of Samaria by the Assyrians, in the days of King Hoshea. After which the people of the two tribes, that remained after Jerusalem was taken, were carried away by Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon and Chaldea. Now as to Shalmaneser, he removed the Israelites out of their country, and placed therein the nation of Cutheans who had formerly belonged to the interior of Persia and Media; but were then called Samaritans; by taking the name of the country to which they were removed. But the King of Babylon, who brought out the two tribes, placed no other nation in their country. By which means all Judea, and Jerusalem, and the temple, continued to be a desert for seventy years.—Book 10, chapter 9, last paragraph, of <em>Antiquities of the Jews,</em> edition by Whiston.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">So just when did the foretold seventy years of the desolation of Jerusalem and Judah begin to count? Not in 626 B.C.E., the third year of the reign of King Jehoiakim, for there was no captivity of Jews in Babylon then. Even in his ninth year, 620 B.C.E., Jehoiakim merely became tributary to the king of Babylon. In the eleventh year of his reign, in 618 B.C.E., he rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar, who came up against him.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1964886/0">a</a> Shortly before the end of Jehoiakim’s eleventh year his son and successor, Jehoiachin, who reigned only three months and ten days, went out in self-surrender to Nebuchadnezzar, who was besieging the city. It was on Nisan 1, 617 B.C.E., (in the spring) that the first regnal year began for Zedekiah, Jehoiachin’s uncle, whom Nebuchadnezzar made king of Jerusalem in place of Jehoiachin.

Thus the seventy years of unbroken captivity to Babylon did not begin until 607 B.C.E., in the month Ethanim, when the land was left completely desolate when its remaining inhabitants went down to Egypt. Then the Jews as a nation went into exile at Babylon, without a king at Jerusalem. This exile was for an <em>uninterrupted</em> period of seventy years.

<strong>Beware of Complacency!</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">This illustration was given to the prophet Ezekiel only about five years before the destruction of Jerusalem. Ezekiel, in vision, saw twenty-five complacent men. They were princes of Jerusalem. As prominent men of the city, counselors of the king, they were giving bad counsel to Jerusalem. Not only were they going contrary to the warnings given by the prophets Ezekiel and Jeremiah, but they were very likely encouraging King Zedekiah to rebel against Babylon and break the covenant that he had made under oath before God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972840/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Chron. 36:11-13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972840/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 24:18 to 25:1</a>) They were relying on the military power of Egypt, the ‘arm of flesh,’ to save them. For it was within the three years after Ezekiel’s vision (612 B.C.E.) that King Zedekiah did rebel, with their approval.</p>

<strong>A Haughty Spirit Is Before Stumbling</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">It is because of making the mistake of dating the beginning of the seventy-year period for the desolation of Jerusalem and the land of Judah after King Jehoiakim reigned at Jerusalem but three years that the chronologers in Christendom throw their time schedule of history at least nineteen years out of order, shortening up the stream of time by that many years. They do this because of trying to harmonize the Bible records with the astronomical Canon of Claudius Ptolemy, an Alexandrian or Egyptian astronomer of the <span id="page638" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="638" data-before-text="638"></span>second century after Christ, but whose system of astronomy has long since been exploded. In this we do not go along with such chronologers.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">So, at this captivity in 617 B.C.E., the beginning of Judah’s desolation had to wait until the eleventh year of the last king of Judah, Zedekiah, who was put under an oath of submission by Nebuchadnezzar.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964766/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Chron. 36:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964766/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Ezek. 17:12-14</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="ss"><strong>PROPHETIC CUP OF RAGE SERVED TO BABYLON</strong></p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Haughty King Jehoiakim had died a disgraceful death. But the obedient priest Jeremiah remained alive to prophesy for Jehovah. In the fourth year of King Zedekiah, or in 614 B.C.E., Jeremiah wrote a prophecy setting out in detail the coming fall of Babylon. It was in contrast to the prophecy made by the false prophet Hananiah to nullify the effect of Jeremiah’s prophecy against Jerusalem. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964766/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Jer. 28:1-4</a>) In that same year King Zedekiah, with his quartermaster Seraiah, made a visit to Babylon for political reasons, doubtless to reassure the king of Babylon by personally bringing the tribute due to Nebuchadnezzar. At this time it appears that the governor of the city of Babylon was one Nabonidus, whom King Nebuchadnezzar was thinking of marrying to his favorite daughter Nitocris.<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1964766/2">c</a> Jeremiah took advantage of Zedekiah’s visit to have this Seraiah take along the roll containing the prophecy on Babylon’s fall and to read it aloud at Babylon. He tells us:</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">“And Jeremiah proceeded to write in one book all the calamity that would come upon Babylon . . . Furthermore, Jeremiah said to Seraiah: ‘As soon as you come to Babylon and actually see her, you must also read aloud all these words. And you must say, “O Jehovah, you yourself have spoken against this place, in order to cut it off so that there may come to be in it no inhabitant, either man or even domestic animal, but that she may become mere desolate wastes to time indefinite.” And it must occur that when you will have completed reading this book, you will tie to it a stone, and you must pitch it into the midst of the Euphrates. And you must say, “This is how Babylon will sink down and never rise up because of the calamity that I am bringing in upon her; and they will certainly tire themselves out.”’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964766/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Jer. 51:59-64</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">From these events in the latter days of the kingdom of Judah, with kings of the line of David sitting on Jehovah’s throne at Jerusalem, we learn the lesson: “Let him that thinks he is standing beware that he does not fall.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964766/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:12</a>) Jerusalem, the city of the great King, that had been so richly blessed by Jehovah God, that had been protected by him, even many years beyond the fall of her sister kingdom of Samaria, had reached a climax in haughtiness and pride, even going so far as to burn the written Word of Jehovah God. After this the entire nation began to decline most rapidly and to stumble seriously to the point of losing her freedom and to come under servitude to a pagan king, with her fall and complete desolation imminent. How this occurred will be discussed in the next succeeding issues of this magazine.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Bible-burning governments, and those who seek to destroy God’s Word, the Bible, or who try to keep it from the people by banning it and arresting those who possess the Bible, and persecuting those who believe and proclaim its message, will stumble seriously, and, because of pride and haughtiness against Jehovah, will soon be brought down with a crash to desolation from which they will never be able to recover.</p>

Hence Jehovah goes on to say to those self-deceiving oath breakers: “Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said, ‘By reason of your causing your error to be remembered by your transgressions being uncovered, in order that your sins may be seen according to all your dealings, by reason of your being called to remembrance you people will be seized even by the hand.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971012/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ezekiel 21:24</a>) Their transgressions against proper covenant-keeping came out into the open or were uncovered, and this caused the offended king of Babylon to remember their error.</p><p id="p107" data-pid="107" class="qu">38.

<strong>Humility—an Aid to Patience</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The Bible tells us that Jehovah God has shown patience over the centuries, yes, for millenniums. He has truly been patient with the human race, even as illustrated by his dealings with the nation of Israel: “Jehovah . . . kept sending against them by means of his messengers, sending again and again,” until, in righteous indignation, he had to act. Patient? Yes, he waited patiently for centuries before he punished that nation for their wicked unfaithfulness by letting them be taken into Babylonian captivity.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101973160/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Chron. 36:15, 16</a>.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204403/524/0">7/1/1962, pp. 390-391</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Facing Up to Our Urgent Times</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Then too, each time a Witness calls he endeavors to leave a few grains of truth, <span id="page391" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="391" data-before-text="391"></span>a few drops of spiritual water, as it were. Time and again these have a cumulative effect, eventually bearing fruit. Besides, the message the Witnesses bring sounds strange to many persons and they fail to grasp its urgency. Only by hearing it again and again do they gradually get the point.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Nor is that all. So as to awaken all latent interest and achieve the most effectiveness, the Witnesses vary their doorstep sermons as well as their literature offers. To some persons one Biblical theme will appeal and arouse interest, to others, another; some are interested in books, others in magazines. And the literature continually carries new information as well as new approaches to information previously published, all of which furnishes added reasons for the Witnesses’ calling so frequently. This is in keeping with the principle enunciated by one of the foremost Christian ministers, the apostle Paul: “I have become all things to people of all sorts, that I might by all means save some.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962481/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Cor. 9:19-23</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Surely all this variety in circumstances, in people themselves, and in the message being presented is sound reason for the Witnesses to face up to our urgent times by repeatedly calling upon the people at their homes.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>WHAT IS ACCOMPLISHED</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Reinforcing the validity of all the foregoing reasons for the Witnesses to call so often at the homes of the people are the four basic things they accomplish. First of all they make known, honor and exalt the name of Jehovah, in keeping with the prophetic command: “Give thanks to Jehovah, you people! Call upon his name. Make known among the peoples his dealings. Make mention that his name is to be put on high.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962481/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isa. 12:4</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Secondly, by the Witnesses’ frequent calls the wicked receive ample warning. Jehovah God always warns the wicked before executing his judgments upon them. As in ancient times God kept sending his messengers to his people Israel, warning them, so today he is having his Witnesses sound the warning. When Armageddon strikes, all the wicked will know why they are being destroyed.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962481/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Chron. 36:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962481/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Ezek. 35:9</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">A third basic result from this repeated calling upon the people at their homes is that a great crowd, close to a million thus far, of persons of goodwill from all nations have taken their stand for Jehovah and may look forward to being hidden in the day of God’s anger. Having sown bountifully, the Witnesses are reaping bountifully.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962481/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Zeph. 2:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962481/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 9:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962481/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> Rev. 7:9</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">And fourthly, by faithfully and repeatedly calling upon the people the Witnesses assure their own salvation, for “with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation.” Yes, thereby they save both themselves and their hearers.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962481/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Rom. 10:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962481/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 4:16</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">So who is there that can say otherwise than that the Christian witnesses of Jehovah have compelling reasons for calling so often at the homes of the people?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Be Taught by Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Still, at times, because of human frailty or some other valid reason, Jehovah does teach his servants by experience. That is, by means of miracles or his providences <span id="page342" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="342" data-before-text="342"></span>he indicates his will or drives home certain lessons. He let the Israelites go hungry in the wilderness and then fed them on miraculous manna ‘in order to make them know,’ that is, to teach them, “that not by. bread alone does man live.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Deut. 8:2, 3</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Because the Israelite Achan let covetousness overreach him God permitted the entire nation to suffer defeat at Ai to impress upon Joshua and all his people the seriousness of Achan’s offense. Thereafter God repeatedly let his people come under pagan subjection to bring them to their senses. This thought is inherent in the psalmists’ words: “Before I was under affliction I was sinning by mistake.” “Show us just how to count our days in such a way that we may bring in a heart of wisdom.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Josh. 7:1-26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Judg. 10:9-16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Ps. 119:67;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/10/3" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 90:12</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">While God’s servants today cannot point to like miracles, God does, at times, indicate his will for them by means of his providences. Thus the wholly unexpected obtaining of an abundance of essential fuel back in 1919 indicated to them what was God’s will in a certain matter, even as their inability to find suitable accommodations in 1958 indicated that it was not God’s will to have certain camping facilities in connection with the Divine Will International Assembly.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>TAUGHT BY HOLY SPIRIT</strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Jehovah God also uses his holy spirit to teach us. By holy spirit is not meant a third person of a mysterious trinity, but God’s active force, by means of which he carries out his purposes. Even as he used it to inspire men to write his Word, so by means of it he gives understanding of that Word. Thus only after receiving holy spirit at Pentecost did the early Christians understand God’s will for them, even as Jesus foretold: “The helper, the holy spirit which the Father will send in my name, that one will teach you all things and bring back to your minds all the things I told you.” As the apostle Paul also noted: “Eye has not seen and ear has not heard, neither have there been conceived in the heart of man the things which God has prepared for those who love him.” But “to us God has revealed them through his spirit, for the spirit searches into all things, even the deep things of God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">John 14:26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 2:9, 10</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">To receive this enlightening holy spirit requires knowledge of God’s Word, faith in it and works in harmony with that faith. We “receive the spirit . . . due to obedient hearing by faith.” Only then will God answer our prayers for the holy spirit. But more than that, it is also necessary for us to have contact or association with God’s visible channel or earthly organization—a fact driven home by the experience of the early Christians.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gal. 3:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Acts 8:15-17</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong>BY A VISIBLE ORGANIZATION</strong></p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Jehovah as the great Teacher has ever used human instruments to teach his earthly children. Adam taught Eve; Noah taught his family; Abraham taught his household; Moses taught his people. In particular was the tribe of Levi, together with its priests, the teaching instrument in ancient Israel: “For the lips of a priest are the ones that should keep knowledge, and the law is what people should seek from his mouth; for he is the messenger of Jehovah.” When this teaching body failed to do its duty, God “kept sending against them by means of his messengers [the prophets], . . . because he felt compassion for his people.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Mal. 2:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 36:15</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">When on earth Jesus proved himself to be the greatest instrument or Teacher this earth had ever seen. He had more knowledge and teaching ability than any other <span id="page343" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="343" data-before-text="343"></span>human before or since. He taught his people on the mountainside, on the seaside, in their homes, synagogues and the temple. As he himself testified: “Day after day I used to sit in the temple teaching.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961404/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 26:55</a>.</p>

Mournfully he says: “Jehovah has swallowed up, he has shown no compassion upon any abiding places of Jacob [Israel]. In his fury he has torn down the fortified places of the daughter of Judah. He has brought into contact with the earth, he has profaned the kingdom and her princes. In the heat of anger he has cut down every horn of Israel. He has turned his right hand back from before the enemy; and in Jacob he keeps burning like a flaming fire that has devoured all around. He has trodden his bow like an enemy.

It was to lie desolate in this manner for a full period of seventy years, in order that the God-given land might enjoy a sabbath period, to make up for all the sabbath years that the Jews had failed to keep regarding the land.

<strong>The Bible—Authentic and Inspired</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Of the many evidences establishing the truth of the Bible, no greater proof could be desired than its inspired prophecy. Man cannot reliably foretell the future. True prophecy comes from the true God, Jehovah, who says: “The first things—here they have come, but new things I am telling <span id="page247" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="247" data-before-text="247"></span>out. Before they begin to spring up, I cause you people to hear them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962284/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isa. 42:9</a>) Examine the chart of prophecies accompanying this article. The events fulfilling prophecy are occurrences known to you through personal observation or history, Biblical and secular. The predictions were made many years or many centuries before the fulfillments. The fulfillment of these prophecies proves the divine inspiration of the Bible. Any one of Jehovah’s witnesses will be glad to give you further details at your request. Investigate and discover why prophecy has been called a continuing miracle.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">This chart by no means exhausts all the fulfilled Bible prophecies, nor have all the evidences of the Bible’s authenticity been explored here. But what we have learned from archaeology, history, prophecy and reason should be enough to convince any honest person that Paul’s statement at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962284/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16</a> is positively true: “All Scripture is inspired of God.”</p>

For example, there is the remarkable forecast, made more than 300 years in advance, that Josiah would be the one to rip apart Jeroboam’s altar at Bethel. Josiah did it! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990072/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">1 Ki. 13:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990072/49/1" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 23:15</a>) However, most outstanding are the prophecies relating to the house of Jehovah, built by Solomon. Jehovah told Solomon that falling away to false gods would result in Jehovah’s cutting Israel off from the surface of the ground and in His throwing away before Him the house that He had <span id="page69" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="69" data-before-text="69"></span>sanctified to his name.

Moreover, Jesus showed that the later temple built by Herod the Great on the same site would suffer the same fate and for the same reason. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990072/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Luke 21:6</a>) How true this also proved to be! We should remember these catastrophes and the reason for them, and they should remind us always to walk in the ways of the true God.</p>

<strong>Bible Book Number 33—Micah</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> There is an abundance of evidence to show the authenticity of the book of Micah. It has always been accepted by the Jews as part of the Hebrew canon. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990094/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jeremiah 26:18, 19</a> refers directly to Micah’s words: “Zion will be plowed up as a mere field, and Jerusalem herself will become mere heaps of ruins.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990094/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mic. 3:12</a>) This prophecy was accurately fulfilled in 607 B.C.E. when the king of Babylon razed Jerusalem, “so as to cause ruin.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990094/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Chron. 36:19</a>) A similar prophecy about Samaria, that it would become “a heap of ruins of the field,” was likewise fulfilled. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990094/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Mic. 1:6, 7</a>) Samaria was ruined by the Assyrians in 740 B.C.E. when they took the northern kingdom of Israel into captivity. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101990094/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Ki. 17:5, 6</a>) It was later conquered by Alexander the Great in the fourth century B.C.E. and suffered devastation by the Jews under John Hyrcanus I in the second century B.C.E. Of this last destruction of Samaria, <em>The New Westminster Dictionary of the Bible,</em> 1970, page 822, states: “The victor demolished it, attempting to efface all proofs that a fortified city had ever stood on the hill.”</p>

Mournfully he says: “Jehovah has swallowed up, he has shown no compassion upon any abiding places of Jacob [Israel]. In his fury he has torn down the fortified places of the daughter of Judah. He has brought into contact with the earth, he has profaned the kingdom and her princes. In the heat of anger he has cut down every horn of Israel. He has turned his right hand back from before the enemy; and in Jacob he keeps burning like a flaming fire that has devoured all around. He has trodden his bow like an enemy. His right hand has taken its position like an adversary, and he kept killing all those desirable to the eyes. Into the tent of the daughter of Zion he has poured out his rage, just like fire.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971010/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Lamentations 2:2-4</a>) With fitting figures of speech Jeremiah continues on to say: “Jehovah has accomplished his rage.

So, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971010/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 36:16-20</a>, we read about the unresponsive Jews:</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> “They were continually making jest at the messengers of the true God and despising his words and mocking at his prophets, until the rage of Jehovah came up against his people, until there was no healing. So he brought up against them the king of the Chaldeans, who proceeded to kill their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, neither did he feel compassion for young man or virgin, old or decrepit. Everything He gave into his hand.

And he proceeded to burn the house of the true God and pull down the wall of Jerusalem; and all its dwelling towers they burned with fire and also all its desirable articles, so as to cause ruin. Furthermore, he carried off those remaining from the sword captive to Babylon, and they came to be servants to him and his sons until the royalty of Persia began to reign.”</p>

<strong>The Watchman Lives to Get the Report</strong><br/><p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[70]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="29"><sup>29</sup></span> Jehovah made it plain that those unrepentant, undeported sinners were due to be deprived of using the God-given land, for he now said to Ezekiel: “This is what you should say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “As I am alive, surely the ones who are in the devastated places will fall by the sword itself; and the one who is upon the surface of the field, to the wild beast I shall certainly give him <span id="page289" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="289" data-before-text="289"></span>for food; and those who are in the strong places and in the caves will die by the pestilence itself.

And they will have to know that I am Jehovah when I make the land a desolate waste, even a desolation, on account of all their detestable things that they have done.”’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971015/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ezekiel 33:27-29</a>.</p><p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="qu">30. What decree concerning the desolation of the land was not to be set at nought, and when did that divine decree take effect?</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[71]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"><sup>30</sup></span> Jehovah’s decree was not to be set at nought. He had decreed that the land of the Kingdom of Judah should be absolutely desolated of man and domesticated beast, with no one even passing through the desolated land because of fear of its being haunted by demons. It was to lie desolate in this manner for a full period of seventy years, in order that the God-given land might enjoy a sabbath period, to make up for all the sabbath years that the Jews had failed to keep regarding the land. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971015/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 36:17-23</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971015/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Daniel 9:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971015/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Jeremiah 9:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971015/24/2" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> 26:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971015/24/3" data-bid="25-4" class="b"> 32:43;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971015/24/4" data-bid="25-5" class="b"> 33:10-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971015/24/5" data-bid="25-6" class="b"> 34:22</a>.) Consequently those defiers of Jehovah’s decree had to be ousted, and they were. The utter desolation of the land of Judah did begin in the seventh month of the year of Jerusalem’s destruction, about October 4/5 of the year 607 B.C.E. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971015/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">2 Kings 25:18-26</a>) Any Jewish fugitives round about who desired to repossess the land before the ending of seventy years of utter desolation were prevented from doing so.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101971015/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Jeremiah 52:24-30</a>.</p><p id="p72" data-pid="72" class="qu">31.

Before the so-called pagan, heathen part of Babylon the Great, Christendom will cease to be the dominant part of that world empire of false Babylonish religion. The <span id="page290" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="290" data-before-text="290"></span>secular elements of today’s worldwide system of things will look at the vacuum that she as well as the rest of Babylon the Great has left, but her they will see no more during the brief time before those secular elements are themselves annihilated in the worldwide “great tribulation” in which the whole system comes to a violent end. Christendom never did correctly put God’s name before those secular elements. Necessarily, then, in view of what the anointed Ezekiel class have long proclaimed world wide, those secular elements will have to come to the knowledge prescribed for them in the repeatedly stated formula: “They will have to know that I am Jehovah.”</p>

This obliged Jehovah to speak, not just with words but more fully with deeds, “against the remaining ones of the nations and against Edom, all of it,” in the fire of his zeal for his name and his cause.

He has turned his right hand back from before the enemy; and in Jacob he keeps burning like a flaming fire that has devoured all around. He has trodden his bow like an enemy.

He had decreed that the land of the Kingdom of Judah should be absolutely desolated of man and domesticated beast, with no one even passing through the desolated land because of fear of its being haunted by demons. It was to lie desolate in this manner for a full period of seventy years, in order that the God-given land might enjoy a sabbath period, to make up for all the sabbath years that the Jews had failed to keep regarding the land.

Christendom never did correctly put God’s name before those secular elements. Necessarily, then, in view of what the anointed Ezekiel class have long proclaimed world wide, those secular elements will have to come to the knowledge prescribed for them in the repeatedly stated formula: “They will have to know that I am Jehovah.”</p>

<strong>Determining the Year by Fact and Bible</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> How long are “seven times”, the times of the nations? The mathematics are supplied for us in another prophecy unrelated to this one which uses the term “times” or “periods of time”. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952322/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Revelation 12:6</a> (<em>NW</em>) there is mentioned 1,260 days and then in the 14th <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952322/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Re 12 verse 14</a> this very same period is referred to as 3 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> “times”. So if 3 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> “times” is 1,260 days, then 7 “times” (twice 3 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> “times”) must be twice 1,260, or 2,520 days. Early in their wilderness trek the Israelites repudiated the sovereign wisdom of their God by wanting to return to Egypt on having believed the faith-lacking reports of the ten unfaithful spies. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952322/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Num. 14:1-4</a>) For this lack of faith by the people in God’s sovereign leadership, Jehovah sentenced the nation to forty years of wandering in the wilderness with no sovereign control of land. “For every day spent in spying out the land, you shall spend a year being punished for your evil-doing, forty years for forty days; that will teach you <span id="page271" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="271" data-before-text="271"></span>what it is to have me against you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952322/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Num. 14:34</a>, <em>Mo.</em></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> So according to this rule established in the wilderness the Jewish nation, who time and again showed they did not appreciate Jehovah’s sovereign control, would have to bear God’s adverse judgment at the hands of their Gentile overlords for a period of seven “times”, or 2,520 year-days. These 2,520 years ran from the desolating of Jerusalem and the land in the summer and fall of 607 B.C. up to the summer and fall of 1914, when they expired. From 607 B.C. to 1 B.C. is 606 years. From 1 B.C. to A.D. 1 is only one year, because the ancients had not discovered the zero which according to modern mathematics would have made it two years. The use of the zero is only of comparatively recent mathematical origin. From A.D. 1 to A.D. 1914 is 1,913 years. Therefore adding 606 years plus 1 year plus 1,913 years we get a total of 2,520 years.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">21-23.

Russell in 1877 used the date 606 B.C. for the fall of Jerusalem whereas <em>The Watchtower</em> of late years has been using 607 B.C. This is because, in the light of modern scholarship, two slight errors were discovered to have been made which cancel each other out and make for the same result, namely, 1914. Concerning the first error, Russell and others considered 1 B.C. to A.D. 1 as being two years whereas in fact this is only one year because, as has been said above, there is no “zero” year in the B.C.-A.D. system for counting years. “The Christian era began, not with no year, but with a 1st year.”—<em>The Westminster Dictionary of the Bible,</em> p. 102.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> The second error had to do with not beginning the count of the 2,520 years at the right point in view of historic facts and circumstances. Almost all early Bible chronology ties in with secular history at the year 539 B.C., in which year the fall of Babylon to Darius and Cyrus of the Medes and the Persians occurred. In late years several cuneiform tablets have been discovered pertaining to the fall of Babylon which peg both Biblical and secular historic dates. The one tablet known as the “Nabunaid Chronicle” gives the date for the fall of Babylon which specialists have ascertained as being October 12-13, 539 B.C., Julian Calendar, or October 6-7, 539 B.C., according to our present Gregorian Calendar.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1952322/1">b</a> This tablet also says that Cyrus made his triumphant entry into Babylon 16 days after its fall to his army. Thus his <em>accession year</em> commenced in October, 539 B.C. However, in another cuneiform tablet called “Strassmaier, <em>Cyrus</em> No. 11” Cyrus’ first <em>regnal year</em> is mentioned and was determined to have begun March 17-18, 538 B.C., and to have concluded March 4-5, 537 B.C.<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1952322/2">c</a> It was in this first <em>regnal year</em> of Cyrus that he issued his decree to permit the Jews to return to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952322/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ezra 1:1</a>) The decree may have been made in late 538 B.C. or before March 4-5, 537 B.C.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> In either case this would have given sufficient time for the large party of 49,897 Jews to organize their expedition and to make their long four-month journey from Babylon to Jerusalem to get there by September 29-30, 537 B.C., the first of the seventh Jewish month, to build their altar to Jehovah as recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952322/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Ezra 3:1-3</a>.

It clearly specifies that the 70 years would be years of <em>devastation of the land of Judah.</em> The prophet Daniel so understood the prophecy, for he states: “I myself, Daniel, discerned by the books the number of the years concerning which the word of Jehovah had occurred to Jeremiah the prophet, for fulfilling the <em>devastations</em> of Jerusalem, namely, seventy years.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/76/0" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Da 9:2</a>) After describing the conquest of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/77/0" data-bid="78-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 36:20, 21</a> states: “Furthermore, he carried off those remaining from the sword captive to Babylon, and they came to be servants to him and his sons until the royalty of Persia began to reign; to fulfill Jehovah’s word by the mouth of Jeremiah, <em>until the land had paid off its sabbaths.</em> All the days of lying desolated it kept sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.”</p><p id="p241" data-pid="241" class="sb">Jerusalem came under final siege in Zedekiah’s 9th year (609 B.C.E.), and the city fell in his 11th year (607 B.C.E.), corresponding to Nebuchadnezzar’s 19th year of actual rule (counting from his accession year in 625 B.C.E.). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/78/0" data-bid="79-1" class="b">2Ki 25:1-8</a>) In the fifth month of that year (the month of Ab, corresponding to parts of July and August) the city was set afire, the walls were pulled down, and the majority of the people were led off into exile. However, “some of the lowly people of the land” were allowed to remain, and these did so until the assassination of Gedaliah, Nebuchadnezzar’s appointee, whereupon they fled into Egypt, finally leaving Judah completely desolate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/79/0" data-bid="80-1" class="b">2Ki 25:9-12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/79/1" data-bid="80-2" class="b"> 22-26</a>) This was in the seventh month, Ethanim (or Tishri, corresponding to parts of September and October). Hence the count of the 70 years of desolation must have begun about October 1, 607 B.C.E., ending in 537 B.C.E. By the seventh month of this latter year the first repatriated Jews arrived back in Judah, 70 years from the start of the full desolation of the land.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/80/0" data-bid="81-1" class="b">2Ch 36:21-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/80/1" data-bid="81-2" class="b"> Ezr 3:1</a>.</p>

<strong>Cyrus</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">In view of the Bible record, Cyrus’ decree freeing the Jews to return to Jerusalem likely was made late in the year 538 or early in 537 B.C.E. This would allow time for the Jewish exiles to prepare to move out of Babylon and make the long trek to Judah and Jerusalem (a trip that could take about four months according to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001102/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ezr 7:9</a>) and yet be settled “in their cities” in Judah by “the seventh month” (Tishri) of the year 537 B.C.E.

<strong>Sabbath Year</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The land would have enjoyed 121 Sabbath years besides 17 Jubilee years prior to the exile if Israel had kept the Law properly. But the Sabbath years were only partially kept. When the people went into exile in Babylon, the land remained desolate for 70 years “until the land had paid off its sabbaths.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003780/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2Ch 36:20, 21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003780/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Le 26:34, 35,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003780/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 43</a>) Nowhere do the Scriptures state that the Jews had failed to keep exactly 70 Sabbath years; but Jehovah let 70 years of enforced desolation of the land make up for all the Sabbath years that had not been kept.</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006846/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jeremiah 25:8-11</a>) The strongest reason to believe that this prophecy came true is the inspired historical account recorded some 75 years after the first group of exiles returned to their homeland. It states that the king of Babylon “carried off those remaining from the sword captive to Babylon, and they came to be servants to him and his sons until the royalty of Persia began to reign.” And regarding the land, it is reported: “All the days of lying desolated it kept sabbath.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006846/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 36:20, 21</a>) Is there any archaeological evidence to support this?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In the journal <em>Biblical Archaeology Review,</em> Ephraim Stern, professor of Palestinian archaeology at Hebrew University, points out: “The Assyrians and Babylonians both ravaged large parts of ancient Israel, yet the archaeological evidence from the aftermath of their respective conquests tells two very different stories.” He explains: “While the Assyrians left a clear imprint of their presence in Palestine, there is a strange gap after the Babylonian destruction. . . . We find no evidence of occupation until the Persian period . . . There is a complete gap in evidence suggesting occupation. In all that time, not a single town destroyed by the Babylonians was resettled.”</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Professor Lawrence E. Stager of Harvard University agrees. “Throughout Philistia, and later throughout Judah,” he says, the Babylonian king’s “scorched-earth policy created a veritable wasteland west of the Jordan River.” Stager adds: “Only with Cyrus the Great, the Persian successor to the Babylonians, does the archaeological record begin again . . . in Jerusalem and in Judah, where many Jewish exiles returned to their homeland.”</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Yes, Jehovah’s word concerning Judah’s lying desolate was fulfilled.

<strong>Finding Answers to Your Bible Questions</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">One of the most valuable aids of all in finding answers to Bible questions is the <em>Watch Tower Publications Index,</em> 1930-1960, <span id="page127" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="127" data-before-text="127"></span>along with its yearly supplements. By using the <em>Index,</em> which has both a subject and a scripture index, you have a treasure map to direct you to a wealth of information to answer questions.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Suppose you are reading the Bible and come to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965127/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 36:20, 21</a>, about the seventy-year desolation that Judah was to experience “to fulfill Jehovah’s word by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had paid off its sabbaths.” One might ask, Why did Jehovah require seventy years? Was it that the Israelites failed to keep exactly that many sabbath years or is the number figurative? By going to the 1963 <em>Index</em> supplement, you will find under the scripture index at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965127/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 36:21</a> a reference to the book <em>“Babylon the Great Has Fallen!” God’s Kingdom Rules!</em> It points out on page 164 that the number seventy is figurative. Further, checking in the <em>Index</em> for 1930-1960 draws your attention to the book <em>“The Kingdom Is at Hand,”</em> where you learn:</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="si">“During the times that the Israelites were faithful to their covenant, they observed these land sabbaths as they fell due. How many all together is not disclosed. But the number seventy represents completeness, it being a multiple of 10 x 7; 10 symbolizing earthly completeness, and 7 symbolizing spiritual completeness. Hence Jehovah God let the number 70 stand as a figure to represent comprehensively all the sabbath-year rests of the land they had failed to observe. Then he let 70 years of enforced desolation of the land offset or make up for all those unkept sabbath-years.”—Pp. 169, 170.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">But the “scripture index” feature of the <em>Watch Tower Publications Index</em> is not all; there is also the “subject index” feature. With many of your questions it may be best to look here. Suppose, for example, you had a question, Was Jesus impaled according to the Jewish or Roman custom? By simply looking under the word “Impalement,” you find a subheading “Jewish procedure,” and are directed to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1965127/0/0"><em>The Watchtower</em> of April 1, 1952, page 223</a>, where you learn the facts about both Jewish and Roman procedures of impalement. The Jewish method was to impale a criminal after he had been put to death; the Roman procedure was to hang the victim on the stake alive. Jesus was thus impaled according to Roman custom.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">So the <em>Watch Tower Publications Index</em> can direct you to answers to many of your Bible questions. Do you have one? If so, do you use it, along with its supplements? You can make the <em>Index</em> especially fruitful by saving your copies of the <em>Watchtower</em> and <em>Awake!</em> magazines or by obtaining the bound volumes at the end of the year. Even if you do not have a variety of Watch Tower publications, the <em>Index</em> will help you greatly, for most of the publications will probably be available in the library of the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s witnesses nearest you.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">So make good use of the many ways to find “the very knowledge of God.” Do not forget to read the context when a question centers around a certain scripture. Bible dictionaries may help you. Use Biblical cross-references and a concordance; and, if at all possible, never fail to check the <em>Watch Tower Publications Index.</em> If you use these aids, you will seldom have to ask others. Furthermore, you will have not only the answer but also the satisfaction that <em>you</em> know how to find answers to your Bible questions. Then, too, your spiritual maturity will be enhanced. Treasures abundant await you! Be an adept researcher and be enriched!</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Jehovah, Enforcer of Prophecy</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">By this move of the people in the middle of the seventh month, Tishri or Ethanim, which would be near the Gregorian calendar date of October 1, 607 B.C.E., the land of Judah was left completely desolate, without human inhabitant or domestic animal. The timing of the enforcement of Jehovah’s prophecy here is remarkable. For it was in this seventh month Ethanim, on the tenth day, the day of atonement, that the trumpet was blown in a Jubilee year to “proclaim liberty in the land to all its inhabitants.” It began a sabbath year for the God-given land. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964886/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Lev. 25:8-22</a>) So exactly at the appropriate time of the year <span id="page734" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="734" data-before-text="734"></span>an uninterrupted run of sabbath years began, in compensation for all the sabbath years that the disobedient Israelites had failed to keep. The land was to enjoy, figuratively, a perfect number of sabbath years—seventy, during which time it was to be utterly desolate, without human inhabitant, a place to be shunned like a haunted place by passers-by. The record written later on, a testimony to Jehovah’s ability to enforce his word, reads:</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="si">“So he brought up against them the king of the Chaldeans, . . . And he proceeded to burn the house of the true God and pull down the wall of Jerusalem; . . . Furthermore, he carried off those remaining from the sword captive to Babylon, and they came to be servants to him and his sons until the royalty of Persia began to reign; to fulfill Jehovah’s word by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had paid off its sabbaths. All the days of lying desolated it kept sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964886/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Chron. 36:17-23</a>; compare also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964886/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Daniel 9:1, 2</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The Jewish secular historian, Flavius Josephus, of the first century of our Common Era, corroborates the Bible account, writing about Jerusalem’s desolation:</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="si">He [the Chaldean historian Berosus in the third century B.C.E.] gives us a catalogue of the posterity of Noah, who adds the years of their chronology, from Noah himself to Nabulassar king of the Babylonians and Chaldeans, with an account of this king’s exploits. He tells us that he sent his son Nabuchodonosor with a mighty army into Egypt and Judea where, upon his being informed of a revolt, he reduced the people to subjection, set fire to our temple at Jerusalem, and carried off our whole nation in captivity to Babylon. After this our city lay desolate during an interval of seventy years, till the days of Cyrus, King of Persia.—Book 1, section 36, of <em>To Epaphroditus on the Antiquities of the Jews in Answer to Apion.</em></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="si">And such was the end of the nation of the Hebrews; it having twice gone beyond Euphrates. For the people of the ten tribes were carried out of Samaria by the Assyrians, in the days of King Hoshea. After which the people of the two tribes, that remained after Jerusalem was taken, were carried away by Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon and Chaldea. Now as to Shalmaneser, he removed the Israelites out of their country, and placed therein the nation of Cutheans who had formerly belonged to the interior of Persia and Media; but were then called Samaritans; by taking the name of the country to which they were removed. But the King of Babylon, who brought out the two tribes, placed no other nation in their country. By which means all Judea, and Jerusalem, and the temple, continued to be a desert for seventy years.—Book 10, chapter 9, last paragraph, of <em>Antiquities of the Jews,</em> edition by Whiston.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">So just when did the foretold seventy years of the desolation of Jerusalem and Judah begin to count? Not in 626 B.C.E., the third year of the reign of King Jehoiakim, for there was no captivity of Jews in Babylon then. Even in his ninth year, 620 B.C.E., Jehoiakim merely became tributary to the king of Babylon. In the eleventh year of his reign, in 618 B.C.E., he rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar, who came up against him.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1964886/0">a</a> Shortly before the end of Jehoiakim’s eleventh year his son and successor, Jehoiachin, who reigned only three months and ten days, went out in self-surrender to Nebuchadnezzar, who was besieging the city. It was on Nisan 1, 617 B.C.E., (in the spring) that the first regnal year began for Zedekiah, Jehoiachin’s uncle, whom Nebuchadnezzar made king of Jerusalem in place of Jehoiachin.

Thus the seventy years of unbroken captivity to Babylon did not begin until 607 B.C.E., in the month Ethanim, when the land was left completely desolate when its remaining inhabitants went down to Egypt. Then the Jews as a nation went into exile at Babylon, without a king at Jerusalem. This exile was for an <em>uninterrupted</em> period of seventy years. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964886/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Dan. 9:1, 2</a>) The seven hundred and forty-five Jews taken into exile, as mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964886/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Jeremiah 52:30</a>, were not taken from the desolated land of Judah, but were captured later when Nebuchadnezzar, as Jehovah’s symbolic cup, made nations that bordered on the land of Judah drink the bitter potion of being violently conquered.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964886/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Jer. 25:17-29</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">When would the desolation end? In 537 B.C.E., when King Cyrus of Persia released the Jewish remnant and they left Babylon and began to repopulate the land of Judah. This date can be established by use of the records of secular history. The period of desolation of the land of Judah began seventy years earlier, in 607 B.C.E. No settlers were brought in by Nebuchadnezzar to occupy the land of Judah, as had been done by the king of Assyria in the land of Samaria when he captured that land. Jehovah enforced his prophecy by miraculous means and the land of Judah was kept a complete desolation, that it might rest the foretold seventy years.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964886/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Chron. 36:21-23</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Ezekiel, over in Babylonia, heard about the destruction, evidently before Nebuchadnezzar’s troops arrived back victorious, in the eleventh year of his exile in Babylon. He says: “At length it occurred in the twelfth year [by a certain calculation], in the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month of our exile, that there came to me the escaped one from Jerusalem, saying: ‘The city has been struck down!’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964886/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ezek. 33:21</a>) From then on, Ezekiel could prophesy about the coming restoration at the end of the seventy years of desolation.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964886/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ezek. 36:1 to 37:28</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Though Jehovah enforced his prophecy, was this something of joy to him and to his faithful prophet Jeremiah? No. He inspired Jeremiah to write the Bible book called Lamentations, describing the sad state of Jerusalem:</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="si">“O how she has come to sit solitary, the city that was abundant with people! How she has become like a widow, she that was populous among the nations! . . . Her adversaries have become the head. . . . Because Jehovah himself has brought grief to her on account of the abundance of her transgressions, her own children have walked captive before the adversary. And from the daughter [city] of Zion there goes out all her splendor.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964886/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Lam. 1:1-6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964886/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964886/23/2" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> 2:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964886/23/3" data-bid="24-4" class="b"> 5:16-22</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">But this regrettable state of the people who had God’s name upon them and who suffered because of their sins against Jehovah did not in any way cancel Jehovah’s covenant nor make him unhappy with his purposes. It is true that in 607 B.C.E. the adversaries of Zion became “the head.” “Jehovah’s throne” in Zion had been overturned. The typical or miniature kingdom of God had passed away. No longer was there any typical kingdom of God on earth to block the Gentile or non-Jewish nations in their way to full world domination. By God’s permission they had complete sway.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="ss"><strong>GOD’S KINGDOM NOT FOREVER OVERTURNED</strong></p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Why was Jehovah God not unhappy? Because, though these uninterrupted “times of the Gentiles” or “appointed times of the nations” set in at the desolation of Judah in the seventh Jewish month of 607 B.C.E., they would last only until Shiloh, the One who has the legal right to the overturned kingdom of God, should come and God should give to him the crown, the royal turban, and the scepter, to rule in the midst of the Gentiles, the worldly nations <span id="page736" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="736" data-before-text="736"></span>who are his enemies. But when would the enthronement of the royal Son of David be? The heavenly King of Eternity had set the time. He foretold it and had it recorded in his inspired Word. He would certainly enforce it.

<strong>The Bible—Authentic and Inspired</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Of the many evidences establishing the truth of the Bible, no greater proof could be desired than its inspired prophecy. Man cannot reliably foretell the future. True prophecy comes from the true God, Jehovah, who says: “The first things—here they have come, but new things I am telling <span id="page247" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="247" data-before-text="247"></span>out. Before they begin to spring up, I cause you people to hear them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962284/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isa. 42:9</a>) Examine the chart of prophecies accompanying this article. The events fulfilling prophecy are occurrences known to you through personal observation or history, Biblical and secular. The predictions were made many years or many centuries before the fulfillments. The fulfillment of these prophecies proves the divine inspiration of the Bible. Any one of Jehovah’s witnesses will be glad to give you further details at your request. Investigate and discover why prophecy has been called a continuing miracle.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">This chart by no means exhausts all the fulfilled Bible prophecies, nor have all the evidences of the Bible’s authenticity been explored here. But what we have learned from archaeology, history, prophecy and reason should be enough to convince any honest person that Paul’s statement at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962284/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16</a> is positively true: “All Scripture is inspired of God.”</p>

<strong>Determining the Year by Fact and Bible</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> How long are “seven times”, the times of the nations? The mathematics are supplied for us in another prophecy unrelated to this one which uses the term “times” or “periods of time”. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952322/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Revelation 12:6</a> (<em>NW</em>) there is mentioned 1,260 days and then in the 14th <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952322/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Re 12 verse 14</a> this very same period is referred to as 3 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> “times”. So if 3 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> “times” is 1,260 days, then 7 “times” (twice 3 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> “times”) must be twice 1,260, or 2,520 days. Early in their wilderness trek the Israelites repudiated the sovereign wisdom of their God by wanting to return to Egypt on having believed the faith-lacking reports of the ten unfaithful spies. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952322/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Num. 14:1-4</a>) For this lack of faith by the people in God’s sovereign leadership, Jehovah sentenced the nation to forty years of wandering in the wilderness with no sovereign control of land. “For every day spent in spying out the land, you shall spend a year being punished for your evil-doing, forty years for forty days; that will teach you <span id="page271" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="271" data-before-text="271"></span>what it is to have me against you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952322/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Num. 14:34</a>, <em>Mo.</em></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> So according to this rule established in the wilderness the Jewish nation, who time and again showed they did not appreciate Jehovah’s sovereign control, would have to bear God’s adverse judgment at the hands of their Gentile overlords for a period of seven “times”, or 2,520 year-days. These 2,520 years ran from the desolating of Jerusalem and the land in the summer and fall of 607 B.C. up to the summer and fall of 1914, when they expired. From 607 B.C. to 1 B.C. is 606 years. From 1 B.C. to A.D. 1 is only one year, because the ancients had not discovered the zero which according to modern mathematics would have made it two years. The use of the zero is only of comparatively recent mathematical origin. From A.D. 1 to A.D. 1914 is 1,913 years. Therefore adding 606 years plus 1 year plus 1,913 years we get a total of 2,520 years.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">21-23. (a) Give one correction of a slight error made by the brothers many years ago as to determining 1914. (b) Explain a second correction.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> At this point some will inquire why Charles T. Russell in 1877 used the date 606 B.C. for the fall of Jerusalem whereas <em>The Watchtower</em> of late years has been using 607 B.C. This is because, in the light of modern scholarship, two slight errors were discovered to have been made which cancel each other out and make for the same result, namely, 1914. Concerning the first error, Russell and others considered 1 B.C. to A.D. 1 as being two years whereas in fact this is only one year because, as has been said above, there is no “zero” year in the B.C.-A.D. system for counting years. “The Christian era began, not with no year, but with a 1st year.”—<em>The Westminster Dictionary of the Bible,</em> p. 102.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> The second error had to do with not beginning the count of the 2,520 years at the right point in view of historic facts and circumstances. Almost all early Bible chronology ties in with secular history at the year 539 B.C., in which year the fall of Babylon to Darius and Cyrus of the Medes and the Persians occurred. In late years several cuneiform tablets have been discovered pertaining to the fall of Babylon which peg both Biblical and secular historic dates. The one tablet known as the “Nabunaid Chronicle” gives the date for the fall of Babylon which specialists have ascertained as being October 12-13, 539 B.C., Julian Calendar, or October 6-7, 539 B.C., according to our present Gregorian Calendar.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1952322/1">b</a> This tablet also says that Cyrus made his triumphant entry into Babylon 16 days after its fall to his army. Thus his <em>accession year</em> commenced in October, 539 B.C. However, in another cuneiform tablet called “Strassmaier, <em>Cyrus</em> No. 11” Cyrus’ first <em>regnal year</em> is mentioned and was determined to have begun March 17-18, 538 B.C., and to have concluded March 4-5, 537 B.C.<a id="footnotesource3" data-fnid="3" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1952322/2">c</a> It was in this first <em>regnal year</em> of Cyrus that he issued his decree to permit the Jews to return to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple.

From the Scriptural record at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101972329/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 36:21-23 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101972329/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Ezra 3:1-3</a>, which tells of Cyrus’ decree liberating the Jews and their return to their homeland, the indications are that the Jews arrived back in their homeland around the early part of October of 537 B.C.E., ending the seventy years of desolation. Jerusalem must, therefore, have been destroyed seventy years earlier, in 607 B.C.E.</p>

He had decreed that the land of the Kingdom of Judah should be absolutely desolated of man and domesticated beast, with no one even passing through the desolated land because of fear of its being haunted by demons. It was to lie desolate in this manner for a full period of seventy years, in order that the God-given land might enjoy a sabbath period, to make up for all the sabbath years that the Jews had failed to keep regarding the land.

Consequently those defiers of Jehovah’s decree had to be ousted, and they were.

Christendom never did correctly put God’s name before those secular elements. Necessarily, then, in view of what the anointed Ezekiel class have long proclaimed world wide, those secular elements will have to come to the knowledge prescribed for them in the repeatedly stated formula: “They will have to know that I am Jehovah.”</p>

<strong>Chronology</strong><br/><p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="sb"><strong>Persian Chronology.</strong> A number of important Biblical events took place during the Persian period: the fall of Babylon, followed by Cyrus’ release of the Jews and the end of the 70-year desolation of Judah; the reconstruction of the temple at Jerusalem, completed “in the sixth year of the reign of Darius [I, Persian]”; and the rebuilding of Jerusalem’s walls by Nehemiah, according to the decree given in the 20th year of Artaxerxes Longimanus.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">2Ch 36:20-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> Ezr 3:8-10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/28/2" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> 4:23, 24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/28/3" data-bid="29-4" class="b"> 6:14, 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/28/4" data-bid="29-5" class="b"> Ne 2:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/28/5" data-bid="29-6" class="b"> 7, 8</a>.</p><p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="sb">The date of 539 B.C.E. for the fall of Babylon can be arrived at not only by Ptolemy’s canon but by other sources as well. The historian Diodorus, as well as Africanus and Eusebius, shows that Cyrus’ first year as king of Persia corresponded to Olympiad 55, year 1 (560/559 B.C.E.), while Cyrus’ last year is placed at Olympiad 62, year 2 (531/530 B.C.E.). Cuneiform tablets give Cyrus a rule of nine years over Babylon, which would therefore substantiate the year 539 as the date of his conquest of Babylon.​—<em>Handbook of Biblical Chronology,</em> by Jack Finegan, 1964, pp. 112, 168-170; <em>Babylonian Chronology, 626 B.C.</em>–<em>A.D. 75,</em> p. 14; see comments above under “Babylonian Chronology,” also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/12">PERSIA, PERSIANS</a>.</p>

<strong>Chronology</strong><br/><p id="p239" data-pid="239" class="sb"><strong><em>From 607 B.C.E. to return from exile.</em></strong> The length of this period is fixed by God’s own decree concerning Judah, that “all this land must become a devastated place, an object of astonishment, and these nations will have to serve the king of Babylon seventy years.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/75/0" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Jer 25:8-11</a>.</p><p id="p240" data-pid="240" class="sb">The Bible prophecy does not allow for the application of the 70-year period to any time other than that between the desolation of Judah, accompanying Jerusalem’s destruction, and the return of the Jewish exiles to their homeland as a result of Cyrus’ decree. It clearly specifies that the 70 years would be years of <em>devastation of the land of Judah.</em> The prophet Daniel so understood the prophecy, for he states: “I myself, Daniel, discerned by the books the number of the years concerning which the word of Jehovah had occurred to Jeremiah the prophet, for fulfilling the <em>devastations</em> of Jerusalem, namely, seventy years.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/76/0" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Da 9:2</a>) After describing the conquest of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/77/0" data-bid="78-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 36:20, 21</a> states: “Furthermore, he carried off those remaining from the sword captive to Babylon, and they came to be servants to him and his sons until the royalty of Persia began to reign; to fulfill Jehovah’s word by the mouth of Jeremiah, <em>until the land had paid off its sabbaths.</em> All the days of lying desolated it kept sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.”</p><p id="p241" data-pid="241" class="sb">Jerusalem came under final siege in Zedekiah’s 9th year (609 B.C.E.), and the city fell in his 11th year (607 B.C.E.), corresponding to Nebuchadnezzar’s 19th year of actual rule (counting from his accession year in 625 B.C.E.). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/78/0" data-bid="79-1" class="b">2Ki 25:1-8</a>) In the fifth month of that year (the month of Ab, corresponding to parts of July and August) the city was set afire, the walls were pulled down, and the majority of the people were led off into exile. However, “some of the lowly people of the land” were allowed to remain, and these did so until the assassination of Gedaliah, Nebuchadnezzar’s appointee, whereupon they fled into Egypt, finally leaving Judah completely desolate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/79/0" data-bid="80-1" class="b">2Ki 25:9-12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/79/1" data-bid="80-2" class="b"> 22-26</a>) This was in the seventh month, Ethanim (or Tishri, corresponding to parts of September and October). Hence the count of the 70 years of desolation must have begun about October 1, 607 B.C.E., ending in 537 B.C.E. By the seventh month of this latter year the first repatriated Jews arrived back in Judah, 70 years from the start of the full desolation of the land.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/80/0" data-bid="81-1" class="b">2Ch 36:21-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000970/80/1" data-bid="81-2" class="b"> Ezr 3:1</a>.</p>

<strong>Cyrus</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><strong>Cyrus’ Decree for the Return of the Exiles.</strong> By his decreeing the end of the Jewish exile, Cyrus fulfilled his commission as Jehovah’s ‘anointed shepherd’ for Israel.

If it did, this would mean that the writer was perhaps viewing Cyrus’ first year as having begun late in the year 538 B.C.E. However, if Darius’ rule over Babylon were to be viewed as that of a viceroy, so that his reign ran concurrent with that of Cyrus, Babylonian custom would place Cyrus’ first <em>regnal</em> year as running from Nisan of 538 to Nisan of 537 B.C.E.</p>

Well, Jehovah spoke of himself as “the One saying of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd, and all that I delight in he will completely carry out’; even in my saying of Jerusalem, ‘She will be rebuilt,’ and of the temple, ‘You will have your foundation laid.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972921/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isa. 44:27, 28</a>) King Cyrus did completely carry out the thing in which Jehovah delighted, though this was contrary to what the national god of Persia delighted to have done. In the year 537 B.C.E., the seventieth year of the desolation of Jerusalem and its temple, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus to decree that the temple should be rebuilt at Jerusalem. To that end Cyrus decreed that the exiles in Babylon who would volunteer for this temple work should be released from Babylon and go back to “the mountain of the house of Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972921/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Chron. 36:20-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972921/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Ezra 1:1-4</a>) By the end of that seventieth year of Jerusalem’s desolation a faithful remnant of temple-work volunteers were back in the land of Judah, bringing to an end its desolation.

<strong>A Pivotal Date in History</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The Jews, of course, left Babylon as quickly as possible after Cyrus’ decree, for, by reason of their knowledge of Jehovah’s prophecies by Jeremiah and Isaiah, they had prepared in advance for departure. But it would take some time to complete all preparations for 49,897 people, and it was a good four months’ journey back to the land of Judah. They arrived there just before the seventh month, Tishri.

No. Why not? The exiled Jews had to take advantage of the decree and leave Babylon and go back to their homeland and reoccupy it in order to end this desolation. For various reasons, such as old age, some Jews were not able to go back; but many others had become well established in highly materialistic Babylonia, and they preferred to remain in comfort rather than to exert themselves and suffer the hardships of traveling across a forbidding terrain to a land absolutely desolate. But the remnant of faithful Jews that returned were eager to obey Jehovah’s command. They were zealous for true worship at the place where he had put his name. They wanted to get away from unclean Babylon in order to be clean to bear Jehovah’s sacred vessels of worship back to the site of his holy temple.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isa. 52:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Jer. 50:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965684/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 51:6</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Cyrus appointed Sheshbazzar as governor of the returning Jews and entrusted him with the delivering of the sacred utensils.

Every year of its lying desolate was the equivalent of a sabbath year according to Jehovah’s law through Moses.

Well, it was in the seventh month of the year of Jerusalem’s destruction that the land of Judah was left completely desolate by the flight of the poor Jews who had not been deported by Nebuchadnezzar. In the seventh month they fled, taking the prophet Jeremiah with them down to Egypt.

<strong>When Did Babylon Desolate Jerusalem?</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">When the Israelites were able to return to Judah and Jerusalem, that desolation ended.

The <span id="page290" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="290" data-before-text="290"></span>secular elements of today’s worldwide system of things will look at the vacuum that she as well as the rest of Babylon the Great has left, but her they will see no more during the brief time before those secular elements are themselves annihilated in the worldwide “great tribulation” in which the whole system comes to a violent end. Christendom never did correctly put God’s name before those secular elements. Necessarily, then, in view of what the anointed Ezekiel class have long proclaimed world wide, those secular elements will have to come to the knowledge prescribed for them in the repeatedly stated formula: “They will have to know that I am Jehovah.”</p>

<strong>Cyrus</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">By this victory Cyrus brought to an end the domination of Mesopotamia and the Near East by Semitic rulers and produced the first dominant world power of Aryan origin. The Cyrus Cylinder, a cuneiform document historians consider to have been written for publication in Babylon, is strongly religious <span id="page410" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="410" data-before-text="410"></span>and in it Cyrus is represented as ascribing the credit for his victory to Marduk the chief god of Babylon, saying: “He [Marduk] scanned and looked (through) all the countries, searching for a righteous ruler willing to lead him (in the annual procession). (Then) he pronounced the name of Cyrus, king of Anshan, declared him (literally: pronounced [his] name) to be(come) the ruler of all the world. . . . Marduk, the great lord, a protector of his people/worshipers, beheld with pleasure his good deeds and his upright mind (and therefore) ordered him to march against his city Babylon. He made him set out on the road to Babylon going at his side like a real friend. His widespread troops—their number, like that of the water of a river, could not be established—strolled along, their weapons packed away. Without any battle, he made him enter his town Babylon, sparing Babylon any calamity.”—<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts</em> by James B. Pritchard, 1955, p. 315.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Despite this pagan interpretation of events, the Bible shows that, on making his proclamation authorizing the exiled Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple there, Cyrus acknowledged: “All the kingdoms of the earth Jehovah the God of the heavens has given me, and he himself has commissioned me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ezra 1:1, 2</a>) This, of course, does not mean that Cyrus became a Jewish convert but simply that he knew the Biblical facts regarding his victory. In view of the high administrative position in which Daniel was placed, both before and after the fall of Babylon (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Dan. 5:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 6:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 28</a>), it would be most unusual if Cyrus were not to be informed of the prophecies that Jehovah’s prophets had recorded and spoken, including Isaiah’s prophecy containing Cyrus’ very name. As regards the Cyrus Cylinder, quoted above, it is acknowledged that others aside from the king may have had a hand in the preparation of this cuneiform document. The book <em>Biblical Archaeology</em> by G. Ernest Wright (p. 200) speaks of “the king, or the bureau which framed the document” (compare the similar case with Darius at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Daniel 6:6-9</a>), while Dr. Emil G. Kraeling (<em>Rand McNally Bible Atlas,</em> p. 328) calls the Cyrus Cylinder “a propaganda document composed by the Babylonian priests.” It may, indeed, have been drawn up under the influence of the Babylonian clergy (see Pritchard’s <em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts,</em> p. 315, ftn. 1), thereby serving their purpose of explaining away the utter failure of Marduk (also known as Bel) and the other Babylonian gods to save the city, going even to the extent of attributing to Marduk the very things that Jehovah had done.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isaiah 46:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 47:11-15</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>CYRUS’ DECREE FOR THE RETURN OF THE JEWISH EXILES</strong></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">By his decreeing the end of the Jewish exile, Cyrus fulfilled his commission as Jehovah’s ‘anointed shepherd’ for Israel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Chron. 36:22, 23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Ezra 1:1-4</a>) The proclamation was made “in the first year of Cyrus the king of Persia,” meaning his first year as ruler toward conquered Babylon. The Bible record at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Daniel 9:1</a> refers to “the first year of Darius” and this appears to have intervened between the fall of Babylon and “the first year of Cyrus” over Babylon. This would mean that Cyrus’ first year may not have begun until late in the year 538 B.C.E. Even if Darius’ rule over Babylon were to be viewed as that of a viceroy, so that his reign ran concurrent with that of Cyrus, Babylonian custom would still place Cyrus’ first <em>regnal</em> year as running from Nisan of 538 to Nisan of 537 B.C.E.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">In view of the Bible record, Cyrus’ decree freeing the Jews to return to Jerusalem likely was made late in the year 538 or early in 537 B.C.E. This would allow time for the Jewish exiles to prepare to move out of Babylon and make the long trek to Judah and Jerusalem (a trip that could take about four months according to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ezra 7:9</a>) and yet be settled “in their cities” in Judah by the “seventh month” (Tishri) of the year 537 B.C.E. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ezra 3:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 6</a>) This marked the end of the prophesied seventy years of Judah’s desolation that began in the same month of Tishri of 607 B.C.E.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Ki. 25:22-26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 36:20, 21</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Cyrus’ cooperation with the Jews was in notable contrast with their treatment by earlier pagan rulers. He restored the precious temple utensils that Nebuchadnezzar had carried off to Babylon, gave royal permission for them to import cedar timbers from Lebanon, and authorized the outlay of funds from the king’s house to cover construction expenses. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ezra 1:7-11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 3:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/18/2" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> 6:3-5</a>) According to the Cyrus Cylinder, the Persian ruler followed a generally humane and tolerant policy toward the conquered peoples of his domain. The inscription quotes him as saying: “I returned to [certain previously named] sacred cities on the other side of the Tigris, the sanctuaries of which have been ruins for a long time, the images which (used) to live therein and established for them permanent sanctuaries. I (also) gathered all their (former) inhabitants and returned (to them) their habitations.”—<em>Ancient Near Eastern Texts</em> by James B. Pritchard, 1955, p. 316.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Aside from the royal proclamation quoted in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ezra 1:1-4</a>, the Biblical record speaks of another document by Cyrus, a “memorandum,” which was filed away in the house of the records at Ecbatana in Media and discovered there during the reign of Darius the Persian. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ezra 5:13-17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 6:1-5</a>) Concerning this second document, Professor Wright says, “[it] is explicitly entitled a <em>dikrona,</em> an official Aramaic term for a memorandum which recorded an oral decision of the king or other official and which initiated administrative action. It was never intended for publication but solely for the eye of the proper official, following which it was filed away in governmental archives.”—<em>Biblical Archaeology,</em> p. 200.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>DEATH, SUCCESSOR, AND PROPHETIC SIGNIFICANCE</strong></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Cyrus is believed to have fallen in battle about 530 B.C.E., though the accounts are somewhat obscure. Prior to his death, his son Cambyses evidently became coregent with him, succeeding to the Persian throne as sole ruler when his father died.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">The prophecies concerning the sudden fall of symbolical “Babylon the Great” as set forth in the book of Revelation parallel in major respects the description of Cyrus’ conquest of the literal city of Babylon. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Revelation 16:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 18:7, 8</a> with <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Isaiah 44:27, 28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 47:8, 9</a>.) The king at the head of the mighty military forces described immediately after the account of symbolic Babylon’s fall, however, is no earthly king but the heavenly “Word of God,” Jehovah’s true anointed Shepherd, Christ Jesus.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Rev. 19:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011074/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 11-16</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb"></p>

In the year 537 B.C.E., the seventieth year of the desolation of Jerusalem and its temple, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus to decree that the temple should be rebuilt at Jerusalem. To that end Cyrus decreed that the exiles in Babylon who would volunteer for this temple work should be released from Babylon and go back to “the mountain of the house of Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972921/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Chron. 36:20-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972921/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Ezra 1:1-4</a>) By the end of that seventieth year of Jerusalem’s desolation a faithful remnant of temple-work volunteers were back in the land of Judah, bringing to an end its desolation.

As God’s minister, Cyrus let the faithful remnant of Jews return to Jerusalem to build the temple and reestablish Jehovah’s worship there. In his decree of liberation Cyrus said concerning Jehovah God: “He himself has commissioned me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962881/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Chron. 36:22, 23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962881/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ezra 1:1-4</a>) To this extent Cyrus was “God’s minister,” not, of course, that Cyrus was now a converted Jew. Twelve years later the returned Jews had to force an investigation of the official government records to relieve themselves of the obstruction of their temple work by their enemies round about. The investigation turned out favorably, the Persian government told the obstructors to stop, and so in four years’ time God’s people completed his temple.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962881/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezra 5:17 to 6:15</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 6.

<strong>Subjection to the Higher Powers</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Clergymen who insist that political powers of this world are the higher authorities to which we are to be subject bring forward certain scriptures to bolster their argument. They quote Daniel’s words in interpreting the dream to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon: “Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory. And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all.” And on the night that Babylon fell to the Persian conqueror Cyrus, Daniel said to King Belshazzar: “O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour: and for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950841/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Dan. 2:37, 38;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950841/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 5:18, 19</a>) In harmony with this Jehovah God told the Israelites by the prophet Jeremiah: “And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon”; and he told the Israelites to go out and yield themselves in subjection to the king of Babylon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950841/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Jer. 27:5-13,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950841/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 17</a>) Then, too, there are the words of Cyrus the conqueror of Babylon: “Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath Jehovah, the God of heaven, given me; and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950841/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Chron. <span id="page444" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="444" data-before-text="444"></span>36:22, 23</a>, <em>AS;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950841/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ezra 1:1, 2</a>) Do not these scriptures prove that the political powers of this world of today draw their authority from Jehovah God and are ordained by him?</p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">17.

In destroying Jerusalem in 607 B.C. and taking the Jews captive to Babylon Nebuchadnezzar was being used as Jehovah’s executioner against the unfaithful Jewish nation. For this reason Jehovah spoke of him as “my servant” and gave him the domination over other nations of this world. In this capacity Nebuchadnezzar was a type of Jesus Christ. God uses Christ as his executioner of vengeance against Jerusalem’s modern counterpart, Christendom, and God also gives him the domination over all the nations of this world before destroying them at the battle of Armageddon. In conquering Babylon and restoring the exiled Jews to Palestine to rebuild the temple at Jerusalem Cyrus king of Persia was also used as a type. For this reason Jehovah God gave the kingdoms of this world into the hand of Cyrus. This prefigured that God would use Jesus Christ to destroy the Devil’s organization, mystic Babylon, and would use him to restore Jehovah’s witnesses to the pure and free worship of God in this “time of the end” of the world and would make him ruler over all the earth.</p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">18, 19. How, therefore, does this prove political governments are not the “superior authorities”, and how far do we obey them?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> It cannot be said of the other political powers and authorities of this world that they were types of Christ as God’s Chief Servant and that therefore God gave such political powers their authority. Certainly Caesar’s government in killing the Son of God and thereafter persecuting his faithful followers was not a type of Christ’s government authorized by God. Jesus told the Roman government: “You would have no authority at all against me unless it had been granted to you from above. This is why the man that handed me over to you has greater sin.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950841/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">John 19:11</a>, <em>NW</em>) But God did not approve of the Roman government for executing Jesus at Calvary. Neither did he hold it without sin for doing so. Likewise he does not authorize and give approval to political governments of today in persecuting the Christian witnesses of Jehovah.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> The political powers of this world are, therefore, not the “superior authorities” to whom Christian souls are to be subject in every demand they make. Every law and statute that is in harmony with righteousness the true Christians will obey in an exemplary fashion. But any law and demand made in conflict with the superior laws and commandments of God they will not obey, for that would mean to render to “Caesar” what belongs to God.</p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">20. How did Jesus’ apostles take this same position, and why?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> Jesus’ apostles took this position. In their day the Jewish Sánhedrin at Jerusalem was charged with certain judicial and legal functions by Caesar’s government. But it was not for this reason part of the “superior authorities” among Jesus’ followers. Jesus had separated his disciples from the natural Israelites and had formed them into a spiritual Israel, “the Israel of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950841/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Gal. 6:16</a>) So the Jewish Sánhedrin was no longer a governing body among God’s true people, but was an alien governmental body now. Its being a religious body <span id="page445" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="445" data-before-text="445"></span>of priests and clergymen added nothing to its power over Jewish Christians. So when it demanded of the apostles that they stop preaching Jesus Christ to the people at Jerusalem, Peter and John answered the Sánhedrin: “Whether it is righteous in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, make your decision. But as for us, we cannot stop speaking about the things we have seen and heard.” A second time before the Sánhedrin for refusing to obey their court order, Peter and the other apostles replied: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men. The God of our forefathers raised up Jesus, . . . And we are witnesses of these matters, and so is the holy spirit which God has given to those obeying him as ruler.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950841/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Acts 4:19, 20 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950841/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Ac 5:29-32</a>, <em>NW</em>) But for this refusal to obey the anti-God order of the Jewish Supreme Court Peter and the other apostles could not be accused of being anarchists or subversive. God gave them and not the Sánhedrin his holy spirit, thus showing whom he approved and authorized.</p>

Assisted by sympathetic Israelites who could not then conveniently leave Babylon, 42,360 Israelites responded to Jehovah’s outpoured spirit and became alive to the opportunity to repeople the hills, mountains and valleys of the soil of Israel, rebuild Jerusalem and its temple and restore Jehovah’s worship there, to the glory of his name internationally. More than 7,500 non-Israelite slaves and professional singers accepted the privilege to go with them for the united service of Jehovah.

<strong>Archaelogy</strong><br/><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Abundant evidence has been found of Babylon’s pantheon of gods, including the chief god Marduk, commonly referred to later as Bel, and the god Nebo, both mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 46:1, 2</a>. Much of the information on Nebuchadnezzar’s own inscriptions deals with his vast building program that made Babylon <span id="page108" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="108" data-before-text="108"></span>such a magnificent city. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Daniel 4:30</a>.) The name of his successor Amel-Marduk (called Evil-merodach at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Kings 25:27</a>) appears on a vase discovered at Susa (Elam).</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Near modern Baghdad excavations in the latter half of the nineteenth century produced numerous clay tablets and cylinders, including the now famous Nabunaid Chronicle. All objections to the record at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Daniel chapter 5</a> as to Belshazzar’s ruling in Babylon at the time of its fall were dispelled by this document, which proved that Belshazzar, eldest son of Nabonidus, was coregent of his father and that in the latter part of his reign Nabonidus entrusted the government of Babylon to his son Belshazzar.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Ur, the ancient home of Abraham (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Gen. 11:28-31</a>), similarly proved to have been a prominent metropolis with a highly developed civilization. A Sumerian city, it was located on the Euphrates near the Persian Gulf. Excavations there by Sir Leonard Woolley indicate that it was at the height of its power and prestige at the time of Abraham’s departure for Canaan. (Before 1943 B.C.E.) Its ziggurat temple is the best preserved of those found. The royal tombs of Ur yielded an abundance of gold objects and jewelry of very high artistic caliber; also musical instruments, such as the harp. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Genesis 4:21</a>.) A small steel (not merely iron) ax was also found. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Genesis 4:22</a>.) Here, too, thousands of clay tablets revealed much of the details of life nearly four thousand years in the past. As a result of these discoveries, Woolley expressed himself thus: “We must radically alter our view of the Hebrew patriarch [Abraham] when we see that his earlier years were passed in such sophisticated surroundings.”—See UR.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">At the site Of ancient Sippar on the Euphrates about twenty miles (32 kilometers) from Baghdad, a clay cylinder of King Cyrus the conqueror of Babylon was found. Cyrus, whose conquest is also described in the Nabunaid Chronicle, recounts his easy capture of the city and also outlines his policy of restoring to their native lands the captive peoples residing in Babylon, thus harmonizing with the Biblical account of Cyrus as the prophesied conqueror of Babylon and of the restoration of the Jews to Palestine during Cyrus’ reign.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa. 44:28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 45:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 2 Chron. 36:23</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="ss"><strong><em>Assyria</em></strong></p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">At Khorsabad, on a northern tributary of the Tigris River, in 1843 the palace of Assyrian King Sargon II, covering some twenty-five acres (10 hectares), was discovered and subsequent archaeological work there brought this king, mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isaiah 20:1</a>, out of secular obscurity to a position of historical prominence. In one of his annals he describes the capture of Samaria (740 B.C.E.) as an outstanding point of his reign. He also records the capture of Ashdod, described at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Isaiah 20:1</a>. Once considered nonexistent by many prominent scholars, Sargon II is now one of the best known of the kings of Assyria.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">Nineveh, Assyria’s capital, was the site of excavations that unearthed the immense palace of Sennacherib, containing some seventy-one rooms with sculptured slabs lining 9,880 feet (3,011 meters) of the walls, one depicting Judean prisoners being led into captivity following the fall of Lachish in 732 B.C.E. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:13-17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 32:9</a>) Of even greater interest, here at Nineveh (modern Kuyunjik) were the annals of Sennacherib found recorded on prisms (clay cylingers). On one prism Sennacherib describes the Assyrian campaign against Palestine in Hezekiah’s reign (732 B.C.E.), but, notably, the boastful monarch makes no claim of having taken the city, thus confirming the Bible account. (See SENNACHERIB.) The account of Sennacherib’s assassination at the hands of his sons is also recorded on an inscription of Esar-haddon, Sennacherib’s successor, and referred to in an inscription of the following king, Ashurbanipal. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Ki. 19:37</a>) In addition to the mention of King Hezekiah by Sennacherib, the names of Judean Kings Ahaz and Manasseh, and the names of Israelite Kings Omri, Jehu, Menahem and Hoshea, and also Hazael of Damascus, all appear on cuneiform records Of various Assyrian emperors.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="ss"><strong><em>Persia</em></strong></p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">Near Behistun, Iran (ancient Persia), King Darius I (521-485 B.C.E.; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ezra 6:1-15</a>) had an immense inscription carved high up on a limestone cliff, describing his unification of the Persian Empire and attributing his success to his god Ahura Mazda. Of primary value is the fact that the inscription was recorded in three languages, Babylonian (Akkadian), “Elamite” and old Persian, thus serving as a key for the deciphering of the Assyro-Babylonian cuneiform, till then undeciphered. Thousands of clay tablets and inscriptions in the Babylonian language can now be read as a result of this work.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">Shushan, the scene of the events recorded in the book of Esther, was excavated by French archaeologists between 1880 and 1890. The royal palace of Xerxes, covering some two and a half acres (about one hectare), was uncovered, revealing the splendor and magnificence of the Persian kings. The finds confirmed the exactitude of details set down by the writer of Esther as relating to the administration of the Persian kingdom and the construction of the palace. The book <em>The Monuments and the Old Testament</em> (1925) by Ira Price (p. 408) comments: “There is no event described in the Old Testament whose structural surroundings can be so vividly and accurately restored from actual excavations as ‘Shushan the Palace.’”</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="ss"><strong><em>Mari and Nuzi</em></strong></p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">The ancient royal city of Mari (Tell Hariri) on the Euphrates River, some 150 miles (240 kilometers) above the town of Hit, was the site of excavations from 1933 on. An enormous palace covering some fifteen acres (6.1 hectares) and containing three hundred rooms was discovered, and its archives yielded more than twenty thousand clay tablets. The palace complex included not only the royal apartments but also administrative offices and a school for scribes. Great mural paintings or frescoes decorated many of the walls, the bathrooms were equipped with tubs, and cake molds were found in the kitchens. The city appears to have been one of the most outstanding and brilliant of the period in the early second millennium B.C.E. The texts on the clay tablets included royal decrees, public notices, accounts, orders for construction of canals, locks, dams and other irrigation projects as well as correspondence concerning imports and exports and foreign affairs. Frequent censuses were taken involving taxation and military enrollment. Religion was prominent, particularly <span id="page109" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="109" data-before-text="109"></span>the worship of Ishtar, the goddess of fertility, whose temple was also found. Divination was practiced as in Babylon, by observation of livers, astronomy and similar methods. The city was largely destroyed by Babylonian King Hammurabi. Of particular interest was the appearance of the names of Peleg, Serug, Nahor, Terah and Haran, all listed as cities of northern Mesopotamia and reflecting the names of the relatives of Abraham.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010347/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Gen. 11:17-32</a>.</p>
