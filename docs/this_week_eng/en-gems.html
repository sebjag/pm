<strong>Broom Tree</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Because the roots of the broom tree are bitter and nauseating, some have suggested that the reference by <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000829/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job (30:4</a>) to these as being used for food by persons starving in barren desolation perhaps refers to an edible parasitic plant (<em>Cynomorium coccineum</em>) that grows like a fungus on these roots. While this may be the case, it is also possible that another variety of this plant existed in Job’s day (over 3,000 years ago) rather than just the present white broom tree (<em>Retama raetam</em>) that now grows. Presenting another viewpoint regarding <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000829/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 30:4</a>, N. Hareuveni wrote: “Since, unlike the leaves of the saltplant, roots of the broom are totally inedible in any form, it is obvious that Job is speaking of white broom roots made into something that can be sold to <em>earn</em> one’s bread. These young men who now scorn Job made embers from the roots of the white broom to sell in the marketplace.” (<em>Tree and Shrub in Our Biblical Heritage,</em> Kiryat Ono, Israel, 1984, p. 31) In harmony with this, some suggest that the vowel pointing of the Hebrew word translated “their food” be adjusted so that the Hebrew would read “to warm them.”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">[Heb., <em>mal·luʹach</em>].</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This term is mentioned only once in Scripture as a food eaten by those of little account. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003812/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 30:4</a>) The original-language word is considered to be derived from a root meaning “salt,” and it has also been translated “salt-wort” (<em>AS, AT, Da</em>), “cress” (<em>Fn</em>), “grass” (<em>Dy</em>), and “mallow(s)” (<em>KJ, Le, RS</em>). The rendering “mallows” appears to have resulted from the similarity between the Hebrew word <em>mal·luʹach</em> and the Greek word <em>mo·loʹkhe,</em> which is believed to be related to the English designation “mallow.” However, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003812/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 30:4</a> the translators of the Greek <em>Septuagint</em> did not use <em>mo·loʹkhe</em> but <em>haʹli·ma</em> (“salt herbs,” <em>LXX,</em> Bagster), and <em>haʹli·ma,</em> like <em>mal·luʹach,</em> is thought to refer either to the salty taste of the plant or to the region where it grows.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The plant most frequently suggested as corresponding to the <em>mal·luʹach</em> of the Bible is sea purslane or shrubby orache (<em>Atriplex halimus</em>). Ordinarily this bushy shrub grows 1 to 2 m (3 to 6.5 ft) high. The plant has small, thick, sour-tasting leaves, and in the spring, it bears tiny purple flowers. It grows in saline soil.</p>

<strong>Brooch</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When the Israelites were granted the privilege of contributing toward the construction of the tabernacle, the men and women brought various ornaments including “brooches” or “buckles.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010816/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex. 35:21, 22</a>) These brooches were evidently hooked ornaments of some type, for the same Hebrew word used for them (<em>hhahh</em>) is rendered “hook(s)” elsewhere.

When touched, the tips of the hairs break off, and the sharp broken ends penetrate the skin, causing the liquid to enter the wound. At least four varieties of nettles are known to exist in Palestine, the most common being the Roman nettle (<em>Urtica pilulifera</em>), which can attain a height of 1.8 m (6 ft) and is especially found amid ruins.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Hebrew terms <em>cha·rulʹ</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003240/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Pr 24:31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003240/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Zep 2:9</a>) and <em>qim·mohsʹ</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003240/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa 34:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003240/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Ho 9:6</a>) are applied to plants that take over neglected fields and ruins. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003240/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 30:7</a>, the reference to <em>cha·rulʹ</em> suggests tall plants. Another Hebrew word <em>sir·padhʹ</em> (“brier,” <em>KJ;</em> “nettle,” <em>Ro;</em> “stinging nettle,” <em>NW</em>) is contrasted with myrtle.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003240/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa 55:13</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003240/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 24:31</a> a form of the word <em>qim·mohsʹ</em> (“thistles,” <em>AT;</em> “thorns,” <em>KJ;</em> “weeds,” <em>NW</em>) is viewed by some as being in parallel with <em>cha·rulʹ.</em> Therefore some scholars think <em>qim·mohsʹ</em> denotes weeds generally; others believe that <em>cha·rulʹ</em> may be a generic term applying to brush. The translating of <em>cha·rulʹ</em> as “nettles” in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003240/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 30:7</a> has also been questioned by some on the basis that people would not voluntarily seek shelter under nettles. In a waterless region, though, people might well avail themselves of the shade of tall nettles or, because of hunger, be found gathering these plants for food. So the rendering is appropriate.</p>

<strong>Brick</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Bricks varied considerably in size and shape. In Egypt the rectangular shape was common, and wedge-shaped bricks were used in the construction of arches. Egyptian bricks were approximately 14 to 20 inches (36 to 51 centimeters) in length, 6 to 9 inches (15 to 23 centimeters) in width and 4 to 7 inches (10 to 18 centimeters) in thickness. In Babylonia, square, oblong triangular and wedge-shaped bricks have been found. However, brick of later periods, as that from the time of Nebuchadnezzar, was generally <span id="page261" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="261" data-before-text="261"></span>square-shaped, measuring about a foot (.3 meter) across.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The Hebrew word for “brick” appears to be derived from a root meaning “to be white,” suggesting that, in their natural state, bricks were whitish in color and hence made from light-colored clay. The Assyrians, Babylonians and other ancient peoples at times enameled or painted their bricks various colors. At Babylon, blue enameled bricks, and fragments of brick covered with a yellow glaze, have been found. An interesting example of the use of painted bricks by the Assyrians is the ziggurat at Khorsabad. The indications are that, starting from the bottom, its seven stories were consecutively painted white, black, red, white, reddish orange, silver and gold.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Isaiah’s reference to Israel’s making sacrificial smoke upon the bricks may have reference to the pavement of the place for offering sacrifice, or the roof tiles.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010810/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 65:3</a>.</p>

<strong>Osprey</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One of the “flying creatures” decreed as unclean and not to be eaten, according to the Law covenant. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013270/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Lev. 11:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013270/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Deut. 14:12</a>) Its Hebrew name (<em>peʹres</em>) literally means “the breaker.” Understanding this to refer to the breaking of bones by a bird of prey, the <em>Authorized Version</em> renders <em>peʹres</em> as “ossifrage,” a name deriving from Latin and meaning “bone-breaker.” However, ossifrage in English is rather indefinite, since the name has been variously applied to three distinct birds: the lammergeier or bearded vulture, the giant petrel, and the osprey. The <span id="page1258" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1258" data-before-text="1258"></span>English name osprey, in fact, comes from ossifrage via the Old French <em>osfrai.</em> Others understand the Hebrew name to indicate a bird “tearing its prey” apart, and hence not necessarily denoting a breaker of bones.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The osprey, often called the “fish hawk,” appears to be related to the falcons and hawks but with certain distinct features, including feet with some similarity to those of the owl. The osprey’s head and beak resemble those of the hawk, the body and wings are dark brown above and the underparts are white with streaks of brown. Measuring about two and a half feet (.8 meter) in length, it has a wingspan of nearly six feet (1.8 meters). The osprey is found throughout the world, living near large bodies of water, where it feeds on fish that swim near the surface. The bird glides almost effortlessly above the water, wheeling gracefully and hovering until it locates its prey. Then it plunges swiftly downward, striking the water forcefully feet first, at times disappearing beneath the surface. It is admirably equipped for this type of attack, having dense compact plumage on its underparts to withstand some of the impact of hitting the water, and long, curved, very sharp claws that extend out from rough toes, enabling the bird to get a firm grip on its slippery prey. Observers say that, in flying with the fish to shore to devour it, the osprey always grips the fish so that its head faces forward, thereby reducing air resistance. In Palestine the osprey appears particularly along the Mediterranean coast.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Other suggestions for the bird designated by the Hebrew <em>peʹres</em> include the sea eagle (distinct from the osprey), and the lammergeier, a vulture known to carry bones and tortoises to some height and then drop them on rocks in order to break them open.</p>

Of course, he would see women in daily life and would likely help them if they needed assistance. But as to being attentive in the sense of pursuing romantic objectives, that was off-limits. Before his trials began, he had been a man of great wealth, “the greatest of all the Orientals.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000802/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Job 1:3</a>) He did not, however, use the power of wealth to attract many women.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● What did Job mean in saying that he had made a covenant with his eyes and so was not attentive to a virgin?</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This verse, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978934/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 31:1</a>, reads: “A covenant I have concluded with my eyes. So how could I show myself attentive to a virgin?” Job meant that in his determination to keep integrity with God he had resolved to avoid even gazing lustfully at a woman other than his wife.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Job and his wife had had a number of children. Despite a difficult period when his wife of many years urged him to curse God and die, he was faithful to her. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978934/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 2:9, 10</a>) There is no evidence that he ever departed from monogamy or even toyed with the prospect of indulging in sex with younger women, virgins.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978934/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 19:17</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Job recognized that immorality often starts by looking with lust on a person of the opposite sex, this creating a desire in the heart for immoral sex. So he made as if a formal contract or covenant with his own eyes. To what end? He firmly resolved not to look with passion at another woman. Naturally, he would see women in daily life and might even be attentive in helping such if they needed aid. But as regards being attentive with flirtatious or romantic motives, that was off limits. It was forbidden to him. Undoubtedly Job’s ‘covenant with his eyes’ helped him to avoid any passion-stimulating looking that could lead to immoral conduct.​—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978934/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 31:9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978934/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978934/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Matthew 5:28</a>.</p>

<strong>What’s the Harm in Flirting?</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">But the mere fact that flirting may be called fun does not make it beneficial or wholesome.

So how could I show myself attentive to a virgin?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101991327/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 31:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101991327/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 9-11</a>) In effect, Job made a contract with himself that he would control his eyes and never flirtatiously glance at an unmarried woman. Why? Because Job was a married man. Indulging in petty flirtations would have been inappropriate, a disloyalty to his wife. At the very least, it could have aroused wrong desires and expectations. Job therefore avoided flirting.</p>

It usually consisted of a horizontal beam, or bar, that pivoted on a peg at its center. A pan hung from each end of the bar. The object being weighed was put in one pan and a weight in the other. God’s people were to use honest scales and weights.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010848/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 11:1</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> When the godly man Job was suffering under satanic attack, he said: “[Jehovah] will weigh me in accurate scales and God will get to know my integrity.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010848/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 31:6</a>) In that regard, Job mentioned a number of situations that could put an integrity keeper to the test.

<strong>Why Keep Your Integrity?</strong><br/><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> We see that integrity enables us to take our stand for Jehovah’s sovereignty. It is thus the basis on which God can judge us. Job well understood this truth. (<em>Read</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008920/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b"><em>Job 31:6</em></a><em>.</em>) Job knew that God weighs all mankind in “accurate scales,” using His perfect standard of justice to gauge our integrity. David similarly said: “Jehovah himself will pass sentence on the peoples. Judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousness and according to my integrity in me. . . . And God as righteous is testing out heart and kidneys.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008920/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 7:8, 9</a>) We know that God can look into the very depths of the inner person, the figurative “heart and kidneys.” We need to remember, though, what he is looking for. As David said, Jehovah judges us according to our integrity.</p>

His example can be of great encouragement to us today, especially when Satan the Devil is trying desperately to break the integrity of all who are serving God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:8</a>) Recognizing this, the disciple James said to “take as a pattern of the suffering of evil and the exercising of patience the prophets,” in particular Job. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">James 5:10, 11</a>) But who can imitate Job’s integrity? Can we?

But when <span id="page16" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>Jehovah granted Satan’s request and removed the hedge of protection from around Job, nothing Satan could do could break Job’s integrity to God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 1:1–2:10</a>) Job thereby provided an answer to Satan’s taunt that he could turn anybody away from serving God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 27:11</a>) By his integrity-keeping course Job was, in effect, declaring to the entire universe, ‘Satan, you are a despicable liar, because Jehovah is my God, and I shall keep integrity to him come what may!’​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 27:5</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>Those Like Job</strong></p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 3.

There in heaven, hedged about by Jehovah’s protective care, was the promised “seed” by means of whom God intended to accomplish His grand purposes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a>) Yet, when stripped of ‘the hedge of protection,’ would this one really imitate Job’s integrity? Would he demonstrate that a perfect man, as Adam had been, could keep <em>perfect</em> integrity to God? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>) Satan made preparations for putting this “seed” to the severest test whenever He would make His appearance on earth.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 4.

(b) What did Jesus provide for Jehovah?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Jesus Christ proved to be the sent-forth “seed” from heaven. He thus became the focus of Satan’s attention, yes, the principal object of Satan’s hostility. In evidence that Jehovah had removed his hedge of protective care, Christ cried out while on the torture stake: “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matthew 27:46;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Psalm 22:1</a>) Although keenly sensing that God had withdrawn his protection, Jesus, like Job, “did not sin or ascribe anything improper to God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 1:22</a>) He imitated Job, keeping <em>perfect</em> integrity to God, and thereby proved that ‘there was no one like him in the earth.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Job 1:8</a>) In Jesus, therefore, Jehovah God has a complete and everlasting answer to Satan’s false accusation that God cannot put on earth a man who will stay faithful to him under the greatest trial.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 5.

(b) What did Satan do when removed from heaven?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Yet wanting still more of an answer, Satan keeps accusing Jesus’ spiritual brothers, who, along with Jesus, make up the “seed” of God’s womanlike organization. When describing the Kingdom’s establishment in heaven, the Bible says regarding Satan: “The accuser of our brothers has been hurled down, who accuses them day and night before our God!” However, Satan does more than accuse, he mounts a hostile attack! The Bible explains that after his ouster from heaven, “the dragon [Satan] grew wrathful at the woman, and went off to wage war with the remaining ones of her seed, who observe the commandments of God and have the work of bearing witness to Jesus.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Revelation 12:7-12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 17</a>.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 6.

They spearhead “the work of bearing witness to Jesus,” publicly declaring worldwide that he is now enthroned as King and will soon bring this unrighteous system of things to its end. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Daniel 2:44</a>) But they are far from being alone! Now a vast crowd of over three million people have joined them to form a united, worldwide, integrity-keeping organization. All these integrity keepers, too, have become objects of Satan’s relentless persecution, and their <span id="page17" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>heavenly Father Jehovah takes delight in their integrity.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Proverbs 27:11</a>.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 7. Why can we be confident in the face of Satan’s attacks?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Surely, it is sobering to realize that, as Satan’s vicious attention was focused on Job, so it is upon us who are trying to keep integrity to God. However, we need not be distraught. Why? Because “Jehovah is very tender in affection and merciful” and “will neither desert you nor leave you entirely.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">James 5:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Deuteronomy 31:6</a>) Yes, Jehovah will uphold us. “For those walking in integrity he is a shield,” the Bible says. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:7</a>) This does not mean, though, that Jehovah will not allow us to be tested. He will, even as he did with Job. “But God is faithful,” the apostle Paul noted, “and he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear, but along with the temptation he will also make the way out in order for you to be able to endure it.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>When Under Trial</strong></p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 8.

Job suffered so much that he wished to die and be concealed in Sheol, the common grave of mankind. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 14:13</a>) Some today have felt similarly, saying that they could identify with Job when he was suffering so much. Perhaps on occasion you have felt that way too. Indeed, reading <span id="page18" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>about his sufferings can be like receiving encouragement from a friend who has undergone a trial even more severe than our own. Knowing that someone else has endured, <em>and understands,</em> surely helps us also to endure.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 9.

Those who were there will remember how good it felt to be in the company of so many whose principal aim in life is to maintain integrity to God. What encouragement to keep integrity it was for those in attendance to know that the many thousands around them​—while at their places of employment or at school in their own communities—​were also keeping integrity under trialsome tests!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:9</a>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">10.

A person suffering greatly, and who is in a depressed state of mind, may say, ‘Oh, why does God do this to me? Why does he permit this to occur?’ The person may even get to the point of asking, ‘What’s the use in serving God?’ Not realizing the source of his suffering, Job questioned the present benefit of being righteous, since the good appeared to suffer as much, if not more, than the bad. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Job 9:22</a>) According to Elihu, Job said: “What does it profit me?

And if your revolts actually increase, what do you do to him?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Job 35:6</a>) Yes, if you try to spite God by abandoning his ways or his service, you are only hurting yourself, not God.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">12.

Of course, God is delighted if we keep integrity, yet, at the same time, he is in no way <em>dependent</em> upon our worship, as was indicated by what Elihu asked Job: “If you are really in the right, what do you give him, or what does he receive from your own hand?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Job 35:7</a>) God gave us life, and because of him we breathe and move and <span id="page19" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>exist.

Like Job, we may not have intentionally said or done anything wrong. Our motive may have been good. But we may have spoken without full knowledge, with a lack of understanding or sensitivity. Perhaps our comments reflected an air of racial or national superiority, or a Scripturally unsupported rigidity on a matter. It may be brought to our attention that what we have said reflects more our own personal viewpoint and that it has hurt others to the extent of jeopardizing their spirituality. When corrected, will we, like Job, acknowledge that we ‘spoke without understanding’ and “make a retraction”?​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Job 42:3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/32/1" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> 6</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>Trusting God, Not Riches</strong></p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">15.

Where are we placing our trust​—in Jehovah or in material possessions? If we were weighed in accurate scales, as Job desired to be, would God get to know our integrity in this matter? Is our chief concern in life really that of providing Jehovah an integrity-keeping course with which to answer Satan’s taunts? Or are we particularly concerned with satisfying our desires for pleasures and possessions? How fine if we can be like Job and make Jehovah’s heart glad by trusting in Him, and not place any undue importance on ourselves or on the material things that are available! If we trust in Jehovah, putting his interests first, he promises never to leave us or forsake us.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Matthew 6:31-33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/36/1" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> Hebrews 13:5, 6</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong>Sexual Morality</strong></p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">17.

It is indeed a challenge, especially in this sex-mad world where immorality is so prevalent. But think how fine, when called to account, to be able to say confidently as did Job: “God will get to know my integrity”!​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986165/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Job 31:6</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong>What Can Help Us</strong></p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">19.

Picture him, his head bowed, shoulders slumped, alone, barely able to summon the energy to shoo away the flies that buzzed around him. Sitting amid ashes to signify his mourning, he could only scrape his diseased skin with a shard of pottery. He had lost so much, had fallen so far! His friends, neighbors, and relatives had abandoned him. People, even children, mocked him. He thought that his God, Jehovah, had turned against him as well, but he was wrong about that.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502019375/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 2:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502019375/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 19:18,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502019375/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 22</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"></span>This was Job.

Job’s story can bring you great comfort. It can also give you insight into a quality that every faithful servant of God needs—integrity. Humans show integrity when they are so completely devoted to God that they continue to do his will even in the face of hardship. Let Job teach us more.</p><h2 id="p6" data-pid="6"><strong>What Job Did Not Know</strong></h2><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"></span>There is reason to believe that some time after Job died, the faithful man Moses wrote down the story of Job’s life. Under divine inspiration, Moses was able to reveal not only the events on earth that affected Job but also some events that unfolded in heaven.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"></span>At the beginning of the account, we find Job leading a full and happy life. He was prosperous, a man well-known and respected in the land of Uz—possibly in northern Arabia. He shared freely with those in need and championed the cause of the helpless. Job and his wife were blessed with ten children. Above all, Job was a spiritual man. He eagerly sought to please Jehovah, much as his distant relatives Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph had done. Like such patriarchs, Job acted as a priest for his family, regularly offering up sacrifices in behalf of his children.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502019375/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 1:1-5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502019375/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 31:16-22</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"></span>Suddenly, though, the scene shifts in Job’s story. We get a glimpse into heaven, and we learn things that Job could not have known. Jehovah’s faithful angels were gathered before God, and the rebel angel Satan entered. Jehovah knew that Satan despised the righteous man Job, so God addressed Satan, pointing out Job’s outstanding integrity. Satan boldly replied: “Is it for nothing that Job has feared God? Have you not put up a protective hedge around him and his house and everything he has?” Satan hates people of integrity. When they show such wholehearted devotion to Jehovah God, they expose Satan for the loveless traitor that he is. So Satan insisted that Job served God only for selfish reasons. If Job were to lose everything, Satan asserted, the man would curse Jehovah to his face!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502019375/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 1:6-11</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"></span>Job could not know it, but Jehovah had entrusted him with a great privilege: Prove Satan wrong. Satan was allowed to rob Job of all that he had. Only the man himself he was not to touch. So Satan eagerly set about his sadistic work. In a single day, a series of terrible blows rained down on Job. He learned that his livestock—first his cattle and donkeys, then his sheep, and then his camels—were suddenly wiped out. Worse, the servants who tended them were killed. In the case of one group, the cause was reported to Job as “fire from God”—possibly lightning. Before Job could even contemplate the loss of human lives or the poverty he now faced, the heaviest blow landed. His ten children were gathered together in the home of the oldest when a sudden windstorm struck the house, destroying it and killing them all!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502019375/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 1:12-19</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"></span>It is hard, perhaps impossible, to imagine how Job felt. He ripped apart his clothes, cut off his hair, and collapsed to the ground. Job concluded that God had given to him and God had taken from him. Indeed, Satan had cleverly made it look as if God had sent those disasters. Nonetheless, Job did not curse his God as Satan had predicted. Rather, Job said: “Let the name of Jehovah continue to be praised.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/502019375/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 1:20-22</a>.</p><img src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/ijwia/2020/56" data-img-small-src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/ijwia/2020/57" alt="Job, his wife, and children enjoy a happy life; Satan enters in among a gathering of faithful angels in heaven" width="300" height="168" class="south_center" />

Apparently this official directed any serious complaints concerning the districts under his jurisdiction to the king and then waited for royal authorization to act. Also, lesser officials could request that the activities of a particular jurisdictional district be investigated.

<strong>Abaddon</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In Hebrew the word <em>ʼavad·dohnʹ</em> means “destruction” and may also refer to “the place of destruction.” It appears in the original Hebrew text a total of five times, and in four of the occurrences it is used to parallel “the burial place,” “Sheol,” and “death.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000007/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps 88:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000007/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Job 26:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000007/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 28:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000007/1/3" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> Pr 15:11</a>) The word <em>ʼavad·dohnʹ</em> in these texts evidently refers to the destructive processes that ensue with human death, and these scriptures indicate that decay or destruction takes place in Sheol, the common grave of mankind.

<strong>United Against Nations in the Valley of Decision</strong><br/><p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[96]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"><sup>27</sup></span> What do these symbolic locusts look like? John says: “And the likenesses of the locusts resembled horses prepared for battle; and upon their heads were what seemed to be crowns like gold, and their faces were as men’s faces, but they had hair as women’s hair. And their teeth were as those of lions; and they had breastplates like iron breastplates. And the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running into battle. Also, they have tails and stings like scorpions; and in their tails is their authority to hurt the men five months.” From this description we note that the remnant of Jehovah’s anointed witnesses were brought forth in 1919 for warfare, a spiritual warfare from that year till the actual outbreak of the “war of the great day of God the Almighty,” commonly called Armageddon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Rev. 16:14-16</a>) Hence they looked like horses, which in Bible times were used for warfare. “The horse <span id="page719" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="719" data-before-text="719"></span>is something prepared for the day of battle,” says <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Proverbs 21:31</a>.</p><p id="p97" data-pid="97" class="qu">28. What is denoted by the crowns on the locusts’ heads, their having hair like women, and their having breastplates like iron ones?</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[97]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="28"><sup>28</sup></span> The symbolic locusts are royal warriors, as denoted by the goldlike crowns upon the locusts’ heads; for by being anointed with God’s spirit they have been made “joint heirs with Christ” and have been assigned a crown and throne in Christ’s kingdom of a thousand years. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Rom. 8:16, 17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Luke 22:28-30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/29/2" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> Rev. 3:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/29/3" data-bid="30-4" class="b"> 21</a>) During this time of spiritual warfare with Christendom these symbolic locusts are mere humans gifted with intelligence, as denoted by their “men’s faces.” Like Hebrew warriors in the field who did not have barbershop facilities, they let their head of hair grow to the length of women’s hair, so that they had a hairy mane and looked like lions for fierceness. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 Chron. 12:8</a>) Appropriately, then, “their teeth were as those of lions,” that could devour solid food, flesh, like the strong judgment message of God’s vengeance against Christendom. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Heb. 5:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/31/1" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 3:1, 2</a>) Their hearts, the organs of love for God and for his righteousness, hence hearts that know no fear but are courageous, are well protected as if by impenetrable breastplates of iron. So they never lose love and courage.</p><p id="p98" data-pid="98" class="qu">29. How do the symbolic locusts make a terrific noise, and for how long are they authorized to torment men not having the seal?</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[98]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="29"><sup>29</sup></span> Like a huge swarm of winged locusts that are capable of flying for a thousand miles or more, they unitedly make a noise that sounds like a squadron of war chariots rattling along to the beat of many horses’ hoofs into the battle. It is a terrific sound. The symbolic locusts shout as from the house-tops and let God’s judgment message be heard over a vast distance in the territory that they cover. Fear of the enemy does not soften down their message to a mere whisper. Jehovah’s war declaration must be sounded loudly. He is responsible for the hurting of feelings that the message causes to the ones who are stung by it. For the brief time interval till Armageddon breaks out, “five months,” as it were, the symbolic locusts must use their scorpion-like tails, God’s Word, “the sword of the spirit,” and must strike men against whom God’s judgment is directed. It is not God’s time to spare feelings. His enemies have to be exposed and notified of coming judgment.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Eph. 6:17</a>.</p><p id="p99" data-pid="99" class="qu">30. Who is king over the symbolic locusts, and what do his names in Hebrew and Greek mean and show?</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[99]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="30"><sup>30</sup></span> The symbolic locusts must follow their King, Jesus Christ. John says of them: “They have over them a king, the angel of the abyss. In Hebrew his name is Abadʹdon, but in Greek he has the name Apollyon.” The resurrected heavenly Jesus Christ is the “angel of the abyss,” for he holds the “keys of death and of Haʹdes.” In the finale of the universal war of Armageddon he will bind and pitch Satan the Devil and his spirit demons into the abyss of deathlike inactivity. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Rev. 20:1-3</a>) When Jesus was on earth as a man, he was a Hebrew, and now in his capacity as Jehovah’s royal Executioner he is called by the Hebrew name Abadʹdon, which means Destruction. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Job 26:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 28:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/34/2" data-bid="35-3" class="b"> 31:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/34/3" data-bid="35-4" class="b"> 12:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/34/4" data-bid="35-5" class="b"> 14:19</a>) In the Greek in which the inspired Christian Scriptures were written his similar title is Apollyon, which means Destroyer. This name clearly shows that he comes to the throne at God’s right hand to rule first in the midst of his enemies and to destroy them in execution of Jehovah’s righteous judgment, Jehovah’s judicial decision against them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Jas. 4:12</a>.</p><p id="p100" data-pid="100" class="qu">31. (a) How, like locusts, do the Witnesses move forward, and of what quality is this indicative? (b) What keeps them united?</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[100]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="31"><sup>31</sup></span> The symbolic locusts who must proclaim the judgment message before the judgment is executed in the “low plain of the decision” have Jesus Christ as their King, but he is invisible. They have no <span id="page720" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="720" data-before-text="720"></span>visible king any more than literal locusts have: “The locusts have no king, and yet they go forth all of them divided into groups.” For the reason that they move forward in groups or swarms, they are “instinctively wise,” although being among the “smallest” things on earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Prov. 30:24,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/36/1" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 27</a>) The symbolic locusts, the anointed witnesses of Jehovah, move forward united, grouped according to their local congregations. But this is not due to any locust instinct. It is due to the heavenly wisdom imparted by God’s spirit. Also, their following their heavenly King Jesus Christ as the Leader whom God had enthroned is what keeps them united in their attack upon the men not sealed. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Rev. 7:2-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/37/1" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> 9:4</a>) Willingly, obediently, they subject themselves to his command; and this is what may also be pictured by the fact that the symbolic locusts “had hair as women’s hair,” since a woman’s long hair naturally is a sign of her subjection, a sign of having authority on her head.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/38/1" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> 15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961883/38/2" data-bid="39-3" class="b"> Ps. 110:3</a>.</p>

<strong>Materialism—A Deadly Philosophy</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Yes, Christendom’s pursuit of materialism has paved the way for the advance of the godless ideology of communism! Materialism is not based on the teachings of God-fearing men, but, rather, is in line with the teachings of the father of modern-day communism, Karl Marx. By adopting such a materialistic philosophy Christendom <span id="page134" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="134" data-before-text="134"></span>has caused people to forget God and to trust instead in material possessions, resulting in a fertile field for the spread of atheistic communism. Such a philosophy can lead only to God’s adverse judgment.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Regarding this, one wise servant of God long ago wrote: “If I have put gold as my confidence, or to gold I have said, ‘You are my trust!’ if I used to rejoice because my property was much, and because my hand had found a lot of things; . . . that too would be an error for attention by the justices, for I should have denied the true God above.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965161/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 31:24-28</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Jesus Christ, the Founder of Christianity, also recognized the danger of making material possessions one’s chief goal in life. He realized that it would cause one to become proud and selfish and to forget God. So time and again he struck right at the heart of materialism. For example, in his famous Sermon on the Mount he said:</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">“Stop storing up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break in and steal. Rather, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, . . . Observe intently the birds of heaven, because they do not sow seed or reap or gather into storehouses; still your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more than they are? . . . So never be anxious and say, ‘What are we to eat?’ or, ‘What are we to drink?’ or, ‘What are we to put on?’ For all these are the things the nations are eagerly pursuing. For your heavenly Father knows you need all these things. <em>Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you.”</em> How different Jesus’ teachings are from the popular materialistic attitude of today!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965161/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 6:19-33</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>AN UNREASONABLE PHILOSOPHY</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">But despite these words of Jesus, many people, even church members, feel it is unreasonable to put the worship of God first in their lives. They relegate it to a secondary place. Why is this so? It is because they have not really been instructed in the teachings of God’s Word, but have instead been regularly indoctrinated with materialistic philosophy. Note what the <em>Nation</em> magazine said relative to the recent shift of values in support of materialism:</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">“The shift of values inevitably has caused some strain in the American ethical consciousness. Frugality, once a virtue, is now a threat to the economy. Debt for the sake of indulgence, once impossible or sinful, now promotes prosperity. Where once greed was opposed to human welfare, we now hear that greed (both for profits and for consumers’ goods) is a public benefit. Traditional faith taught, ‘You cannot serve God and mammon’; editorialists today tell us, ‘You serve God and society best by serving mammon.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965161/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 6:24</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Yes, day in and day out the public is indoctrinated with materialism. Buy this! Buy that! Borrow money here! Practically every medium of communication constantly stresses the importance of money and material possessions. Why, even godliness and Christianity have come to be equated with material success, and this is what many are told in their churches. It is, therefore, no wonder that the public consciousness has been conditioned to think that materialism is the only reasonable philosophy of life. But is it?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Stop and think: Who made the heavens, the earth, the sea, trees, flowers, mountains, streams, birds, animals—all the things that make the earth such a pleasant place to live in? The only logical, reasonable conclusion is that given in the Bible: “Jehovah is in truth God. . . . He is the Maker of the earth by his power, the One firmly establishing the productive land by his wisdom, and the One who by his understanding <span id="page135" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="135" data-before-text="135"></span>stretched out the heavens.” “Know that Jehovah is God. It is he that has made us, and not we ourselves.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965161/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jer. 10:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965161/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965161/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Ps. 100:3</a>.</p>

<strong>The Deceptive Power of Wealth</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> Everyone must put up a constant battle to keep a good spiritual balance. If we find that we are letting material anxieties choke off our service to God, perhaps it is because we are not exercising faith. What is the remedy? Strengthen that faith. Study God’s Word; attend meetings where faith may be revived by good association and by receiving a generous share of God’s spirit. Build up a spiritual reserve by home Bible study with your family and by teaching others the truths you know, thereby demonstrating your faith. Never let your secular employment keep you from attending congregational meetings for Bible study or from attending conventions devoted to pure worship. There are other Jobs for a man of faith, and “your heavenly Father knows you need all these things.” <span id="page435" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="435" data-before-text="435"></span>The more material riches a man has the harder it is for him to accept the Scriptural truths and apply them. Such a man has a big stake in the old world; and the bigger the stake is, the harder it is to pull it up. Jesus illustrated this, saying: “It is easier for a camel to get through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to get into the kingdom of God.” Only with faith can such a person pull through.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 19:24</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>MEN OF FAITH</strong></p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">16. Why do we say it is practical to let our lives be free of the love of money?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Perhaps you say all of this sounds good, but it certainly is not practical. However, doing things the way Jehovah directs and the way his Word counsels is always the wisest and most practical. There are many outstanding examples of men of stature in the world who have found that their greatest treasure was in spiritual things. One was a man who had the best education the old world had to offer. He became what we might call the prime minister of a new nation, Israel. He was especially well known as a lawgiver and judge. He served as a special ambassador of Jehovah to a hostile nation, Egypt, and finally he came to prefigure Christ Jesus. This was Moses. His opinion on the deceptive power of wealth is expressed at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:24-26</a>: “By faith Moses, when grown up, refused to be called the son of the daughter of Pharaoh, . . . because he esteemed the reproach of the Christ as riches greater than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked intently toward the payment of the reward.” Yes, Moses made Jehovah’s interests his interests, not materialism. He had faith.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">17. Why was Job wise in not putting his trust in gold?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Another example is the case of a well-known property holder. He was a large-family man who had a tremendous cattle and livestock ranch with over 11,000 animals and many servants. Because he had such vast holdings he was called the greatest of all the Orientals. Who was it? Job. Was his faith in material things? Read his words at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 31:24-28</a>: “If I have put gold as my confidence, or to gold I have said, ‘You are my trust!’ If I used to rejoice because my property was much, and because my hand had found a lot of things . . . that too would be an error for attention by the justices, for I should have denied the true God above.” Job did not deny his Creator and, despite all the difficulties he went through because of putting his faith in God first, his latter days were more richly blessed than his youth.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">18. What did Paul consider to be the greatest riches?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Another man who testified strongly in favor of spirituality and against the deceptive power of wealth was one who was educated by some of the greatest scholars of his day. He became a leader of the early Christian organization and one of the twelve “apostles of the Lamb.” This was Paul. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 6:10</a> he described his own position: “As poor but making many rich, as having nothing and yet possessing all things.” When Paul entered the ministry he did not ask what his salary would be or what he was going to get out of it. He exercised faith in Jehovah to provide, and rejoiced that he was privileged to give so bountifully of spiritual riches to so many.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">19. Did Jesus encourage materialism?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> Finally, we have the words of the greatest man of all times, Christ Jesus, who has affected the lives of millions of people, and whose words are quoted more often than those of any living human. He stated: “Foxes have dens and birds of heaven have roosts, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay down his head.” Obviously materialism was not his way in life. To his disciples he instructed: “Do not carry a purse, nor a food pouch, nor sandals.” He knew that a workman is worthy of his hire <span id="page436" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="436" data-before-text="436"></span>and that Jehovah would provide for those serving him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Luke 9:58;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 10:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/19/2" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 7</a>) These men were among the most outstandingly successful of their time. They recognized the fleeting value of material possessions, and so chose the course leading to spiritual riches and favor with God.</p>

For your heavenly Father knows you need all these things. <em>Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you.”</em> How different Jesus’ teachings are from the popular materialistic attitude of today!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965161/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 6:19-33</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>AN UNREASONABLE PHILOSOPHY</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">But despite these words of Jesus, many people, even church members, feel it is unreasonable to put the worship of God first in their lives. They relegate it to a secondary place. Why is this so? It is because they have not really been instructed in the teachings of God’s Word, but have instead been regularly indoctrinated with materialistic philosophy. Note what the <em>Nation</em> magazine said relative to the recent shift of values in support of materialism:</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">“The shift of values inevitably has caused some strain in the American ethical consciousness. Frugality, once a virtue, is now a threat to the economy. Debt for the sake of indulgence, once impossible or sinful, now promotes prosperity. Where once greed was opposed to human welfare, we now hear that greed (both for profits and for consumers’ goods) is a public benefit. Traditional faith taught, ‘You cannot serve God and mammon’; editorialists today tell us, ‘You serve God and society best by serving mammon.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965161/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 6:24</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Yes, day in and day out the public is indoctrinated with materialism. Buy this! Buy that! Borrow money here! Practically every medium of communication constantly stresses the importance of money and material possessions. Why, even godliness and Christianity have come to be equated with material success, and this is what many are told in their churches. It is, therefore, no wonder that the public consciousness has been conditioned to think that materialism is the only reasonable philosophy of life. But is it?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Stop and think: Who made the heavens, the earth, the sea, trees, flowers, mountains, streams, birds, animals—all the things that make the earth such a pleasant place to live in? The only logical, reasonable conclusion is that given in the Bible: “Jehovah is in truth God. . . . He is the Maker of the earth by his power, the One firmly establishing the productive land by his wisdom, and the One who by his understanding <span id="page135" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="135" data-before-text="135"></span>stretched out the heavens.” “Know that Jehovah is God. It is he that has made us, and not we ourselves.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965161/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jer. 10:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965161/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965161/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Ps. 100:3</a>.</p>

<strong>The Deceptive Power of Wealth</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> Everyone must put up a constant battle to keep a good spiritual balance. If we find that we are letting material anxieties choke off our service to God, perhaps it is because we are not exercising faith. What is the remedy? Strengthen that faith. Study God’s Word; attend meetings where faith may be revived by good association and by receiving a generous share of God’s spirit. Build up a spiritual reserve by home Bible study with your family and by teaching others the truths you know, thereby demonstrating your faith. Never let your secular employment keep you from attending congregational meetings for Bible study or from attending conventions devoted to pure worship. There are other Jobs for a man of faith, and “your heavenly Father knows you need all these things.” <span id="page435" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="435" data-before-text="435"></span>The more material riches a man has the harder it is for him to accept the Scriptural truths and apply them. Such a man has a big stake in the old world; and the bigger the stake is, the harder it is to pull it up. Jesus illustrated this, saying: “It is easier for a camel to get through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to get into the kingdom of God.” Only with faith can such a person pull through.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 19:24</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>MEN OF FAITH</strong></p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">16. Why do we say it is practical to let our lives be free of the love of money?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Perhaps you say all of this sounds good, but it certainly is not practical. However, doing things the way Jehovah directs and the way his Word counsels is always the wisest and most practical. There are many outstanding examples of men of stature in the world who have found that their greatest treasure was in spiritual things. One was a man who had the best education the old world had to offer. He became what we might call the prime minister of a new nation, Israel. He was especially well known as a lawgiver and judge. He served as a special ambassador of Jehovah to a hostile nation, Egypt, and finally he came to prefigure Christ Jesus. This was Moses. His opinion on the deceptive power of wealth is expressed at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:24-26</a>: “By faith Moses, when grown up, refused to be called the son of the daughter of Pharaoh, . . . because he esteemed the reproach of the Christ as riches greater than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked intently toward the payment of the reward.” Yes, Moses made Jehovah’s interests his interests, not materialism. He had faith.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">17. Why was Job wise in not putting his trust in gold?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Another example is the case of a well-known property holder. He was a large-family man who had a tremendous cattle and livestock ranch with over 11,000 animals and many servants. Because he had such vast holdings he was called the greatest of all the Orientals. Who was it? Job. Was his faith in material things? Read his words at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 31:24-28</a>: “If I have put gold as my confidence, or to gold I have said, ‘You are my trust!’ If I used to rejoice because my property was much, and because my hand had found a lot of things . . . that too would be an error for attention by the justices, for I should have denied the true God above.” Job did not deny his Creator and, despite all the difficulties he went through because of putting his faith in God first, his latter days were more richly blessed than his youth.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">18. What did Paul consider to be the greatest riches?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Another man who testified strongly in favor of spirituality and against the deceptive power of wealth was one who was educated by some of the greatest scholars of his day. He became a leader of the early Christian organization and one of the twelve “apostles of the Lamb.” This was Paul. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 6:10</a> he described his own position: “As poor but making many rich, as having nothing and yet possessing all things.” When Paul entered the ministry he did not ask what his salary would be or what he was going to get out of it. He exercised faith in Jehovah to provide, and rejoiced that he was privileged to give so bountifully of spiritual riches to so many.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">19. Did Jesus encourage materialism?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> Finally, we have the words of the greatest man of all times, Christ Jesus, who has affected the lives of millions of people, and whose words are quoted more often than those of any living human. He stated: “Foxes have dens and birds of heaven have roosts, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay down his head.” Obviously materialism was not his way in life. To his disciples he instructed: “Do not carry a purse, nor a food pouch, nor sandals.” He knew that a workman is worthy of his hire <span id="page436" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="436" data-before-text="436"></span>and that Jehovah would provide for those serving him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Luke 9:58;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 10:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/19/2" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 7</a>) These men were among the most outstandingly successful of their time. They recognized the fleeting value of material possessions, and so chose the course leading to spiritual riches and favor with God.</p>

But Job’s neighbors worshiped the moon as a symbol of fertility. Alluring sex orgies were often a part of moon worship. If Job constantly thought about these his ‘hand would have proceeded to kiss his mouth’ in an act of worship. His heart could have become more open and permissive, to the point that idolatry would not have seemed so bad. But he caught himself.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982881/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 31:26-28</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Television serials are just as subtle. The search for love is used to justify any conduct. For instance, one unwed pregnant youth says to a friend: “But I love Victor. I don’t care. I’ll lie, cheat and steal to be with him. He’s worth it. Victor’s worth any cost. To have his baby is worth everything to me!” The soft background music makes it hard to consider her course to be so bad. You too like Victor. You feel sympathy for the girl. You “understand.” “It is amazing how you can rationalize,” stated one viewer who later came to her senses. “We know that immorality is bad. . . . But I realized that <em>mentally</em> I was taking part.”</p>

<strong>Ornamental or Idolatrous Representations—Which?</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">However, the Christian has to be careful that he does not begin to look upon any object as being something more than it actually is. This aspect was well expressed by Jehovah’s faithful servant Job: “If I used to see the light when it would <span id="page296" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="296" data-before-text="296"></span>flash forth, or the precious moon walking along, and my heart began to be enticed in secrecy and my hand proceeded to kiss my mouth, that too would be an error for attention by the justices, for I should have denied the true God above.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972362/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 31:26-28</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Accordingly, if a Christian felt that the presence of a certain picture or object could stir up worshipful feelings because of its ancient idolatrous association, he would want to get rid of it. This could include personal ornaments, jewelry and the like. And, of course, he would not want to keep things that presently have a supposed sacred significance or that are specifically designed for use in false religious rituals. That would be true even if the items in question no longer had any religious significance to him. Like Christians in ancient Ephesus, he would destroy appendages of false worship, regardless of how expensive they may have been, so that no one else could misuse them.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972362/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 19:19</a>.</p>

<strong>Attitudes and Gestures</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><em>Religious gestures toward an object.</em> Job pointed out the danger of letting one’s heart be enticed toward some object of reverence such as the sun or the moon to the point of making a worshipful gesture toward it, perhaps placing one’s hand to one’s mouth in a kiss the way pagan moon worshipers and those giving homage to idols did.

<strong>Kiss</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>False Worship.</strong> Kissing as an act of adoration toward false gods was forbidden by Jehovah, who mentions 7,000 men who did not bend the knee to Baal and kiss him.

<strong>Are They Corrupting Your Heart?</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><span id="page5" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span><strong>Hearts Enticed in Secrecy</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The faithful man Job admitted how easily his heart could be enticed by what he watched. “If I used to see the light when it would flash forth, or the precious moon walking along, and my heart began to be enticed in secrecy . . . , that too would be an error for attention by the justices,” confessed Job.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1982881/0">a</a> A view of the starry heavens, with the moon beaming, is touching. But Job’s neighbors worshiped the moon as a symbol of fertility. Alluring sex orgies were often a part of moon worship. If Job constantly thought about these his ‘hand would have proceeded to kiss his mouth’ in an act of worship. His heart could have become more open and permissive, to the point that idolatry would not have seemed so bad. But he caught himself.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1982881/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 31:26-28</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Television serials are just as subtle. The search for love is used to justify any conduct. For instance, one unwed pregnant youth says to a friend: “But I love Victor. I don’t care. I’ll lie, cheat and steal to be with him. He’s worth it. Victor’s worth any cost. To have his baby is worth everything to me!” The soft background music makes it hard to consider her course to be so bad. You too like Victor. You feel sympathy for the girl. You “understand.” “It is amazing how you can rationalize,” stated one viewer who later came to her senses. “We know that immorality is bad. . . . But I realized that <em>mentally</em> I was taking part.”</p>

<strong>Ornamental or Idolatrous Representations—Which?</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">However, the Christian has to be careful that he does not begin to look upon any object as being something more than it actually is. This aspect was well expressed by Jehovah’s faithful servant Job: “If I used to see the light when it would <span id="page296" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="296" data-before-text="296"></span>flash forth, or the precious moon walking along, and my heart began to be enticed in secrecy and my hand proceeded to kiss my mouth, that too would be an error for attention by the justices, for I should have denied the true God above.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972362/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 31:26-28</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Accordingly, if a Christian felt that the presence of a certain picture or object could stir up worshipful feelings because of its ancient idolatrous association, he would want to get rid of it. This could include personal ornaments, jewelry and the like. And, of course, he would not want to keep things that presently have a supposed sacred significance or that are specifically designed for use in false religious rituals. That would be true even if the items in question no longer had any religious significance to him. Like Christians in ancient Ephesus, he would destroy appendages of false worship, regardless of how expensive they may have been, so that no one else could misuse them.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972362/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 19:19</a>.</p>

This was usually done by falling on the knees and bowing forward, resting on the hands or, more often, the elbows, with the head touching the ground.

Job realized that this was a denial of the true God and would require an accounting for such error.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 31:26-28</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><em>Christian postures for prayer.</em> Jesus prayed publicly, in sincerity, as did Paul and others. He also recommended private prayer. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matt. 6:5, 6</a>) But Jesus condemned ostentatiousness in making long prayers for a pretense, a practice into which some of the scribes had fallen. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Mark 12:40;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Luke 20:47</a>) However, Christians adopted many of the customs and practices of the Jewish synagogue of which God did not disapprove, and the same attitudes and postures of prayer are mentioned in the Christian Greek Scriptures. Nowhere do they give support to the facial or bodily attitude of assumed piety and sanctimoniousness, making any given posture essential, such as placing the palms together or clasping the hands when offering prayer, as many of the artists of Christendom have depicted. In fact, prayers can be made silently and completely without outward manifestation, when the individual is carrying on an assigned duty or is faced with an emergency. Christians are told to carry on prayer “with every form of prayer and supplication.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Eph. 6:18</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>RESPECT, HUMILITY</strong></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><em>Kneeling</em>. The attitudes and postures of the Orientals in expressing respect for one another and especially when petitioning superiors were much the same as the attitudes practiced in prayer. We find examples of kneeling in supplication before others. This was not in worship of the superior person, but in acknowledgment of that one’s position or office, with deep respect.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Matt. 17:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Mark 1:40;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/20/2" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> 10:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/20/3" data-bid="21-4" class="b"> 2 Ki. 1:13</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><em>Bowing</em> was more frequently used in greeting others or in approaching them on a matter of business or in displaying a high degree of respect. Jacob bowed seven times on meeting Esau. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Gen. 33:3</a>) Solomon, even though he was king, showed respect to his mother by bowing to her.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Ki. 2:19</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Bowing could also be a symbol of acknowledgment of defeat.

This was because Haman, as an Agagite, was very likely an Amalekite, concerning whom Jehovah had said that he would completely wipe out their remembrance from under the heavens and that he would have war with Amalek from generation to generation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ex. 17:14-16</a>) Since bowing down or prostration would have a connotation of peace toward Haman, and possibly because the Persians considered such act a gesture of homage or worship, Mordecai refused to perform this act, because he would have violated God’s command in doing so.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Esther 3:5</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><em>Prostrating.</em> Joshua prostrated himself before an angel, “as prince of the army of Jehovah,” not in worship, but in acknowledgment of the superior office the angel held and of the fact that the angel was obviously sent from Jehovah with a command for him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Josh. 5:14</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">When Jesus was on earth, persons would prostrate themselves before him to petition and to do obeisance to him and he did not reprove them. This was because he was the appointed King, the King-designate, as he himself said: “God’s royal majesty has approached” (<em>ED</em>); “The kingdom of God has drawn near.” (<em>NW,</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Mark 1:15</a>) Jesus was the heir to the throne of David and therefore was rightfully honored as a king.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matt. 21:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> John 12:13-15</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">However, the apostles of Jesus Christ refused to permit others to prostrate themselves before them. This was for the reason that, in the instances described, prostration was done as an attitude of worship, as though the power of the holy spirit in the apostles, which performed the healing and other powerful works, was their own. The apostles realized that the power was from God and that credit for these things should be given to him and all worship directed toward Jehovah through Jesus Christ, of whom they were merely the representatives.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Acts 10:25, 26</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">In connection with the respect paid to Jesus, the word often used is <em>pro·sky·neʹo,</em> a word having the basic meaning of doing obeisance, but variously translated as “to worship, bow to the ground, fall prostrate,” Jesus was not accepting worship, which belongs to God alone (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Matt. 4:10</a>), but recognized the act of the one doing obeisance as recognition of the authority given Him by God. The angel whom Jesus Christ sent to bring the Revelation to John expressed the principle that man’s worship belongs only to God, when he refused to accept worship from John.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Rev. 19:10</a>; see WORSHIP.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><em>Covering the head</em> was a sign of respect on the part of women. This custom was followed in the Christian congregation. In discussing the principle of Christian headship the apostle Paul stated: “Every woman that prays or prophesies with her head uncovered shames the one who is her head . . . That is why the woman ought to have a sign of authority upon her head because of the angels.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:3-10</a>; see HEADSHIP.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><em>Removing one’s sandals</em> was a gesture of respect or reverence. Moses was commanded to do this at the burning bush and Joshua in the presence of an angel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ex. 3:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> Josh. 5:15</a>) Since the tabernacle and the temple were holy places, the priests are said to have performed their duties at the sanctuary barefooted. Likewise, the loosening of the laces of another person’s sandals or bearing his sandals for him was considered a menial duty and an expression of one’s humility and consciousness of insignificance when contrasted with his master. It is still a practice in the East that, when one enters a house, his sandals are taken off, sometimes by a servant.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Matt. 3:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/35/1" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> John 1:27</a>; see SANDAL.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"><em>Pouring water on another’s hands.</em> Elisha was identified as the minister or servant of Elijah by the expression “[he] poured out water upon the hands of Elijah.” This was a service performed particularly after meals. In the East it was not the <span id="page164" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="164" data-before-text="164"></span>custom to use knives and forks, but fingers, and the servant would afterward pour water over the hands of his master to wash them.

<strong>Ornamental or Idolatrous Representations—Which?</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">However, the Christian has to be careful that he does not begin to look upon any object as being something more than it actually is. This aspect was well expressed by Jehovah’s faithful servant Job: “If I used to see the light when it would <span id="page296" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="296" data-before-text="296"></span>flash forth, or the precious moon walking along, and my heart began to be enticed in secrecy and my hand proceeded to kiss my mouth, that too would be an error for attention by the justices, for I should have denied the true God above.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972362/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 31:26-28</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Accordingly, if a Christian felt that the presence of a certain picture or object could stir up worshipful feelings because of its ancient idolatrous association, he would want to get rid of it. This could include personal ornaments, jewelry and the like. And, of course, he would not want to keep things that presently have a supposed sacred significance or that are specifically designed for use in false religious rituals. That would be true even if the items in question no longer had any religious significance to him. Like Christians in ancient Ephesus, he would destroy appendages of false worship, regardless of how expensive they may have been, so that no one else could misuse them.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972362/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 19:19</a>.</p>

<strong>Materialism—A Deadly Philosophy</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Yes, Christendom’s pursuit of materialism has paved the way for the advance of the godless ideology of communism! Materialism is not based on the teachings of God-fearing men, but, rather, is in line with the teachings of the father of modern-day communism, Karl Marx. By adopting such a materialistic philosophy Christendom <span id="page134" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="134" data-before-text="134"></span>has caused people to forget God and to trust instead in material possessions, resulting in a fertile field for the spread of atheistic communism. Such a philosophy can lead only to God’s adverse judgment.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Regarding this, one wise servant of God long ago wrote: “If I have put gold as my confidence, or to gold I have said, ‘You are my trust!’ if I used to rejoice because my property was much, and because my hand had found a lot of things; . . . that too would be an error for attention by the justices, for I should have denied the true God above.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965161/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 31:24-28</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Jesus Christ, the Founder of Christianity, also recognized the danger of making material possessions one’s chief goal in life. He realized that it would cause one to become proud and selfish and to forget God. So time and again he struck right at the heart of materialism. For example, in his famous Sermon on the Mount he said:</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">“Stop storing up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break in and steal. Rather, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, . . . Observe intently the birds of heaven, because they do not sow seed or reap or gather into storehouses; still your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more than they are? . . . So never be anxious and say, ‘What are we to eat?’ or, ‘What are we to drink?’ or, ‘What are we to put on?’ For all these are the things the nations are eagerly pursuing. For your heavenly Father knows you need all these things. <em>Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you.”</em> How different Jesus’ teachings are from the popular materialistic attitude of today!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965161/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 6:19-33</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>AN UNREASONABLE PHILOSOPHY</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">But despite these words of Jesus, many people, even church members, feel it is unreasonable to put the worship of God first in their lives. They relegate it to a secondary place. Why is this so? It is because they have not really been instructed in the teachings of God’s Word, but have instead been regularly indoctrinated with materialistic philosophy. Note what the <em>Nation</em> magazine said relative to the recent shift of values in support of materialism:</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">“The shift of values inevitably has caused some strain in the American ethical consciousness. Frugality, once a virtue, is now a threat to the economy. Debt for the sake of indulgence, once impossible or sinful, now promotes prosperity. Where once greed was opposed to human welfare, we now hear that greed (both for profits and for consumers’ goods) is a public benefit. Traditional faith taught, ‘You cannot serve God and mammon’; editorialists today tell us, ‘You serve God and society best by serving mammon.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965161/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 6:24</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Yes, day in and day out the public is indoctrinated with materialism. Buy this! Buy that! Borrow money here! Practically every medium of communication constantly stresses the importance of money and material possessions. Why, even godliness and Christianity have come to be equated with material success, and this is what many are told in their churches. It is, therefore, no wonder that the public consciousness has been conditioned to think that materialism is the only reasonable philosophy of life. But is it?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Stop and think: Who made the heavens, the earth, the sea, trees, flowers, mountains, streams, birds, animals—all the things that make the earth such a pleasant place to live in? The only logical, reasonable conclusion is that given in the Bible: “Jehovah is in truth God. . . . He is the Maker of the earth by his power, the One firmly establishing the productive land by his wisdom, and the One who by his understanding <span id="page135" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="135" data-before-text="135"></span>stretched out the heavens.” “Know that Jehovah is God. It is he that has made us, and not we ourselves.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965161/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jer. 10:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965161/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965161/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Ps. 100:3</a>.</p>

<strong>The Deceptive Power of Wealth</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> Everyone must put up a constant battle to keep a good spiritual balance. If we find that we are letting material anxieties choke off our service to God, perhaps it is because we are not exercising faith. What is the remedy? Strengthen that faith. Study God’s Word; attend meetings where faith may be revived by good association and by receiving a generous share of God’s spirit. Build up a spiritual reserve by home Bible study with your family and by teaching others the truths you know, thereby demonstrating your faith. Never let your secular employment keep you from attending congregational meetings for Bible study or from attending conventions devoted to pure worship. There are other Jobs for a man of faith, and “your heavenly Father knows you need all these things.” <span id="page435" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="435" data-before-text="435"></span>The more material riches a man has the harder it is for him to accept the Scriptural truths and apply them. Such a man has a big stake in the old world; and the bigger the stake is, the harder it is to pull it up. Jesus illustrated this, saying: “It is easier for a camel to get through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to get into the kingdom of God.” Only with faith can such a person pull through.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 19:24</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>MEN OF FAITH</strong></p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">16. Why do we say it is practical to let our lives be free of the love of money?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Perhaps you say all of this sounds good, but it certainly is not practical. However, doing things the way Jehovah directs and the way his Word counsels is always the wisest and most practical. There are many outstanding examples of men of stature in the world who have found that their greatest treasure was in spiritual things. One was a man who had the best education the old world had to offer. He became what we might call the prime minister of a new nation, Israel. He was especially well known as a lawgiver and judge. He served as a special ambassador of Jehovah to a hostile nation, Egypt, and finally he came to prefigure Christ Jesus. This was Moses. His opinion on the deceptive power of wealth is expressed at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:24-26</a>: “By faith Moses, when grown up, refused to be called the son of the daughter of Pharaoh, . . . because he esteemed the reproach of the Christ as riches greater than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked intently toward the payment of the reward.” Yes, Moses made Jehovah’s interests his interests, not materialism. He had faith.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">17. Why was Job wise in not putting his trust in gold?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Another example is the case of a well-known property holder. He was a large-family man who had a tremendous cattle and livestock ranch with over 11,000 animals and many servants. Because he had such vast holdings he was called the greatest of all the Orientals. Who was it? Job. Was his faith in material things? Read his words at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 31:24-28</a>: “If I have put gold as my confidence, or to gold I have said, ‘You are my trust!’ If I used to rejoice because my property was much, and because my hand had found a lot of things . . . that too would be an error for attention by the justices, for I should have denied the true God above.” Job did not deny his Creator and, despite all the difficulties he went through because of putting his faith in God first, his latter days were more richly blessed than his youth.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">18. What did Paul consider to be the greatest riches?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Another man who testified strongly in favor of spirituality and against the deceptive power of wealth was one who was educated by some of the greatest scholars of his day. He became a leader of the early Christian organization and one of the twelve “apostles of the Lamb.” This was Paul. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 6:10</a> he described his own position: “As poor but making many rich, as having nothing and yet possessing all things.” When Paul entered the ministry he did not ask what his salary would be or what he was going to get out of it. He exercised faith in Jehovah to provide, and rejoiced that he was privileged to give so bountifully of spiritual riches to so many.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">19. Did Jesus encourage materialism?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> Finally, we have the words of the greatest man of all times, Christ Jesus, who has affected the lives of millions of people, and whose words are quoted more often than those of any living human. He stated: “Foxes have dens and birds of heaven have roosts, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay down his head.” Obviously materialism was not his way in life. To his disciples he instructed: “Do not carry a purse, nor a food pouch, nor sandals.” He knew that a workman is worthy of his hire <span id="page436" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="436" data-before-text="436"></span>and that Jehovah would provide for those serving him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Luke 9:58;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 10:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962524/19/2" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 7</a>) These men were among the most outstandingly successful of their time. They recognized the fleeting value of material possessions, and so chose the course leading to spiritual riches and favor with God.</p>

Jews were scattered throughout this vast realm. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012499/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Esther 1:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012499/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 3:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012499/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 4:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012499/7/3" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> 8:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012499/7/4" data-bid="8-5" class="b"> 9:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012499/7/5" data-bid="8-6" class="b"> 30</a>) The land of Judah, with its own governor and lesser administrative heads, was itself one of the 127 jurisdictional districts. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012499/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Neh. 1:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012499/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 11:3</a>) Seemingly, however, Judah was part of a still larger political division administered by a higher governmental official. Apparently this official directed any serious complaints concerning the districts under his jurisdiction to the king and then waited for royal authorization to act. Also, lesser officials could request that the activities of a particular jurisdictional district be investigated. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012499/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ezra 4:8-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012499/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 5:3-17</a>) When authorized by the king, jurisdictional districts could receive monies from the royal treasury, and the royal decrees were sent by means of couriers to the various parts of the empire. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012499/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ezra 6:6-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012499/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Esther 1:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012499/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 3:12-15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012499/10/3" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 8:10-14</a>) Therefore, all the inhabitants of the jurisdictional districts were familiar with the laws and decrees of the central government.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012499/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Esther 4:11</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The system of jurisdictional districts existing in nations of antiquity often made the lot of the subject peoples more difficult. This fact is acknowledged by the wise writer of Ecclesiastes: “If you see any oppression of the one of little means and the violent taking away of judgment and of righteousness in a jurisdictional district, do not be amazed over the affair, for one that is higher than the high one is watching, and there are those who are high above them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012499/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Eccl. 5:8</a>) There was little reason to be amazed about the oppression of the lowly one when lesser administrators were watched by higher officials, most of whom sought their own advantage at the expense of their subjects.—See PROVINCE.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"></p>

<strong>The Art of Listening With Love</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>Listen to Discern Feelings</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Companions of the man Job heard no fewer than ten of his discourses.

Because their listening provided no comfort. They neither cared about Job nor wanted to understand his feelings. They surely did not have fellow feeling as sympathetic listeners. But the apostle Peter counsels: “All of you be like-minded, showing fellow feeling, having brotherly affection, tenderly compassionate, humble in mind.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005844/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:8</a>) How can we show fellow feeling? One way is by showing concern for the other person’s feelings and trying to understand them. Making such sympathetic comments as “that must have been upsetting” or “you must have felt misunderstood” is one way to show that we are concerned. Another way is to put what the person is saying in our own words, thus showing that we understood what he said. Listening with love means paying attention not only to the words but also to the emotions subtly expressed.</p>

In this Christ was a sign to that generation, but even that did not convince most of the Jews.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Luke 11:30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 1:22</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>SIGN OF CHRIST’S PRESENCE</strong></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Shortly before Jesus’ death his apostles asked him: “What will be the sign of your presence and of the conclusion of the system of things?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Matt. 24:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Mark 13:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/20/2" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> Luke 21:7</a>) There were distinct differences between this question and the requests for a sign that the religious leaders had made. While right there, able to see him and his works, those leaders would not accept him as Messiah and king-designate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">John 19:15</a>) Once they asked for a sign “to tempt him” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Luke 11:16</a>); also some may have been infected with idle curiosity about Jesus’ signs, as was Herod. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Luke 23:8</a>) Quite the opposite, the disciples who asked about the sign of Christ’s presence already accepted him as Messiah and King. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matt. 16:16</a>) But Jesus had said that the Kingdom was “not coming with striking observableness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Luke 17:20</a>) Consequently (though the apostles mistakenly believed that the Kingdom would be established on earth [<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Acts 1:6</a>]), they did not want to be like the Jewish leaders when the Kingdom should arrive—blind to Jesus’ presence. Accordingly, they asked, not for a miraculous sign to be performed right there, but what the future identifying sign would be.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">In response Jesus described a composite “sign,” one made up of many evidences, including wars, earthquakes, persecution of Christians and a preaching about the Kingdom. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Matt. 24:4-14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 32, 33</a>) The destruction of Jerusalem and its temple was under consideration when the disciples asked Jesus for the “sign” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Luke 21:5-7</a>), and his reply gave prophecies that applied to Jerusalem and Judea, that were fulfilled during their lifetime. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Luke 21:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Matt. 24:15</a>) But his answer also dealt with the establishment of the kingdom of God and its effects on all mankind.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Luke 21:31,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 35</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong><em>“Sign of the Son of man”</em></strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">On that occasion Jesus said to his disciples: “And then the sign of the Son of man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will beat themselves in lamentation, and they will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Matt. 24:30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/31/1" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> Luke 21:27</a>) Just before this comment he had spoken of the prophet Daniel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Matt. 24:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/32/1" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> Dan. 9:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/32/2" data-bid="33-3" class="b"> 11:31</a>) And from the expression Jesus here used it is evident that he was now referring back to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Daniel 7:13, 14</a>, where the vision depicted “with the clouds of the heavens someone like a son of man” gaining access to the “Ancient of Days” and receiving a ‘kingdom that will not be brought to ruin.’ This linked the “sign of the Son of man” with the time when Jesus would be given Kingdom power. Jesus applied the expression “Son of man” and the prophecy at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Daniel 7:13, 14</a> to himself.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Matt. 26:63, 64;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/35/1" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> Mark 14:61, 62</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">About 96 C.E., twenty-six years after the destruction of Jerusalem, John wrote about things that would take place in the future, and he saw in vision Jesus Christ “coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, and those who pierced him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Rev. 1:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/36/1" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 7</a>) Hence, both this statement about something that was to take place after 96 C.E. and what Christ said about the “sign of the Son of man” referred to Jesus as coming in the clouds and as being seen by all people. (See CLOUD.) It should be noted, however, that while the Greek verb <em>ho·raʹo,</em> “to see,” used at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Matthew 24:30 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014023/37/1" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> Revelation 1:7</a>, can mean literally to “see an object, behold,” it can also be used metaphorically, of mental sight, to “discern, perceive.”—<em>A Greek-English Lexicon by Liddell and Scott</em> (Ninth ed., p. 1245a).</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">For a comparison of “miracles,” “portents” and “signs,” see MIRACLES; PORTENT.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"></p>
