Such spirits or demons were unable to materialize like the faithful angels did in communicating with Abraham. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Gen. 18:1-8</a>) This meant that the demons had to resort indirectly to divination and oracles. “In inspirational or natural divination the agent is professedly under the immediate influence of some spirit or god who enables the diviner to see the future and to utter oracles embodying what he sees. . . . It can be proved that among the ancient Babylonians and Egyptians the view prevailed that not only oracles but also omens of all kinds are given to men by the gods and express the minds of these gods.”<a id="footnotesource13" data-fnid="13" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966643/12">a</a> Note that in Eliphaz’s first speech he appeals to one of his Babylonish-like, spiritistic experiences to support his argument. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Job 4:15-17</a>) Never did Abraham or Job have such demonistic experiences to deny the Godship of Jehovah who guided them directly.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="ss"><strong>MAN, THE MORTAL—RESURRECTION HOPE</strong></p><p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="qu">20.

He understood man to be a living soul. He rejected the Babylonish view that man has an immortal soul. Job believed that man is mortal and, when man dies, he is dead. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Job 7:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/57/1" data-bid="58-2" class="b"> 17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/57/2" data-bid="58-3" class="b"> 9:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/57/3" data-bid="58-4" class="b"> 10:4, 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/57/4" data-bid="58-5" class="b"> 13:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/57/5" data-bid="58-6" class="b"> 14:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/57/6" data-bid="58-7" class="b"> 28:13</a>) Job further shows that upon death man has expired.

Then, too, Job is the only one to devotedly refer to Jehovah as the “Holy One.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Job 6:10</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="ss"><strong>A SPIRITISTIC EXPERIENCE</strong></p><p id="p70" data-pid="70" class="qu">19.

Such spirits or demons were unable to materialize like the faithful angels did in communicating with Abraham. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Gen. 18:1-8</a>) This meant that the demons had to resort indirectly to divination and oracles. “In inspirational or natural divination the agent is professedly under the immediate influence of some spirit or god who enables the diviner to see the future and to utter oracles embodying what he sees. . . . It can be proved that among the ancient Babylonians and Egyptians the view prevailed that not only oracles but also omens of all kinds are given to men by the gods and express the minds of these gods.”<a id="footnotesource13" data-fnid="13" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1966643/12">a</a> Note that in Eliphaz’s first speech he appeals to one of his Babylonish-like, spiritistic experiences to support his argument. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Job 4:15-17</a>) Never did Abraham or Job have such demonistic experiences to deny the Godship of Jehovah who guided them directly.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="ss"><strong>MAN, THE MORTAL—RESURRECTION HOPE</strong></p><p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="qu">20.

He understood man to be a living soul. He rejected the Babylonish view that man has an immortal soul. Job believed that man is mortal and, when man dies, he is dead. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Job 7:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/57/1" data-bid="58-2" class="b"> 17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/57/2" data-bid="58-3" class="b"> 9:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/57/3" data-bid="58-4" class="b"> 10:4, 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/57/4" data-bid="58-5" class="b"> 13:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/57/5" data-bid="58-6" class="b"> 14:1, 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/57/6" data-bid="58-7" class="b"> 28:13</a>) Job further shows that upon death man has expired.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966643/63/0" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Job 11:7</a>) It is complained that Job (one of Jehovah’s witnesses) conceitedly claims to know more than the religious sages of the past.

<strong>Hour</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">As recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012044/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Revelation 8:1-4</a>, the apostle John saw, during a silence in heaven for “about a half hour,” an angel with incense that he offered with the prayers of all the holy ones. This reminds one of the practice in the temple in Jerusalem “at the hour of offering incense.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200012044/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Luke 1:10</a>) Dr. Edersheim, in <em>The Temple,</em> presents the traditional Jewish account of this “hour”: “Slowly the incensing priest and his assistants ascended the steps to the Holy Place . . . Next, one of the assistants reverently spread the coals on the golden altar; the other arranged the incense; and then the chief officiating priest was left alone within the Holy Place, to await the signal of the president before burning the incense. . . . As the president gave the word of command, which marked that ‘the time of incense had come,’ ‘the whole multitude of the people without’ withdrew from the inner court, and fell down before the Lord, spreading their hands in silent prayer. It is this most solemn period, when throughout the vast Temple buildings deep silence rested on the worshipping multitude, while <span id="page799" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="799" data-before-text="799"></span>within the sanctuary itself the priest laid the incense on the golden altar, and the cloud of ‘ordours’ rose up before the Lord.”—P. 138.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"></p>

Thus Moses was told that no human could see God and live. Samuel was reminded that a human can see only the outside, but God can see the heart. David prayed that he might not fall into human hands but into God’s hands, for having numbered the fighting men of his nation presumptuously. The temple of Solomon, David said, was to be built, not for humans, but for God. Jehoshaphat counseled the judges to remember that they were judging, not for humans, but for God. Elihu refused to give flattering titles to mere humans.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ex. 33:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 1 Sam. 16:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 1 Chron. 21:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/3" data-bid="11-4" class="b"> 29:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/4" data-bid="11-5" class="b"> 2 Chron. 19:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/10/5" data-bid="11-6" class="b"> Job 32:21</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The psalmist twice asked why the great Creator should take note of mere humans; also, he said that, though certain ones were “gods,” they would die like earthling man.

And to highlight the seriousness of the selfishness of the priests in Malachi’s day, God asked: “Will earthling man rob God?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 8:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 144:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 82:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/3" data-bid="12-4" class="b"> Prov. 29:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/4" data-bid="12-5" class="b"> Isa. 31:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/11/5" data-bid="12-6" class="b"> Mal. 3:8</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>“ENÓSH”</strong></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The thought behind <em>enósh,</em> weak or mortal, shows, for one thing, that the Hebrew Scripture writers had no illusions about man’s being immortal. How could they, since they received their “theology,” not from pagan sources, but from God himself, who made plain man’s mortal nature both by warning him of death in the event he sinned and by sentencing him, after he had sinned, to return to the dust from which man had been taken.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. 2:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 3:19</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><em>Enósh</em> always has an unfavorable connotation and, therefore, is never used in a complimentary sense. Fittingly, it is frequently coupled with <em>adám,</em> human, when man is contrasted with his immortal Maker, Jehovah God. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalms 8:4 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Ps 144:3</a> are typical of this coupling of <em>enósh</em> with <em>adám</em> when contrasting man with God. Thus also Moses wrote: “You make mortal man [<em>enósh</em>] go back to crushed matter, and you say: ‘Go back, you sons of men [<em>adám</em>].’” Because of the wickedness of man God warned that he would make <em>‘enósh</em> scarcer than refined gold and <em>adám</em> scarcer than the gold of Ophir.’ Putting both <em>enósh</em> and <em>adám</em> in their places are the words of Jehovah to Isaiah: “I myself am the One that is comforting you people. Who are you that you should be afraid of a mortal man [<em>enósh</em>] that will die, and of a son of mankind [<em>adám</em>] that will be rendered as mere green grass? And that you should forget Jehovah your Maker, the One stretching out the heavens and laying the foundation of the earth.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 90:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Isa. 13:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 51:12, 13</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Particularly in the book of Job, which features God’s sovereignty in contrast to man’s puniness, is <em>enósh</em> a favorite term when making this point: “How can mortal man be in the right in a case with God?” “What is mortal man that you should rear him, and that you should set your heart upon him?” “Do you [Jehovah] have eyes of flesh, or is it as a mortal man sees that you see? Are your days like the days of mortal man, or your years just like the days of an able-bodied man?” “As one trifles with mortal man will you trifle with [God]? “ “God is much more than mortal man.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Job 9:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 7:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/2" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 10:4, 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/3" data-bid="16-4" class="b"> 13:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/15/4" data-bid="16-5" class="b"> 33:12</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">From his prayers we can see that David had a like keen appreciation: “Do arise, O Jehovah!

<strong>Sea</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">James’ brother Jude warns his fellow Christians of the great danger from wicked men who slip into the congregation with the purpose of bringing in moral defilement. He calls them “wild waves of the sea that foam up their own causes for shame.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013776/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Jude 4-13</a>) Jude may have had in mind an earlier expression of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013776/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Isaiah (57:20</a>) and may be figuratively describing such ones’ passionate, reckless disregard for God’s laws and their rushing against the divinely constituted moral barriers in their degraded, lustful course. As one commentator remarks: “. . . they cast forth <span id="page1462" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1462" data-before-text="1462"></span>to public view the mire and dirt of their excesses, . . . So these men foam out their own acts of shame, and cast them forth for men to see, and so to blame the Church for the ill-deeds of these professors.” (F. C. Cook, <em>Commentary</em> on Jude) Another says: “What they impart is as unsubstantial and valueless as the foam of the oceanside, and is in fact a proclamation of their own shame.”—Schaff-Lange, <em>Commentary</em> on Jude; compare Peter’s description of such men at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013776/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">2 Peter 2:10-22</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"></p>

It is impossible at present to specify which constellation they refer to and hence it is safer to transliterate the name (as in our heading) rather than to translate the Hebrew with specific names such as “Arcturus” (Gr., <em>Ar·ktouʹros,</em> literally meaning “Guardian of the Bear”) (<em>KJ</em>), or “Bear” (<em>RS</em>).</p>

The Latin <em>Vulgate</em> translated <em>kesilʹ</em> as “Orion” in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002597/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 9:9</a> and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002597/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Amos 5:8</a>. Most translations imitate the Latin <em>Vulgate</em> in viewing <em>kesilʹ</em> as referring to Orion. The ancient Targum and Syriac versions read “giant,” and this corresponds to the Arabic name for the Orion constellation, <em>gabbar,</em> or “strong one” (Hebrew equivalent, <em>gib·bohrʹ</em>).</p>

<strong>From Our Readers</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>Reed Boats</strong>  I was fascinated by the article “Sailing the Deep Blue Sea​—On Reeds!” (January 22, 2003) In my personal Bible reading, I came across <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102003691/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 9:26</a>. Referring to the short life span of humans, it states: “They have moved on like reed boats.” A friend and I wondered why Job would have compared a brief life span to a reed boat. Then my friend suggested that Job may have been making the same point mentioned in your article​—that “reeds gradually become waterlogged” and hence unusable.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sj">N.

If this is so, the same point would be made​—that man’s life span is short.</p>

Otherwise we will most certainly be influenced by our own fleshly tendencies of selfishness, fear, pride and jealousy. Or we may allow others with the same tendencies <span id="page169" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="169" data-before-text="169"></span>to influence us in the decisions we make.

How then can we avoid the ungodly influence of the worldly people among whom we live? Paul’s answer is simple and to the point.

The scripture reads, “Men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, . . . lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God.” Today the attitude of the majority of people is, “Let’s live now! Let’s eat, drink and be merry, and worry about tomorrow when tomorrow comes.” The majority think in terms of pleasure and ease, being materially well fixed. They live for this world. They want what they want now, believing it is now or never. They have no hope for the future. Their thinking is so influenced by Satan, the god of this system of things, that without realizing it they are his slaves. They give their lives to getting what they want in this system while it lasts.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969202/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:4</a>.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 8.

If you have, then you will remember that the more you spun the wheels to get out the deeper you got in. Many today are allowing themselves to be led down the bottomless road of materialism in which they get bogged down more and more deeply until they are hopelessly stuck. Soon there are so many monthly payments that they have to have two jobs to meet them, or have other members of the family working who could be spending this time in preaching the good news of God’s kingdom. <span id="page170" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="170" data-before-text="170"></span>When this happens, the materialistic world about us is influencing our decisions, influencing us to forget Jesus’ words, “Even when a person has an abundance his life does not result from the things he possesses.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969202/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 12:15</a>) If we feel that our happiness depends on the things we possess, then it is time to remember the words recorded in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969202/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Proverbs 16:20</a>, “Happy is he that is trusting in Jehovah,” not in the things he possesses. Jesus further asked, “What benefit will it be to a man if he gains the whole world but forfeits his soul?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969202/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 16:26</a>) He could have one of all the things the world has to offer, but what benefit is it if he has no life with which to enjoy them? Yes, spending one’s life in the pursuit of material things is well compared to the spinning wheels of an immobile car—it is a life of frustration devoid of true satisfaction or progress.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● By what means were the waters of the Red Sea held back when the Israelites marched through? Does</strong> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958808/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Exodus 15:8</strong></a><strong>, which says “the surging waters were congealed in the heart of the sea,” indicate that they were frozen?—J.H., U.S.A.</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">We do not know just how Jehovah kept the waters of the Red Sea standing like walls to the right and the left of the Israelites as they marched through. It was a miracle performed by God.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The verse in question, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958808/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Exodus 15:8</a>, reads: “And by a breath from your nostrils waters were heaped up; they stood still like a dam of floods; the surging waters were congealed in the heart of the sea.” The same expression, “congealed,” is used in the <em>American Standard Version,</em> the <em>Authorized Version,</em> and translations by J. N. Darby, I. Leeser, R. Knox, and J. Rotherham.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The word “congeal,” as defined in Webster’s <em>New International Dictionary,</em> means “to change from a fluid to a solid by cold; to freeze”; “to make viscid or like jelly; to curdle; coagulate.” The Hebrew word here translated “congeal” means to shrink or thicken as with curdled milk or frozen water, or to congeal. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958808/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 10:10</a> the expression is used in regard to curdling cheese. Therefore, it does not of necessity mean that the walls of water were frozen solid, although Jehovah could do such a thing. The consistency of the congealed substance could be like jello or curds. Nothing visible was holding back the waters of the Red Sea on each side of the Israelites, so they had the appearance of being congealed, stiffened, curdled or thickened so as to remain standing like walls on each side and not collapsing in an inundation upon the Israelites to their destruction.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Had the wind been a blast cold enough to freeze the waters, the account no doubt would have made reference to the extreme cold. And such cold might well have resulted in a frozen sea bottom that would be precarious for travel. But <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958808/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Exodus 14:21</a> says that “Jehovah began making the sea go back by a strong east wind all night long and converting the sea basin into <em>dry ground.”</em> And <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958808/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 51:10</a> similarly states: “Are you not the one that <em>dried up</em> the sea, the waters of the vast deep?”</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Moses described the appearance of things to him. He was aware of the strong east wind and he could see the walls of apparently congealed water. The event, however, was a miracle from God, and Moses did not attempt to explain the mechanics by which the water was held up, nor will we.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Chebar</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Some commentators have advanced the view that the Chebar may have been the modern Khabur, which enters the Euphrates about 290 miles (466.6 kilometers) N of Babylon. However, it should be noted that the exiles taken by Nebuchadnezzar’s forces were removed to “Babylon” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010917/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Ki. 24:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010917/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> <span id="page308" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="308" data-before-text="308"></span>2 Chron. 36:20</a>) and the river Chebar is spoken of as being “in the land of the Chaldeans” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010917/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezek. 1:3</a>), terms which designate lower or southern Mesopotamia, not an area as far N as the modern Khabur River.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Most scholars agree that when speaking of the <em>“river</em> Chebar” Ezekiel used the Hebrew term <em>na·harʹ</em> (usually rendered “river”) apparently in its widest sense to include the numerous Babylonian canals that once intersected the fertile area between the lower courses of the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers. This usage would be consistent with the corresponding Babylonian word that also describes either a river or a canal. Engineers are believed to have devised Babylon’s impressive irrigational canal system early in Mesopotamian history to control the otherwise destructive Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, which started rising during the rainy season each year, not only causing destructive floods, but depositing layers of soil-ruining salt over agricultural areas. Many of these canals were also broad enough for large sailing vessels, serving thereby to enhance Babylon’s already renowned commercial and economic position.—See CANALS.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Which canal of the vast network that laced Mesopotamia is the Biblical river Chebar cannot be determined with certainty. Some hold that since the Hebrew <em>K<sup>e</sup>varʹ</em> (Chebar) may be derived from a word meaning ‘to be great or mighty,’ this would fit Babylonia’s <em>Nahr Malcha</em> or “Royal River,” an ancient, broad, deep canal connecting the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. Although apparently first dug in the days of Hammurabi, it was reopened by Nebuchadnezzar and is said to have been large enough to afford passage to merchant ships. The <em>Nahr Malcha</em> was rated one of the chief canals of Babylonia, running from a point N of Babylon on the Euphrates to Opis near Seleucia at the Tigris.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Most modern Biblical geographers, however, prefer some connection of the “river Chebar” with the Shatt en-Nil, which has been identified with the <em>naru Kabari</em> (or “Grand Canal”) mentioned in cuneiform contract tablets found at the city of Nippur, about fifty-three miles (85.3 kilometers) SE of Babylon. The Shatt en-Nil branches off the Euphrates above Babylon and runs in a SE direction, passing near Nippur, to rejoin the Euphrates S of Ur, about 150 miles (241.4 kilometers) below Babylon. Considered the canal <em>par excellence</em> of ancient Babylonia proper, it is said to have been fifteen to twenty feet (4.6 to 6.1 meters) deep in places, a sufficient depth to make it navigable by certain vessels. There are indications that Jews may have lived in this area about the time of the exile. Cuneiform tablets, believed to be from the archives of a Babylonian brokerage firm of the fifth century B.C.E. and containing many Jewish names among their list of clientele, have been found at Nippur along with the tablets that mention the <em>naru Kabari.</em></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The identification of the Chebar with the Shatt en-Nil is, of course, not positive. Shiftings and floodings of the Euphrates River are known to have greatly altered the topography of the country over the centuries. Skilled archaeologists admit uncertainty as to where the ancient canals lay, and they acknowledge that ruins of canals found may date back only to the Arab rule of the Middle Ages. This makes any definite locating of the ancient “river Chebar” an impossibility at this time.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Compulsory Service</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Hebrew word <em>tsa·vaʼʹ,</em> which often applies to military service or service in war, also means “compulsory labor,” that is, to pay off debt or guilt. Thus Jerusalem was to be told that her “military service” had been fulfilled and her error had been paid off. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001018/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isa 40:1, 2</a>, ftn) When under test, distressed and pain-racked Job likened life to hard, fatiguing service or “compulsory labor,” asking: “Is there not a compulsory labor for mortal man on earth, and are not his days like the days of a hired laborer?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001018/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 7:1</a>) With similar sentiment, he later said to God: “You will make your vexation with me greater; hardship after hardship is with me,” or “one shift of compulsory labor after another is with me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001018/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 10:17</a>, ftn) Job evidently felt that God was adding to his affliction by bringing one new hardship after another upon him. Job also likened the time that the dead spend in Sheol to compulsory labor, a burden that is enforced; yet he expressed hope in a resurrection.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001018/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Job 14:14</a>.</p>

<strong>Compensation</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">When items or goods were left with another for safekeeping and during this time were stolen, the thief, if found, had to make the usual double compensation. Things such as money, articles, and so forth, would not require special care, but only a safe place. In the case of a domestic animal kept for another, the one keeping the animal (bailee) was to exercise the same care that he did for his own flock. Such bailees were usually paid for food the <span id="page369" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="369" data-before-text="369"></span>animals needed, and sometimes they were probably paid also for the extra trouble of keeping the animals. If an animal died of itself, was torn by a wild beast or was taken by a band of marauders, the bailee was free from blame. The loss was beyond his control. This might happen to his own animals, but if it was stolen (by someone whom the bailee could have prevented, or through his negligence) the bailee was responsible and was required to make compensation.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011000/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ex. 22:7-13</a>; see <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011000/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Genesis 31:38-42</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">A man who borrowed an animal from another person for his own use had to compensate for any damages incurred.

If it was a hired item, the owner would stand the loss because he supposedly would consider the risk in setting a hiring price.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011000/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ex. 22:15</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Hebrew language has another word equivalent for “organization,” namely, <em>histadruthʹ.</em> This word is based upon a word that is found in the original Hebrew Scriptures. The basic or key letters in the word <em>histadruthʹ</em> are <em>s</em> and <em>d</em> and <em>r.</em> With these three consonants is built up the Hebrew verb <em>sadarʹ,</em> which means, basically, “to arrange in order,” thus producing an arrangement. The reflexive form of the verb <em>sadarʹ</em> serves as the basis for the noun <em>histadruthʹ</em>, which means “organization.”</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Although we do not find this word in the inspired Hebrew Scriptures, we do find the related Hebrew noun <em>seder</em> in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981330/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 10:22</a>. There this noun is used in the plural number, being spelled <em>sʽdarimʹ.</em> The <em>English Revised Version</em> renders <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981330/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 10:22</a> as follows: “A land of thick darkness, as darkness itself; A land of the shadow of death, without any order [<em>sʽdarimʹ</em>], And where the light is as darkness.” (Also, <em>Authorized Version; Young’s Literal Translation.</em>) The <em>New World Translation</em> here reads: “To the land of obscurity like gloom, of deep shadow and disorder [<em>lo sʽdarimʹ</em>], where it beams no more than gloom does.” (Also, Rotherham’s <em>The Emphasised Bible.</em>) Disorder, without any order, here would mean a lack of arrangement, a disorganized state.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">To this day the Jews use the word <em>seder.</em> A seder is part of the Jewish Mishnah. Under the word “Mishna,” M’Clintock and Strong’s <em>Cyclopædia</em> says: “The Mishnah is divided into six parts (. . . , <em>Sedarim,</em> arrangements), which contain 62 treatises . . . and 514 chapters . . . The latter, again, are divided into numbered sections.”</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">So in the original Hebrew Bible the word for “order” or “arrangement” is to be found. Emphasizing the needs for order and arrangement in the Christian congregation, the apostle Paul wrote to the Christians in Corinth: “For God is not a God of confusion, but of peace; as in all the churches of the saints. But let all things be done decently and in order [Hebrew translations: <em>sʽdarimʹ nʽkhonimʹ</em>].” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981330/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Cor. 14:33,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981330/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 40</a>, <em>English Revised Version; Authorized Version</em>) This apostolic counsel of the first century applies with equal force today to all congregations of the Christian witnesses of Jehovah. The apostle Paul wrote in the common Greek of the day, and the Greek word for “organization” is <em>or·ganʹo·sis.</em> The root for this word is <em>erʹgon,</em> a word meaning “work” that is found repeatedly in the Christian Greek Scriptures.</p>
