<strong>Abiasaph</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It appears that Korah’s sons did not join their father in his rebellion, along with Dathan and Abiram, against Moses and Aaron. Hence, these sons did not die with their father at that time. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000029/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Nu 26:9-11</a>) Thus, at a later period, we find reference made to “the sons of Korah” in the superscriptions of many of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000029/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">the Psalms (42,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000029/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 44-49,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000029/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 84,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000029/5/3" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> 85,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000029/5/4" data-bid="6-5" class="b"> 87,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000029/5/5" data-bid="6-6" class="b"> 88</a>), although this term has, basically, the meaning of “the descendants of Korah,” or “the house of Korah.”</p>

Thus the designation “Ezrahite” apparently is another word for “Zerahite.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001478/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Nu 26:20</a>) The Targum of Jonathan interprets “Ezrahite” as “son of Zerah.”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">(Maʹha·lath).</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Probably a musical term, perhaps one of a technical nature, found in the superscriptions of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002841/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalms 53</a> and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002841/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">88</a>. Some believe that this term may be related to a Hebrew root verb meaning “grow weak; fall sick,” thereby suggesting a gloomy and melancholy tune. This would harmonize with the somewhat somber content of the two songs, particularly that of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002841/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 88</a>.</p>

When he was near death from a terrible disease, Job said: “If I keep waiting, Sheol is my house; in the darkness I shall have to spread out my lounge. To the pit I shall have to call out, ‘You are my father!’ to the maggot, ‘My mother and my sister!’ So where, then, is my hope? And my hope—who is it that beholds it?

Any honest reader will answer, “The grave!” It is in the dust of the earth. It is a dark place, where the dead body is laid out as on a lounge; it is a pit, and there the maggot is to be found, feeding on the rotting corpse. It has bars, in the sense that those buried in it cannot free themselves. In fact, the Authorized Version Bible of King James of England uses here the words “grave” and “pit” instead of the Hebrew word Sheol.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 2. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Psalm 141:7</a>, what remains are associated with Sheol?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> Having in mind a woodchopper scattering chips and sticks of wood around, the psalmist David said: “As when one is doing cleaving and splitting on the earth, our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 141:7</a>) Instead of Sheol, the English <em>Authorized Version</em> uses the words “the grave,” and fittingly so, for bones are scattered at the mouth of the grave before burial.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 3. How does <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Isaiah 28:15-18</a> indicate that Sheol is the grave?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> When speaking about the enemies of God, the prophet Isaiah links death (not life) and Sheol together, saying: “Because you men have said: ‘We have concluded a covenant with Death; and with Sheol we have effected a vision; the overflowing flash flood, in case it should pass through, will not come to us. . . ’; therefore this is what the Lord Jehovah has said: ‘ . . . your covenant with Death will certainly be dissolved, and that vision of yours with Sheol will not stand. The overflowing flash flood, when it passes through—you must also become for it a trampling place.”’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 28:15-18</a>) This very language indicates that Sheol is the common grave of dead mankind, for the grave is the place of death.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 4. How is Sheol shown to be a low place also in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Isaiah 57:9</a>?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 57:9</a> also indicates that Sheol is a low place, as low as the grave. After telling how the Jewish kingdom of Judah tried to lure other nations, Gentile nations, into political alliances with her, this prophecy says: “You proceeded to descend toward Melech with oil, and kept making your ointments abundant. And you continued sending your envoys far off, so that you lowered matters to Sheol.” In her political dealings with Gentile nations the unfaithful kingdom of Judah stooped so low in God’s view that she was bringing upon herself the condemnation of death in the grave, thus ceasing to be an independent nation with a king.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 5.

Incline your ear to my entreating cry. For my soul has had enough of calamities, and my very life has come in touch even with Sheol. I have been reckoned in among those going down to the pit; I have become like an able-bodied man without strength, set free among the dead themselves, like slain ones lying in the burial place, whom you have remembered no longer and who have been severed from your own helping hand. You have put me in a pit of the lowest depths, in dark places, in a large abyss.”</p>

<strong>“Man” in the Hebrew Scriptures</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><span id="page59" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="59" data-before-text="59"></span><strong>“GEBER”</strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">The term <em>geber</em> means one able-bodied, well-developed, physically strong, that is, a mighty one in the case of a man. While it has complimentary implications, the way it is used by the Hebrew Scripture writers keeps man cognizant of his inferior relationship to his Maker, Jehovah God. Thus we find that, when at last Jehovah God called patient Job to account because of his mistaken view of things, God twice addressed Job, not as a mere <em>ish,</em> a mere <em>adám</em> or a mere <em>enósh,</em> but he used the term <em>geber:</em> “Gird up your loins, please, like an able-bodied man, and let me question you, and you inform me,” since you were so sure of yourself as not to justify me! How fitting!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 38:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 40:7</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Pharaoh, when beginning to yield under the impact of the plagues, at first only granted permission for the able-bodied men to go into the wilderness to worship. And when the Israelites finally left Egypt we read that 600,000 able-bodied men, above twenty years old and able to fight, left Egypt together with their little ones.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ex. 10:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 12:37</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Because an able-bodied man is inclined to be “self-assuming,” trusting in his own strength, he is repeatedly singled out for reminders of the folly of such a mental attitude: “Here is the able-bodied man that does not put God as his fortress.” “What able-bodied man is there alive who will not see death?” “An able-bodied man dies and lies vanquished.” Yes, “cursed is the able-bodied man who puts his trust,” not in Jehovah, but in what is, after all, a mere “earthling man [<em>adám</em>].”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Hab. 2:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Ps. 52:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/19/2" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 89:48;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/19/3" data-bid="20-4" class="b"> Job 14:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/19/4" data-bid="20-5" class="b"> Jer. 17:5</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"><em>Geber</em> is frequently used to drive home a point by way of contrast. Thus the psalmist complains: “I have become like an able-bodied man without strength.” It would not have made much of a point had he said he became like a weak mortal, an <em>enósh,</em> because such a one does not have strength to begin with! Making the same point, Solomon observed that it is not good that “an able-bodied man should transgress over a mere piece of bread.” There might be an excuse for an <em>enósh</em> to do so, but certainly not a <em>geber.</em> The bad news he received caused Jeremiah’s bones to shake like “an able-bodied man whom wine has overcome,” hence a violent shaking. He also stressed the wretchedness of the men of Israel by employing this term: “Why is it that I have seen every able-bodied man with his hands upon his loins like a female that is giving birth, and all faces have turned pale?” Yes, this was serious when even able-bodied men, not mere <em>enósh</em> or weak mortals, were affected in this way!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 88:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Prov. 28:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/20/2" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> Jer. 23:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/20/3" data-bid="21-4" class="b"> 30:6</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Logically we are told that “one wise in strength is,” not an <em>adám, ish</em> or <em>enósh,</em> but a <em>geber,</em> “an able-bodied man.” A wise <em>geber</em> trusts not in his own strength but in Jehovah: “Blessed is the able-bodied man who puts his trust in Jehovah, and whose confidence Jehovah has become.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Prov. 24:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Jer. 17:7</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Truly, to note the way “man” is used in the Hebrew Scriptures strengthens our faith and helps us to get God’s view on man. It is wholesomely instructive to our maintaining our proper relationship with our Creator and gaining his approval and blessing.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Abaddon</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In Hebrew the word <em>ʼavad·dohnʹ</em> means “destruction” and may also refer to “the place of destruction.” It appears in the original Hebrew text a total of five times, and in four of the occurrences it is used to parallel “the burial place,” “Sheol,” and “death.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000007/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps 88:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000007/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Job 26:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000007/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 28:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000007/1/3" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> Pr 15:11</a>) The word <em>ʼavad·dohnʹ</em> in these texts evidently refers to the destructive processes that ensue with human death, and these scriptures indicate that decay or destruction takes place in Sheol, the common grave of mankind.

<strong>Answering the Roman Governor’s Question, “What Is Truth?”</strong><br/><p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[97]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"><sup>27</sup></span> This prophecy concerning kingship was written in the Bible’s first book, in <span id="page652" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="652" data-before-text="652"></span><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Genesis 49:8-10</a>. However, the book of Genesis was written by Moses. What are now the first five books of the Bible were at first just one book written by Moses. In the days of Jesus Christ, when Jews spoke of the big divisions of the books of the Hebrew Scriptures, the first five Bible books written by Moses were called the Law or “Torah,” so that the book of Genesis came under the heading of “the Law,” the Torah. After being resurrected from the dead Jesus said to his disciples: “These are my words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you [in the flesh], that all the things written in [1] the law of Moses and in [2] the Prophets and [3] Psalms about me must be fulfilled.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Luke 24:44</a>) For that reason the expression “the Law” could include the things written in the book of Genesis, including this prophecy by the patriarch Jacob concerning the kingship in the tribe of Judah.</p><p id="p98" data-pid="98" class="qu">28.

It was because David of the tribe of Judah was made king of Israel, to succeed King Saul and his son Ish-bosheth, and then Jehovah God made a solemn contract or covenant with King David for the kingship of God’s people to stay in David’s royal family line forever. That meant that at last David would have a permanent heir to the kingdom.

It is the special means by which Jehovah will vindicate his position as the universal Sovereign Lord. In this kingdom he has a representative of his on the throne, one whom he anoints to be King. Early after the flood of Noah’s day Jehovah raised up a king on earth who foreshadowed Jehovah’s anointed King of the new world. His name was Melchizedek, and he was king of the city of Salem and at the same time priest of the Most High God. No creature in heaven or on earth could arrange to make himself king of the new world. It was Jehovah who had to conceive the idea of such a king and to make a covenant or solemn agreement with one whom he wanted to hold this kingship. Jesus Christ is the one whom Jehovah has anointed to be the King, the one with whom he has made the special covenant for the kingdom of the heavens. Since Jesus showed his disciples that the Psalms had so much to say prophetically about him, do we find some psalms speaking of the Kingdom covenant and of Melchizedek? We do. Jehovah chose the family line of King David as the one through whom the Messiah, the anointed King of the new world, should come. So Jehovah made with David a covenant for a permanent kingdom.</p><p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="qu">25.

<strong>The Legal Foundations of the New World</strong><br/><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> Did you notice that Paul said that by Jesus’ becoming a high priest by reason of the sworn oath, it really meant that Jesus was “the one given in pledge [guarantee, security] of a better covenant”? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Heb. 7:22</a>, <em>NW</em>) That “better covenant” is the <em>new covenant,</em> and this fact brings us to the third reason in our list. Is it one of the <em>legal</em> foundations of the new world? Indeed it is, as the apostle goes on to clearly prove in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Hebrews, chapters 8 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/44/1" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> 9</a>. He shows that the new covenant succeeds where the former one made with the fleshly house of Israel failed. Quoting from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, where the terms of the new covenant are set forth, Paul explains that God found fault with both the former (Law) covenant and the people under it, as evidenced in the fact that God said of them: “They did not continue in my covenant, so that I stopped caring for them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Heb. 8:9</a>, <em>NW</em>) The former covenant proved inadequate to provide the real remedy and failed to produce a people for Jehovah’s name. In contrast, the new covenant is altogether superior, as Paul shows in detail in the two chapters mentioned (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Hebrews 8 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/47/1" data-bid="48-2" class="b"> 9</a>), and makes the point that Jesus is “the mediator of a correspondingly better covenant, which has been <em>legally established</em> upon better promises.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Heb. 8:6</a>, <em>NW</em>) The new covenant really does produce a people who sincerely delight to do God’s will because his law is written ‘in their minds and upon their hearts.’ It produces a people whose consciences are cleansed through Christ’s shed blood, the adequate remedy, thus enabling them to “render sacred service to the living God” and ultimately gain “the everlasting inheritance” and, with Christ, <span id="page183" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="183" data-before-text="183"></span>form part of the new world’s government.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Heb. 9:14, 15</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">23. In tracing the promised seed, what further oathbound promise is revealed?</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> What is the fourth reason? When God made promise to Abraham, he first said nothing about either a king or a kingdom, but did so later. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Gen. 12:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/50/1" data-bid="51-2" class="b"> 17:15, 16</a>) So, in tracing the promised seed down the line from father Abraham, we come to David, who was made king of Israel, the typical theocracy, by Jehovah’s own choosing and appointment. With David God made a solemn covenant, to which he added his oath-bound promise, expressed in these words: “I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant: thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Ps. 89:3, 4</a>, <em>AS</em>) That David’s kingly seed is Christ Jesus is proved by Peter in his inspired speech to the men of Israel on the day of Pentecost, after the outpouring of the holy spirit, when he said: “Because he [David] was a prophet and knew that God had sworn to him with an oath that he would seat one of his offspring upon his throne, he saw beforehand and spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Acts 2:30, 31</a>, <em>NW;</em> see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Luke 1:32, 33</a>, <em>NW.</em>) Surely, then, we have here another legal foundation of the new world, made legally secure by God’s oathbound promise.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">24. (a) What is the relationship between the ransom and God’s purpose? (b) How is the ransom seen to be one of the new world’s legal foundations?</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> Perhaps some of our readers have been expecting to see Christ’s ransom sacrifice mentioned first, or at least earlier, in our list of reasons. But, no, we have purposely left it till the last. Why? Because God’s <em>purpose,</em> meaning that which he has determined and set before himself as an object to be attained, is more important than the necessary means incidental thereto. We are not minimizing the importance of the ransom as an indispensable means and provision for the attainment of the end in view, and we remember that God’s oathbound promise was given after Abraham’s sacrifice of Isaac, picturing Jehovah’s sacrifice of his only-begotten Son Jesus Christ. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Gen. 22:1-18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/54/1" data-bid="55-2" class="b"> John 3:16</a>) Moreover, it is freely admitted that not one of the foregoing aspects of God’s purpose, covered by the four reasons just discussed, could be successfully carried out unless and until the disability resting upon the entire human family is first removed. By “disability” we mean the legal incapacity, or disqualification, of man with regard to his standing before his Creator, due to inherited sin and crippling imperfection, leading to the grave. But, “just as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned,” so also through a man, “a man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a corresponding ransom for all,” God has graciously provided a “propitiatory sacrifice for our sins, yet not for ours only but also for the whole world’s.” Therefore we gladly and gratefully acknowledge this essential part of the new world’s foundations, legally provided in strict conformity with God’s fundamental law of equity. We thank God for “the Lamb who was slaughtered from the world’s foundation.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/55/1" data-bid="56-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 2:5, 6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/55/2" data-bid="56-3" class="b"> 1 John 2:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/55/3" data-bid="56-4" class="b"> Rev. 13:8</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">25. A review of the new world’s strong foundations leads us to what question and conclusion?</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"><sup>25</sup></span> Thus, in this brief review, we have in a few words endeavored to build up before our mental vision a comprehensive survey of the mighty foundations of the new world, immovable and secure. Viewing these foundations, so well buttressed, we are moved to ask ourselves, repeating the expression already used, Why did God go to all that trouble of making one oathbound promise after another? It is evident <span id="page184" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="184" data-before-text="184"></span>that in Paul’s mind these legal foundations, when rightly appreciated, should act as a spur to our maintaining industriousness down to the end, and to put a stop effectually to any tendency to sluggishness. A consideration of this theme will be taken up in our next article, for now is the day when we need all the encouragement we can get, also to heed the warning divinely given.</p>

<strong>Answering the Roman Governor’s Question, “What Is Truth?”</strong><br/><p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[97]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"><sup>27</sup></span> This prophecy concerning kingship was written in the Bible’s first book, in <span id="page652" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="652" data-before-text="652"></span><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Genesis 49:8-10</a>. However, the book of Genesis was written by Moses. What are now the first five books of the Bible were at first just one book written by Moses. In the days of Jesus Christ, when Jews spoke of the big divisions of the books of the Hebrew Scriptures, the first five Bible books written by Moses were called the Law or “Torah,” so that the book of Genesis came under the heading of “the Law,” the Torah. After being resurrected from the dead Jesus said to his disciples: “These are my words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you [in the flesh], that all the things written in [1] the law of Moses and in [2] the Prophets and [3] Psalms about me must be fulfilled.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Luke 24:44</a>) For that reason the expression “the Law” could include the things written in the book of Genesis, including this prophecy by the patriarch Jacob concerning the kingship in the tribe of Judah.</p><p id="p98" data-pid="98" class="qu">28. (a) For Jesus fully to “bear witness to the truth,” why did he have to be born in a particular family besides in a particular tribe?

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Heb. 7:14</a>) But in order for him fully to “bear witness to the truth,” Jesus’ birth could not be in any unparticular family in the tribe of Judah. His birth had to be in the family line of David of Bethlehem; and it was. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Rom. 1:1-4</a>) Why was this? It was because David of the tribe of Judah was made king of Israel, to succeed King Saul and his son Ish-bosheth, and then Jehovah God made a solemn contract or covenant with King David for the kingship of God’s people to stay in David’s royal family line forever. That meant that at last David would have a permanent heir to the kingdom.

In thus swearing, God was really swearing in behalf of his own kingdom, for King David himself acknowledged that the kingdom over Israel really belonged to Jehovah and that the throne on which he sat in Jerusalem was really “Jehovah’s throne.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:10, 11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 23</a>) Concerning this sworn oath which was to confirm the covenant with David for an everlasting kingdom, we read:</p><p id="p99" data-pid="99" class="qu">29.

His name was Melchizedek, and he was king of the city of Salem and at the same time priest of the Most High God. No creature in heaven or on earth could arrange to make himself king of the new world. It was Jehovah who had to conceive the idea of such a king and to make a covenant or solemn agreement with one whom he wanted to hold this kingship. Jesus Christ is the one whom Jehovah has anointed to be the King, the one with whom he has made the special covenant for the kingdom of the heavens. Since Jesus showed his disciples that the Psalms had so much to say prophetically about him, do we find some psalms speaking of the Kingdom covenant and of Melchizedek? We do. Jehovah chose the family line of King David as the one through whom the Messiah, the anointed King of the new world, should come. So Jehovah made with David a covenant for a permanent kingdom.</p><p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="qu">25.

To time indefinite I shall preserve my loving-kindness toward him, and my covenant will be faithful to him. And I shall certainly set up his seed forever and his throne as the days of heaven. I shall not profane my covenant, and the expression out of my lips I shall not change. Once I have sworn in my holiness, to David I will not tell lies.

If your sons will keep my covenant and my reminders that I shall teach them, their sons also forever will sit upon your throne.’ For Jehovah has chosen Zion; he has longed for it as a dwelling for himself: ‘ . . .

He is a God that faithfully keeps his covenant.</p>

<strong>The Legal Foundations of the New World</strong><br/><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> Did you notice that Paul said that by Jesus’ becoming a high priest by reason of the sworn oath, it really meant that Jesus was “the one given in pledge [guarantee, security] of a better covenant”? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Heb. 7:22</a>, <em>NW</em>) That “better covenant” is the <em>new covenant,</em> and this fact brings us to the third reason in our list. Is it one of the <em>legal</em> foundations of the new world? Indeed it is, as the apostle goes on to clearly prove in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Hebrews, chapters 8 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/44/1" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> 9</a>. He shows that the new covenant succeeds where the former one made with the fleshly house of Israel failed. Quoting from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, where the terms of the new covenant are set forth, Paul explains that God found fault with both the former (Law) covenant and the people under it, as evidenced in the fact that God said of them: “They did not continue in my covenant, so that I stopped caring for them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Heb. 8:9</a>, <em>NW</em>) The former covenant proved inadequate to provide the real remedy and failed to produce a people for Jehovah’s name. In contrast, the new covenant is altogether superior, as Paul shows in detail in the two chapters mentioned (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Hebrews 8 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/47/1" data-bid="48-2" class="b"> 9</a>), and makes the point that Jesus is “the mediator of a correspondingly better covenant, which has been <em>legally established</em> upon better promises.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Heb. 8:6</a>, <em>NW</em>) The new covenant really does produce a people who sincerely delight to do God’s will because his law is written ‘in their minds and upon their hearts.’ It produces a people whose consciences are cleansed through Christ’s shed blood, the adequate remedy, thus enabling them to “render sacred service to the living God” and ultimately gain “the everlasting inheritance” and, with Christ, <span id="page183" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="183" data-before-text="183"></span>form part of the new world’s government.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Heb. 9:14, 15</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">23. In tracing the promised seed, what further oathbound promise is revealed?</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> What is the fourth reason? When God made promise to Abraham, he first said nothing about either a king or a kingdom, but did so later. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Gen. 12:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/50/1" data-bid="51-2" class="b"> 17:15, 16</a>) So, in tracing the promised seed down the line from father Abraham, we come to David, who was made king of Israel, the typical theocracy, by Jehovah’s own choosing and appointment. With David God made a solemn covenant, to which he added his oath-bound promise, expressed in these words: “I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant: thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Ps. 89:3, 4</a>, <em>AS</em>) That David’s kingly seed is Christ Jesus is proved by Peter in his inspired speech to the men of Israel on the day of Pentecost, after the outpouring of the holy spirit, when he said: “Because he [David] was a prophet and knew that God had sworn to him with an oath that he would seat one of his offspring upon his throne, he saw beforehand and spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Acts 2:30, 31</a>, <em>NW;</em> see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Luke 1:32, 33</a>, <em>NW.</em>) Surely, then, we have here another legal foundation of the new world, made legally secure by God’s oathbound promise.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">24. (a) What is the relationship between the ransom and God’s purpose? (b) How is the ransom seen to be one of the new world’s legal foundations?</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> Perhaps some of our readers have been expecting to see Christ’s ransom sacrifice mentioned first, or at least earlier, in our list of reasons. But, no, we have purposely left it till the last. Why? Because God’s <em>purpose,</em> meaning that which he has determined and set before himself as an object to be attained, is more important than the necessary means incidental thereto. We are not minimizing the importance of the ransom as an indispensable means and provision for the attainment of the end in view, and we remember that God’s oathbound promise was given after Abraham’s sacrifice of Isaac, picturing Jehovah’s sacrifice of his only-begotten Son Jesus Christ. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Gen. 22:1-18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/54/1" data-bid="55-2" class="b"> John 3:16</a>) Moreover, it is freely admitted that not one of the foregoing aspects of God’s purpose, covered by the four reasons just discussed, could be successfully carried out unless and until the disability resting upon the entire human family is first removed. By “disability” we mean the legal incapacity, or disqualification, of man with regard to his standing before his Creator, due to inherited sin and crippling imperfection, leading to the grave. But, “just as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned,” so also through a man, “a man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a corresponding ransom for all,” God has graciously provided a “propitiatory sacrifice for our sins, yet not for ours only but also for the whole world’s.” Therefore we gladly and gratefully acknowledge this essential part of the new world’s foundations, legally provided in strict conformity with God’s fundamental law of equity. We thank God for “the Lamb who was slaughtered from the world’s foundation.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/55/1" data-bid="56-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 2:5, 6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/55/2" data-bid="56-3" class="b"> 1 John 2:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1954204/55/3" data-bid="56-4" class="b"> Rev. 13:8</a>, <em>NW.</em></p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">25. A review of the new world’s strong foundations leads us to what question and conclusion?</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"><sup>25</sup></span> Thus, in this brief review, we have in a few words endeavored to build up before our mental vision a comprehensive survey of the mighty foundations of the new world, immovable and secure. Viewing these foundations, so well buttressed, we are moved to ask ourselves, repeating the expression already used, Why did God go to all that trouble of making one oathbound promise after another? It is evident <span id="page184" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="184" data-before-text="184"></span>that in Paul’s mind these legal foundations, when rightly appreciated, should act as a spur to our maintaining industriousness down to the end, and to put a stop effectually to any tendency to sluggishness. A consideration of this theme will be taken up in our next article, for now is the day when we need all the encouragement we can get, also to heed the warning divinely given.</p>

Some of these elements may amount to no more than one hundredth of one percent of the human body, but they are necessary for life. Cooperating in making them available are thousands of millions of living organisms in the soil, of countless different designs, each working to convert dead leaves, grass and other waste matter back to usable form or to loosen up the soil so that air and water can get in.

<strong>Holy Spirit Active in the Invisible Heavenly Realm</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[63]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> Is there any other spirit son of God in heaven who is honored so highly as this one who appears in Daniel’s vision as “a son of man”? No! Who, then, is he? The psalmist identifies him. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101976032/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Psalm 89:26, 27</a> he says: “He himself calls out to me, ‘You are my Father, my God and the Rock of my salvation.’ Also, I myself shall place him as firstborn, The most high of the kings of the earth.” This statement of Jehovah does not refer to King David, with whom God made a covenant for an everlasting kingdom in his royal family line, nor to David’s royal successor, Solomon. Neither of these kings were the firstborn sons of their fathers. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101976032/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Psalm 89:28-37;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101976032/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 2 Samuel 7:4-17</a>) The later facts show that Jehovah was referring prophetically to his own “firstborn” in heaven, the Son who had been with him for time indefinite before Jehovah God created man.</p><p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu">21.

It is the special means by which Jehovah will vindicate his position as the universal Sovereign Lord. In this kingdom he has a representative of his on the throne, one whom he anoints to be King. Early after the flood of Noah’s day Jehovah raised up a king on earth who foreshadowed Jehovah’s anointed King of the new world. His name was Melchizedek, and he was king of the city of Salem and at the same time priest of the Most High God. No creature in heaven or on earth could arrange to make himself king of the new world. It was Jehovah who had to conceive the idea of such a king and to make a covenant or solemn agreement with one whom he wanted to hold this kingship. Jesus Christ is the one whom Jehovah has anointed to be the King, the one with whom he has made the special covenant for the kingdom of the heavens. Since Jesus showed his disciples that the Psalms had so much to say prophetically about him, do we find some psalms speaking of the Kingdom covenant and of Melchizedek? We do. Jehovah chose the family line of King David as the one through whom the Messiah, the anointed King of the new world, should come.

I shall not profane my covenant, and the expression out of my lips I shall not change. Once I have sworn in my holiness, to David I will not tell lies.

Jehovah has sworn to David, truly he will not draw back from it: ‘Of the fruitage of your belly I shall set on your throne. If your sons will keep my covenant and my reminders that I shall teach them, their sons also forever will sit upon your throne.’ For Jehovah has chosen Zion; he has longed for it as a dwelling for himself: ‘ . . . There I shall cause the horn of David to grow. I have set in order a lamp for my anointed one.

He is a God that faithfully keeps his covenant.</p>

No! Who, then, is he? The psalmist identifies him. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101976032/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Psalm 89:26, 27</a> he says: “He himself calls out to me, ‘You are my Father, my God and the Rock of my salvation.’ Also, I myself shall place him as firstborn, The most high of the kings of the earth.” This statement of Jehovah does not refer to King David, with whom God made a covenant for an everlasting kingdom in his royal family line, nor to David’s royal successor, Solomon. Neither of these kings were the firstborn sons of their fathers. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101976032/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Psalm 89:28-37;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101976032/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 2 Samuel 7:4-17</a>) The later facts show that Jehovah was referring prophetically to his own “firstborn” in heaven, the Son who had been with him for time indefinite before Jehovah God created man.</p><p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="qu">21.

In answer to that question, the one who proved to be that “firstborn” speaks for himself.

<strong>Tracing the Human Line of Descent of the “Seed”</strong><br/><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> However, since this promised ruler was to be a “son” of King David, why would David refer to him as “My Lord”? This was due to the fact that this outstanding “son of David” would be a king far higher than David. Although David sat on the “throne of Jehovah” on earthly Mount Zion, he never, even at his death, ascended to heaven and sat down on the “right hand” of Jehovah. But the one who would become David’s “Lord” would do so. His royal position at Jehovah’s right hand in heaven could be referred to as a heavenly Mount Zion because it was pictured by the earthly Mount Zion, which used to be enclosed within Jerusalem’s walls but is not so today.

<strong>Firstborn, Firstling</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The firstborn is primarily the oldest son of a father (rather than the firstborn of the mother), the beginning of the father’s generative power (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deut. 21:17</a>); also, the initial male offspring <span id="page584" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="584" data-before-text="584"></span>of animals, at times designated as “firstlings.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 4:4</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">From earliest times the firstborn son held an honored position in the family and was the one who succeeded to the headship of the household. He inherited a double portion of the father’s property. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Deut. 21:17</a>) Reuben was seated by Joseph at a meal according to his right as firstborn. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 43:33</a>) But the Bible does not always honor the firstborn by listing sons according to birth. The first place is often given to the most prominent or faithful of the sons rather than to the firstborn.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 6:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 1:28</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Genesis 11:26,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 12:4</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The firstborn came into considerable prominence at the time that Jehovah delivered his people from slavery in Egypt. Among the Egyptians, the firstborn were dedicated as sacred to the sun-god Amon-Ra, the supposed preserver of all the firstborn. The tenth plague that Jehovah brought upon the Egyptians served to discredit this god and showed up his inability to protect the firstborn. By obeying God’s instructions concerning the slaying of a lamb and the splashing of its blood on the doorposts and upper part of the doorway of their houses, the Israelites did not lose their firstborn in death, whereas all the firstborn of the Egyptians, both of man and beast, were slain. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ex. 12:21-23,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 28, 29</a>) Evidently the firstborn son of each household is meant in most cases and not the head of the household, who may have been a firstborn. Pharaoh himself was probably a firstborn and yet his life was not taken. However it may be that not every Egyptian household had a literal firstborn son (the married couple being childless or the firstborn son having already died), and in view of the statement at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Exodus 12:30</a>, “there was not a house where there was not one dead,” the destruction could have included the chief one in the house occupying the <em>position</em> of firstborn.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Since the firstborn sons among the Israelites were those in line to become the heads of the various households, they represented the entire nation. Jehovah, in fact, referred to the whole nation as his “first-born,” it being his firstborn nation because of the Abrahamic covenant. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ex. 4:22</a>) In view of his having preserved their lives, Jehovah commanded that “every male first-born that opens each womb among the sons of Israel, among men and beasts,” be sanctified to him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ex. 13:2</a>) Thus, the firstborn sons were devoted to God.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Later Jehovah took the male Levites, evidently aside from the 300 Levite firstborn (compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Numbers 3:21, 22,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 27, 28,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 33, 34</a> with 3:39), in place of the firstborn sons of Israel, from those one month old and upward. A ransom price of five shekels had to be paid to Aaron and his sons for each of the 273 in excess of the Levites. Also, Jehovah took the domestic animals of the Levites in place of the firstborn domestic animals of the other tribes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Num. 3:40-48</a>) From that time forward, a firstborn son was to be presented to Jehovah at the tabernacle or temple after the period of the mother’s uncleanness and be redeemed by the payment of the estimated value for those from a month up to five years old, “five silver shekels by the shekel of the holy place.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Lev. 12:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 27:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/12/2" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> Num. 18:15, 16</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The firstborn males of clean animals, such as the bull, lamb or goat, were not to be redeemed.

Otherwise, its neck was to be broken, since it belonged to Jehovah and was not to be used by man. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ex. 13:12, 13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 34:19, 20</a>) However, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011483/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Leviticus 27:27</a> reads: “If it is among the unclean beasts and he must redeem it according to the estimated value, he must then give a fifth of it in addition to it. But if it should not be bought back, it must then be sold according to the estimated value.” Some commentators view this text as a modification of the regulation concerning the redeeming of an ass.

It is the special means by which Jehovah will vindicate his position as the universal Sovereign Lord. In this kingdom he has a representative of his on the throne, one whom he anoints to be King. Early after the flood of Noah’s day Jehovah raised up a king on earth who foreshadowed Jehovah’s anointed King of the new world. His name was Melchizedek, and he was king of the city of Salem and at the same time priest of the Most High God. No creature in heaven or on earth could arrange to make himself king of the new world. It was Jehovah who had to conceive the idea of such a king and to make a covenant or solemn agreement with one whom he wanted to hold this kingship. Jesus Christ is the one whom Jehovah has anointed to be the King, the one with whom he has made the special covenant for the kingdom of the heavens. Since Jesus showed his disciples that the Psalms had so much to say prophetically about him, do we find some psalms speaking of the Kingdom covenant and of Melchizedek? We do. Jehovah chose the family line of King David as the one through whom the Messiah, the anointed King of the new world, should come. So Jehovah made with David a covenant for a permanent kingdom.</p><p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="qu">25.

It is the special means by which Jehovah will vindicate his position as the universal Sovereign Lord. In this kingdom he has a representative of his on the throne, one whom he anoints to be King. Early after the flood of Noah’s day Jehovah raised up a king on earth who foreshadowed Jehovah’s anointed King of the new world. His name was Melchizedek, and he was king of the city of Salem and at the same time priest of the Most High God. No creature in heaven or on earth could arrange to make himself king of the new world. It was Jehovah who had to conceive the idea of such a king and to make a covenant or solemn agreement with one whom he wanted to hold this kingship. Jesus Christ is the one whom Jehovah has anointed to be the King, the one with whom he has made the special covenant for the kingdom of the heavens. Since Jesus showed his disciples that the Psalms had so much to say prophetically about him, do we find some psalms speaking of the Kingdom covenant and of Melchizedek? We do. Jehovah chose the family line of King David as the one through whom the Messiah, the anointed King of the new world, should come. So Jehovah made with David a covenant for a permanent kingdom.</p><p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="qu">25.

He is a God that faithfully keeps his covenant.</p>

<strong>Jesus’ Birth—How It Brings Peace</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Gabriel explained: “Look! you will conceive in your womb and give birth to a son, and you are to call his name Jesus. This one will be great and will be called Son of the Most High; and Jehovah God will give him the throne of David his father, and he will rule as king over the house of Jacob forever, and there will be no end of his kingdom.” Mary questioned how this was to be, since she, a virgin, was not having intercourse with a man. Gabriel responded that the child would be conceived by means of God’s holy spirit. This would be no ordinary child.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006921/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 1:28-35</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>A Foretold King</strong></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Gabriel’s words must have helped Mary to discern that the son she would bear was the subject of ancient prophecies. The disclosure that Jehovah would give Mary’s son “the throne of David his father” would make her​—and indeed any Jewish person acquainted with the Scriptures—​think of the promise that God had made to King David of Israel.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Through the prophet Nathan, Jehovah had told David: “Your house and your kingdom will certainly be steadfast to time indefinite before you; your very throne will become one firmly established to time indefinite.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006921/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Samuel 7:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2006921/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 16</a>) Jehovah stated concerning David: “I shall certainly set up his seed forever and his throne as the days of heaven.

The period of Gentile world supremacy without interference from a typical kingdom of God at Jerusalem would continue on until the coming of the one “who has the legal right,” that is to say, the promised true Messiah, and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah would give the kingdom to him. The Gentile world powers would then be no longer on top to dominate the earth. The Messianic kingdom would take world control.

Jesus Christ is the one whom Jehovah has anointed to be the King, the one with whom he has made the special covenant for the kingdom of the heavens. Since Jesus showed his disciples that the Psalms had so much to say prophetically about him, do we find some psalms speaking of the Kingdom covenant and of Melchizedek? We do.

His seed itself will prove to be even to time indefinite, and his throne as the sun in front of me.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101972763/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 89:29,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101972763/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 36</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Over the centuries God also indicated in his Word many of the blessings the righteous rule of this promised “seed” would bring to mankind.

For this to become true, the Heir of David’s everlasting kingdom must be born on earth in David’s line. His birth was foretold, and it was to mark a turning point in history. Another prophecy of the birth of this Prince was made by the prophet Isaiah at a time when the kingdom of the royal house of David at Jerusalem was threatened by an alliance of enemy nations. To the king then ruling, Isaiah said:</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[92]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> “Hear ye, therefore, O house of David: Is it a small thing for you to be grievous to men, that you are grievous to my God also?

It is noted in the records of history that are beyond denial and that cannot be wiped out, to prove that the Lord of hosts has performed this miraculous birth, as he promised that he would do. A tax collector of the Roman Empire, named Matthew Levi, explains how the birth occurred by divine power. He names the virgin mother as Mary. To call attention to the fact that this was a fulfillment of the prophecy of the Lord of hosts by means of Isaiah, Matthew Levi says: “Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which the Lord spoke by the prophet, saying: <em>Behold a virgin shall be with child, and bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel,</em> which being interpreted is, <em>God with us.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965761/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 1:22, 23</a>, <em>Dy</em>) According to God’s command, the child was named Jesus.</p><p id="p94" data-pid="94" class="qu">24, 25.

It is the special means by which Jehovah will vindicate his position as the universal Sovereign Lord. In this kingdom he has a representative of his on the throne, one whom he anoints to be King. Early after the flood of Noah’s day Jehovah raised up a king on earth who foreshadowed Jehovah’s anointed King of the new world. His name was Melchizedek, and he was king of the city of Salem and at the same time priest of the Most High God. No creature in heaven or on earth could arrange to make himself king of the new world. It was Jehovah who had to conceive the idea of such a king and to make a covenant or solemn agreement with one whom he wanted to hold this kingship. Jesus Christ is the one whom Jehovah has anointed to be the King, the one with whom he has made the special covenant for the kingdom of the heavens. Since Jesus showed his disciples that the Psalms had so much to say prophetically about him, do we find some psalms speaking of the Kingdom covenant and of Melchizedek? We do. Jehovah chose the family line of King David as the one through whom the Messiah, the anointed King of the new world, should come. So Jehovah made with David a covenant for a permanent kingdom.</p><p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="qu">25.

To time indefinite I shall preserve my loving-kindness toward him, and my covenant will be faithful to him. And I shall certainly set up his seed forever and his throne as the days of heaven. I shall not profane my covenant, and the expression out of my lips I shall not change. Once I have sworn in my holiness, to David I will not tell lies.

Jehovah has sworn to David, truly he will not draw back from it: ‘Of the fruitage of your belly I shall set on your throne. If your sons will keep my covenant and my reminders that I shall teach them, their sons also forever will sit upon your throne.’ For Jehovah has chosen Zion; he has longed for it as a dwelling for himself: ‘ . . . There I shall cause the horn of David to grow. I have set in order a lamp for my anointed one. His enemies I shall clothe with shame, but upon him his diadem will flourish.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Ps. 132:10-18</a>) Since the Kingdom is the powerful means by which Jehovah has chosen to vindicate his universal sovereignty, how could we even think that Jehovah would draw back what he has solemnly sworn to King David even though it was thirty centuries ago! He is a God that faithfully keeps his covenant.</p>

<strong>Are You a Loyal Christian?</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">It will help us to understand the exact meaning of “loyal” if we compare it with another word with which it has much in common, although it is not wholly synonymous <span id="page550" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="550" data-before-text="550"></span>with it, namely, “faithful.” For example, an animal, such as a dog, can be said to be faithful, for to be faithful means to be dependable, to be constant. But a dog cannot be spoken of as being loyal, because loyalty always includes principle, which only free moral agents, such as man, are able to exercise.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The difference between the two terms can also be seen from the fact that it is common to speak of certain inanimate things that are regular or dependable as being faithful. For instance, such inanimate things as the sun, moon and stars may be spoken of as faithful, or dependable, but they are not capable of personal attachment or of moral stability.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964681/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 89:37</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>LOYALTY TO GOD</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Since loyalty is such a fine quality, it is to be expected that the Creator would require it of his creatures. And in doing so he is consistent, for he himself is loyal. As God-fearing David expressed it: “With someone loyal you will act in loyalty; with the faultless, mighty one you will deal faultlessly.” Expressing a similar thought, we find God pleading by means of his prophet Jeremiah with the nation of Israel, which had become renegade, to return to Him, “for I am loyal.” Being loyal in a way that none of his creatures can be, he is spoken of in the Bible as the only one loyal: “Who will not really fear you, Jehovah, and glorify your name, because you alone are loyal?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964681/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Sam. 22:26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964681/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Jer. 3:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964681/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Rev. 15:4</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">What does it mean to be loyal to God? It means to be steadfast in a strong love for him, recognizing one’s obligation to him as the great Sovereign and Benefactor. To be loyal to God means to be governed by his will as that will is made known in his Word, the Bible. Every day you have opportunities to show that you are loyal to God. You show such loyalty when you let yourself be guided by his righteous principles instead of selfishness; when you are not ashamed to do what is right even though it is unpopular and brings ridicule upon you. In particular do you show you are loyal to God when you are not ashamed to confess him before men, when, with freeness of speech, you witness to his existence, his righteous qualities and his purposes for man.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Of course, as a Christian you would never be disloyal to any government under which you live nor to the employer for whom you work, nor to your marriage partner, yet you should always bear in mind that being loyal to your God comes first. Your loyalty to God may at times circumscribe your loyalty to others, but it will never make you disloyal to them. For example, your loyalty to God may preclude your attending the same house of worship as does your wife, but you will not be disloyal to her by having an affair with another woman. In other words, your loyalty to God alone is absolute, to all others it is relative, but only because of its being absolute in relation to God.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>LOYALTY BETWEEN CREATURES</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Have you entered into a marital relationship? If so, you and your mate have entered into a mutual agreement to be loyal to each other and this loyalty should be shown not only in big things but also in little ones. Are you a husband? Loyalty not only requires that you provide for your wife but that you limit your sex interest, or attempts to derive sexual pleasure, to your wife. For a married man to flirt with other women may seem a trifle, but it is disloyalty nevertheless and can easily lead to more serious, grosser forms of disloyalty.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964681/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Prov. 5:15-20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964681/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Matt. 5:28</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Among other ways in which you can show your loyalty to your wife is by being careful not to make any disparaging <span id="page551" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="551" data-before-text="551"></span>remarks about her or betray to others any of her weaknesses that you may get to know so well because of living so intimately with her.

It is the special means by which Jehovah will vindicate his position as the universal Sovereign Lord. In this kingdom he has a representative of his on the throne, one whom he anoints to be King. Early after the flood of Noah’s day Jehovah raised up a king on earth who foreshadowed Jehovah’s anointed King of the new world. His name was Melchizedek, and he was king of the city of Salem and at the same time priest of the Most High God. No creature in heaven or on earth could arrange to make himself king of the new world. It was Jehovah who had to conceive the idea of such a king and to make a covenant or solemn agreement with one whom he wanted to hold this kingship. Jesus Christ is the one whom Jehovah has anointed to be the King, the one with whom he has made the special covenant for the kingdom of the heavens. Since Jesus showed his disciples that the Psalms had so much to say prophetically about him, do we find some psalms speaking of the Kingdom covenant and of Melchizedek? We do. Jehovah chose the family line of King David as the one through whom the Messiah, the anointed King of the new world, should come. So Jehovah made with David a covenant for a permanent kingdom.</p><p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="qu">25.

To time indefinite I shall preserve my loving-kindness toward him, and my covenant will be faithful to him. And I shall certainly set up his seed forever and his throne as the days of heaven. I shall not profane my covenant, and the expression out of my lips I shall not change. Once I have sworn in my holiness, to David I will not tell lies. His seed itself will prove to be even to time indefinite and his throne as the sun in front of me.

Jehovah has sworn to David, truly he will not draw back from it: ‘Of the fruitage of your belly I shall set on your throne. If your sons will keep my covenant and my reminders that I shall teach them, their sons also forever will sit upon your throne.’ For Jehovah has chosen Zion; he has longed for it as a dwelling for himself: ‘ . . . There I shall cause the horn of David to grow. I have set in order a lamp for my anointed one. His enemies I shall clothe with shame, but upon him his diadem will flourish.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Ps. 132:10-18</a>) Since the Kingdom is the powerful means by which Jehovah has chosen to vindicate his universal sovereignty, how could we even think that Jehovah would draw back what he has solemnly sworn to King David even though it was thirty centuries ago! He is a God that faithfully keeps his covenant.</p>

This is a place of nonexistence, unconsciousness, where the dead must remain until God resurrects them. They are completely dead, but not without hope.</p>

<strong>Part Two</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> It was Almighty God, whose name is Jehovah, who miraculously brought up Jonah the prophet out of the belly of the huge fish on the third day. This same God, Jehovah, brought up his faithful prophet <span id="page46" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="46" data-before-text="46"></span>Jesus Christ out of the “heart of the earth” on the third day. Hence the deliverance of Jonah was a prophetic picture of the resurrection of the Son of God from the dead. After his resurrection the “keys of death and of Haʹdes” were given to Jesus Christ, that he might be God’s Agent in raising all the others who are in Haʹdes or Sheol and in the condition of death. No man can, by his own means and arrangements, escape death and Sheol or Haʹdes, the grave that is common to dead mankind in the dust of the earth.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">10.

Is it all in vain that you have created all the sons of men? What able-bodied man is there alive who will not see death? Can he provide escape for his soul from the hand of Sheol?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 89:47, 48</a>) For this reason those dedicated Christians today who will survive the coming battle of Armageddon and enter into a righteous new order on earth with the opportunity of never dying will survive only by means of God’s miraculous power of protection and preservation. Likewise, those who die and are buried in Sheol or Haʹdes cannot come up out of that place of death and decay by their own power. The deathly diseased prophet Job spoke of this inability of man when he mournfully said: “The eye of him that sees me will not behold me; your eyes will be upon me, but I shall not be. The cloud certainly comes to its end and goes away; so he that is going down to Sheol will not come up.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 7:8, 9</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">11.

For he sees that even the wise ones die, together the stupid one and the unreasoning one perish, and they must leave to others their means of maintenance.” Unlike a materialistic rich man, the inspired psalmist trusts in Almighty God Jehovah and says: “However, God himself will redeem my soul from the hand of Sheol, for he will receive me.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 49:15</a>.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">12.

The mother of the prophet Samuel voiced that same fact when she said: “Jehovah is a Killer and a Preserver of life, a Bringer down to Sheol, and He brings up.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Sam. 2:6</a>) Mary, the mother of Jesus, spoke in praise to Jehovah with a similar thought in mind.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Luke 1:46-55</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>DEAD OR CONSCIOUSLY ALIVE—WHICH?</strong></p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">13.

That is why numbers of Bible translators render these two words into English as “the grave” (not, a grave). The <em>Authorized Version</em> or King James Bible Version renders the Hebrew word Sheol as “the grave” thirty-one times and as “the pit” three times, and the Greek word Haʹdes as “grave” once (in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965042/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:55</a>). But for centuries the religious clergy of Christendom have taught that Haʹdes is a place of fiery torment. So now our question is, What is the condition of people who are dead in Sheol or Haʹdes? Are they consciously alive as immortals, or are they really dead and out of existence? What does God’s own Word, the Holy Bible, not the clergy of Christendom, say in answer to this question?</p>

Thus the psalmist complains: “I have become like an able-bodied man without strength.” It would not have made much of a point had he said he became like a weak mortal, an <em>enósh,</em> because such a one does not have strength to begin with! Making the same point, Solomon observed that it is not good that “an able-bodied man should transgress over a mere piece of bread.” There might be an excuse for an <em>enósh</em> to do so, but certainly not a <em>geber.</em> The bad news he received caused Jeremiah’s bones to shake like “an able-bodied man whom wine has overcome,” hence a violent shaking. He also stressed the wretchedness of the men of Israel by employing this term: “Why is it that I have seen every able-bodied man with his hands upon his loins like a female that is giving birth, and all faces have turned pale?” Yes, this was serious when even able-bodied men, not mere <em>enósh</em> or weak mortals, were affected in this way!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 88:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Prov. 28:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/20/2" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> Jer. 23:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/20/3" data-bid="21-4" class="b"> 30:6</a>.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Logically we are told that “one wise in strength is,” not an <em>adám, ish</em> or <em>enósh,</em> but a <em>geber,</em> “an able-bodied man.” A wise <em>geber</em> trusts not in his own strength but in Jehovah: “Blessed is the able-bodied man who puts his trust in Jehovah, and whose confidence Jehovah has become.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Prov. 24:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962045/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Jer. 17:7</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Truly, to note the way “man” is used in the Hebrew Scriptures strengthens our faith and helps us to get God’s view on man.

<strong>What Is the Destiny of the Wicked?</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Further, if Jesus’ words regarding the destiny of the wicked are to be taken literally, is it not passing strange that, while the Bible tells us of God creating heaven and earth, it says nothing about his creating <span id="page132" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="132" data-before-text="132"></span>a place of eternal torment, nor of a purgatory, for that matter? When was hell created? Before any of God’s creatures sinned, or only thereafter? And where is it?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The question also is raised as to what it is that goes to hell. Certainly not the physical body, for it returns to the dust. The soul? But what is the soul? Is it, as claimed by Augustine, an immortal spiritual substance, created by God at the time of the conception of a human, and which at death goes to heaven, purgatory or hell?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Not according to God’s Word. It tells us that when God created man he “came to <em>be</em> a living soul,” also that because of sin no man is able to “deliver his soul from the hand of the grave.” Thus also Samson prayed: “Let my soul die with the Philistines.” Yes, plainly we read: “The soul that is sinning—it itself will die.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961160/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 2:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961160/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Ps. 89:48</a>, <em>AV;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961160/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Judg. 16:30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961160/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Ezek. 18:20</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">What is generally overlooked is that what God placed before Adam were not the alternatives of life in heaven and life in eternal torment, but life (existence) and death (nonexistence). God said nothing about Adam’s going to heaven, but only that “in the day you eat from [the tree of the knowledge of good and bad] you will positively die.” And so when Adam and Eve disobeyed, God did not sentence them to an eternity of torture but to nonexistence: “Dust you are and to dust you will return.” God used Moses to put the same alternatives before his people: “I have put life and death before you.” And so we also read that “the wages sin pays is death, but the gift God gives is everlasting life.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961160/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gen. 2:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961160/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 3:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961160/6/2" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Deut. 30:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961160/6/3" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> Rom. 6:23</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">This is logical, reasonable and just. If life is a gift, as the Scriptures state, it can be refused. Were man born with an immortal soul, he would have an eternity forced upon him with an ultimatum of obey or suffer torment forever. That would show about as much love as would be shown by a young man who would offer a young lady an engagement ring with the alternative of blowing her brains out!</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Then how are we to understand the words of Jesus quoted above in support of eternal torment for the wicked? As figures of speech, as indeed they must be in view of their context. When Jesus spoke of plucking out an eye or chopping off a foot or hand, did he mean for us literally to perform mayhem upon ourselves, and would we then throughout eternity dwell in heaven with but one eye, one hand, one foot? Of course not! Since these words are to be understood figuratively, or as symbols, so must Jesus’ references to the worm not dying and the fire not being quenched. The same is true of his parable of the sheep and goats. Even as he was not referring to literal sheep and goats but to sheeplike and goatlike people, so he was not referring to literal fire but to firelike complete destruction.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The false religious teaching that eternal torment is the destiny of the wicked blasphemes God and turns honest persons away from him. But the truth honors him and shows him to be wise, just and loving. Those who love and obey God will receive his gifts, chief of which is life. Those who do not, the wicked, will be extinct, without life.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">In this space age God is again putting before all mankind the alternatives of life and death. Fulfillment of Bible prophecy shows that we are living in the days Jesus likened to those of Noah. Even as Noah and his family survived the Deluge because of knowing and doing God’s will, so today only those who know and do God’s will will survive the impending destruction of Armageddon. To help you toward that end is one of the purposes of this magazine.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961160/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 24:37-39</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Answering the Roman Governor’s Question, “What Is Truth?”</strong><br/><p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[97]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="27"><sup>27</sup></span> This prophecy concerning kingship was written in the Bible’s first book, in <span id="page652" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="652" data-before-text="652"></span><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Genesis 49:8-10</a>. However, the book of Genesis was written by Moses. What are now the first five books of the Bible were at first just one book written by Moses. In the days of Jesus Christ, when Jews spoke of the big divisions of the books of the Hebrew Scriptures, the first five Bible books written by Moses were called the Law or “Torah,” so that the book of Genesis came under the heading of “the Law,” the Torah. After being resurrected from the dead Jesus said to his disciples: “These are my words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you [in the flesh], that all the things written in [1] the law of Moses and in [2] the Prophets and [3] Psalms about me must be fulfilled.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Luke 24:44</a>) For that reason the expression “the Law” could include the things written in the book of Genesis, including this prophecy by the patriarch Jacob concerning the kingship in the tribe of Judah.</p><p id="p98" data-pid="98" class="qu">28. (a) For Jesus fully to “bear witness to the truth,” why did he have to be born in a particular family besides in a particular tribe?

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Heb. 7:14</a>) But in order for him fully to “bear witness to the truth,” Jesus’ birth could not be in any unparticular family in the tribe of Judah. His birth had to be in the family line of David of Bethlehem; and it was. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Rom. 1:1-4</a>) Why was this? It was because David of the tribe of Judah was made king of Israel, to succeed King Saul and his son Ish-bosheth, and then Jehovah God made a solemn contract or covenant with King David for the kingship of God’s people to stay in David’s royal family line forever. That meant that at last David would have a permanent heir to the kingdom.

In thus swearing, God was really swearing in behalf of his own kingdom, for King David himself acknowledged that the kingdom over Israel really belonged to Jehovah and that the throne on which he sat in Jerusalem was really “Jehovah’s throne.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:10, 11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 23</a>) Concerning this sworn oath which was to confirm the covenant with David for an everlasting kingdom, we read:</p><p id="p99" data-pid="99" class="qu">29.

I shall not profane my covenant, and the expression out of my lips I shall not change. Once I have sworn in my holiness, to David I will not tell lies.

<strong>Ambassador</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Unlike modern-day ambassadors, ancient envoys or messengers, since they did not reside in foreign <span id="page64" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="64" data-before-text="64"></span>capitals, were dispatched only on special occasions for specific purposes. Often they were persons of rank (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:17, 18</a>) and their office was highly respected. Consequently, they were accorded inviolability of person when they visited other rulers.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The treatment accorded a ruler’s messengers or envoys was considered as done toward the ruler and his government. Thus, when Rahab showed favor to the messengers sent as spies to Jericho by Joshua, she really was acting as she did because she recognized that Jehovah was the God and King of Israel. Jehovah, through Joshua showed her favor accordingly. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Josh. 6:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Heb. 11:31</a>) A flagrant violation of the unwritten international custom of respect toward envoys was the action of Hanun the king of Ammon, to whom King David sent some servants in a gesture of friendship. The king of Ammon listened to his princes, who falsely called the messengers spies, and publicly humiliated them, demonstrating his disrespect for David and his government. This disgraceful action led to war.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Sam. 10:2–11:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 12:26-31</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Opposite to the modern-day practice of recalling an ambassador when diplomatic relations are broken with a government, the people of ancient times sent messengers or envoys as spokesmen to one another during times of strain in an effort to reestablish peaceful relations. Isaiah speaks of such “messengers of peace.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isa. 33:7</a>) Hezekiah sent a peace appeal to Sennacherib the king of Assyria. Although Sennacherib was threatening the fortified cities of Judah, the messengers were given freedom of passage by the Assyrians because they were acting as Hezekiah’s envoys. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Ki. 18:13-15</a>) Another example of this can be seen in the record about Jephthah, a judge in Israel. He dispatched messengers with a letter of remonstration against wrong action on the part of the king of the Ammonites and to clear up a dispute over territorial rights. If possible, Jephthah, through his envoys, would have settled the matter without war. These messengers were permitted to pass back and forth between the armies without hindrance.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010229/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Judg. 11:12-28</a>; see MESSENGER.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"></p>
