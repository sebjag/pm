<strong>Gate, Gateway</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The Gate of the Old City was located on the NW side of the city between the Fish Gate and the Gate of Ephraim. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Neh. 3:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/51/1" data-bid="52-2" class="b"> 12:39</a>) In Hebrew, the gate is called simply “Gate of the Old,” the word “city” being supplied by some translators. It is suggested that the name was derived from its having been the main N entrance to the old city. It may have been at the junction of the Broad Wall (that formed a N boundary of the old city) and the S end of the W wall of the second quarter. Some think that this gate is identical with the “First Gate” mentioned by Zechariah. He seemingly refers to the E-W limits of the city in saying “from [1] the gate of Benjamin <span id="page626" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="626" data-before-text="626"></span>all the way to the place of [2] the First Gate, all the way to [3] the Corner Gate,” and to the N-S limits in saying “from the Tower of Hananel all the way to the press vats of the king.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Zech. 14:10</a>) If so, this places the First Gate E of the Corner Gate, possibly naming, from E to W, (1) the gate in or near the E corner, (2) the gate at the angle where the walls of the second quarter and the old city meet, and (3) the gate in the NW corner of the old city wall. Hence this would allow for the above-suggested identity of the First Gate with the Gate of the Old City. Others would connect the Gate of the Old City with the “Middle Gate” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Jeremiah 39:3</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong><em>Gate of Ephraim</em></strong></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">The Gate of Ephraim was located in the Broad Wall 400 cubits (c. 583 feet [c. 178 meters]) E of the Corner Gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">2 Ki. 14:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/54/1" data-bid="55-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 25:23</a>) It was an exit N in the direction of the territory of Ephraim. It, too, has been identified by some researchers with the Middle Gate (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Jer. 39:3</a>), by others with the First Gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Zech. 14:10</a>) It is thought to be (or correspond to) the Gennath or Garden Gate spoken of by the Jewish historian Josephus. There was a public square near the Gate of Ephraim, in which the people made booths to celebrate the Festival of Booths in Nehemiah’s time. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Neh. 8:16</a>) This gate is not named in Nehemiah’s reconstruction text, evidently because it did not need extensive repairs.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="ss"><strong><em>Corner Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">This gate was evidently located in the NW angle of the city wall, 400 cubits (c. 583 feet [c. 178 meters]) along the Broad Wall W of the Gate of Ephraim. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/58/0" data-bid="59-1" class="b">2 Ki. 14:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/58/1" data-bid="59-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 25:23</a>) It was on the E side of the Valley of Hinnom, apparently in the W wall of the old city at the point where it joined the Broad Wall. Uzziah built a tower by this gate; whether or not it was the Tower of the Bake Ovens is not stated. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:9</a>) Both Jeremiah and Zechariah appear to refer to the Corner Gate as being on the western edge of the city. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/60/0" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Jer. 31:38;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/60/1" data-bid="61-2" class="b"> Zech. 14:10</a>) Some think the Corner Gate is the same as the First Gate, but the statement in the book of Zechariah seems to weigh against this view as to its location, for, apparently describing the E-W limits, Zechariah wrote, “from the gate of Benjamin all the way to the place of the First Gate, all the way to the Corner Gate,” thus evidently placing the First Gate E of the Corner Gate.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">There is no other gate described as existing in the W wall from the Corner Gate to the Valley Gate at the S end, this no doubt being because of the steep slope of the Hinnom valley, making any other gate impractical. The Corner Gate does not appear in Nehemiah’s accounts; again the reason may be that it did not need extensive repairs. The account does speak of repairing the Tower of the Bake Ovens, which seems to have been a part of, or near, the Corner Gate.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Neh. 3:11</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="ss"><strong><em>Valley Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">At the SW corner of the city wall, the Valley Gate led to the Valley of Hinnom, and corresponds to the modern Jaffa Gate. Josephus’ “Gate of the Essenes” may have been located here or nearby. Uzziah, in his city-fortification program, built a tower by this gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/62/0" data-bid="63-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:9</a>) It was from the Valley Gate that Nehemiah went out for his inspection of the damaged wall, riding eastward through the Valley of Hinnom and then up the Kidron valley, finally reentering the city by the same gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/63/0" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Neh. 2:13-15</a>) Although not named as such, the Valley Gate appears to be the point at which the inauguration procession started, one group marching counterclockwise around the walls past the Gate of the Ash-heaps and the other clockwise past the Corner Gate and the Tower of the Bake Ovens.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Neh. 12:31-40</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="ss"><strong><em>Gate of the Ash-heaps</em></strong></p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">This gate is also known as the <em>Gate of the Potsherds,</em> and is usually called the <em>Dung Gate</em>. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/65/0" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Neh. 2:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/65/1" data-bid="66-2" class="b"> 12:31</a>) Nehemiah’s description seems to place it 1,000 cubits (c. 1,458 feet [c. 444 meters]) E of the Valley Gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/66/0" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Neh. 3:13, 14</a>) It was at the SE corner of the city wall, and led to the Valley of Hinnom near the point where it joined the Tyropean valley. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/67/0" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Jer. 19:2</a>) It was from this gate that Topheth in the Valley of Hinnom was reached by those idolatrously burning their children in the fire to Baal. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/68/0" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Jer. 19:5, 6</a>) It was also the gate through which Jeremiah led some of the older men and priests of Israel and proclaimed calamity to Jerusalem, breaking an earthenware flask to illustrate God’s breaking of the people for their serving of other gods.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/69/0" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Jer. 19:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/69/1" data-bid="70-2" class="b"> 10, 11</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">The name “Gate of the Potsherds” may have been given because fragments of pottery were thrown near there as refuse, or because fragments of pottery were ground there, the dust from which was used to make cement for plastering cisterns (as has been done in modern times near a pool at the SW corner of the city). Also, there may have been a potter’s industry near this gate, for there was clay nearby in the Valley of Hinnom as well as a water supply at the mouth of the Tyropean valley and at the spring En-rogel. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/70/0" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Jeremiah 18:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/70/1" data-bid="71-2" class="b"> 19:1, 2</a>.) The “potter’s field” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/71/0" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Matt. 27:7, 8</a>) has, since the fourth century C.E., been traditionally considered to be located on the S side of the Valley of Hinnom.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="ss"><strong><em>Fountain Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">This gate was so called because of its giving access to a spring or fountain nearby, perhaps En-rogel, which was below the junction of the Kidron Valley and the Valley of Hinnom. Probably it was at the S tip of the E hill of the city (that is, at the southern end of the “City of David”). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/72/0" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Neh. 2:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/72/1" data-bid="73-2" class="b"> 3:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/72/2" data-bid="73-3" class="b"> 12:37</a>) The Fountain Gate would afford convenient exit and access to En-rogel for those living in the City of David, while the Gate of the Ash-heaps, not far to the SW, would also lead out toward En-rogel and would likely be a better exit for the residents of the Tyropean valley and the SW hill of the city.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="ss"><strong><em>Water Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">The name of this gate may have been derived from its proximity, or at least its access, to the Spring of Gihon about midway up the E side of the city. This gate was near Ophel, not far from the Temple area. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/73/0" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Neh. 3:26</a>) The Water Gate was where one of the groups of the inauguration procession left the wall, proceeding from there to the Temple, where they assembled with the other group, apparently not traversing that part of the city wall to the E of the Temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/74/0" data-bid="75-1" class="b">Neh. 12:37-40</a>) There was a public square before this gate in which all the people gathered to hear Ezra read the Law, and where they afterward built booths to celebrate the Festival of Booths.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/75/0" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Neh. 8:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/75/1" data-bid="76-2" class="b"> 16</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="ss"><strong><em>Horse Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb">Repair work above the Horse Gate was done by the priests, which implies that its location was near the Temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/76/0" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Neh. 3:28</a>) Some have held that the Horse Gate was one providing communication between two parts of the Temple-palace quarter. They reach this conclusion from the account of Athaliah’s execution, which reports that, on being led out of the Temple by the soldiers, “she came to the entry of the horse gate of the king’s house.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/77/0" data-bid="78-1" class="b">2 Chron. 23:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/77/1" data-bid="78-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 11:16</a>) However, this was likely an entry just to the precincts of the royal palace and not the Horse Gate through which the horses passed in and out of the city itself. Nehemiah definitely includes the Horse Gate in his reconstruction description, indicating that it was a gate in the city wall. It was probably located near the SE corner of the Temple-palace area. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/78/0" data-bid="79-1" class="b">Neh. 3:28</a>) According to Jeremiah, there must have been a <span id="page627" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="627" data-before-text="627"></span>corner of the wall near this gate, probably as the wall turned toward the left as one comes up the Kidron valley, thereby following the valley’s contour (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/79/0" data-bid="80-1" class="b">Jer. 31:40</a>) The Horse Gate is omitted in the inauguration procession account, evidently because the two parts of the procession left off at the Water Gate and the Gate of the Guard, respectively, and did not walk over the section of the wall E of the Temple, where the Horse Gate and the Inspection Gate were located.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/80/0" data-bid="81-1" class="b">Neh. 12:37-40</a>.</p>

The first day of Tishri was a special new moon feast called Festival of Trumpet Blast. On that day, priests blew on trumpets while sacrifices were offered to Jehovah.

So on the first day of the new month, Tishri, they gathered together at the public square to hear Ezra, along with other Levites, read aloud and explain God’s Law.  Whole families, including “all intelligent enough to listen,” stood and listened “from daybreak till midday.” What a fine example for those of us who today attend meetings in comfortable Kingdom Halls! Yet, on such occasions do you sometimes find that your mind wanders and you start thinking about less important matters? If so, consider again the example of those ancient Israelites who not only listened but took to heart what they heard to the extent that they began weeping over their failure <span id="page22" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>as a nation to obey God’s Law.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013766/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Neh. 8:1-9</a>.</p><img src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/w13/2013/1602" data-img-small-src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/w13/2013/1603" alt="" width="300" height="475" class="east_right" />

<strong>Benefiting from the Undeserved Kindness of God</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Of course, there have been instances over the years when I might have wished for greater physical endurance. My physical frailty has at times interrupted my work, and the last interruption nearly brought my service here to an end when it struck hard at my stomach. I was rushed straight to the operating table, but, filled with confidence in Jehovah, I found peace even under those circumstances. The surgeon was a gentleman and, though he could not hold out much hope for me, he was willing to respect my religious view precluding the use of blood, and he did a fine job. To the astonishment of all, my recovery, though it took time, was good. <span id="page509" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="509" data-before-text="509"></span>It makes me feel as the apostle Paul must have felt due to the affliction that he termed a “thorn in the flesh.” He longed to be freed from it, but the Lord said to him: “My undeserved kindness is sufficient for you; for my power is being made perfect in weakness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962607/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Cor. 12:7-9</a>) Even my own infirmity, my own weakness, opened the way for a good witness to the hospital personnel and other patients, all of whom were very kind to me.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Well over forty years have gone by since I came to the Watch Tower Society’s Finnish branch office to work, yet this time has seemed very short. I gave up a career of musical entertainment but I have become convinced that real happiness does not come through seeking material gain or self honor. I have found far greater happiness in singing the praises of God. And my fascination for languages has come to have much more meaning than it ever did when I was a boy, for I have been able to have a part in translating the message of life into the language of the people among whom I serve. It is the undeserved kindness of God that has opened to me all these opportunities, bringing joy to my life and enabling me to devote myself to sharing it with others.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"></p>

Job realized that this was a denial of the true God and would require an accounting for such error.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 31:26-28</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><em>Christian postures for prayer.</em> Jesus prayed publicly, in sincerity, as did Paul and others. He also recommended private prayer. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matt. 6:5, 6</a>) But Jesus condemned ostentatiousness in making long prayers for a pretense, a practice into which some of the scribes had fallen. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Mark 12:40;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Luke 20:47</a>) However, Christians adopted many of the customs and practices of the Jewish synagogue of which God did not disapprove, and the same attitudes and postures of prayer are mentioned in the Christian Greek Scriptures. Nowhere do they give support to the facial or bodily attitude of assumed piety and sanctimoniousness, making any given posture essential, such as placing the palms together or clasping the hands when offering prayer, as many of the artists of Christendom have depicted. In fact, prayers can be made silently and completely without outward manifestation, when the individual is carrying on an assigned duty or is faced with an emergency. Christians are told to carry on prayer “with every form of prayer and supplication.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Eph. 6:18</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>RESPECT, HUMILITY</strong></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><em>Kneeling</em>. The attitudes and postures of the Orientals in expressing respect for one another and especially when petitioning superiors were much the same as the attitudes practiced in prayer. We find examples of kneeling in supplication before others. This was not in worship of the superior person, but in acknowledgment of that one’s position or office, with deep respect.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Matt. 17:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Mark 1:40;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/20/2" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> 10:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/20/3" data-bid="21-4" class="b"> 2 Ki. 1:13</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><em>Bowing</em> was more frequently used in greeting others or in approaching them on a matter of business or in displaying a high degree of respect. Jacob bowed seven times on meeting Esau. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Gen. 33:3</a>) Solomon, even though he was king, showed respect to his mother by bowing to her.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Ki. 2:19</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Bowing could also be a symbol of acknowledgment of defeat.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Ki. 20:31, 32</a>) Some think that the ropes mentioned were put about their necks to symbolize their captivity and submission.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Although it was a common thing for the Jews to bow before authority to show respect, Mordecai refused to bow before Haman. This was because Haman, as an Agagite, was very likely an Amalekite, concerning whom Jehovah had said that he would completely wipe out their remembrance from under the heavens and that he would have war with Amalek from generation to generation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ex. 17:14-16</a>) Since bowing down or prostration would have a connotation of peace toward Haman, and possibly because the Persians considered such act a gesture of homage or worship, Mordecai refused to perform this act, because he would have violated God’s command in doing so.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Esther 3:5</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><em>Prostrating.</em> Joshua prostrated himself before an angel, “as prince of the army of Jehovah,” not in worship, but in acknowledgment of the superior office the angel held and of the fact that the angel was obviously sent from Jehovah with a command for him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Josh. 5:14</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">When Jesus was on earth, persons would prostrate themselves before him to petition and to do obeisance to him and he did not reprove them. This was because he was the appointed King, the King-designate, as he himself said: “God’s royal majesty has approached” (<em>ED</em>); “The kingdom of God has drawn near.” (<em>NW,</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Mark 1:15</a>) Jesus was the heir to the throne of David and therefore was rightfully honored as a king.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matt. 21:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> John 12:13-15</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">However, the apostles of Jesus Christ refused to permit others to prostrate themselves before them. This was for the reason that, in the instances described, prostration was done as an attitude of worship, as though the power of the holy spirit in the apostles, which performed the healing and other powerful works, was their own. The apostles realized that the power was from God and that credit for these things should be given to him and all worship directed toward Jehovah through Jesus Christ, of whom they were merely the representatives.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Acts 10:25, 26</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">In connection with the respect paid to Jesus, the word often used is <em>pro·sky·neʹo,</em> a word having the basic meaning of doing obeisance, but variously translated as “to worship, bow to the ground, fall prostrate,” Jesus was not accepting worship, which belongs to God alone (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Matt. 4:10</a>), but recognized the act of the one doing obeisance as recognition of the authority given Him by God. The angel whom Jesus Christ sent to bring the Revelation to John expressed the principle that man’s worship belongs only to God, when he refused to accept worship from John.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Rev. 19:10</a>; see WORSHIP.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><em>Covering the head</em> was a sign of respect on the part of women. This custom was followed in the Christian congregation. In discussing the principle of Christian headship the apostle Paul stated: “Every woman that prays or prophesies with her head uncovered shames the one who is her head . . . That is why the woman ought to have a sign of authority upon her head because of the angels.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:3-10</a>; see HEADSHIP.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><em>Removing one’s sandals</em> was a gesture of respect or reverence. Moses was commanded to do this at the burning bush and Joshua in the presence of an angel.

<strong>Understanding</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The basic meaning of these terms reveals the understanding person to be one able to see into a matter and discern its composition by separating the individual factors or features that compose or act together to form the whole, then to perceive the relationship between them and thus comprehend, or grasp, the significance or meaning of the matter. This may be illustrated with a language. If a person is to understand what is spoken in a certain tongue, he must be able to distinguish the individual words composing the sentences, know their meaning, and see how they relate to one another. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004510/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">De 28:49</a>) However, even though a person may basically comprehend what is said to him, understanding can also go beyond such simple comprehension; it means that he gets the real significance and sense of the message, then is able to evaluate it, benefit by it, and know what action it calls for. When Ezra the priest read the Law before the people in Jerusalem, “all intelligent [from Heb., <em>bin</em>] enough to listen” were gathered. Even though these had mature minds able to understand all the words, the Levites “were explaining the law to the people [instructing the people in the law, or giving understanding (form of <em>bin</em>)], . . . reading aloud from the book, from the law of the true God, it being expounded, and there being a putting of meaning into it; and they continued giving understanding in the reading.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004510/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ne 8:2, 3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200004510/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 7, 8</a>.</p>

<strong>Aramaic</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">A number of years after the Jews returned from Babylonian exile Ezra the priest read the book of the Law to Jews assembled in Jerusalem, and various Levites explained it to the people, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000333/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Nehemiah 8:8</a> stating: “They continued reading aloud from the book, from the law of the true God, it being expounded, and there being a putting of meaning into it; and they continued giving understanding in the reading.” This expounding or interpreting may have involved paraphrasing the Hebrew text into Aramaic, Aramaic possibly having been adopted by the Hebrews when in Babylon. The expounding also, no doubt, involved exposition so that the Jews, even if understanding the Hebrew, would comprehend the deep significance of what was being read.</p>

<strong>“Happy Is He Who Reads Aloud”</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> It is sad to think that after concluding this covenant to walk in accord with what was written in the book, the people of God forgot their God and his Word and the reading of it for direction and succumbed to the will of the nations round about. Their continued neglect led to their downfall as a nation in 607 B.C.E. But Jehovah, being merciful, heard their pleas and, in his due time, allowed a remnant of them to return from exile to their beloved Jerusalem and Judah to engage in pure worship. Nevertheless, Jehovah’s view of the importance of his written Word had not diminished with time. Ezra, the scribe of God, again calls upon them in their restored condition to remember the things that are written. We are told by Governor Nehemiah: “And all the people proceeded <span id="page204" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="204" data-before-text="204"></span>to gather themselves as one man at the public square that was before the Water Gate. Then they said to Ezra the copyist to bring the book of the law of Moses, which Jehovah had commanded Israel. Accordingly Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation of men as well as of women and of all intelligent enough to listen, on the first day of the seventh month. And he continued to read aloud from it before the public square that is before the Water Gate, from daybreak till midday, in front of the men and the women and the other intelligent ones; and the ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973242/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Neh. 8:1-3</a>) Those there with Ezra, the Levites, were explaining the law to the people, while the people were in a standing position. “And they continued reading aloud from the book, from the law of the true God, it being expounded, and there being a putting of meaning into it; and they continued giving understanding in the reading.” The result? There was “a great rejoicing, for they had understood the words that had been made known to them.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973242/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Neh. 8:6-8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973242/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 12</a>.</p>

By understanding we gain the full assurance concerning what we believe. It is only when we understand that we can declare our beliefs to other people and can do so with strong conviction that we have the truth, which is worthy of acceptance by all. There is not much good in hearing something and yet not understanding it, for then it does not mean anything to us. We can never do right without understanding what the will of God is. Rather, we are sure to act foolish in his sight, and this would not win his approval. But when we understand his will as contained in his written instructions, we can do it. And as we do so it builds up a full assurance of hope in us, and we can firmly hold on to that hope to the end, till we inherit what God has promised and we reap his good reward for our service. We want to understand how to approach him properly in prayer and what to pray for, that we may gain an answer. Then we can draw near to him in full assurance. We want to understand definitely what the hope is which he has set before us, that we may never suffer the disappointment of false hopes, having wasted all our efforts in aiming wrong.

Why did Hebrews in Nehemiah’s day need to have the Bible translated to them?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[22]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> As far as the vast majority of mankind is concerned, the Bible, in which God’s will and purpose are expressed, is written in dead languages, Hebrew and ancient common (<em>koi·neʹ</em>) Greek. For that reason the original Bible has needed to be translated for us to know what it says. Even then it has to be translated or explained in such a way as to give us an understanding of what it says. Already five centuries before Christ the Hebrews or Israelites themselves had to have their own Hebrew Scriptures translated to them in order to grasp their contents. Jerusalem had been destroyed and the survivors had been carried captive to Babylon. During their seventy years of exile there a new generation had grown up. Because of the close association of the rising generation with the Babylonians they had lost their mother tongue and had come to speak Ar·a·maʹic, a language similar to Hebrew and related to it. This is what they spoke when they were restored to their homeland. Eighty-two years after they were restored Governor Nehemiah succeeded in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem. They had a celebration over it, at which Ezra the priest and other Levites read the Bible to the assembled people. But for the audience in general to understand it these readers had to interpret it to them. On this we read, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950765/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Nehemiah 8:7, 8</a>: They “explained the meaning <span id="page385" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="385" data-before-text="385"></span>of the law to the people as they stood; they read from the book, from the law of God, translating as they went and explaining the meaning, so that the people understood what was read”. (<em>Mo</em>) By having the Bible text translated from Hebrew to the ar·a·maʹic which they spoke, the people came to understand what God’s law was.</p>

<strong>Ezra, Zealous for Pure Worship</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Ezra then carefully weighed and counted the treasure, some four million dollars in value, and, with a solemn injunction, entrusted it to twelve of the chief priests. After a journey taking about four months, Ezra and his band arrived safely in Jerusalem. Again Jehovah had prospered Ezra’s zeal for the pure worship. After offering sacrifices <span id="page207" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="207" data-before-text="207"></span>of bulls, rams, lambs and he-goats for all the twelve tribes of Israel, Ezra learned of the transgression of the people in the matter of taking heathen wives. To one so jealous for the pure worship as was Ezra, this news of the widespread infiltration of pagan worshipers caused the greatest consternation and amazement. “I tore my garment and my mantle, and pulled the hair from my head and my beard, and sat down appalled . . . until the evening oblation.”</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Then falling upon his knees and spreading his hands out to Jehovah he made a moving confession in the presence of the assembled Israelites, “all who trembled at the words of the God of Israel.” Confessing the wrongful course of his people from the days of their fathers to the present time, he recounted the punishment that they had received because of it, and how God had again extended mercy to them by permitting them to return. They had been punished with less than they deserved, and “shall we again break thy commands, and make marriage alliances with the peoples who perform these abominable rites? Wouldst thou not be enraged with us until thou hadst consumed us, until neither remnant nor survivor was left?”</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">On behalf of the people one Shechaniah spoke up and counseled that all enter into a solemn agreement to straighten this matter out, and, urging Ezra, said: “Arise, for it is your task, and we are with you; be strong and act.” Ezra then made all the people swear that they would be submissive to Jehovah’s will in the matter, and they were commanded to return for this purpose within three days. All those refusing to do so were to be banished and their goods confiscated.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950484/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezra 9:3-10:8</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Accordingly all the people came together in Jerusalem on the twentieth day of the ninth month. This was therefore no small assembly. “And all the people sat in the open square in front of the house of God, trembling on account of the occasion itself and also because of the pouring rain.” It was seen that the entire matter could not be taken care of then and there because of the great number that had transgressed, so after instructions’ being given by Ezra arrangements were made to take care of the matter gradually at appointed times. By the end of the next three months all the pagan worshipers had been cleared out.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950484/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezra 10:9-17</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Without doubt this action caused much suffering to all concerned; the overdue remedying of violations of God’s laws often does. Neither is it at all likely that the heathen neighbors round about who were involved particularly welcomed the return of these grass widows, with the added burden of their children, nor that they appreciated the issue of pure worship that was involved. But the servants of Jehovah must decide whether they will be primarily concerned with pleasing Jehovah or with pleasing this world. Ezra was determined to ‘know, teach and do’ God’s will and law regardless of what others thought. The servants of the Lord today likewise cannot be governed in their decisions by whether or not the people of the world appreciate the issue in regard to such questions as the flag salute, military service, or understand God’s will in the matter of blood transfusions, etc. But, back to Ezra.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Thirteen years pass, and it is the first day of the seventh month when we next hear of him. In the meantime Nehemiah had returned, rebuilt the walls of Jerusalem and was serving as governor of the land. Again we see Ezra manifest zeal for the pure worship by instructing the people in the law of Jehovah. We see him stand on a platform that was raised high above the people so that all could see and hear, and after a prayer to Jehovah he reads from the law from day dawn till noon. For that convention the people had gotten up early! As the law or word of the law was written in Hebrew and the people in general no longer understood it but spoke Aramaic, it was necessary that others interpret it for them; hence “they read in the book in the law of God distinctly [that is, gave the Aramaic paraphrase], and gave the sense [by dividing the words according to the sense], and caused them to understand the reading [by giving the traditional pronunciation of the words]”.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950484/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Neh. 8:8</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">As the people heard the words of the law read they wept, but they were told not to weep, but to rejoice, that this was a time of joy and feasting, “for the joy of Jehovah is your strength.” “And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them.” On the next day the people again gathered for Bible education, “even to give attention to the words of the law.” Learning of God’s commandment to celebrate the feast of tabernacles, they immediately went out to the forests and gathered boughs and made themselves booths or tabernacles and dwelt in them. “And there was very great gladness.” Ezra continued to instruct the people: “Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950484/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Neh. 8:9-18</a>, <em>Am. Stan. Ver.</em>) Great as was the joy of the people, Ezra’s joy was, without doubt, still greater; for is it not more blessed to give out the words of God’s law than to receive them?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">In addition to orally instructing the people, Ezra showed his zeal for the pure worship in other ways. He wrote the book bearing his name as well as the two books of Chronicles. Further, there is every reason to believe that Jehovah’s spirit directed his zeal to compile the Hebrew Scripture canon; collating the various books of the Hebrew canon while still in Babylon and then putting them into final form and adding his own writings after he returned to Palestine. The evidence at hand is quite conclusive that the Hebrew canon was complete in his day, with perhaps the single exception of the book of Malachi.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The time of Ezra also saw the making of many copies of the Hebrew Scriptures for the use of the Jews in the synagogues, scattered far and wide. Without doubt Ezra’s zeal for pure worship caused him to pioneer in this work and also to supervise it. Thus in various ways Ezra manifested his zeal for the pure worship of Jehovah, and not only did his contemporary brethren benefit from it but all of Jehovah’s servants since have profited from his resolve to know, teach and do Jehovah’s law. And in this he also set a good example for all servants of Jehovah today.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sd">I will give thanks unto Jehovah with my whole heart; I will show forth all thy marvellous works.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950484/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 9:1</a>, <em>A.S.V.</em></p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"></p>

There are but few people and houses within the city, for most of the Israelites are living outside according to their tribal inheritances.

<strong>Aramaic</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Aramaic is generally divided into Western and <span id="page104" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="104" data-before-text="104"></span>Eastern groups. However, from a historical standpoint the following four groups have been recognized: Old Aramaic, Official Aramaic, Levantine Aramaic and Eastern Aramaic. It has been suggested that likely various dialects of Aramaic were spoken around and within the Fertile Crescent and Mesopotamia during the second millennium B.C.E. A difference between early forms of Aramaic and Hebrew may be noted at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010336/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Genesis 31:47</a>. After Jacob and Laban effected a reconciliation, a heap of stones was set up as a witness between them. Laban called it Jeʹgar-sa·ha·duʹtha in Aramaic (Syrian), while Jacob called it Galʹe·ed in Hebrew, both expressions meaning “witness heap.”</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Old Aramaic is a name applied to certain inscriptions discovered in northern Syria and said to date from the tenth to the eighth centuries B.C.E. Gradually, however, a new dialect of Aramaic became the <em>lingua franca</em> or the international auxiliary language during the time of the Assyrian Empire, supplanting Akkadian as the language used for official governmental correspondence with outlying areas of the empire. In view of its use, this standard form of Aramaic is referred to as “Official Aramaic.” It continued to be employed during the time Babylon was the world power (625-539 B.C.E.) and thereafter, during the time of the Persian Empire (538-331 B.C.E.). Especially did it then enjoy wide usage, being the official language of government and business over a wide area, as archaeological discoveries attest, for it appears in dockets on cuneiform tablets, on ostraca, papyri, seals, coins, in inscriptions on stone, and so forth. These artifacts have been found in such lands as Mesopotamia, Persia, Egypt, Anatolia, northern Arabia and regions as far N as the Ural Mountains and to the E as distant as Afghanistan and Kurdistan. The use of Official Aramaic continued during the Hellenistic period (330-30 B.C.E.).</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">It seems that it is this Official Aramaic that is found in the writings of Ezra, Jeremiah and Daniel. The Scriptures also give evidence of the fact that Aramaic was a <em>lingua franca</em> of those ancient times. Thus, in the eighth century B.C.E. an appointed spokesman for King Hezekiah of Judah, appealed to Assyrian King Sennacherib’s representative Rabshakeh, saying: “Speak, please, to your servants in the Syrian [Aramaean, and hence Aramaic] language, for we are listening; and do not speak to us in the Jews’ language in the ears of the people that are on the wall.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010336/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isa. 36:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010336/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 18:26</a>) The officials of Judah understood Aramaic, or Syrian, but evidently it was not understood by the common people among the Hebrews at that time in Jerusalem.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">A number of years after the Jews returned from Babylonian exile Ezra the priest read the book of the law to Jews assembled in Jerusalem, and various Levites explained it to the people, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010336/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Nehemiah 8:8</a> stating: “They continued reading aloud from the book, from the law of the true God, it being expounded, and there being a putting of meaning into it; and they continued giving understanding in the reading.” This expounding or interpreting may have involved paraphrasing the Hebrew text into Aramaic, Aramaic possibly having been adopted by the Hebrews when in Babylon. However, the expounding could have involved exposition so that the Jews, even if understanding the Hebrew, would comprehend the deep significance of what was being read.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>WHAT LANGUAGE DID JESUS SPEAK WHEN ON EARTH?</strong></p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">On this question there is considerable difference of opinion among scholars. However, concerning languages used in Palestine when Jesus Christ was on earth, Professor G. Ernest Wright states: “Various languages were undoubtedly to be heard on the streets of the major cities. Greek and Aramaic were evidently the common tongues, and most of the urban peoples could probably understand both even in such ‘modern’ or ‘western’ cities as Caesarea and Samaria where Greek was the more common. Roman soldiers and officials might be heard conversing in Latin, while orthodox Jews may well have spoken a late variety of Hebrew with one another, a language that we know to have been neither classical Hebrew nor Aramaic, despite its similarities to both.” Commenting further, on the language spoken by Jesus Christ, Professor Wright says: “The language spoken by Jesus has been much debated. We have no certain way of knowing whether he could speak Greek or Latin, but in his teaching ministry he regularly used either Aramaic or the highly Aramaized popular Hebrew. When Paul addressed the mob in the Temple, it is said that he spoke Hebrew (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010336/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 21:40</a>). Scholars generally have taken this to mean Aramaic, but it is quite possible that a popular Hebrew was then the common tongue among the Jews.”<em>—Biblical Archaeology,</em> p. 240.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">It is possible that Jesus and his early disciples, such as the apostle Peter, at least at times spoke Galilean Aramaic, Peter being told on the night Christ was taken into custody: “Certainly you also are one of them, for, in fact, your dialect gives you away.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010336/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 26:73</a>) This may have been said because the apostle was using Galilean Aramaic at the time, though that is not certain and he may have been speaking a Galilean Hebrew that differed dialectically from that employed in Jerusalem or elsewhere in Judea. Earlier, when Jesus came to Nazareth in Galilee and entered the synagogue there, he read from the prophecy of Isaiah, evidently as written in Hebrew, and then said: “Today this scripture that you just heard is fulfilled.” Nothing is said about Jesus’ translating this passage into Aramaic. So it is likely that persons present on that occasion could readily understand Biblical Hebrew. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010336/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Luke 4:16-21</a>) It may also be noted that <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010336/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 6:1</a>, referring to a time shortly after Pentecost 33 C.E., mentions Greek-speaking Jews and Hebrew-speaking Jews in Jerusalem.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Professor Harris Birkeland (in <em>The Language of Jesus,</em> 1954, pp. 10, 11) points out that Aramaic’s being the written language of Palestine when Jesus was on earth does not necessarily mean that it was spoken by the masses, and the fact that the Elephantine papyri belonging to a Jewish colony in Egypt were written in Aramaic does not prove that it was their chief or common tongue in their homeland, for Aramaic was then an international literary language. Of course, the Christian Greek Scriptures contain a number of Aramaisms, Jesus using some Aramaic words, for instance. However, as Birkeland argues, perhaps Jesus ordinarily spoke the popular Hebrew, while occasionally using Aramaic expressions.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">While it may not be provable, as Birkeland contends, that the common people were illiterate as far as Aramaic was concerned, it does seem that when Luke, an educated physician, records that Paul spoke to the Jews ‘in Hebrew’ and when the apostle said the voice from heaven spoke to him ‘in Hebrew,’ a form of Hebrew was actually meant (though perhaps not the ancient Hebrew) and not Aramaic.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010336/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Acts 22:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010336/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 26:14</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Lending further support to the use of a form of Hebrew in Palestine when Jesus Christ was on earth are early indications that the apostle Matthew first wrote his Gospel account in Hebrew. For instance, Eusebius (of the third and fourth centuries C.E.) said: “The evangelist Matthew delivered his Gospel in the Hebrew tongue.” And Jerome (of the fourth and fifth centuries C.E.) stated: “Matthew, who is also Levi, and who from a publican came to be an Apostle, first of all the Evangelists, composed a Gospel of Christ in Judaea in the Hebrew language and characters, for the benefit of those of the circumcision who had believed. . . . Furthermore, the Hebrew itself is preserved to this day in the library at Caesarea which the Martyr Pamphilus so diligently collected.” (<em>Catalogue of Ecclesiastical Writers</em>) Hence, Jesus Christ as a man on earth could well have used <span id="page105" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="105" data-before-text="105"></span>a form of Hebrew and a dialect of Aramaic.—See HEBREW.</p>

<strong>Hebrew, II</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Had both Hebrew and Aramaic diverged from the <span id="page738" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="738" data-before-text="738"></span>original “one language,” or did one of them preserve the purity of that primary language? While the Bible does not specifically say, the implication is that the language in which Moses began the writing of the inspired Sacred Record was the same as that spoken by the first man. The history of pre-Flood times and of early post-Flood times, as set forth in Genesis, was obviously preserved in an oral and/or written form down till Moses’ day. Logically, those preserving it were those adhering to worship of Jehovah.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">If written, such history would contribute notably to the preservation of the purity of the original tongue. Even if that history were passed on by oral tradition (which seems less likely), it would still serve to maintain the stability of the original speech. The extreme care that the Jews of later times showed in endeavoring to conserve the true form of the Sacred Record illustrates the concern that would surely have been shown in patriarchal times to transmit accurately the earliest record of God’s dealings with men.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Further reason for believing that the Hebrew of the Bible accurately represents the “one language” of pre-Babel times is the remarkable stability of the Hebrew language during the thousand-year period in which the Hebrew Scriptures were written. As <em>The International Standard Bible Encyclopaedia</em> states: “One of the most remarkable facts connected with the Heb[rew] of the O[ld] T[estament] is that although that lit[erature] extends through a period of over 1,000 years, there is almost no difference between the language of the oldest parts and that of the latest.” The same work later observes: “It is needless to add that the various writers differ from one another in point of style, but these variations are infinitesimal compared with those of Gr[eek] and Lat[in] authors.”—Vol. III, p. 1833.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>KNOWLEDGE OF THE LANGUAGE REMAINS INCOMPLETE</strong></p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">In reality, knowledge of ancient Hebrew is by no means complete. As Professor Burton L. Goddard says: “In large measure, the O[ld] T[estament] Hebrew must be self explanatory.” This is due to the fact that so few other contemporaneous writings in the Hebrew language have been found that could contribute to understanding of the word usage. Among those of any importance are the “Gezer calendar” (a simple list of agricultural operations thought to date from the middle of the tenth century B.C.E.), some ostraca (inscribed pieces of broken pottery) from Samaria (mainly orders and receipts for wine, oil, barley and generally assigned to the early part of the eighth century B.C.E), the Siloam inscription (found in a water tunnel of Jerusalem and believed to date from the reign of King Hezekiah [745-716 B.C.E.]), and the Lachish ostraca (probably from the latter part of the seventh century B.C.E.).</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Additionally, there is a Phoenician inscription on the sarcophagus of King Ahiram in Byblos (Gebal), its language closely resembling Hebrew and thought to be from the start of the first millennium B.C.E.; also the Moabite Stone, apparently from the late tenth or early ninth century B.C.E. The language on the Moabite Stone is very similar to Hebrew, as might be expected in view of the Moabites’ descendancy from Abraham’s nephew Lot.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011903/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Gen. 19:30-37</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The total of the information on all these inscriptions, however, is but a small fraction of that found in the Hebrew Scriptures.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The Hebrew Scriptures, themselves, though covering a wide range of subjects and employing an extensive vocabulary, by no means contain all the words or expressions of ancient Hebrew. The Siloam inscription and the Lachish ostraca, for example, contain certain word and grammatical constructions that do not appear in the Hebrew Scriptures, yet these constructions are clearly of Hebrew origin. Undoubtedly the ancient vocabulary of the Hebrew-speaking people contained many more “root” words, plus thousands of words derived from these, than are known today.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Aside from those portions of the Bible definitely known to be written in Aramaic, there are quite a number of words and expressions found in the Hebrew Scriptures for which the original “roots” are unknown. Lexicographers classify many of these as “loan words,” claiming that Hebrew borrowed these from other Semitic tongues, such as Aramaic, Akkadian or Arabic. This is speculation, however. As Dr. Edward Horowitz states: “But sometimes the borrowing is so ancient that scholars do not know which language did the borrowing and which was the original owner.” It seems more probable that such questioned terms are genuinely Hebrew and are further evidence of the incompleteness of modern knowledge of the scope of the ancient language.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Among the evidences pointing to a rich vocabulary in ancient Hebrew are writings from the start of the Common Era. These include non-Biblical religious writings forming part of the Dead Sea Scrolls, and also the Mishnah, a body of rabbinical writings in Hebrew dealing with Jewish tradition. Writing in <em>The Encyclopedia Americana</em> (1956 ed., Vol. 14, p. 57a), Professor Meyer Waxman says: “Biblical Hebrew . . . does not exhaust the entire stock of words, as is proved by the Mishnah, which employs hundreds of Hebrew words not found in the Bible.” Of course, some of these could have been later additions or “coined” expressions, but doubtless many were part of the Hebrew vocabulary during the period of the writing of the Hebrew Scriptures.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>WHEN DID HEBREW BEGIN TO WANE?</strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">It is popularly held that the Jews began to change over to Aramaic speech during their exile in Babylon. The evidence for this, however, is not strong. Modern examples show that subjugated groups or immigrants can and frequently do retain their native tongue over periods far longer than seventy years. Particularly since the Jews had the divine promise of a return to their homeland, it may be expected that they would be little inclined to drop Hebrew in favor of either Akkadian (Assyro-Babylonian) or Aramaic, the <em>lingua franca</em> of that time. True, Aramaic passages and words are to be found in the exilic and postexilic books, such as Daniel, Ezra and Esther. This is not unusual, however, inasmuch as those books include accounts of events taking place in Aramaic-speaking lands, as well as official correspondence, and deal with a people subject to domination by foreign powers using Aramaic as a diplomatic language.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011903/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Nehemiah 8:8</a> describes the “putting of meaning” into and “giving understanding” in the reading of the Law. It has been suggested that Hebrew was not then perfectly understood by the returned exiles and that some Aramaic paraphrasing was done. However, the text itself seems to point more to an exposition of the sense and application of what was being taught in the Law, rather than to some clarification of linguistic terminology or grammatical forms.—Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011903/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matthew 13:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011903/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 51, 52;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011903/13/2" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> Luke 24:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011903/13/3" data-bid="14-4" class="b"> Acts 8:30, 31</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Actually, there is no reference in the Bible to any abandonment of Hebrew as the daily tongue of the people. True, Nehemiah found certain Jews who had Ashdodite, Ammonite and Moabite wives and whose children did not know “how to speak Jewish.” But the mention of this factor in connection with Nehemiah’s indignation at the Jews involved in these marriages with non-Israelites indicates that such slighting of Hebrew was strongly disapproved. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011903/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Neh. 13:23-27</a>) This might be expected in view of the importance given to the reading of God’s Word, which was till then mainly in Hebrew.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">The period from the close of the Hebrew canon (likely in the time of Ezra and Malachi in the fifth century B.C.E.) down till the start of the Common Era is not dealt with to any extent in the Bible. Secular records are also few. But even these give little support to a changeover from Hebrew to Aramaic on the part of the Jewish people. The evidence indicates that many of the apocryphal books, such as <span id="page739" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="739" data-before-text="739"></span>Judith, Ecclesiasticus (not Ecclesiastes), Baruch, and First Maccabees, were written in Hebrew, and these works are generally viewed as dating from the last three centuries before the Common Era. As already mentioned, some of the non-Biblical writings among the Dead Sea Scrolls were also in Hebrew, and Hebrew was used in compiling the Jewish Mishnah centuries within the Common Era.</p>

This is a figurative expression referring to the best of the flock, or as <em>The Jerusalem Bible</em> renders the phrase, “rich food of the pastures.” (See also <em>Da</em> ftn and <em>Kx.</em>) This poetic sense is indicated by later portions of the same verse referring to “the <em>kidney fat</em> of wheat” and “the <em>blood</em> of the grape.” So, too, with <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001493/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Nehemiah 8:10</a>, where the people are commanded, “Go, eat the fatty things,” we are not to conclude that they literally consumed whole fat. “Fatty things” refers to rich portions, things not skinny or dry, but luscious, including tasty items prepared with vegetable oils. Thus, Knox’ translation here reads “regale yourselves with rich meat,” while Moffatt’s translation says “eat the dainty pieces.”</p>

(Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2008927/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isaiah 25:6</a>.)

Nehemiah therefore helped them to get into the right frame of mind by saying: “Go, eat the fatty things and drink the sweet things, and send portions to the one for whom nothing has been prepared; for this day is holy to our Lord, and do not feel hurt, for the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.” Obediently, “all the people went away to eat and drink and to send out portions and to carry on a great rejoicing, for they had understood the words that had been made known to them.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998764/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Nehemiah 8:10-12</a>.</p>

In this regard, consider what happened in Jerusalem in Ezra’s day. The copyist Ezra and others imparted understanding through a meaningful reading of the Law. Then the people were urged: “Go, eat the fatty things and drink the sweet things, and send portions to the one for whom nothing has been prepared; for this day is holy to our Lord, and do not feel hurt, for the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.” “Great rejoicing” resulted as the Jews applied the knowledge they had gained and held a joyous Festival of Booths.

The “fatty things,” the “sweet things,” the wholesome nourishment from God’s Word that we enjoy in association with others, build in us this joy and enthusiasm that have such great persuasive power in recommending the truth to others.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973563/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Rom. 12:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973563/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> Neh. 8:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973563/30/2" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> Acts 4:13</a>.</p>

Their privilege in this regard is that of keeping integrity both in their conduct and in their ministry of preaching and teaching. What a privilege this is! Think of it, the privilege of making the heart of the great Jehovah glad by taking a wise course of obedience, and thus proving the Devil a liar.

Their enemies, of course, cannot understand how “the joy of Jehovah” could prove to be such a tower of strength and an impregnable stronghold.

They know that it was this same joy that was set before the Faithful and True Witness, Jesus, and that enabled him to endure the shame and suffering of death on a torture stake. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965402/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Heb. 12:2</a>) In his Sermon on the Mount this great integrity-keeper promised that his faithful followers would likewise share in this joy. “Happy are those who have been persecuted for righteousness’ sake, since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them. Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you and lyingly say every sort of wicked thing against you for my sake. Rejoice and leap for joy, since your reward is great in the heavens; for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to you.” To this the writer James adds: “Consider it all joy, my brothers, when you meet with various trials.

<strong>Are You Enduring or Have You Grown Weary?</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">While Jehovah does his part, that is not sufficient for you to endure. You must also do your part. For example, he provides the spiritual food and drink, but unless you put forth effort to partake of it, you will continue to be spiritually famished. So buy out time from other things so as to be able <span id="page599" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="599" data-before-text="599"></span>to read the Bible regularly and to study it with the helps that God has provided. Never let a day go by without taking in some such spiritual food. That is every bit as essential for you as it was for Joshua and the kings of Israel who were told to peruse God’s Word daily.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964726/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Josh. 1:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964726/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Deut. 17:18-20</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Good as that is, however, it is not enough. You must also arrange your affairs so as to meet regularly with your fellow Christians, who, like you, are concerned with enduring and are in a position to help you and whose very example can encourage you to endure. They will incite you to “love and fine works,” and, in turn, you will be able to aid others. Christians are like the members of the human body; they cannot get along without one another.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964726/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Heb. 10:24, 25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964726/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 12:14-27</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Further, to endure you must make yourself susceptible to and receptive of God’s holy spirit, for that is what gives you the strength to endure. Nor is prayer to be overlooked. And even as physical activity is essential to bodily health, so spiritual activity, in the Christian ministry, is essential to spiritual health.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>QUALITIES AIDING YOU TO ENDURE</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">By taking advantage of God’s Word, association with God’s people, God’s holy spirit and prayer you will be able to cultivate the qualities that will help you to endure and not grow weary. Among such qualities are faith and hope. These enabled Abraham and Moses to endure long years in God’s service and they can help you likewise to endure. As the apostle Paul shows: “If we hope for what we do not see, we keep on waiting for it with endurance.” “We bear . . . in mind your faithful work and your loving labor and your endurance due to your hope.” Just as an anchor helps a ship to endure in a storm, so the anchor of hope will help you to endure the storms of life.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964726/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Rom. 8:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964726/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 1 Thess. 1:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964726/12/2" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> Heb. 6:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964726/12/3" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> 11:8-10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964726/12/4" data-bid="13-5" class="b"> 24-27</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Joy and contentment are two further Christian qualities that will enable you to endure. “The joy of Jehovah is your stronghold,” Nehemiah told his people. And of Jesus we read, “For the joy that was set before him he endured a torture stake.” As for contentment, along with godly devotion, “it is a means of great gain.” Contentment simplifies matters and makes it easier to endure the rugged life of a Christian soldier.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964726/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Neh. 8:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964726/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Heb. 12:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964726/13/2" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 1 Tim. 6:6</a>, ftn. 1950 edition.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">But above all, love, love for Jehovah, with all your heart, mind, soul and strength, and love of your neighbor as yourself, will help you to endure. If you love Jehovah your God you will want to please him, you will want to make his heart happy by keeping integrity, you will want to make known to others his name and his glorious attributes, and to do all that takes endurance. And if you love your neighbor as yourself you will want to help him to gain everlasting life by your example and your ministry, and that takes endurance. As we read, “Love is long-suffering and kind. . . . It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails.” Yes, above all else, love will help you to endure!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964726/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964726/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 7, 8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964726/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> Matt. 22:37-39</a>.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">It is not easy to endure.

Then you should also humbly acknowledge your dependence on his earthly organization today. There is no place of real safety outside God’s New World society. All lovers of life must find their place, and hold their place, within that society, regularly attending the <em>Watchtower</em> study meeting, the service meeting and theocratic ministry school, listening attentively to the public Bible talks, and supporting the midweek congregation book study. Happy are all those that crowd all these meetings into a busy week, for in so doing they are crowding out the inconsequential things that the enemy would like to sow in their Christian lives. Happy, because they are conscious of their spiritual need! Happy, because they are pressing on to maturity with all of God’s people throughout the wide world!

Remember how our German brothers maintained their entity of organization while they were being compelled to flee from the Sachsenhausen concentration camp at the climax of World War II. Amid shootings, machine-gunnings, pillagings and death by exhaustion, our 230 brothers marched out in theocratic order, the one group in all that confusion of death and warfare that trusted in Jehovah God. Did Jehovah answer their united prayer for guidance? Did he lead and protect that small group of his worshipers? The report says: “From our troop of about 230 brothers and sisters none, not even the weakest, was lying on the road, despite the fact that we had some brothers from 65 to 72 years of age. They were all standing faithfully.”<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1961122/0">a</a> During future trials, and through Armageddon’s battle itself, the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses expects to keep standing faithfully, in the one united, theocratic order. Now is the time to seek that association, so that you also may find joy in saying: “In Jehovah I have trusted, that I may not wobble.

This prohibition against blood was incorporated into and restated in the Mosaic law covenant to give it renewed emphasis, but mankind in general still continued under the obligations of the Noachian mandate concerning the sanctity of creature blood. Thus when the law covenant, binding upon the Jews, was taken out of the way by Jehovah’s nailing it to the torture stake of Jesus Christ. the Jews still continued under the prohibitions against eating and drinking blood, along with all the rest of mankind down to this very day. Christians were specifically notified of this continuing prohibition concerning blood: “They should keep themselves from what is sacrificed to idols as well as from blood and what is killed without draining its blood and from fornication.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957851/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 21:25</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The prohibition against fat, however, was lifted with the removal of the Mosaic law covenant. Other foods listed as unclean under the Jewish law covenant were thus removed from under prohibition by abolition of that covenant, and Jewish Christians as well as Christians from among Gentiles could eat such foods in all good conscience, giving thanks to God therefor that such foods might be sanctified through prayer.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>● Sometimes in your publications you capitalize personal pronouns referring to Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, but generally you do not. Why not?—W. S., United States.</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The practice of some who capitalize all personal pronouns referring to Jehovah and Christ appears to be merely a matter of preference or style and not something made obligatory by any principle in God’s Word. The way to praise and honor Jehovah and Christ is not by the mere capitalizing of initial letters in personal pronouns referring to them, but is by study and service, obedience and preaching. In the oldest Bible manuscripts available all the letters are alike. Capitalization is of relatively recent origin. Says Sir Frederic Kenyon in his book <em>Textual Criticism of the New Testament,</em> pages 19, 20, 25: “Capital letters, which are occasionally used in business documents to mark the beginning of a clause, do not occur in literary papyri . . .” It is interesting to note that not even the translators of the respected <em>King James</em> or <em>Authorized Version</em> always capitalized personal pronouns referring to Jehovah and Christ.—See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957851/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 15:4-13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957851/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> John 1:1-4</a>, <em>AV</em>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">It is our policy to lower-case pronouns referring to Jehovah God and Jesus Christ in all our publications, with the exception that capitals are used when other pronouns in the sentence might make the meaning doubtful. If, for instance, both Jehovah and Jeremiah are mentioned in a sentence and then in that sentence the pronoun “he” occurs, the “h” would be capitalized if the pronoun were referring to Jehovah and it would be lower-cased if it referred to Jeremiah.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"></p>

<strong>The Spirit, the Organization, and the Word</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span id="page374" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="374" data-before-text="374"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> To illustrate: There is a sacred mystery contained in God’s Word, and which holds out the hope of heavenly glory for Christians. It takes the illuminating power of God’s spirit to probe into the depths of that secret and discover its meaning to us. Showing our need of the spirit’s help Paul writes: “We speak God’s wisdom in a sacred secret, the hidden wisdom, which God foreordained before the systems of things for our glory. This wisdom not one of the rulers of this system of things came to know, for if they [Jewish rulers with the written Hebrew Scriptures] had known it they would not have impaled the glorious Lord. But just as it is written: ‘Eye has not seen and ear has not heard, neither have there been conceived in the heart of man the things which God has prepared for those who love him.’ For it is to us God has revealed them through his spirit, for the spirit searches into all things, even the deep things of God. So, too, no one has come to know the things of God, except the spirit of God. Now we received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that have been kindly given us by God. . . . because they are examined spiritually.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951445/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Cor. 2:7-10, 11-14</a>, <em>NW</em>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 6, 7. (a) In apostolic days how did the spirit manifest its power toward the disciples? (b) Of what is having the spirit a seal?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Yes, we need the spirit in addition to God’s written Word. Again emphasizing this, Paul writes: “You, when you read this, can realize the comprehension I have in the sacred secret of the Christ. In other generations this secret was not made known to the sons of men as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by spirit.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951445/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eph. 3:4, 5</a>, <em>NW</em>) In apostolic days the Christian believers had God’s spirit make his written Word plain to them. Not only that, but they also received gifts of the spirit which manifested itself in various ways by miraculous power to speak foreign tongues, translate them, perform cures, do powerful works and utter prophecy. In his same letter the apostle tells how, after they had believed the Word, they received the outpouring of God’s spirit with its various manifestations. This was as an authoritative seal upon them that they belonged to God and were his possession.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Writes Paul: “We should serve for the praise of his glory, we who have been first to hope in the Christ. But you also hoped in him after you heard the word of truth, the good news about your salvation. By means of him also, after you believed, you were sealed with the promised holy spirit, which is a token in advance of our inheritance, for the purpose of releasing by a ransom God’s own possession, to his glorious praise.” “Christ Jesus himself is the foundation cornerstone. In union with him you, too, are being built up together into a place for God to inhabit by spirit.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951445/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Eph. 1:12-14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951445/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 2:20,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951445/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 22</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951445/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Cor. 1:21, 22</a>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 8.

Paul says that this was true of the Thessalonians, to whom he writes: “You accepted the word under much tribulation with joy of holy spirit, so that you came to be an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia.” One of the fruits or products of the holy spirit in us is a joy over God’s Word, work and people. This joy strengthens us to endure many things we could not otherwise bear, especially in the right frame of mind and heart.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951445/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Thess. 1:6, 7</a>, <em>NW;</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951445/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gal. 5:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951445/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Neh. 8:10</a>.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 9.

Having this spirit does not relieve Christians of studying and consulting God’s Word to ascertain his will. But when they do study the written Word, then God’s spirit helps them understand and appreciate it.</p>

<strong>Fast</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Fasting has been enjoined on their members by some religious sects of Christendom, but the Bible itself gives no command to Christians to fast. When Jesus was talking to his disciples about fasting, as above (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011451/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matt. 6:16-18</a>), he and his disciples were still <span id="page568" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="568" data-before-text="568"></span>under the Mosaic law and observed the Day of Atonement and its fast.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The text about fasting at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011451/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Matthew 17:21</a>, appearing in the <em>Authorized Version,</em> is not contained in some of the most important ancient manuscripts. Likewise, although the <em>Authorized Version</em> mentions fasting at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011451/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Mark 9:29,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011451/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Acts 10:30,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011451/21/2" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 7:5 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011451/21/3" data-bid="22-4" class="b"> 2 Corinthians 6:5</a>, according to such manuscripts these texts do not contain any references to fasting.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Some have taken <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011451/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matthew 9:15</a> as a command for Christians to fast. In reality, Jesus was merely making a statement of what was going to happen when he died. While Jesus was with his disciples on earth, it was not appropriate for them to fast. When he died, they did mourn and fast. But they had no cause for mournful fasting after his resurrection and especially after the marvelous outpouring of holy spirit. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011451/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Mark 2:18-20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011451/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Luke 5:33-35</a>) Certainly Christians were not under obligation to fast on the anniversary of the Lord’s death, for the apostle Paul, correcting abuses that had crept into the annual observance of the Lord’s Evening Meal, said: “Certainly you do have houses for eating and drinking, do you not? . . . Consequently, my brothers, when you come together to eat it [the Lord’s Evening Meal], wait for one another. If anyone is hungry, <em>let him eat at home,</em> that you may not come together for judgment.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011451/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:22,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011451/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 33, 34</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">While not fasting as a religious requirement, the early Christians did fast on special occasions. When Barnabas and Paul were sent on a special missionary assignment into Asia Minor, there were both fasting and praying. Also, there was the offering of prayer “with fastings” when older men were appointed to office in a new congregation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011451/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Acts 13:2, 3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011451/25/1" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 14:23</a>) Hence, Christians are neither under command to fast nor prohibited from doing so.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011451/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Rom. 14:5, 6</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Festival of Booths</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Known also as the <strong>FESTIVAL OF INGATHERING</strong> or of Tabernacles, it is called the “festival of Jehovah” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011464/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Leviticus 23:39</a>.

The festival occupied the days of Ethanim 15-21, with a solemn assembly or sabbath on the twenty-second. Ethanim (Tishri; September-October) was originally the first month of the Jewish calendar, but after the exodus from Egypt it became the seventh month of the sacred year, since Abib (Nisan; March-April), formerly the seventh month, was made the first month.

The fourteenth was the day of preparation, unless that day happened to be a weekly sabbath day, in which case preparations could be made earlier. The time of all was busily occupied in constructing the booths, in purification and in caring for the offerings each one had brought, as well as in joyful fellowship. The city of Jerusalem and surroundings provided a unique and picturesque appearance, with the booths located all over the town and in the roads and gardens around Jerusalem. Adding to the festive atmosphere was the colorful beauty of the fruits and the leaves, along with the fragrance of the myrtles. Everyone was in anticipation, awaiting the sound of the trumpet blast from the elevated location of the temple in the early autumn evening, announcing the advent of the festival.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">During this festival the number of sacrifices offered was greater than at any other festival of the year. The national sacrifice, starting with thirteen bulls on the first day and diminishing one each day, totaled seventy bulls sacrificed, besides 119 lambs, rams and goats, and, in addition, the grain and wine offerings. During the week thousands of individual offerings would also be made by the attenders. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011464/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Num. 29:12-34,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011464/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 39</a>) On the eighth day, on which no laborious work could be done, a bull, a ram and seven male lambs a year old were presented as a burnt offering, along with grain and drink offerings and a goat as a sin offering.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011464/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Deut. 31:10-13</a>) It is likely that the first of the twenty-four divisions of priests established by David began to serve at the temple after the Festival of Booths, inasmuch as the temple built by Solomon was inaugurated at the time of this festival in 1027 B.C.E.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011464/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Ki. 6:37, 38;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011464/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 24:1-18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011464/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 2 Chron. 5:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011464/11/3" data-bid="12-4" class="b"> 7:7-10</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The distinguishing mark of the Festival of Booths, the primary nature of it, was joyful thanksgiving. Jehovah’s desire was that his people should rejoice in him. “You must rejoice before Jehovah your God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011464/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Lev. 23:40</a>) It was a festival of thanksgiving for the ingathering, especially in the fact that, not only the grain was now gathered in, but also the oil and the wine, which contributed much to the enjoyment of life. During this festival the Israelites could meditate in their hearts upon the fact that their prosperity and abundance of fine things did not come through their own power. No, it was the care of Jehovah their God for them that brought them into this prosperity. They were to think deeply upon these things, for fear, as Moses had said, that “your heart may indeed be lifted up and you may indeed forget Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slaves.” Moses also declared: “And you must remember Jehovah your God, because he is the giver of power to you to make wealth; in order to carry out his covenant that he swore to your forefathers, as at this day.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011464/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Deut. 8:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011464/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 18</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Israel was commanded to live for one week in booths, “in order that your generations may know that it was in the booths that I made the sons of Israel to dwell when I was bringing them out of the land of Egypt. I am Jehovah your God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011464/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Lev. 23:42, 43</a>) They could recall with joy and thankfulness God’s care for them in the wilderness when they were provided shelter by Jehovah, “who caused you to walk through the great and fear-inspiring wilderness, with poisonous serpents and scorpions and with thirsty ground that has no water; who brought forth water for you out of the flinty rock; who fed you with manna in the wilderness, which your fathers had not known.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011464/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Deut. 8:15, 16</a>) This would give them reason to rejoice over God’s continually increasing care and bounty toward them.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>FEATURES ADDED LATER</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">A custom that came to be practiced later, possibly alluded to in the Christian Greek Scriptures (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011464/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">John 7:37, 38</a>) but not in the Hebrew Scriptures, was the drawing of water from the pool of Siloam and pouring it, along with wine, on the altar at the time of the morning sacrifice. According to most authorities, this occurred on seven days of the festival but not on the eighth. The priest would go to the pool of Siloam with a golden pitcher (except on the opening day of the festival, a sabbath, when the water was taken from a golden vessel in the temple, to which it had been carried from Siloam on the preceding day). He would time himself so as to return from Siloam with the water just as the priests in the temple were ready to lay the pieces of the sacrifice on the altar. As he entered by the Water Gate he was announced by a threefold blast from the priests’ trumpets. The water was then poured out into a basin leading to the base of the altar, at the same time that wine was being poured into a basin. Then the temple music accompanied the singing of the Hallel (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011464/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Psalms 113-118</a>), during which time the worshipers waved their palm branches toward the altar. This ceremony was understood as reminding the Israelites of God’s having provided water out of a rock in the wilderness and was a petition to God to provide rain for the next year’s crops, some of which were soon to be sown.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011464/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ex. 17:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011464/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Num. 20:8-11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011464/18/2" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> Deut. 8:15</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Another ceremony somewhat similar was that each day of the seven days of the festival the priests, in procession, would walk around the altar, singing, “Ah now, Jehovah, do save, please! Ah, now, Jehovah, do grant success, please!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011464/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 118:25</a>) On the seventh day, however, they made the circuit seven times.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">According to rabbinical sources, there was also another outstanding feature of this festival that, like the bringing in of the water of Siloam, was carried out in the time when Jesus was on earth. This ceremony began at the close of the fifteenth of Tishri, the first day of the festival, actually in the beginning of the sixteenth, the festival’s second day, and was carried on for the five succeeding nights. Preparations were made in the Court of the Women. Four great golden lampstands stood in the court, each having four golden bowls. Four youths of priestly descent would climb ladders with large pitchers of oil, filling the bowls. The old clothing of the priests was used as wicks for the lamps. Jewish writers say these lamps made a brilliant light that could be seen at a considerable distance, lighting up the courts of the <span id="page576" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="576" data-before-text="576"></span>houses in Jerusalem. Certain men, including some of the elders, danced with flaming torches in their hands and sang songs of praise, accompanied by musical instruments.</p>

We of the present generation should desire to be like Nehemiah, a governor of the province of Judah in the fifth century B.C.E. He took vigorous steps to halt the abandoning or neglecting of God’s house among His chosen people. This was not Solomon’s temple, which had been destroyed in the seventh century B.C.E., but was the temple that had been rebuilt in the sixth century B.C.E. after the remnant of worshipful Jews returned from the land of Babylon to Jerusalem. After mighty Babylon fell to the Medes and Persians in 539 B.C.E., the land of Judah became a Persian province under Cyrus the Great. In 455 B.C.E. King Artaxerxes of Persia appointed Nehemiah to govern the province of Judah and Jerusalem. Nehemiah did not ignore Jewish history up till then. He did not want the restored Jews of his generation to suffer calamity for mistakes like those of their ancestors. To that end he used the power of his governorship.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">13.

The temple of Jehovah that was then destroyed has never been rebuilt, and today we find on its former location a different structure known as the Dome of the Rock, dedicated to the Allah of the Moslems or Mohammedans. An investigation of the causes for this uncovers that it resulted from a misuse or abuse of the rebuilt temple of Jehovah. Truly Nehemiah had been concerned aright and he had not taken matters any too seriously. We do well to examine what measures he took.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">14.

Then prayer was offered up for the whole people by some ministerial Levites who stood upon a raised platform.

So in view of all this we are contracting a trustworthy arrangement, both in writing and attested by the seal of our princes, our Levites and our priests.”</p>

Again, God’s Law was read to the people for about three hours in the morning. In the afternoon, “they were making confession and bowing down to Jehovah their God.”  Then the Levites represented the people with their well-prepared prayer. ​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2013766/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Neh. 9:1-4</a>.</p><img src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/w13/2013/1607" data-img-small-src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/w13/2013/1606" alt="" width="300" height="180" class="south_center" />

For example, King David in his memorable farewell speech before the congregation of Israel shortly before his death said, among other things: “Yours, O Jehovah, are the greatness and the mightiness and the beauty and the eminence and the dignity, for everything in the heavens and in the earth is yours. . . . you are dominating everything, and in your hand there are power and mightiness and in your hand is ability to make great and to give strength to all.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961523/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:11, 12</a>) After the return from Babylonian captivity and after the walls of Jerusalem had been rebuilt in the days of Nehemiah, the priests and Levites of Israel in a seal-bound statement attested to Jehovah’s exclusive almightiness, saying: “You are Jehovah alone, you yourself have made the heavens, even the heaven of the heavens, and all their army, the earth and all that is upon it, the seas and all that is in them, and you are preserving all of them alive, and the army of the <span id="page428" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="428" data-before-text="428"></span>heavens are bowing down to you.

Numbered among these sensible ones are some few thousands of the modern-day spiritual Israelites who returned from captivity in Satan’s Babylonish organization A.D. 1919, the remnant of the anointed members of the body of Christ still on earth; and as part of the “twenty-four persons of advanced age” mentioned in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961523/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Revelation 11:16, 17</a>, these keep on saying: “We thank you, Jehovah God, the <em>Almighty,</em> the one who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and begun ruling as king,” that is, from and after A.D. 1914. Joining in this hallelujah chorus of praise to the almightiness of Jehovah are the voices of over 900,000 other individuals, who are indeed a “great crowd,” and these keep on saying with ever-increasing effectiveness in all parts of the inhabited earth: “Praise Jah, you people, because Jehovah our God, the <em>Almighty,</em> has begun to rule as king.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961523/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rev. 19:6</a>.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">17.

As already considered, human creatures have been using the forces and energies of Jehovah’s material creation for a long time and in a number of ways, whether they recognize and admit it or not.

Listen! By the mouth of his prophet Isaiah, the Almighty himself says: “Have you not come to know or have you not heard? Jehovah, the Creator of the extremities of the earth, is a God to time indefinite. He does not tire out or grow weary.” Moreover, if you have not already heard, this eternally Tireless One says that he is able to sustain weak and weary ones and to supply them with an abundance of vigorous power. “[Jehovah] is giving to the tired one power, and to the one without dynamic energy he makes full might abound. Boys even may tire out and grow weary, and young men themselves will without fail get to stumbling, but those who are hoping in Jehovah will regain power. They will mount up with wings like eagles. They will run and not grow weary; they will walk and not tire out.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961523/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isa. 40:28-31</a>.</p>

<strong>Answering the Roman Governor’s Question, “What Is Truth?”</strong><br/><p id="p48" data-pid="48" data-rel-pid="[109]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="40"><sup>40</sup></span> When on earth as a man, Jesus was determined to bear witness to the truth of God’s recorded word in the Hebrew Scriptures. On the night of falling into the hands of his enemies he said to his faithful apostles: “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">John 14:6</a>) Was he not correct in saying this? Yes, for he was indeed the Truth. He was no <em>shadow</em> Messiah or Christ. He was the <em>real</em> one promised. <span id="page655" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="655" data-before-text="655"></span>He was no <em>shadow</em> king-priest. He was substantially the <em>true</em> one that had been prefigured. As such, he benefits not only the circumcised Jews but also all the non-Jewish nations. Hence the apostle Paul says:</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" data-rel-pid="[109]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="41"><sup>41</sup></span> “I say that Christ actually became a minister of those who are circumcised in behalf of God’s truthfulness, so as to verify the promises He made to their forefathers, and that the nations might glorify God for his mercy. Just as it is written: ‘That is why I will openly acknowledge you among the nations and to your name I will make melody.’ And again he says: ‘Be glad, you nations, with his people.’ And again: ‘Praise Jehovah, all you nations, and let all the peoples praise him.’ And again Isaiah says: ‘There will be the root of Jesse [father of King David], and there will be one arising to rule nations; on him nations will rest their hope.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Rom. 15:8-12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/37/1" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> Ps. 18:49;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/37/2" data-bid="38-3" class="b"> 117:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/37/3" data-bid="38-4" class="b"> Deut. 32:43;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/37/4" data-bid="38-5" class="b"> Isa. 11:10</a>.</p><p id="p110" data-pid="110" class="qu">42. (a) How did Jesus actually become “a minister of those who are circumcised”? (b) How did Jesus “verify” God’s promises made to the forefathers?</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" data-rel-pid="[110]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="42"><sup>42</sup></span> Once when he encountered a Phoenician woman, Jesus Christ said: “I was not sent forth to any but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” When sending out his twelve apostles to preach the kingdom of the heavens, Jesus said to them: “Do not go off into the road of the nations, and do not enter into a Samaritan city; but, instead, go continually to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Matt. 15:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/38/1" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> 10:5, 6</a>) Thus, because he was born and circumcised as a Jew under the Mosaic law, Jesus “actually became a minister of those who are circumcised.” This ministry of Jesus Christ to the circumcised Jews was rendered “in behalf of God’s truthfulness,” because Jehovah God had said to the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob that all the nations of the earth would bless themselves by means of their seed. Naturally, by human birth, their “seed” would be Israelites or Jews, Hebrews. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Gen. 22:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/39/1" data-bid="40-2" class="b"> 26:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/39/2" data-bid="40-3" class="b"> 28:14</a>) Hence according to the natural order of things it was necessary for Jesus Christ to establish “God’s truthfulness” as regards those promises made to the three Hebrew patriarchs; how? By offering first to Jews the opportunity to receive the Abrahamic blessing and become the spiritual seed of Abraham. It was absolutely obligatory upon Jesus to respect the sworn oath of Jehovah God, because God had sworn with an oath that his promises to the patriarchs were truthful, and Jesus had to “verify” those promises.</p><p id="p111" data-pid="111" class="qu">43. (a) In order to keep what thing did Jehovah bring the descendants of the forefathers out of Egypt? (b) How did He strengthen his promises to the forefathers?</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" data-rel-pid="[111]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="43"><sup>43</sup></span> To the circumcised descendants of the patriarchs, Moses said: “It was because of Jehovah’s loving you, and because of his keeping the sworn statement that he had sworn to your forefathers, that Jehovah brought you out . . . from the hand of Pharaoh the king of Egypt.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Deut. 7:8</a>) God’s swearing to the patriarchs is further mentioned in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965801/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Psalm 105:7-11</a>,<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1965801/1">b</a> which says: “He is Jehovah our God.

<strong>Can You Display More Loving-kindness?</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">On the other hand, is your problem perhaps being overly sensitive, becoming easily offended? When hurt by someone, do you have the urge to retaliate, or the tendency to ‘clam up,’ refusing to speak to the individual for a considerable length of time? If so, there is need to apply loving-kindness in a particular way. As an aid in this regard, the Bible sets forth the perfect example of God himself, saying: “You are a God of <em>acts of forgiveness,</em> gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101977080/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Neh. 9:17</a>) If God, who never offends anyone, freely forgives the offensive deeds of others, how much more should imperfect humans do so!</p>

<strong>Why a God of Love Gives Reproof</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">How refreshing to stop and think that in all of this parents simply reflect God’s own splendid example! For he does not easily give up on his servants; rather, he displays an amazing degree of long-suffering toward them. Thus, Levites in the days of Nehemiah, when praying to God, referred to the Israelites’ experiences in the wilderness of Sinai and said:</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="si">“They themselves, even our forefathers, acted presumptuously and . . . they refused to listen, and they did not remember your wonderful acts that you performed with them, but they hardened their neck and appointed a head to return to their servitude in Egypt. But you are a God of acts of forgiveness, gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness, and <em>you did not leave them.”</em>​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1976884/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Neh. 9:16, 17</a>.</p>

<strong>Did You Commit the Unforgivable Sin?</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The sin of Judas was likewise unforgivable, being a deliberately selfish one. In fact, his betrayal of his Master was only the culmination of a course of hypocrisy and dishonesty. He had been a thief, robbing the treasury that had been entrusted to his care. When he saw Mary anointing Jesus with very costly perfume, Judas complained, and Jesus silenced him. Then out of selfish spite, Judas went to the rulers and bargained to betray Jesus for thirty pieces of silver. No wonder that Jesus <span id="page509" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="509" data-before-text="509"></span>said it would have been better had Judas never been born, and termed him “the son of destruction.” When Judas saw the consequences of his vile deed he felt remorse, but he was unable to revive himself to repentance because of his continued selfish course and the deliberate willfulness of his act.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 26:6-16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Mark 14:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> John 12:1-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/2/3" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 17:12</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Such unforgivable sins stand in striking contrast to those that God did forgive. Thus the grievous sin of David was forgiven—though not without punishment, let it not be forgotten—because of his long years of faithful service, because his repentance was sincere and because of God’s covenant with him. For similar reasons Peter’s sin of denying his Master was forgiven. He had been honest in his service of his Master—not like Judas—and his sin was due to fleshly weakness and so repentance and forgiveness were also granted him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Sam. 12:7-14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Ps. 51:1-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Matt. 19:27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 26:69-75</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>PLEADING FORGIVENESS</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">In view of the foregoing examples of sins that God forgave and those that he did not, the sincerely repentant Christian can come to God and plead with confidence for forgiveness, and that for a number of sound Scriptural reasons:</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">He can plead on the basis of inherited sin even as did David: “Look! . . . in sin my mother conceived me.” He can plead for forgiveness also on the basis of his past record of faithful service. Further, he can plead on the basis of God’s mercy: “You are a God of acts of forgiveness, gracious and merciful.” God’s name is another basis for pleading: “For your name’s sake, O Jehovah, you must even forgive my error, for it is considerable.” Closely related to the foregoing is another plea that David made: “Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God . . . that my tongue may joyfully tell about your righteousness.” And in particular is Jesus’ ransom sacrifice a basis for a Christian’s pleading with God for forgiveness: “By means of him we have the release by ransom through the blood of that one, yes, the forgiveness of our trespasses.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 51:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Neh. 9:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Ps. 25:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/4/3" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 51:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/4/4" data-bid="5-5" class="b"> Eph. 1:7</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">If a Christian who has sinned feels unable to pray because his sin has made him spiritually sick, then what? “Let him call the older men of the congregation to him, and let them pray over him, greasing him with oil in the name of Jehovah. And the prayer of faith will make the indisposed one well, and Jehovah will raise him up. Also, if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jas. 5:14, 15</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Even if the sin is of such a serious nature as to require disfellowshiping, that does not mean that the sin is unforgivable. However, to secure God’s forgiveness one must comply with his rules by also confessing his sin to those in charge of his congregation and willingly submitting to being punished. That such sins are forgivable is apparent from the words of the apostle Paul regarding such an erring one: “This rebuke given by the majority is sufficient for such a man, so that, on the contrary now, you should kindly forgive and comfort him, that somehow such a man may not be swallowed up by his being overly sad.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Cor. 2:6-8</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Often a run-down physical condition, perhaps due to overconscientiousness, is at the bottom of the anxiety of having committed the unforgivable sin. So never let the Devil discourage you so that you give up trying to serve God and doing what is right because of imagining you have committed the unforgivable sin. The ways of Jehovah God are not only just but also wise and, above all, loving. Certainly if he <span id="page510" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="510" data-before-text="510"></span>has no pleasure in the death of the wicked he has none in the loss of a servant of his. So keep feeding on God’s Word, especially such comforting sections as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 103</a>, associate with your Christian brothers and share in God’s work to the extent of your ability and opportunities. Doing so, you will become strong in faith, hope and love and free from any fear of having committed the unforgivable sin.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963607/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:13</a>.</p>

How can it be obtained?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">WHO is the person that is so righteous that he has no need of forgiveness? Actually there is not one, for “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” It is the wise person, therefore, that recognizes his need of forgiveness, and, in harmony with the instructions of the Lord Jesus, humbly prays to God: “Forgive us our sins.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963521/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 3:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963521/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Luke 11:4</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">But will God hear the confessions of the repentant sinner who is truly sorry for his wrongdoing and desires with all his heart to do what is right? Indeed, he will! David, a man well acquainted with the forgiveness of God, sang: “For you, O Jehovah, are good and ready to forgive; and the loving-kindness to all those calling upon you is abundant.” Years later an assembly of Levites acknowledged: “You are a God of acts of forgiveness, gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963521/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 86:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963521/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Neh. 9:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963521/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Dan. 9:9</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">God’s wonderful disposition to forgive is an invitation to all those who may have strayed into sinful ways. So do not feel that you are beyond recovery, that your sins disqualify you from God’s mercy. Take courage in Jehovah’s large capacity to forgive. Accept the invitation: “Let the wicked man leave his way, and the harmful man his thoughts; and let him return to Jehovah, who will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will forgive in a large way.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963521/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa. 55:7</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">While he was on the earth Jesus magnified this large capacity of his Father to forgive. Especially did he do so on the occasion when the self-righteous scribes and Pharisees ridiculed him, saying: “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.” Jesus responded by giving a series of illustrations in which he vindicated his welcoming of tax collectors and sinners by showing that such ones who repented became beloved by God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963521/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 15:2</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>THE LOST SHEEP AND THE DRACHMA COIN</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">First, he asked which one of those Pharisees would not go searching if one out of his flock of a hundred sheep got lost. He explained that just as there would be great joy on finding that one lost sheep, so there is more joy in heaven over just one sinner that repents than over ninety-nine self-righteous persons who feel no need of repentance. Yes, those that recognize themselves as sinners and who desire to correct their ways make the hearts of God’s heavenly family rejoice.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963521/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 15:3-7</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">To further illustrate the point, Jesus asked: “What woman with ten drachma coins, if she loses one drachma coin, does not light a lamp and sweep her house and search carefully until she finds it?” He explained that, just as her joy is great on finding this one coin, so great joy arises among God’s heavenly family when just one humble sinner repents and takes up His service.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963521/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 15:8-10</a>.</p>

That is why it can truthfully be said, Never in human history has there been a happier assembly of so many peaceable people as when the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses convened in New York city, July 27 to August 3, 1958, for never before had so many mild-tempered individuals gathered together at one time. It is utterly impossible for any other group of people to duplicate a convention like this, for only witnesses of Jehovah are able to reflect on earth the peaceableness, mildness and happiness that constantly radiate from the very personality of the Most High God.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="qu"> 2.

Certainly, then, his faithful and loyal witnesses must exhibit these godly qualities at all times and under all circumstances, whether isolated, as many of them are in Communist camps of slavery, or congregated, as more than two hundred thousand of them were at their New York city assembly. Their doing this is not discretionary. It is mandatory, for it is Jehovah’s will.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="qu"> 3, 4.

In fact, he was the most mild and gentle man ever to walk this earth. When inviting others to take upon them his yoke and become his disciples, Jesus said: “I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960081/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 11:29</a>) This one who was so peaceable that he proved fully worthy of the title “Prince of Peace” not only displayed mildness in his personal life and activity but also preached to others that they too should live a life of peace and mildness. Here is how Jesus stated this fundamental Christian principle on one occasion: “I say to you who are listening, Continue to love your enemies, to do good to those hating you, to bless those cursing you, to pray for those who do you injury. To him that strikes you on the one cheek offer the other also.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960081/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 6:27-29</a>) At times Jesus and his traveling companions were exhausted from their walking and talking and they sought a little seclusion and rest. However, the crowds rudely intruded upon their privacy. Instead of harshly rebuking them, Jesus suppressed his own personal feelings and tenderly and compassionately cared for their spiritual and physical needs. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960081/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 14:13-23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960081/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Mark 6:31-46</a>) Later, when Jesus peacefully rode into Jerusalem without a fight and presented himself as king, the words of the prophet were fulfilled: “Tell the daughter of Zion, ‘Look! your King is coming to you, <span id="page70" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="70" data-before-text="70"></span>mild-tempered, and mounted upon an ass.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960081/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 21:4, 5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960081/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Zech. 9:9</a>, AS.</p>

Z., United States.</strong></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957851/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Leviticus 3:17 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957851/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Nehemiah 8:10</a> are not at variance with each other. Leviticus refers to the layers of fat in animal bodies, which were not to be eaten. By the expression “fatty things” Nehemiah refers to rich portions, things not skinny, things not dry but luscious, including tasty things prepared with vegetable oils. Frequently “fat” is used figuratively to indicate richness or lushness or prosperity. Instances of this are “the fatness of the earth,” “his bread shall be fat,” “they found fat pasture,” “they took strong cities, and a fat land,” “the large and fat land which thou gavest,” “in a fat pasture shall they feed,” and “the fattest places of the province.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957851/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 27:28,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957851/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 39;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957851/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 49:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957851/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 1 Chron. 4:40;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957851/3/4" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> Neh. 9:25,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957851/3/5" data-bid="4-6" class="b"> 35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957851/3/6" data-bid="4-7" class="b"> Ezek. 34:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957851/3/7" data-bid="4-8" class="b"> Dan. 11:24</a>, <em>AV.</em></p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Now we are not under the Leviticus prohibition concerning fat, since we are not under the Mosaic law, it being made inoperative by God through Jesus’ death: “He kindly forgave us all our trespasses and blotted out the handwritten document against us which consisted of decrees and which was in opposition to us, and He has taken it out of the way by nailing it to the torture stake.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957851/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Col. 2:13, 14</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Does this mean we are no longer under the Law’s prohibition concerning blood? No, because the prohibition against eating or drinking blood was given long before the Mosaic law covenant, namely, in the days of Noah immediately after the flood. This prohibition against blood was incorporated into and restated in the Mosaic law covenant to give it renewed emphasis, but mankind in general still continued under the obligations of the Noachian mandate concerning the sanctity of creature blood. Thus when the law covenant, binding upon the Jews, was taken out of the way by Jehovah’s nailing it to the torture stake of Jesus Christ. the Jews still continued under the prohibitions against eating and drinking blood, along with all the rest of mankind down to this very day. Christians were specifically notified of this continuing prohibition concerning blood: “They should keep themselves from what is sacrificed to idols as well as from blood and what is killed without draining its blood and from fornication.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957851/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 21:25</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The prohibition against fat, however, was lifted with the removal of the Mosaic law covenant. Other foods listed as unclean under the Jewish law covenant were thus removed from under prohibition by abolition of that covenant, and Jewish Christians as well as Christians from among Gentiles could eat such foods in all good conscience, giving thanks to God therefor that such foods might be sanctified through prayer.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>● Sometimes in your publications you capitalize personal pronouns referring to Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, but generally you do not. Why not?—W. S., United States.</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The practice of some who capitalize all personal pronouns referring to Jehovah and Christ appears to be merely a matter of preference or style and not something made obligatory by any principle in God’s Word. The way to praise and honor Jehovah and Christ is not by the mere capitalizing of initial letters in personal pronouns referring to them, but is by study and service, obedience and preaching. In the oldest Bible manuscripts available all the letters are alike. Capitalization is of relatively recent origin. Says Sir Frederic Kenyon in his book <em>Textual Criticism of the New Testament,</em> pages 19, 20, 25: “Capital letters, which are occasionally used in business documents to mark the beginning of a clause, do not occur in literary papyri . . .” It is interesting to note that not even the translators of the respected <em>King James</em> or <em>Authorized Version</em> always capitalized personal pronouns referring to Jehovah and Christ.—See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957851/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 15:4-13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957851/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> John 1:1-4</a>, <em>AV</em>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">It is our policy to lower-case pronouns referring to Jehovah God and Jesus Christ in all our publications, with the exception that capitals are used when other pronouns in the sentence might make the meaning doubtful. If, for instance, both Jehovah and Jeremiah are mentioned in a sentence and then in that sentence the pronoun “he” occurs, the “h” would be capitalized if the pronoun were referring to Jehovah and it would be lower-cased if it referred to Jeremiah.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Questions From Readers</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">During the days of Moses and Joshua, some older men in the congregation were judges in the sense that they were chosen to hear and decide legal cases. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986409/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Exodus 18:21, 22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986409/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Joshua 8:33;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986409/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 23:2</a>) After Joshua’s death, Israel fell away from true worship and came to be afflicted by other peoples. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986409/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Judges 2:16</a> says: “So Jehovah would raise up <em>judges,</em> and they would save them out of the hand of their pillagers.” Jehovah first raised up as a judge, or ‘savior,’ the man named Othniel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986409/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Judges 3:9</a>) After that came Ehud, Shamgar, Barak, Gideon, Tola, Jair, Jephthah, Ibzan, Elon, Abdon, and Samson.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Aside from these 12, the Bible mentions Deborah, Eli, and Samuel in connection with judging. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986409/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Judges 4:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986409/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 1 Samuel 4:16-18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986409/5/2" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 7:15, 16</a>) However, Deborah is called first a prophetess, and she is linked with Judge Barak, who particularly took the lead in delivering the people from oppression. Similarly, Eli was principally a high priest, not a ‘savior’ who led Israel to freedom through battle. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986409/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Nehemiah 9:27</a>) Hence, while Deborah and Eli had a role in judging Israel, there is reason not to list them with the 12 men who clearly and primarily were especially ‘raised up’ as judges. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986409/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 13:20</a> says that “judges [were given] <em>until Samuel the prophet.”</em> This limits what might be known as the period of the judges, and it shows why Samuel and his sons are usually not counted among the judges either.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986409/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Samuel 8:1</a>.</p>

<strong>Part Two</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Clergymen of Christendom cannot defend themselves by saying that they are Jehovah’s witnesses by being witnesses of Jesus because, as they say, Jehovah is the Old Testament name for Jesus and so Jesus is Jehovah and they (the clergy) merely use Jesus instead of the name Jehovah. They point to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964123/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Isaiah 43:10</a> in which Jehovah says not only “Ye are my witnesses” but also these words (in the <em>King James Version</em>): “Before me there was no God formed,<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1964123/0">a</a> neither shall there be after me.” And also to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964123/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Isa 43 verse 11</a>, which reads (in the same <em>King James Version</em>): “I, even I, am <span id="page115" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="115" data-before-text="115"></span>the LORD; and besides me there is no saviour.” This, the clergy say, proves that Jehovah and Jesus are one and the same God, because here the Lord Jehovah says: “Besides me there is no saviour,” and the New Testament says that Jesus is our Savior.</p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">19. What do the clergy of Christendom overlook by this interpretation?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> In arguing this way those clergymen do not point to the later prophecy of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964123/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Obadiah, verse 21</a> (<em>AV</em>; <em>AS; RS</em>), which reads: “And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD’S.” Please, note here that there are other saviors besides the Lord Jehovah. Those clergymen also do not point to the following scriptures that speak of other saviors: “And the LORD gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964123/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">2 Ki. 13:5</a>, <em>AV</em>) “According to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964123/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Neh. 9:27</a>, <em>AV</em>) “And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the LORD of hosts . . . and he shall send them a saviour, and a great one, and he shall deliver them.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964123/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Isa. 19:20</a>, <em>AV</em>) So Jehovah can raise up others to act as saviors.</p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">20. Explain how Jesus is a savior for mankind.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> In harmony with this fact the Holy Scriptures testify that Jesus Christ was only an agent of Jehovah God for the salvation of mankind. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964123/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Acts 5:30-32</a> (<em>AV</em>) the Christian apostles said to the Jewish Sanhedrin: “The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree. Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins. And we are his witnesses of these things.” In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964123/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Acts 13:23</a> (<em>AV</em>) the apostle Paul says: “Of this man’s [David’s] seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus.” In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964123/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">1 John 4:14</a> (<em>AS</em>) the apostle writes: “And we have beheld and bear witness that the Father hath sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.” For anybody to argue that Jesus Christ is the one and only Savior would be, in the face of all these Bible texts, to deny that God, the Father of Jesus Christ, is a Savior. But God the Father is the <em>only</em> Source of salvation in that he sent his only-begotten Son to this earth to become the man Jesus Christ and to die as a ransom sacrifice; and God the Father raised up his Son from the dead and thus also saved his own Son.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964123/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Heb. 5:5-8</a>.</p><p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">21, 22. What argument is next used by the clergy in explaining <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964123/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Isaiah 43:10</a>, and by their doing so what happens?</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> Nevertheless, not wholly satisfied with the foregoing, the clergy of Christendom refer back to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964123/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Isaiah 43:10</a>, where Jehovah, in addressing his witnesses, says: “Before me there was no God [<em>El</em>] formed, neither shall there be after me.” (<em>AV</em>) Then they point to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964123/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Isaiah 9:6</a> (<em>AV</em>), which calls Jesus Christ “The mighty God [<em>El</em>], The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace,” and they say that, since there was no God formed before Jehovah and there was to be no God after Jehovah, this proves that Jehovah and Jesus are one and the same God and that Jehovah is Jesus. They say that this also proves that the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</em> is wrong in translating <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964123/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">John 1:1</a> as follows: “In the beginning the Word was, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god,” that is, a god in addition to Jehovah.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> By using such an argument the trinitarian clergymen lift Jehovah’s words in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964123/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Isaiah 43:10</a> out of their context and show that they do not understand what Jehovah by his prophet is talking about.</p><p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu">23, 24. Just what does Jehovah tell Israel in this <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964123/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">43rd chapter of Isaiah</a>, and how are we to understand <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964123/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Isa 43 verses ten and eleven</a>?</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> In the first verse of the forty-third chapter <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964123/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Isa 43:1</a> Jehovah tells Isaiah’s people that He is the Creator of the nation of Jacob, <span id="page116" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="116" data-before-text="116"></span>He is the Former of the nation of Israel. Jehovah created and formed that nation. The nation of Israel did not create and form Jehovah as their God. The other nations, the Gentile nations, had created their gods and had formed images to represent their gods, but this was not the case with the nation of Israel and their God Jehovah. Because of this vital fact Jehovah challenges the many gods of the nations and tells such gods to furnish their witnesses to testify with proof that they are really gods who foreknow the future and who foretell the future. But the nation of Israel could tell many actual historical facts about their God in proof that he is a real living God, although he permits no material idol image to be made to represent him. Hence Jehovah tells the Israelites that they are <em>his</em> witnesses and are his servant whom he has chosen. Why?</p>

For example, King David in his memorable farewell speech before the congregation of Israel shortly before his death said, among other things: “Yours, O Jehovah, are the greatness and the mightiness and the beauty and the eminence and the dignity, for everything in the heavens and in the earth is yours. . . . you are dominating everything, and in your hand there are power and mightiness and in your hand is ability to make great and to give strength to all.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961523/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:11, 12</a>) After the return from Babylonian captivity and after the walls of Jerusalem had been rebuilt in the days of Nehemiah, the priests and Levites of Israel in a seal-bound statement attested to Jehovah’s exclusive almightiness, saying: “You are Jehovah alone, you yourself have made the heavens, even the heaven of the heavens, and all their army, the earth and all that is upon it, the seas and all that is in them, and you are preserving all of them alive, and the army of the <span id="page428" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="428" data-before-text="428"></span>heavens are bowing down to you.

Numbered among these sensible ones are some few thousands of the modern-day spiritual Israelites who returned from captivity in Satan’s Babylonish organization A.D. 1919, the remnant of the anointed members of the body of Christ still on earth; and as part of the “twenty-four persons of advanced age” mentioned in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961523/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Revelation 11:16, 17</a>, these keep on saying: “We thank you, Jehovah God, the <em>Almighty,</em> the one who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and begun ruling as king,” that is, from and after A.D. 1914. Joining in this hallelujah chorus of praise to the almightiness of Jehovah are the voices of over 900,000 other individuals, who are indeed a “great crowd,” and these keep on saying with ever-increasing effectiveness in all parts of the inhabited earth: “Praise Jah, you people, because Jehovah our God, the <em>Almighty,</em> has begun to rule as king.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961523/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rev. 19:6</a>.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">17.

As already considered, human creatures have been using the forces and energies of Jehovah’s material creation for a long time and in a number of ways, whether they recognize and admit it or not. But is there a more direct way for weakling man to draw on this inexhaustible Source to supplement the very limited natural strength of the fleshly body and mind?</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">18.

Listen! By the mouth of his prophet Isaiah, the Almighty himself says: “Have you not come to know or have you not heard? Jehovah, the Creator of the extremities of the earth, is a God to time indefinite. He does not tire out or grow weary.” Moreover, if you have not already heard, this eternally Tireless One says that he is able to sustain weak and weary ones and to supply them with an abundance of vigorous power. “[Jehovah] is giving to the tired one power, and to the one without dynamic energy he makes full might abound. Boys even may tire out and grow weary, and young men themselves will without fail get to stumbling, but those who are hoping in Jehovah will regain power. They will mount up with wings like eagles. They will run and not grow weary; they will walk and not tire out.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961523/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isa. 40:28-31</a>.</p>

Leviticus refers to the layers of fat in animal bodies, which were not to be eaten. By the expression “fatty things” Nehemiah refers to rich portions, things not skinny, things not dry but luscious, including tasty things prepared with vegetable oils. Frequently “fat” is used figuratively to indicate richness or lushness or prosperity. Instances of this are “the fatness of the earth,” “his bread shall be fat,” “they found fat pasture,” “they took strong cities, and a fat land,” “the large and fat land which thou gavest,” “in a fat pasture shall they feed,” and “the fattest places of the province.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957851/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 27:28,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957851/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 39;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957851/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 49:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957851/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 1 Chron. 4:40;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957851/3/4" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> Neh. 9:25,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957851/3/5" data-bid="4-6" class="b"> 35;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957851/3/6" data-bid="4-7" class="b"> Ezek. 34:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957851/3/7" data-bid="4-8" class="b"> Dan. 11:24</a>, <em>AV.</em></p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Now we are not under the Leviticus prohibition concerning fat, since we are not under the Mosaic law, it being made inoperative by God through Jesus’ death: “He kindly forgave us all our trespasses and blotted out the handwritten document against us which consisted of decrees and which was in opposition to us, and He has taken it out of the way by nailing it to the torture stake.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957851/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Col. 2:13, 14</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Does this mean we are no longer under the Law’s prohibition concerning blood? No, because the prohibition against eating or drinking blood was given long before the Mosaic law covenant, namely, in the days of Noah immediately after the flood. This prohibition against blood was incorporated into and restated in the Mosaic law covenant to give it renewed emphasis, but mankind in general still continued under the obligations of the Noachian mandate concerning the sanctity of creature blood. Thus when the law covenant, binding upon the Jews, was taken out of the way by Jehovah’s nailing it to the torture stake of Jesus Christ. the Jews still continued under the prohibitions against eating and drinking blood, along with all the rest of mankind down to this very day. Christians were specifically notified of this continuing prohibition concerning blood: “They should keep themselves from what is sacrificed to idols as well as from blood and what is killed without draining its blood and from fornication.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957851/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 21:25</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The prohibition against fat, however, was lifted with the removal of the Mosaic law covenant. Other foods listed as unclean under the Jewish law covenant were thus removed from under prohibition by abolition of that covenant, and Jewish Christians as well as Christians from among Gentiles could eat such foods in all good conscience, giving thanks to God therefor that such foods might be sanctified through prayer.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>● Sometimes in your publications you capitalize personal pronouns referring to Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, but generally you do not. Why not?—W. S., United States.</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The practice of some who capitalize all personal pronouns referring to Jehovah and Christ appears to be merely a matter of preference or style and not something made obligatory by any principle in God’s Word. The way to praise and honor Jehovah and Christ is not by the mere capitalizing of initial letters in personal pronouns referring to them, but is by study and service, obedience and preaching. In the oldest Bible manuscripts available all the letters are alike. Capitalization is of relatively recent origin. Says Sir Frederic Kenyon in his book <em>Textual Criticism of the New Testament,</em> pages 19, 20, 25: “Capital letters, which are occasionally used in business documents to mark the beginning of a clause, do not occur in literary papyri . . .” It is interesting to note that not even the translators of the respected <em>King James</em> or <em>Authorized Version</em> always capitalized personal pronouns referring to Jehovah and Christ.—See <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957851/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 15:4-13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957851/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> John 1:1-4</a>, <em>AV</em>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">It is our policy to lower-case pronouns referring to Jehovah God and Jesus Christ in all our publications, with the exception that capitals are used when other pronouns in the sentence might make the meaning doubtful. If, for instance, both Jehovah and Jeremiah are mentioned in a sentence and then in that sentence the pronoun “he” occurs, the “h” would be capitalized if the pronoun were referring to Jehovah and it would be lower-cased if it referred to Jeremiah.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Why Many Now Living Have Opportunity Never to Die</strong><br/><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">Secular historians are in agreement that Babylon fell to Cyrus the Persian in the year 539 B.C.E. This date is substantiated by all available historical records of ancient times. The Bible reveals that in his first year of rule, Cyrus issued a decree permitting the exiled Israelites to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple. There being first the brief rule of Darius the Mede over Babylon, Cyrus’ first year of rule toward Babylon evidently extended from 538 to 537 B.C.E. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974078/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Daniel 5:30, 31</a>) As considerable distance in traveling was involved, it must have been by the “seventh month” of 537 B.C.E. (rather than 538 B.C.E.) that the Israelites were back in their cities, ending the desolation of Jerusalem and the land of Judah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974078/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ezra 3:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974078/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 6</a>) Nevertheless, they remained under Gentile domination, and therefore spoke of themselves as ‘slaves upon their own land.’​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101974078/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Nehemiah 9:36, 37</a>.</p>

<strong>Why the Changes in World Governments Since 1914?</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">This return to kingship was not the establishment of the kingdom of God, for Nebuchadnezzar had never been a worshiper of the true God, but worshiped the Babylonian idol gods, as was shown by his <span id="page758" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="758" data-before-text="758"></span>attempt to force Daniel’s three faithful companions Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego to worship a great golden idol that he set up on the plain of Dura. For their upholding Jehovah’s sovereignty and refusing to bow to the idol, he threw them into a superheated furnace, but he found out then that Jehovah was superior, for He protected these three uncompromising worshipers of the true God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964923/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Daniel, chapter 3</a>) Nebuchadnezzar never built a temple to Jehovah God even after his restoration from the seven years of madness, but he did build fifty-four temples at Babylon to all the false gods, which gods symbolized merely the attributes of Bel and his son Marduk, or Merodach. He also built great public works. He made Babylon the wonder city of the ancient world and, to satisfy the homesick longings of his Median queen, he built the famous Hanging Gardens of Babylon that were rated as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>KINGDOM NEVER RESTORED TO JUDAH</strong></p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Ever since the kingdom covenant had been made with David and his line of descent, one ruling by Jehovah’s right sat upon the throne in Jerusalem, and the Gentile world powers, therefore, had the kingdom of Judah in their way as a roadblock to complete world domination. But when Judah was cut down and went into exile in 607 B.C.E., then world domination as typically symbolized in the kingdom of Judah passed into the hands of Gentile rulers, beginning with Nebuchadnezzar. In the case of Judah, however, the kingdom was not restored at the end of seven years, neither was it restored at the time of their release and return from Babylon years later, in 537 B.C.E., because even this was done under the authority of another Gentile power, Persia, successor to Babylon as world power and represented in the dream image of Nebuchadnezzar, in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964923/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Daniel, chapter 2</a>, by the breast and arms of the image, coming after the head of gold. The Jews themselves admitted this later on, 152 years after the Babylonians had destroyed Jerusalem, namely, in 455 B.C.E. The Levites said, in public prayer to Jehovah God before the people gathered at the rebuilt temple:</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="si">“Finally you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands. And in your abundant mercy you did not make an extermination of them or leave them; for you are a God gracious and merciful. . . . Look! We are today slaves; and as for the land that you gave to our forefathers to eat its fruitage and its good things, look! we are slaves upon it, and its produce is abounding for the kings that you have put over us because of our sins, and over our bodies they are ruling and over our domestic animals, according to their liking, and we are in great distress.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964923/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Neh. 9:4, 5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964923/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 30-37</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The long period of Gentile world domination is called the “appointed times of the nations” in the Scriptures. Jesus said, more than five hundred years after the Jews’ release from Babylon and restoration to Jerusalem: “Jerusalem will be trampled on by the nations, until the appointed times of the nations are fulfilled.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1964923/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Luke 21:24</a>) Even though Jerusalem at that time was still standing, yet the kingship in the hands of a king of the line of David was not restored. The Jews were under the oppressive hand of the Sixth World Power, the Roman Empire, their nation to be destroyed later, in 70 C.E., by this world power. So certainly the kingdom right, represented by Jerusalem, was being trodden upon and the nation was in the hands of the Gentile rulers.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Nebuchadnezzar, a pagan, and never a worshiper of Jehovah God, was not himself important, and while his kingdom was restored to him after seven years of madness, it was not for his benefit that this drama was enacted. Also, Judah was only a typical kingdom and its kingship was <span id="page759" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="759" data-before-text="759"></span>never restored. So, then, there is a great major fulfillment. This would mean that the “seven times” would have a larger, extended meaning, at the end of which “times” the kingdom of God in the hands of Shiloh would be established. What is the length of a symbolic “time” and of the “seven times”?</p>

<strong>Nehemiah</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><strong>Law Observance Restored.</strong> It was probably at Nehemiah’s direction that an assembly was held in the public square near the Water Gate. Although Ezra the priest evidently took the lead in giving instruction in the Law, Nehemiah also shared therein.

During this assembly a general confession of Israel’s sin was made. Thereafter a written confession contract was drawn up. This confession contract or “trustworthy arrangement” was attested by the princes, Levites, and priests. Nehemiah, “the Tirshatha [governor],” was the first to attest it by seal. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003212/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ne 8:13–10:1</a>) All the people agreed to refrain from intermarriage with foreigners, to observe the Sabbaths, and to support the temple service.

<strong>A Jerusalem True to Its Name</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> There is a proper time and place to correct serious deficiencies among God’s people. Apparently realizing that this was such a time, Ezra and Nehemiah arranged for a day of fasting on the 24th of the month of Tishri. Again God’s Law was read, and the people made confession of their sins. Then the Levites reviewed God’s merciful dealings with his wayward people, made beautiful expressions of praise to Jehovah, and contracted “a trustworthy arrangement” attested by the seal of their princes, Levites, and priests.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998764/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Nehemiah 9:1-38</a>.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">11.

Clearly, they were determined ‘not to neglect the house of their God.’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998764/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Nehemiah 10:32-39</a>.</p>

<strong>Neglecting the House of the Creator of Heaven and Earth</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Future generations are apt to repeat the mistakes of previous generations, unless they take to heart the lessons taught by past history, especially Bible history. So, like people of the past, they suffer the same or similar bad consequences for the <span id="page744" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="744" data-before-text="744"></span>same bad conduct toward God’s house. We of the present generation should desire to be like Nehemiah, a governor of the province of Judah in the fifth century B.C.E. He took vigorous steps to halt the abandoning or neglecting of God’s house among His chosen people. This was not Solomon’s temple, which had been destroyed in the seventh century B.C.E., but was the temple that had been rebuilt in the sixth century B.C.E. after the remnant of worshipful Jews returned from the land of Babylon to Jerusalem. After mighty Babylon fell to the Medes and Persians in 539 B.C.E., the land of Judah became a Persian province under Cyrus the Great. In 455 B.C.E. King Artaxerxes of Persia appointed Nehemiah to govern the province of Judah and Jerusalem. Nehemiah did not ignore Jewish history up till then. He did not want the restored Jews of his generation to suffer calamity for mistakes like those of their ancestors. To that end he used the power of his governorship.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">13. What happened to God’s temple in 70 C.E., and what shows whether Nehemiah was at fault?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> It was not Nehemiah’s fault that this rebuilt temple in Jerusalem suffered destruction by the Roman legions under General Titus in the year 70 of our Common Era. The temple of Jehovah that was then destroyed has never been rebuilt, and today we find on its former location a different structure known as the Dome of the Rock, dedicated to the Allah of the Moslems or Mohammedans. An investigation of the causes for this uncovers that it resulted from a misuse or abuse of the rebuilt temple of Jehovah. Truly Nehemiah had been concerned aright and he had not taken matters any too seriously. We do well to examine what measures he took.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">14. What building work did Nehemiah first take care of, and on Tishri 24 thereafter how did the Israelite celebrators deport themselves?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> First, Nehemiah enlisted the efforts of the restored Jews to rebuild the protective walls of Jerusalem, in fifty-two days. Then he turned his attention more to the things of the temple and to the spiritual condition of the people of Judah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Neh. 6:15 to 7:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 8:1-9</a>) In the lunar month following the completion of the walls of Jerusalem, namely, on the twenty-fourth day of the month Tishri, the people who had just finished celebrating the festival of booths at Jerusalem gathered together in a more serious mood, “with fasting and with sackcloth and dirt upon themselves.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Neh. 9:1</a>.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">15, 16. (a) On this occasion what was read, and there was a confession of what? (b) The prayer then offered closed with what reference to slavery and to a “trustworthy arrangement”?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> By that time the writing of all the inspired Hebrew Scriptures (39 books) had been completed, with the exception of the books of Nehemiah and Malachi. However, on this solemn occasion there was a reading from only the “book of the law” (the five books of Moses) for a fourth part of the daylight period (three hours), after which they made confession of the sins of both themselves and their forefathers, and also bowed down in worship before Jehovah their God. Then prayer was offered up for the whole people by some ministerial Levites who stood upon a raised platform. The prayer closed with this statement, as recorded in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965921/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Nehemiah 9:36-38</a>:</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> “Look! We are today slaves; and as for the land that you gave to our forefathers to eat its fruitage and its good things, look! we are slaves upon it, and its produce is abounding for the kings that you have put over us because of our sins, and over our bodies they are ruling and over our domestic animals, according to their liking, and we are in great distress. So in view of all this we are contracting a trustworthy arrangement, both in writing and attested by the seal of our princes, our Levites and our priests.”</p>

<strong>Genealogy</strong><br/><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">These genealogies were carefully preserved down to the start of the Common Era. This is proved by the fact that each family of Israel was able to go back to the city of its father’s house to be registered in response to Caesar Augustus’ decree shortly before Jesus’ birth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Luke 2:1-5</a>) Also, John the Baptist’s father Zechariah is noted as of the priestly division of Abijah and John’s mother Elizabeth as from the daughters of Aaron. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Luke 1:5</a>) Anna the prophetess is spoken of as “of Asher’s tribe.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Luke 2:36</a>) And, of course, the extensive listings of Jesus’ forefathers at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Matthew, chapter 1</a>, and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Luke, chapter 3</a>, make it <span id="page636" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="636" data-before-text="636"></span>clear that such records were kept in the public archives, available for examination.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">The historian Josephus gives testimony to the existence of Jewish official genealogical registers when he says: “Now, I am not only sprung from a sacerdotal family in general, but from the first of the twenty-four courses; and . . . of the chief family of that first course also.” Then, after pointing out that his mother was descended from Asamoneus, he concludes: “Thus have I set down the genealogy of my family as I have found it described in the public records, and so bid adieu to those who calumniate me.”—<em>The Life of Flavius Josephus,</em> par. 1.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">The official genealogies of the Jews were destroyed, not by King Herod the Great, as some have supposed, but by the Romans at the destruction of Jerusalern in 70 C.E. Since that time the Jews have been unable to establish their descent in even the two most important lines, David and Levi.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="ss"><strong>PROBLEMS IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF GENEALOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS</strong></p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">In determining relationships, often the context or a comparison of parallel lists or of texts from different parts of the Bible is necessary. For example, “son” may actually mean a grandson or merely a descendant. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Matt. 1:1</a>) Again, a list of names may appear to be a register of brothers, the sons of one man. On closer observation and by comparison with other texts, however, it may prove to be the register of a genealogical line, naming some sons and also some grandsons or later descendants. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Genesis 46:21</a> evidently lists both sons and grandsons of Benjamin as “sons,” as can be seen by a comparison with <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Numbers 26:38-40</a>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">The above situation is found even in the genealogies of some major families. For example, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 6:22-24</a> lists ten “sons of Kohath.” But in the eighteenth verse, and at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Exodus 6:18</a>, we find only four sons attributed to Kohath. And examination of the context shows that the listing of “sons of Kohath” at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 6:22-24</a> is in reality part of a genealogy of <em>families</em> of the line of Kohath who had representative members present for appointment by David to certain temple duties.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">Conversely, “father” may mean “grandfather.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Dan. 5:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/51/1" data-bid="52-2" class="b"> 18</a>) In many places, such as at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 26:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/52/1" data-bid="53-2" class="b"> 1 Kings 15:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/52/2" data-bid="53-3" class="b"> 24</a>, and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">2 Kings 15:38</a>, the Hebrew word <em>ʼav</em> (father) also is used in the sense of “ancestor,” or “forefather.” Similarly, the Hebrew words <em>ʼem</em> (mother) and <em>bath</em> (daughter) are used occasionally for “grandmother” and “granddaughter” respectively.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">1 Ki. 15:10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/54/1" data-bid="55-2" class="b"> 13</a>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="ss"><strong><em>Cities and plural names</em></strong></p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">In some lists a man may be said to be the “father” of a certain city, as at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 2:50-54</a>, where, for example, Salma is called “the father of Bethlehem” and Shobal “the father of Kiriath-jearim.” Evidently the cities of Bethlehem and Kiriath-jearim were either founded by these men or populated by their descendants. The same list reads, further: “The sons of Salma were Bethlehem and the Netophathites, Atroth-beth-joab and half of the Manahathites, the Zorites.” (Vs. 54) Here Netophathites, Manahathites and Zorites were evidently families.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Genesis 10:13, 14</a>, the names of Mizraim’s descendants have what appear to be plural forms.

However, it should be borne in mind that other names in dual or plural form, such as Ephraim, Appaim, Diblaim, Meshillemoth, and also the above-named Mizraim, son of Ham, each refer to one individual.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Gen. 41:52;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/57/1" data-bid="58-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 2:30, 31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/57/2" data-bid="58-3" class="b"> Hos. 1:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/57/3" data-bid="58-4" class="b"> 2 Chron. 28:12</a>.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="ss"><strong><em>Abbreviated lists</em></strong></p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">Often the Bible writers greatly abbreviated a genealogical list, evidently naming only family heads of the more prominent houses, or important personages, or persons most important to the particular history being considered. At times descent from a certain remote ancestor was apparently all that the chronicler was concerned with showing; therefore he could leave out many intermediate names.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">One example of such abridgment is found in Ezra’s own genealogy. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/58/0" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Ezra 7:1-5</a>) He records his descent from Aaron the high priest, but in a parallel listing at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 6:3-14</a>, several names appear in verses 7 to 10 that are dropped at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/60/0" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Ezra 7:3</a>. Likely Ezra did this to avoid unnecessary repetition and to shorten the long list of names. Still, the list was perfectly adequate to prove his priestly descent. Ezra says that he is the “son” of Seraiah, meaning that he was his descendant, for he must have been Seraiah’s great-grandson, or possibly his great-great-grandson. Seraiah was high priest and was killed by Nebuchadnezzar at the time of the exile to Babylon (607 B.C.E.), his son Jehozadak being taken into exile. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">2 Ki. 25:18-21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/61/1" data-bid="62-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 6:14, 15</a>) Joshua (Jeshua) the high priest, who returned seventy years later with Zerubbabel, was Seraiah’s grandson. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/62/0" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Ezra 5:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/62/1" data-bid="63-2" class="b"> Hag. 1:1</a>) Ezra traveled to Jerusalem sixty-nine years after that, which circumstance would make it impossible for Ezra to be Seraiah’s actual son and Jehozadak’s brother.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">Another thing that we learn from comparing genealogies here is that Ezra, though descended from Aaron through Seraiah, was evidently not from <em>that</em> line of Seraiah in which the office of high priest was hereditary, namely, from Jehozadak, but from a son born later to either Seraiah or Jehozadak. The high-priestly line from Seraiah ran through Joshua (Jeshua), Joiakim and Eliashib, the latter being high priest during the governorship of Nehemiah. Ezra, then, achieved his objective with his abridged genealogy, supplying just sufficient names to prove his position in the lineage of Aaron.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/63/0" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Neh. 3:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/63/1" data-bid="64-2" class="b"> 12:10</a>.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="ss"><strong>SOME REASONS FOR VARIATIONS IN GENEALOGICAL LISTS</strong></p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb">A son who died childless was often not named; in some cases the man may have had a daughter but no son, and the inheritance may have been transmitted through a daughter who, in marriage, went under another family head in the same tribe. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Num. 36:7, 8</a>) At times the genealogy may merge a less prominent family under another family head, so that such minor family is not listed. Therefore childlessness, transmission of inheritance through women, perhaps adoption, or failure to establish a separate ancestral house caused names to be dropped out of some of the genealogical lists, while new houses formed might add new names to the lists. It is obvious, therefore, that the names in a later genealogy might differ at many points from those in an earlier listing.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">A number of family heads may appear in what seems to be a list of brothers but which may actually include nephews, as in Jacob’s “adoption” of Joseph’s sons, Jacob saying: “Ephraim and Manasseh will become mine like Reuben and Simeon.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/65/0" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Gen. 48:5</a>) Later, therefore, Ephraim and Manasseh are counted alongside their uncles as tribal heads.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/66/0" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Num. 2:18-21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/66/1" data-bid="67-2" class="b"> Josh. 17:17</a>.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/67/0" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Nehemiah, chapter 10</a>, presents a number of names attesting by seal a “trustworthy arrangement” to perform God’s commandments. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/68/0" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Neh. 9:38</a>) In these lists, the names given are not necessarily the names of the individuals entering into the agreements, but may refer to the houses involved, the ancestral head being named. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011609/69/0" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Ezra 10:16</a>.) This may be indicated by the fact that many of the names listed are the same as those listed as returning with Zerubbabel from Babylon some eighty years earlier. So, while those present may in some cases have had the same name as the ancestral head, they may have been merely representatives of the ancestral houses listed by those names.</p>

<strong>Sea</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">James’ brother Jude warns his fellow Christians of the great danger from wicked men who slip into the congregation with the purpose of bringing in moral defilement. He calls them “wild waves of the sea that foam up their own causes for shame.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013776/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Jude 4-13</a>) Jude may have had in mind an earlier expression of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013776/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Isaiah (57:20</a>) and may be figuratively describing such ones’ passionate, reckless disregard for God’s laws and their rushing against the divinely constituted moral barriers in their degraded, lustful course. As one commentator remarks: “. . . they cast forth <span id="page1462" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1462" data-before-text="1462"></span>to public view the mire and dirt of their excesses, . . . So these men foam out their own acts of shame, and cast them forth for men to see, and so to blame the Church for the ill-deeds of these professors.” (F. C. Cook, <em>Commentary</em> on Jude) Another says: “What they impart is as unsubstantial and valueless as the foam of the oceanside, and is in fact a proclamation of their own shame.”—Schaff-Lange, <em>Commentary</em> on Jude; compare Peter’s description of such men at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013776/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">2 Peter 2:10-22</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"></p>
