It apparently designates them as descendants of Agag and hence of Amalekite descent.

Josephus refers to Haman as “of Amalekite descent.” (<em>Jewish Antiquities,</em> XI, 209 [vi, 5]) Mordecai was a descendant of Kish of the tribe of Benjamin, thus making him and Haman, in a sense, traditional enemies.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000131/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Es 2:5</a>.</p>

<strong>Amalek</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">There is no further direct mention of the Amalekites in Biblical or secular history. However, “Haman the son of . . . the Agagite” was probably a descendant, for “Agag” was the title or name of certain Amalekite kings. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000216/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Es 3:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000216/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Nu 24:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000216/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 1Sa 15:8, 9</a>) Thus the Amalekites, along with others mentioned by name, were exterminated in order “that people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000216/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps 83:6-18</a>.</p>

If, indeed, Haman was an Amalekite, this in itself would explain why he harbored such great hatred for the Jews, for Jehovah had decreed the eventual extermination of the Amalekites. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001833/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ex 17:14-16</a>) This was because they showed hatred for God and his people by taking the initiative to sally forth in attack on the Israelites when they were traveling through the wilderness.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001833/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex 17:8</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Haman was a servant of King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I) of Persia, who ruled early in the fifth century B.C.E. Haman was honored and appointed as prime minister over the Persian Empire. Enraged by the refusal of Mordecai the Jew to bow down to him, Haman plotted the destruction of Mordecai and all the Jews in the empire. He painted the Jews as undesirable in the empire, lawbreakers, having laws “different from all other people’s.” He added an economic appeal, saying to the king: “Let there be a writing that they be destroyed; and ten thousand silver talents <span id="page1024" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1024" data-before-text="1024"></span>[c. $66,060,000] I shall pay into the hands of those doing the work by bringing it into the king’s treasury.” The king gave Haman his signet ring and replied: “The silver is given to you, also the people, to do with them according to what is good in your own eyes.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001833/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Es 3:1-11</a>.</p>

<strong>Persecution by Permission of Jehovah—Why?</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> It would almost seem, in fact, that Mordecai’s act was unappreciated, because the account continues: “After these things King Ahasuerus magnified Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite and proceeded to exalt him and to put his throne above all the other princes that were with him. And all the king’s servants that were in the king’s gate were bowing low and prostrating themselves to Haman, for so the king had commanded respecting him. But as for Mordecai, he would neither bow low nor prostrate himself.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Esther 3:1-4</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Haman’s name, if of Persian origin, means “magnificent; celebrated,” but if it corresponds with the Hebrew parallel, it means “noise, tumult, he who prepares,” doubtless in a bad way. Being the son of Hammedatha (possibly, “he who troubles the law”) the Agagite, he was a descendant of Amalek, who was the grandson of Esau. Esau had sold his birthright to his twin brother Jacob, from whom Mordecai was descended. Yet Esau hated Jacob and opposed him bitterly because Jacob took what was rightfully his. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Gen. 25:29-34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/38/1" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> 27:41</a>) Furthermore, and in keeping with this animosity of Esau toward Jacob, his descendants through Amalek showed their hatred for God’s own people the Israelites, when Jehovah himself was delivering his people from Egypt. The Amalekites attacked the rear of the departing Israelites and therefore Joshua fought against them with the help of Moses’ upright hands and defeated them. Because of this vile attack upon the Israelites, God said that they had laid their hand against the throne of God and Jehovah would have war against the children of Amalek forever, and that meant down into the day of Mordecai and Esther. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Ex. 17:8-16</a>) Haman would well represent in modern times the clergy of Christendom who have sold their birthright as to God’s kingdom in return for exaltation among the kingdoms of this world and who fight bitterly against God and his chosen people, as did the Amalekites of old.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Matt. 23:5-7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/40/1" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> 13-15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/40/2" data-bid="41-3" class="b"> John 11:48-50,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/40/3" data-bid="41-4" class="b"> 53</a>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">18.

How then can we say that Ahasuerus represents royal power in the hands of Jesus Christ? The Scriptures speak about God as permitting certain things to occur, bad things, damaging apparently to his own organization and hurtful for the time being to his own people. An instance of this is found in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">2 Thessalonians 2:11</a>: “So that is why God lets an operation of error go to them [God shall send them strong delusion (<em>AV</em>)], that they may get to believing the lie.” God is not the author <span id="page178" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="178" data-before-text="178"></span>of error nor the source of delusions but he permits them to go to the class that he wants to be affected by them. So in the fulfillment of the prophetic drama, Jehovah wants his people to come under a certain test in order for them to prove that they uphold his universal sovereignty and to demonstrate their true theocratic Christian integrity to him. The Lord Jesus Christ, ruling at Jehovah’s right hand with all power in heaven and earth, lets this situation develop. He lets the clergy of all Christendom get a high station in this world, in the midst of which the Mordecai class and Esther class are living. This affects the condition of the Lord’s people on earth. It does not destroy their own relationship with the Messianic King, but it does prove to be a peril, threatening even their lives.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">John 16:2, 3</a>.</p>

<strong>The Amalekites—A Lesson for Opposers of God</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Because of their hardened and unreasonable hostility toward God’s people and because they “did not fear God,” the Amalekites came under a permanent ban. Since they worked in opposition to the purposes of the Universal Sovereign, Jehovah, he decreed their utter extermination in <span id="page534" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="534" data-before-text="534"></span>time.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963644/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex. 17:14-16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963644/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Num. 24:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963644/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Deut. 25:18, 19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963644/4/3" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 1 Sam. 15:2, 3</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">During the remainder of the year that Israel remained at Sinai and during their subsequent journey northward toward the southern border of Palestine, they remained unmolested. But when they reached Kadesh, another encounter with the Amalekites took place. It had been the intention of the Israelites to enter Palestine from the south, west of the Dead Sea. Spies were sent in to examine the land and determine whether an entrance from that point was possible. The returning spies reported that the Amalekites were in southern Palestine, together with the Hittites, Jebusites, Amorites and Canaanites. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963644/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Num. 13:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963644/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 14:25</a>) They discouraged the people so that they rebelled against Moses. At this Jehovah declared that they would not enter the Land of Promise. Yet, contrary to the will of Jehovah and the command of Moses, the Israelites determined to go forward anyway. They were met by the Amalekites and the Canaanites and suffered defeat.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963644/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Num. 14:39-45</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Years later, when Israel was established in Palestine in the days of the Judges, another encounter is recorded. The Amalekites apparently allied themselves with Eglon, king of Moab, and the Ammonites to attack Israelite territory successfully. Later, when Moab was defeated by Israel under the leadership of Ehud, the Amalekites may have suffered too.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963644/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Judg. 3:12-30</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">A few generations later the Amalekites pursued their old tactics of harassing peaceful agriculturists when, in league with the Midianites, they oppressed northern Israel. As the crops sown by the Israelites were ripening, the Amalekite marauders descended and plundered the area, so that the unfortunate Israelites became impoverished and discouraged.

At this time Jehovah commanded Saul to execute the Amalekites on account of “what Amalek did to Israel when he set himself against him in the way while he was coming up out of Egypt.” King Saul crushed the Amalekites, but foolishly spared their king, Agag, and the best of the flocks alive, for which Samuel rebuked Saul and slew Agag.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963644/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Sam. 15:1-33</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Remnants of the Amalekites evidently still remained in the wild desert near the southern boundary of Palestine, because King David found them in that region.

David pursued them and so severely mauled the Amalekites that only 400 of their men on swift camels succeeded in making their escape. From this disaster they never recovered.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963644/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Sam. 30:1-20</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The decline of Amalek was hastened in King Hezekiah’s day when a band of 500 from the sons of Simeon struck down “the remnant that escaped of Amalek,” taking their stronghold in Mount Seir.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963644/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Chron. 4:43</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">A final reference to this nation may be in connection with Haman, the son of an “Agagite,” who was executed along with his sons in the days of Queen Esther and King Ahasuerus of Persia.

<strong>Mordecai</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>Refuses to Bow to Haman.</strong> Subsequent to this, Haman the Agagite was made prime minister by Ahasuerus, who ordered that all in the king’s gate prostrate themselves before Haman in his newly exalted position. Mordecai staunchly refused to do so and gave as a reason that he was a Jew. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003111/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Es 3:1-4</a>) The fact that Mordecai based his action on this reason proves that it had to do with his relationship, as a dedicated Jew, to his God Jehovah. He recognized that prostrating himself before Haman involved more than falling down to the earth for an exalted personage, as Israelites had done in the past, merely acknowledging such a one’s superior position as ruler. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003111/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2Sa 14:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003111/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 18:28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003111/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 1Ki 1:16</a>) In Haman’s case there was good reason why Mordecai did not bow. Haman was probably an Amalekite, and Jehovah had expressed himself as being at war with Amalek “from generation to generation.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003111/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ex 17:16</a>; see <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003111/0">HAMAN</a>.)

But as for Mordecai, he would neither bow low nor prostrate himself.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Esther 3:1-4</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Haman’s name, if of Persian origin, means “magnificent; celebrated,” but if it corresponds with the Hebrew parallel, it means “noise, tumult, he who prepares,” doubtless in a bad way. Being the son of Hammedatha (possibly, “he who troubles the law”) the Agagite, he was a descendant of Amalek, who was the grandson of Esau. Esau had sold his birthright to his twin brother Jacob, from whom Mordecai was descended. Yet Esau hated Jacob and opposed him bitterly because Jacob took what was rightfully his. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Gen. 25:29-34;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/38/1" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> 27:41</a>) Furthermore, and in keeping with this animosity of Esau toward Jacob, his descendants through Amalek showed their hatred for God’s own people the Israelites, when Jehovah himself was delivering his people from Egypt. The Amalekites attacked the rear of the departing Israelites and therefore Joshua fought against them with the help of Moses’ upright hands and defeated them. Because of this vile attack upon the Israelites, God said that they had laid their hand against the throne of God and Jehovah would have war against the children of Amalek forever, and that meant down into the day of Mordecai and Esther. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Ex. 17:8-16</a>) Haman would well represent in modern times the clergy of Christendom who have sold their birthright as to God’s kingdom in return for exaltation among the kingdoms of this world and who fight bitterly against God and his chosen people, as did the Amalekites of old.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Matt. 23:5-7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/40/1" data-bid="41-2" class="b"> 13-15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/40/2" data-bid="41-3" class="b"> John 11:48-50,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/40/3" data-bid="41-4" class="b"> 53</a>.</p>

<strong>Mordecai</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>Refuses to Bow to Haman.</strong> Subsequent to this, Haman the Agagite was made prime minister by Ahasuerus, who ordered that all in the king’s gate prostrate themselves before Haman in his newly exalted position. Mordecai staunchly refused to do so and gave as a reason that he was a Jew. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003111/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Es 3:1-4</a>) The fact that Mordecai based his action on this reason proves that it had to do with his relationship, as a dedicated Jew, to his God Jehovah. He recognized that prostrating himself before Haman involved more than falling down to the earth for an exalted personage, as Israelites had done in the past, merely acknowledging such a one’s superior position as ruler. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003111/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2Sa 14:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003111/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 18:28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003111/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 1Ki 1:16</a>) In Haman’s case there was good reason why Mordecai did not bow. Haman was probably an Amalekite, and Jehovah had expressed himself as being at war with Amalek “from generation to generation.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003111/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ex 17:16</a>; see <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003111/0">HAMAN</a>.) It was a matter of integrity to God and not a political issue on Mordecai’s part.</p>

<strong>Moderation in the Enjoyment of Good Things</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">True, there is nothing wrong in itself with brethren’s coming together occasionally and enjoying in a little more abundant way than usual the good things that the Lord has provided for man in the way of food and drink. In fact, such occasions can even aid in helping the good-will interest to appreciate the fact that Jehovah’s witnesses are not fanatical extremists. But at such times let us not forget that we are Jehovah’s servants, let the indulgence in food and drink be in moderation, so as not to bring any reproach nor to have ill aftereffects, and above all, let the conversation be clean and on things that edify. The singing and playing of Kingdom songs, the playing of Scriptural quiz <span id="page157" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="157" data-before-text="157"></span>games, the relating of field-service experiences, etc., can all combine to make such an evening one not only of relaxation and enjoyment but also one of profit.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Let each Christian minister be on guard, therefore, remembering that Satan is out to debauch the human race so as to cause all to be destroyed at Armageddon, that to sow to the flesh is to reap destruction, and that “[we] have spent time enough in the past in doing as the heathen like to do, indulging in sensuality, passion, drunkenness, carousing, dissipation”. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950363/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:3</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em>) Let us make honest, wise and considerate use of our Christian liberty. Be moderate in the enjoyment of the good things that God has provided, “so whether you are eating or drinking or doing anything else, do it all to the honor of God”; ever appreciating that “the Kingdom of God is not a matter of what we eat or drink, but of uprightness, peace, and happiness through the possession of the holy spirit”.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950363/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950363/36/1" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> Rom. 14:17</a>, <em>An Amer.

Job realized that this was a denial of the true God and would require an accounting for such error.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Job 31:26-28</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><em>Christian postures for prayer.</em> Jesus prayed publicly, in sincerity, as did Paul and others.

Nowhere do they give support to the facial or bodily attitude of assumed piety and sanctimoniousness, making any given posture essential, such as placing the palms together or clasping the hands when offering prayer, as many of the artists of Christendom have depicted. In fact, prayers can be made silently and completely without outward manifestation, when the individual is carrying on an assigned duty or is faced with an emergency. Christians are told to carry on prayer “with every form of prayer and supplication.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Eph. 6:18</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>RESPECT, HUMILITY</strong></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><em>Kneeling</em>. The attitudes and postures of the Orientals in expressing respect for one another and especially when petitioning superiors were much the same as the attitudes practiced in prayer. We find examples of kneeling in supplication before others. This was not in worship of the superior person, but in acknowledgment of that one’s position or office, with deep respect.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Matt. 17:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> Mark 1:40;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/20/2" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> 10:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/20/3" data-bid="21-4" class="b"> 2 Ki. 1:13</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><em>Bowing</em> was more frequently used in greeting others or in approaching them on a matter of business or in displaying a high degree of respect.

This was because he was the appointed King, the King-designate, as he himself said: “God’s royal majesty has approached” (<em>ED</em>); “The kingdom of God has drawn near.” (<em>NW,</em> <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Mark 1:15</a>) Jesus was the heir to the throne of David and therefore was rightfully honored as a king.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matt. 21:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> John 12:13-15</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">However, the apostles of Jesus Christ refused to permit others to prostrate themselves before them. This was for the reason that, in the instances described, prostration was done as an attitude of worship, as though the power of the holy spirit in the apostles, which performed the healing and other powerful works, was their own. The apostles realized that the power was from God and that credit for these things should be given to him and all worship directed toward Jehovah through Jesus Christ, of whom they were merely the representatives.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Acts 10:25, 26</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">In connection with the respect paid to Jesus, the word often used is <em>pro·sky·neʹo,</em> a word having the basic meaning of doing obeisance, but variously translated as “to worship, bow to the ground, fall prostrate,” Jesus was not accepting worship, which belongs to God alone (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Matt. 4:10</a>), but recognized the act of the one doing obeisance as recognition of the authority given Him by God. The angel whom Jesus Christ sent to bring the Revelation to John expressed the principle that man’s worship belongs only to God, when he refused to accept worship from John.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Rev. 19:10</a>; see WORSHIP.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><em>Covering the head</em> was a sign of respect on the part of women. This custom was followed in the Christian congregation. In discussing the principle of Christian headship the apostle Paul stated: “Every woman that prays or prophesies with her head uncovered shames the one who is her head . . . That is why the woman ought to have a sign of authority upon her head because of the angels.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:3-10</a>; see HEADSHIP.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><em>Removing one’s sandals</em> was a gesture of respect or reverence. Moses was commanded to do this at the burning bush and Joshua in the presence of an angel. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ex. 3:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> Josh. 5:15</a>) Since the tabernacle and the temple were holy places, the priests are said to have performed their duties at the sanctuary barefooted. Likewise, the loosening of the laces of another person’s sandals or bearing his sandals for him was considered a menial duty and an expression of one’s humility and consciousness of insignificance when contrasted with his master. It is still a practice in the East that, when one enters a house, his sandals are taken off, sometimes by a servant.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Matt. 3:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010467/35/1" data-bid="36-2" class="b"> John 1:27</a>; see SANDAL.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"><em>Pouring water on another’s hands.</em> Elisha was identified as the minister or servant of Elijah by the expression “[he] poured out water upon the hands of Elijah.” This was a service performed particularly after meals. In the East it was not the <span id="page164" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="164" data-before-text="164"></span>custom to use knives and forks, but fingers, and the servant would afterward pour water over the hands of his master to wash them.

<strong>Divination</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Wicked Haman had “someone [evidently an astrologer] cast Pur, that is, the Lot, . . . from day to day and from month to month,” in order to determine the most favorable time to have Jehovah’s people exterminated. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001200/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Es 3:7-9</a>) Regarding this text, one commentary says: “In resorting to this method of ascertaining the most auspicious day for putting his atrocious scheme into execution, Haman acted as the kings and nobles of Persia have always done, never engaging in any enterprise without consulting the astrologers, and being satisfied as to the lucky hour.” (<em>Commentary on the Whole Bible,</em> by Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown) Based on this divination, Haman immediately set in motion his wicked scheme. However, Jehovah’s power to deliver his people was again demonstrated, and Haman, who trusted in divination, was hanged on the very stake he had prepared for Mordecai.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001200/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Es 9:24, 25</a>.</p>

But when Jehovah caused the dust to become gnats, the sorcerers had to admit it was by “the finger of God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969567/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ex. 7:8-12,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969567/20/1" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 19-22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969567/20/2" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> 8:5-11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969567/20/3" data-bid="21-4" class="b"> 16-19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969567/20/4" data-bid="21-5" class="b"> 9:11</a>.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Wicked Haman had “someone [evidently an astrologer] cast Pur, that is, the Lot . . . from day to day and from month to month,” in order to determine the most favorable time to have Jehovah’s people exterminated.

However, Jehovah’s power to deliver his people was again demonstrated, and Haman, who trusted in divination, was hanged on the very stake he had prepared for Mordecai.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969567/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Esther 9:24, 25</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Another example of Jehovah’s superior power over the occult forces is the instance when the Moabites came “with the payments for divination in their hands” to hire Balaam the Mesopotamian diviner to curse Israel.

Man naturally desires to know the future, and his desire can best be satisfied when he worships and serves his Grand Creator. After all, Jehovah is the only source of dependable information on the future. He alone knows the end from the beginning.

<strong>A Powerful Identification of the Messiah</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Daniel 11:1</a> he mentions Darius the Mede and in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Da 11 verse 2</a> he prophesies that there will yet be three kings standing up for Persia and a fourth one who will amass greater riches than all the others and who “will rouse up everything against the kingdom <span id="page629" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="629" data-before-text="629"></span>of Greece.” The third king was Darius I, who began ruling the Persian Empire in 522 B.C.E. He had been preceded since Darius the Mede by two kings, Cyrus the Persian and Cambyses, Cyrus’ son. In 490 B.C.E. King Darius ordered a second Persian invasion of Greece. The Persian forces far outnumbered the Athenians, but at Marathon, Greece, the Persians were defeated. King Darius intended to invade Greece a third time but died in 486 B.C.E. before he could finish preparations.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Then the fourth king mentioned by Daniel rose up to make further attempts to conquer Greece. In some modern Bible translations his name is mentioned as Xerxes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Esther 1:1-3</a>, <em>AT, Mo</em>) In other Bible translations he is called Ahasuerus, as rendered according to the Hebrew. If Ahasuerus is Xerxes, he began to reign in December, 486 B.C.E. The reason that King Xerxes I figures in a discussion of the seventy weeks of Daniel’s prophecy is that he was the father of King Artaxerxes, who issued the decree to rebuild Jerusalem. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Neh. 1:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 2:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 7, 8</a>) King Xerxes I was the ruler who gave legal sanction to the Jews to defend themselves against being massacred by their enemies. Mordecai, the cousin of Xerxes’ Jewish wife Esther, was then acting as prime minister for Xerxes and he established for the Jews the memorial festival of Purim or Lots on the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the twelfth lunar month, Adar (February/ March). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Esther 9:20, 21</a>) Xerxes was then ruling in his twelfth year (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Esther 3:7</a>) and his rule must have extended over into his thirteenth year, to some time in 474 B.C.E., for after the decree of Xerxes other things took place, as stated at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965762/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Esther 9:32 to 10:3</a>:</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="si">“The command of Esther also confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in a book. Now King Xerxes laid a tribute on the land and the coast-lands of the sea. All the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai to which the king advanced him, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia? For Mordecai, the Jew, was next in rank to King Xerxes, and great among the Jews, and a favorite with the mass of his fellow-countrymen; for he sought the good of his people and voiced the welfare of his entire race.”—<em>AT.</em></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The third invasion of Greece had taken place before Xerxes’ twelfth year. Crossing the Hellespont in 480 B.C.E., Xerxes’ invasion forces, greatly outnumbering the Greeks, were defeated through the tactics of the Athenian general Themistocles. There was a Greek delaying action at Thermopylae that inflicted great losses on the Persians and that was followed by the destruction of more than half of Xerxes’ fleet. The following year the Greeks defeated the Persian army that had been left behind under the command of one of its ablest generals. On the same day the remains of the Persian fleet were destroyed near the promontory of Mycale in Asia Minor. The Persians never invaded Greece again. Thus the efforts of the Fourth World Power to invade deeply into Europe were checked in 479 B.C.E., the eighth year of Xerxes’ reign. Nevertheless, the Persian Empire continued to hold world domination for a century and a half.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>BEGINNING OF ARTAXERXES’ REIGN</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Here we present historical evidence that the reign of Artaxerxes began in 474 B.C.E.: Even though Themistocles had accomplished these victories and had greatly strengthened the Grecian defenses, he later on began to lose the confidence of the people. He was finally accused of treasonable negotiations with the Persians. He fled to Asia Minor and was proclaimed a traitor and his property confiscated. We read, however, that he was well received by the Persians:</p>

<strong>Haman’s “Pride Goes Before Destruction”</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span id="page190" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="190" data-before-text="190"></span>Of course, Haman could not carry out such an ambitious scheme of murder without official sanction and cooperation, neither could he reveal his own petty and personal motive for this malicious action. Being a superstitious pagan, he first sought the cooperation of his gods by having lots cast before him to determine the most auspicious time for the carrying out of his murderous conspiracy. Then he appeared before the king with this story:</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples throughout all the provinces of your kingdom, and their laws are different from every other people; neither do they observe the king’s laws; therefore it is not fitting to leave them alone. If it please the king, let it be prescribed that they be destroyed; and I will pay ten thousand talents [$18,000,000, at $1,800 a talent] into . . . the king’s treasuries.” What a grand-scale patriotic and unselfish gesture! Unsuspectingly, King Xerxes accepted it for just what it superficially seemed to be, and so authorized Haman to proceed against the Jews “as seems good to you”.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950443/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Esther 3:7-11</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Letters dictated by Haman and bearing the king’s seal were then sent on the 13th day of the first month (Nisan) to all the provinces in their respective languages “to wipe out, to slay, and to destroy all the Jews, both young and old, infants and women in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, . . . and to take the spoil of them as plunder”. Then the king and Haman sat down to drink wine and felicitate each other at the prospect.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950443/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Esther 3:12-15</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Not long thereafter Haman received an invitation to attend a royal banquet that Queen Esther had made for him and the king, after which “Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart. But when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, and he neither stood up nor moved for him, Haman was filled with wrath against Mordecai”. Coming home he related to his wife and friends “the glory of his riches and the multitude of his children and every instance where the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and the servants of the king . . . ‘Even Esther the queen . . . has permitted no man but me to come in with the king to the banquet she has prepared, and tomorrow also I am invited by her together with the king. Yet all this does not satisfy me so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950443/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Esther 6:5-13</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em>) Yes, Haman was a great man in his own estimation; but how little did he suspect as to why the queen had invited him!</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Haman’s wife and friends egged him on by suggesting that he have a gallows seventy-five feet high erected and then have Mordecai hanged thereon. This just suited his vanity and malice, and so he immediately had it built, and then hastened to the king for permission to hang Mordecai on it. But the king had other plans for Mordecai. During a sleepless night he had occasion to learn that that trusted servant had uncovered a plot on his life and that he had not been rewarded therefor. Seeing his grand vizier Haman standing in the outer court, the king bids him to enter and then poses the question to him: “What shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor?” Of course, conceited Haman thought, ‘whom could the king possibly want to honor more than me, and so, how would <em>I</em> like to be honored? Hm! Ah!’ Figuratively rubbing his hands in glee at the prospect, he expressed his sentiments: “For the man whom the king delights to honor, let royal garments be brought which the king has worn [nothing but the best for Haman!], and a horse which the king has ridden [no ordinary horse would do!], on the head of which a royal crown is set. [How Haman would have liked to be king himself!] Let the garments and the horse be delivered to one of the king’s most noble princes [no mere lackey or porter would do!], and let them clothe the man whom the king delights to honor and cause him to ride on horseback through the open square of the city, and proclaim before him, ‘Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.’” Haman already saw himself riding through the streets of the capital and could hardly wait for the king to tell him that he was the man to be so honored. Imagine, then, the fall of his haughty spirit as the king commands him as “one of the most noble of the princes” to do this signal honor to his worst enemy, even to Mordecai! The one for whom he had already built a gallows, in fact, had come to the king at that very time for the purpose of obtaining permission to hang Mordecai.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950443/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Esther 5:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950443/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 6:1-11</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Had Haman known what was further in store for him he might have spared himself this humiliation, but, having no inkling of that, there was nothing left for him to do but to obey the king’s command. Coming home, crestfallen and mourning, he got very little comfort from the ones who had influenced him to build those gallows just a few hours before. Now they said: “If Mordecai . . . be of the Jewish race, you . . . will surely fall before him.” And while they were yet speaking the king’s messenger arrived to hurry Haman to the banquet Queen Esther had prepared for him and the king.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950443/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Esther 6:12-14</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Picture the setting: King Xerxes, powerful world ruler, whose very whim was law; Queen Esther, loveliest woman of all the empire, decked in her most beautiful robes; and fawning Haman, vain, proud, and with a heart filled with malice—all enjoying a most sumptuous banquet where wine flowed freely. The king again asks his queen for her petition. Note the expression on Haman’s face as with amazement he hears the queen discuss his plot to destroy the Jews, and learns that she is a Jewess; see it blanche with stark fear and guilt as the king in great rage asks, “Who is he, and where is he who dares presume in his heart to do so?” and as Esther, pointing to Haman, replies, “An adversary and an enemy, this wicked Haman.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950443/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Esther 7:3-6</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Terrified, Haman pleads with Esther for his life, and falls on her couch while doing so. The king, who in rage had gone out to the garden, upon returning sees Haman on the couch with Esther. He demands: “Will he violate the queen in my presence in the house?” At this his servants cover Haman’s face (as was the custom with condemned criminals). Being advised of the gallows 75 feet high that Haman had built for Mordecai, the king ordered Haman to be hanged on it. “So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king’s wrath abated.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950443/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Esther 7:7-10</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Pride had led Haman to his downfall and destruction, and a disgraceful one at that. And not only to his own end, but by a subsequent decree counter to the decree that he had engineered, also to the downfall and destruction of <span id="page191" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="191" data-before-text="191"></span>some 75,000 enemies of the Jews, which enemies either shared his malice for the Jews or sought to profit by their destruction. His own ten sons were hanged on the gallows and his estate was turned over to Esther and, by her, to Mordecai. It was not God’s will that his typical name-people, the Jews, should be wiped out, and therefore he maneuvered the destruction of their would-be destroyers. The record leaves no doubt about this, even though it directly omits all references to God.</p>

<strong>Should “Biorhythms” Regulate Your Life?</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong><em>A Form of Divination</em></strong></p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">How should the biorhythm theory be viewed by persons who wish to please God? The Bible contains no specific mention of biorhythms. But the Word of God does relate the efforts of one individual to determine in advance the correct day for performing a certain action. It says:</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="si">“Haman was furious when he realized that Mordecai was not going to kneel and bow to him, and when he learned that Mordecai was a Jew, he decided to do more than punish Mordecai alone. He made plans to kill every Jew in the whole Persian Empire. In the twelfth year of King Xerxes’ rule, in the first month, the month of Nisan, Haman ordered the lots to be cast (‘Purim,’ they were called) <em>to find out the right day and month</em> to carry out his plot. The thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, was decided on.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101979287/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Esther 3:5-7</a>, <em>Today’s English Version.</em></p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Casting lots in this way was a form of divination. According to the Bible, all efforts to discern the future through divination are forbidden to persons who wish to please God. We read: “There should not be found in you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, anyone who employs divination, a practicer of magic or anyone who looks for omens or a sorcerer, or one who binds others with a spell or anyone who consults a spirit medium or a professional foreteller of events or anyone who inquires of the dead. For everybody doing these things is something detestable to Jehovah, and on account of these detestable things Jehovah your God is driving them away from before you. You should prove yourself faultless with Jehovah your God.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101979287/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deut. 18:10-13</a>.</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010389/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Neh. 2:1-8</a>) Because this edict is referred to at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010389/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Daniel 9:25</a> as relating to the time of the promised coming of the Messiah, the date of Artaxerxes’ twentieth year has been a matter of considerable study. Whereas most secular works fix the date of the start of his reign at 465 or 464 B.C.E., there is sound reason for placing it at an earlier date, as follows:</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The first year of the reign of Xerxes, father and predecessor of Longimanus, ran from December of 486 B.C.E. to the spring of 485 B.C.E. During 480-479 B.C.E. (the seventh year of his reign) he attempted an invasion of Greece but suffered defeats due to the tactics of the Athenian general Themistocles. The book of Esther (which calls him Ahasuerus) refers to the twelfth year of Xerxes’ rule (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010389/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Esther 3:7</a>) and indicates that his rule likely extended on into its thirteenth year (474 B.C.E.). Though modern historians generally extend Xerxes’ reign on to include a total of twenty-one years, and although some clay tablets referring to a sixteenth, twentieth and twenty-first year have been assigned by certain scholars to his reign, there is strong testimony to show that Xerxes’ rule ended in 474 B.C.E. and that he was then replaced by his son, Artaxerxes Longimanus.—See CHRONOLOGY.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The key to the matter relates to the flight of Athenian general Themistocles to the Persian capital, because of being accused of treason in his own land. The Greek historian Thucydides of Athens lived during the reign of Artaxerxes, and he records that Themistocles fled to Persia when Artaxerxes had but “lately come to the throne.” (See Thucydides in Book I, chapter 137.) Nepos, a Roman historian of the first century B.C.E., supports this statement, saying: “I know that most historians have related that Themistocles went over into Asia in the reign of Xerxes, but I give credence to Thucydides in preference to others, because he, of all who have left records of that period, was nearest in point of time to Themistocles, and was of the same city. Thucydides says that he went to Artaxerxes.” (Nepos, <em>Themistocles,</em> chap. 9) Similarly, the Greek biographer Plutarch, of the first century C.E., says: “Thucydides, and Charon of Lampsacus, say that Xerxes was dead, and that Themistocles had an interview with his son, Artaxerxes; but Ephorus, Dinon, Clitarchus, Heraclides and many others, write that he came to Xerxes. The chronological tables better agree with the account of Thucydides.”—Themistocles, c. 27; see also <em>The Encyclopedia Americana,</em> 1956 ed., Vol. 26, p. 507.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The weight of historical evidence, therefore, points to Themistocles’ flight as occurring in the reign of Artaxerxes, not of Xerxes. As to the date of that flight, Jerome’s <em>Eusebius</em> places Themistocles’ arrival in Asia in the fourth year of the 76th Olympiad (four-year periods beginning in 776 B.C.E.), that is, in the year 473/472 B.C.E. Confirming this are the annals or chronology of Diodorus the Sicilian, a Greek historian of the first century B.C.E., which place the date of Themistocles’ death in 471 B.C.E. Since after his arrival Themistocles is reported to have requested one year’s time in which to learn Persian before receiving audience with the king, it fits well that his arrival would reasonably have taken place about two years before his death or by the year 473 B.C.E. And since, as Thucydides records, Themistocles arrived when Artaxerxes had but “lately come to the throne,” then the first year of Artaxerxes’ reign evidently began in 474 B.C.E. The noted German scholar Ernst Wm. Hengstenberg (1802-1869) in his work entitled “Christology of the Old Testament” (Vol. 2, p. 395) states: “Krueger . . . places the death of Xerxes in the year 474 or 473, and the flight of Themistocles a year later.” Archbishop James Ussher, of Ireland (1581-1656), as a chronologist, also held that Artaxerxes Longimanus ascended the Persian throne in 474 B.C.E., as did the celebrated writer Vitringa (1659-1722).</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Accepting the year 474 B.C.E. on this basis as the initial year of Artaxerxes’ reign, we conclude that the twentieth year of his rule should have been the year 455 B.C.E., at which time his decree sent to Palestine by Nehemiah for the rebuilding of the city of Jerusalem would go into effect, thus marking the start of the “seventy weeks” of Daniel’s prophecy. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010389/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Dan. 9:24</a>) Hengstenberg sums up the matter in saying (Vol. 2, p. 394): “The difference [of opinion] concerns only the year of the commencement of the reign of Artaxerxes. Our problem is completely solved, when we have shown that this year falls in the year 474 before Christ. For then the twentieth year of Artaxerxes is the year 455 before Christ, according to the usual reckoning.” Undoubtedly the strongest proof for the date of 455 B.C.E. as the twentieth year of the reign of Artaxerxes, however, is the fact of the Messiah’s appearance in the year 29 C.E., and his death in 33 C.E., in fulfillment of the time period indicated in Daniel’s prophecy.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010389/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Dan. 9:25, 26</a>; see MESSIAH.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010389/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Nehemiah 13:6</a> refers to the “thirty-second year of Artaxerxes,” at which time (443-442 B.C.E.)

Those who turn to the latter are often seized in violent convulsions by invisible demonic powers, sometimes working themselves into a frenzy by weird music and certain drugs. The Greek word for “soothsaying” comes from the verb <em>maiʹne·sthai,</em> meaning “to rave,” and is used to describe one who foams at the mouth and whose hair is wild and snarled. Origen (third century C.E.), in answering the attack of the pagan philosopher Celsus that “[Christians] set no value on the oracles of the Pythian priestess,” declared: “It is said of the Pythian priestess, whose oracle seems to have been the most celebrated, that when she sat down at the mouth of the Castalian cave, the prophetic spirit of Apollo entered her private parts. . . . Moreover, it is not the part of a divine spirit to drive the prophetess into such a state of ecstasy and madness that she loses control of herself. . . . If, then, the Pythian priestess is beside herself when she prophesies, what spirit must that be which fills her mind and clouds her judgment with darkness, unless it be of the same order with those demons which many Christians cast out?” (<em>Origen Against Celsus,</em> Book VII, chaps. iii, iv) No such physical or mental distortions are experienced by true servants of Jehovah when moved by holy spirit to speak.

<strong>Haman</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Haman was a servant of King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I) of Persia, who ruled early in the fifth century B.C.E. Haman was honored and appointed as prime minister over the Persian Empire. Enraged by the refusal of Mordecai the Jew to bow down to him, Haman plotted the destruction of Mordecai and all the Jews in the empire. He painted the Jews as undesirable in the empire, lawbreakers, having laws “different from all other people’s.” He added an economic appeal, saying to the king: “Let there be a writing that they be destroyed; and ten thousand silver talents <span id="page1024" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1024" data-before-text="1024"></span>[c. $66,060,000] I shall pay into the hands of those doing the work by bringing it into the king’s treasury.” The king gave Haman his signet ring and replied: “The silver is given to you, also the people, to do with them according to what is good in your own eyes.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001833/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Es 3:1-11</a>.</p>

<strong>Festivals of Praise to Jehovah</strong><br/><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> In about the year 474 B.C.E. another festival was added to the list of Jewish <span id="page432" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="432" data-before-text="432"></span>feasts. The historic events that caused Mordecai to inaugurate this two-day festival, called Purim, are of such important prophetic meaning and encouragement to Christians today that we would like to discuss them with you. The Jews were under Persian rule and scattered throughout the 127 provinces. A certain Haman, an Amalekite and hater of the Jews, was chief of all the princes of the Persian Empire. This man had determined in his heart to exterminate all the Jews in the entire Persian realm. As a religious and superstitious man he asked his gods on what day he should order the Jews to be exterminated, by casting the <em>Pur,</em> or Lot. The Lot fell on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, or Adar. This gave him about one year to prepare the slaughter, since the Lot was cast in the first month. But it also gave the Jews time to turn to their God and pray for deliverance and to prepare for it.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967522/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Esther 9:20-22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967522/38/1" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> 3:1-7</a>.</p><p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="qu">20.

With what result?</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> Now Haman, after knowing the date superstitiously selected, presented his request before the king, representing the Jews as a seditious and dangerous people, not obeying the laws of the king, but having their own customs different from all the people. Haman said that the money necessary to defray the expenses of the slaughter would be forthcoming​—it would not cost the crown anything—​that ten thousand silver talents (about $8,456,400) would be brought into the king’s treasury. The king granted the request. The law was issued to kill the Jews in the whole Persian realm on the thirteenth day of Adar. It seemed as if Haman had reached the zenith of his glory. But things changed fast.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967522/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Esther 3:9-15</a>.</p><p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="qu">21. (a) How did the Jews counteract the attack, and what was the outcome? (b) What days were set aside for this festival, and why?</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> Through the fearless action of Queen Esther, herself a Jewess, a counterlaw was issued granting the Jews the right to “stand for their souls, to annihilate and kill and destroy all . . . that were showing hostility to them, . . . on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, that is, the month of Adar.” Under the fine leadership of faithful Mordecai the Jews were preparing their defense. And when the day arrived, they were assisted not only by the Persian people but, according to the historic record, by “all the princes . . . and the satraps and the governors and the doers of the business that belonged to the king . . . for the dread of Mordecai had fallen upon them. . . . and there was an avenging of themselves upon their enemies and a killing among those hating them of seventy-five thousand.” In Shushan the Castle the fight extended into the next day, with a total of 810 of the enemy killed, including Haman’s ten sons. The Jews in the provinces and in Shushan banqueted on the fourteenth and fifteenth days respectively. Consequently, Mordecai put them under obligation to keep the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar in each and every year “as days of banqueting and rejoicing and sending of portions to one another and of gifts to the poor people.” The Jews were thereby reminded every <span id="page433" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="433" data-before-text="433"></span>year of their deliverance, and year by year they gave praise and honor to Jehovah, the God of deliverance.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1967522/40/0" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Esther 8:9 to 9:22</a>.</p>

<strong>Hebrew Weights and Money</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Talent is our word for the Hebrew <em>kikkarʹ,</em> which means circle, round or oval. Maneh is from a root meaning to count or reckon. The Greek <em>mina</em> means a portion, that is, a subdivision of the talent; sixty manehs equaled a talent. Shekel comes from an expression in Hebrew meaning to weigh, and it did actually signify the common unit of weight. Weight was usually expressed in terms of shekels. Bekah, the half shekel, is from the Hebrew for a cleft or fraction; it signifies a division <span id="page651" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="651" data-before-text="651"></span>or a half. And the gerah, or bean or kernel, was similar to the grain now used in weighing. This gerah was one-twentieth of a shekel; as <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Leviticus 27:25</a> (<em>NW</em>) says: “The shekel should amount to twenty gerahs.”</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Some feel that the Hebrew talent may have been equal to 115 pounds troy. If such was the case, then figuring gold at $32 an ounce and silver at 88 cents an ounce, we should be presented with a picture like this: In silver the gerah would be worth about 2 cents, the bekah 20 cents, the shekel 40 cents, the maneh $20.24 and the talent $1,214.40. In gold the value of the gerah would be about 74 cents, the bekah $7.36, the shekel $14.72, the maneh $736 and the talent $44,160. Although other authorities do not give exactly the same figures, still this gives us something to start with, and from here the relative weight and value of the other denominations may be figured. On our scale one talent equals sixty manehs; a maneh is fifty shekels; each shekel is two bekahs and the bekah is ten gerahs.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Some question may arise as to the relation between the shekel and the maneh in view of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ezekiel 45:12</a>, which says, “And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.” This would appear to say that the maneh has sixty shekels instead of the fifty mentioned above. However, many scholars prefer the Greek reading of the text as given in the Codex Alexandrinus: “Five shekels are five, and ten shekels are ten, and fifty shekels shall be your maneh.” In other words, the weights were to be honest and according to the accepted standard, neither more nor less.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>BIBLICAL REFERENCES</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Applied to Bible accounts what light does this throw on our understanding of the texts? Well, did you ever wonder how much money Joseph’s brothers accepted when they sold him into Egyptian slavery? In terms of the value of equivalent silver in our day the “twenty pieces of silver” would be only about $8. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Gen. 37:28</a>) Later on the Mosaic law stipulated the price of a slave as thirty pieces of silver, which would come to around $12. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ex. 21:32</a>) Remember, it was for thirty pieces of silver that Judas was willing to betray Jesus.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 27:3</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">We have often read the account of Haman and his hatred for the people of God, but it is difficult to conceive of a man as filled with bitterness toward anyone as he was toward the Jews. The account at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Esther 3:9</a> (<em>NW</em>) tells us about it, saying: “If to the king it does seem good, let there be a writing that they be destroyed, and ten thousand silver talents I shall pay into the hands of those doing the work by bringing [it] into the king’s treasury.” Can you imagine a man with such hatred that he was willing to pay $12,144,000 to have the object of his hatred removed?</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Every Bible reader is acquainted with David, and most of us have some idea of the picture David and Goliath must have presented as they faced each other on the battlefield. Goliath was insulted as he saw the lad David coming out with a simple sling in his hand. There in front of young David stood a giant, “his height being six cubits and a span,” or nine feet nine inches. “And there was a helmet of copper on his head, and he was clad with a coat of mail, of overlapping scales, and the weight of the coat of mail was five thousand shekels of copper. And there were greaves of copper above his feet and a javelin of copper between his shoulders. And the wooden shaft of his spear was like the beam of loom workers, and the blade of his spear was six hundred shekels of iron.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1956802/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Sam. 17:4-7</a>, <em>NW</em>) His coat <span id="page652" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="652" data-before-text="652"></span>of mail alone weighed over 157 pounds and just the head of his spear came to almost 19 pounds. But this metal-clad monstrosity did not cause David to turn back in dismay. Fully confident that Jehovah was with him David went through with his assignment and came off victorious.</p>

<strong>Haman’s “Pride Goes Before Destruction”</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span id="page190" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="190" data-before-text="190"></span>Of course, Haman could not carry out such an ambitious scheme of murder without official sanction and cooperation, neither could he reveal his own petty and personal motive for this malicious action. Being a superstitious pagan, he first sought the cooperation of his gods by having lots cast before him to determine the most auspicious time for the carrying out of his murderous conspiracy. Then he appeared before the king with this story:</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples throughout all the provinces of your kingdom, and their laws are different from every other people; neither do they observe the king’s laws; therefore it is not fitting to leave them alone. If it please the king, let it be prescribed that they be destroyed; and I will pay ten thousand talents [$18,000,000, at $1,800 a talent] into . . . the king’s treasuries.” What a grand-scale patriotic and unselfish gesture! Unsuspectingly, King Xerxes accepted it for just what it superficially seemed to be, and so authorized Haman to proceed against the Jews “as seems good to you”.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950443/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Esther 3:7-11</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Letters dictated by Haman and bearing the king’s seal were then sent on the 13th day of the first month (Nisan) to all the provinces in their respective languages “to wipe out, to slay, and to destroy all the Jews, both young and old, infants and women in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, . . . and to take the spoil of them as plunder”. Then the king and Haman sat down to drink wine and felicitate each other at the prospect.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950443/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Esther 3:12-15</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Not long thereafter Haman received an invitation to attend a royal banquet that Queen Esther had made for him and the king, after which “Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart. But when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, and he neither stood up nor moved for him, Haman was filled with wrath against Mordecai”. Coming home he related to his wife and friends “the glory of his riches and the multitude of his children and every instance where the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and the servants of the king . . . ‘Even Esther the queen . . . has permitted no man but me to come in with the king to the banquet she has prepared, and tomorrow also I am invited by her together with the king. Yet all this does not satisfy me so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950443/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Esther 6:5-13</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em>) Yes, Haman was a great man in his own estimation; but how little did he suspect as to why the queen had invited him!</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Haman’s wife and friends egged him on by suggesting that he have a gallows seventy-five feet high erected and then have Mordecai hanged thereon. This just suited his vanity and malice, and so he immediately had it built, and then hastened to the king for permission to hang Mordecai on it. But the king had other plans for Mordecai. During a sleepless night he had occasion to learn that that trusted servant had uncovered a plot on his life and that he had not been rewarded therefor. Seeing his grand vizier Haman standing in the outer court, the king bids him to enter and then poses the question to him: “What shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor?” Of course, conceited Haman thought, ‘whom could the king possibly want to honor more than me, and so, how would <em>I</em> like to be honored? Hm! Ah!’ Figuratively rubbing his hands in glee at the prospect, he expressed his sentiments: “For the man whom the king delights to honor, let royal garments be brought which the king has worn [nothing but the best for Haman!], and a horse which the king has ridden [no ordinary horse would do!], on the head of which a royal crown is set. [How Haman would have liked to be king himself!] Let the garments and the horse be delivered to one of the king’s most noble princes [no mere lackey or porter would do!], and let them clothe the man whom the king delights to honor and cause him to ride on horseback through the open square of the city, and proclaim before him, ‘Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.’” Haman already saw himself riding through the streets of the capital and could hardly wait for the king to tell him that he was the man to be so honored. Imagine, then, the fall of his haughty spirit as the king commands him as “one of the most noble of the princes” to do this signal honor to his worst enemy, even to Mordecai! The one for whom he had already built a gallows, in fact, had come to the king at that very time for the purpose of obtaining permission to hang Mordecai.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950443/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Esther 5:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950443/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 6:1-11</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Had Haman known what was further in store for him he might have spared himself this humiliation, but, having no inkling of that, there was nothing left for him to do but to obey the king’s command. Coming home, crestfallen and mourning, he got very little comfort from the ones who had influenced him to build those gallows just a few hours before. Now they said: “If Mordecai . . . be of the Jewish race, you . . . will surely fall before him.” And while they were yet speaking the king’s messenger arrived to hurry Haman to the banquet Queen Esther had prepared for him and the king.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950443/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Esther 6:12-14</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Picture the setting: King Xerxes, powerful world ruler, whose very whim was law; Queen Esther, loveliest woman of all the empire, decked in her most beautiful robes; and fawning Haman, vain, proud, and with a heart filled with malice—all enjoying a most sumptuous banquet where wine flowed freely. The king again asks his queen for her petition. Note the expression on Haman’s face as with amazement he hears the queen discuss his plot to destroy the Jews, and learns that she is a Jewess; see it blanche with stark fear and guilt as the king in great rage asks, “Who is he, and where is he who dares presume in his heart to do so?” and as Esther, pointing to Haman, replies, “An adversary and an enemy, this wicked Haman.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950443/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Esther 7:3-6</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Terrified, Haman pleads with Esther for his life, and falls on her couch while doing so. The king, who in rage had gone out to the garden, upon returning sees Haman on the couch with Esther. He demands: “Will he violate the queen in my presence in the house?” At this his servants cover Haman’s face (as was the custom with condemned criminals). Being advised of the gallows 75 feet high that Haman had built for Mordecai, the king ordered Haman to be hanged on it. “So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king’s wrath abated.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950443/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Esther 7:7-10</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Pride had led Haman to his downfall and destruction, and a disgraceful one at that. And not only to his own end, but by a subsequent decree counter to the decree that he had engineered, also to the downfall and destruction of <span id="page191" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="191" data-before-text="191"></span>some 75,000 enemies of the Jews, which enemies either shared his malice for the Jews or sought to profit by their destruction. His own ten sons were hanged on the gallows and his estate was turned over to Esther and, by her, to Mordecai. It was not God’s will that his typical name-people, the Jews, should be wiped out, and therefore he maneuvered the destruction of their would-be destroyers. The record leaves no doubt about this, even though it directly omits all references to God.</p>

<strong>Persecution by Permission of Jehovah—Why?</strong><br/><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> Haman, too, goaded to the extreme by his pride and Mordecai’s refusal to bow to him, determined that he would annihilate not just Mordecai but all the Jews. To this end Haman cast lots to determine the time most auspicious from the standpoint of his gods for his plot to be fulfilled. The lot or “Pur” fell on the thirteenth day of the twelfth lunar month, Adar. He then presented the matter to the king, charging the Jews with being against the king’s law, and asked that a writing be published throughout the empire authorizing their destruction. King Ahasuerus agreed, giving Haman his own signet ring to seal the writing, making it a law of the Medes and Persians which could not be revoked. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971205/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Esther 3:5-15</a>) This would indicate that in modern times the Lord Jesus Christ would allow the enemies of his people to go to the full limit in their effort to carry out their purpose to destroy them. What the end result would be, however, would be his to determine, as it was even in the case of Mordecai and Esther. These dramatic events are the substance of the article that follows.</p>

<strong>Ezra</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">If, as some scholars believe, a man could not become a scribe until reaching the age of 30, Ezra may have been more than 30 years old in 468 B.C.E. when he went to Jerusalem. He undoubtedly lived during the rule of Ahasuerus, in the time of Mordecai and Esther, at the time the decree went out to exterminate the Jews throughout the Persian Empire. There were many Jews living in Babylon, so this national crisis must have made an indelible imprint on Ezra, strengthening him in faith in Jehovah’s care for and deliverance of his people and serving as training, maturing him in judgment and competence to accomplish the tremendous task later set before him.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001475/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Es 1:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001475/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 3:7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001475/3/2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 12, 13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001475/3/3" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 8:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001475/3/4" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> 9:1</a>.</p>

<strong>How to Read the Bible</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">What are some aids to productive reading of the Holy Bible? First, there is the matter of personal application. The reader of the Bible must be open to new insights into himself even though they are painful; and, above all, he has to be ready to revise or change his attitudes and actions in the direction of those insights. So as you read be on the lookout for any principles that apply to your life. Ask yourself: How does this affect my life? Does this call on me to make any adjustments to bring my attitude or actions into harmony with this expression of the divine will? For example, when reading Paul’s counsel, “Keep doing all things free from murmurings and arguments,” the true servant of God searches his heart to see if he is really conforming <span id="page474" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="474" data-before-text="474"></span>in this regard to the divine will.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961568/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Phil. 2:14</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">So as the Christian reads the Bible he is continually alert to find and apply principles that are a guide to his daily living, and not only that: He also considers how texts in the material he is reading support Bible truths that he discusses in his Kingdom ministry. So that he can use these texts in the future he makes note of them. A minister may find that he often refers to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961568/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 21:4</a> to show others that death inherited from Adam will be destroyed; so in reading <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961568/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">the fifteenth chapter of First Corinthians</a>, he will make a note of the text, “For he must rule as king until God has put all enemies under his feet. As the last enemy, death is to be destroyed.” Thus the minister of God plans to use this text in teaching others the divine purposes.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961568/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:25, 26</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Then there is the reading aid of asking questions, such as, ‘Why is this so?’ and, ‘Why did this happen?’ Such questions stir up thinking. Thus one may be reading <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961568/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 4:1, 2</a>: “Then Jesus was led by the spirit up into the wilderness to be tempted by the Devil. After he had fasted forty days and forty nights, then he felt hungry.” One might ask himself, “Why were forty days and forty nights necessary?” One might reason that Jesus used that time well, by meditating on God’s Word. But still why that length of time? As you reflect on the matter, by association your mind may think on other similar periods, how both Moses and Elijah experienced them. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961568/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ex. 24:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961568/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 34:28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961568/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Deut. 9:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961568/7/3" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> 1 Ki. 19:8</a>) Further thinking brings to mind the transfiguration scene, wherein Jesus was transfigured with Moses and Elijah, and such thinking has given you insight into the matter: That Jesus went into the wilderness for that specific length of time to conform to these types and that the transfiguration scene required this conformity. So by asking questions to yourself and then reflecting on the matter, your understanding may be greatly enhanced.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>PROPHETIC IMPORT AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">As you read, then, be on the lookout for prophetic fulfillment, both in a minor and major way. If you are reading <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961568/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke, chapter nine</a>, about the transfiguration of Jesus, you may ask, being alert to prophetic import, “What does this mean?” If, after thinking about the matter, you do not arrive at a satisfactory answer, then do some research. Go to a Scripture index in one of the Watch Tower publications. Look under <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961568/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 9:29, 30</a> (or the corresponding verses in Matthew and Mark) or in a subject index under the word “transfiguration.” By doing this you will be referred to publications that show the transfiguration scene represented Jesus’ presence in Kingdom power and that he would do a work like that of both Moses and Elijah. You will also learn that the transfiguration was to Peter the fulfillment of Jesus’ promise that some of his disciples would not taste death until they had first seen the Son of man in his kingly power.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Sometimes as you read you will find it desirable to dig out background material to enhance your understanding. Suppose you are reading the book of Esther and you notice that much of the action takes place at “Shushan the castle,” or “the city of Shushan.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961568/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Esther 1:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961568/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 3:15</a>) You wonder, Where is this city? What was it like? Going to a Bible dictionary, you find that Shushan was really the Persian royal treasure city of Susa and that it was the royal winter residence. In one dictionary the reader will see a picture of an air view of the ruins of Susa, and you will see it was located on the Karkheh River, and that it is located in what is today southwest Iran. The name “Shushan” now means <span id="page475" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="475" data-before-text="475"></span>much more to you as you read this account in which the word so frequently occurs.</p>

A writing, naming Adar the thirteenth as the fateful day, was published throughout the 127 jurisdictional districts of the empire of the Persians and the Medes, including Shushan the royal castle. Mordecai, learning of it, put on sackcloth and ashes, doubtless in supplication to Jehovah, as others of God’s servants have done.

Such will therefore peruse with interest and profit the record of one Esther, a Jewish maiden who followed this wise course.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Esther lived in the royal city of Shushan, capital of Persia, in the early part of the fifth century B.C., at the time when Xerxes (Ahasuerus) ruled the 127 provinces of the empire which extended from Ethiopia to India. Orphaned at a tender age, she had been reared by her cousin, Mordecai, a Benjamite. Her name “Esther” was the Persian equivalent for the Jewish “Hadassah”, meaning “myrtle”.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Esther first appears in the book by her name after Xerxes had deposed his queen Vashti for a serious act of insubordination and when the most beautiful virgins of the empire were being brought to the capital as likely candidates to replace the deposed queen. Esther was among those so chosen, for she was “fair and beautiful”, and from the record that follows it is quite apparent that she had a lovely disposition. It is not surprising, therefore, to learn that she immediately received preferment above all other virgins by the keeper of the king’s women, Hegai, when her time came to prepare her visit to the king.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Esther manifested wisdom by obeying Mordecai’s instructions not to reveal her identity as a Jewess; for why should racial prejudice disqualify her? Here was a time for silence. And after the prescribed beauty course, which lasted for twelve months, when it came her turn to visit the king and she was permitted to ask for anything she wished so as to appear before him in the most attractive manner possible, again she showed wisdom and contentment by keeping silent; trusting the maturer judgment of Hegai and asking for nothing save what he prescribed. Some girlish notion might easily have spoiled things.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Regarding her visit to the king we read: “The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she won favor and kindness in his presence more than all the maidens; so that he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.” Following this the king made a great feast, declared a national holiday and gave lavish gifts, all in honor of Esther his new queen.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950403/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Esther 2:16-18</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Not long thereafter Esther’s cousin Mordecai revealed to her a plot to kill the king, which she made known to the king and which upon investigation was found to be so. Here again she showed wisdom, for, while making sure to advise the king that it was Mordecai that had uncovered the plot, she ‘did not make known her kindred and people’. Though now a queen she still heeded the wise instructions of this wise and devoted servant of Jehovah the same as before.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Vashti had been deposed in the third year of Xerxes’ reign; four years had passed by the time Esther succeeded her. Now it was the twelfth year of his reign, about 475 B.C., as one day her maidens brought her the report that all the Jews in Shushan, including Mordecai, were in great distress, weeping, wailing and fasting and covering themselves with sackcloth and ashes. Perplexed, Esther sends clothes to Mordecai so that he could discard his garments of sackcloth, but he refuses to accept them. Troubled Esther then sends one of the king’s chamberlains, Hatach, who was at her service, to “learn what this was and why it was”.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Mordecai advises him of all that had happened to him and regarding the exact sum of money ($18,000,000) that Haman had promised to pay to the king’s treasuries for the destruction of the Jews. He also gives Hatach a copy of the decree that was given out in Shushan to destroy all the Jews on the 13th day of the twelfth month (Adar), which date had been determined by the casting of lots, that he might show it to Esther, and charges her to go in to the king and implore him on behalf of her people.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950403/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Esther 4:1-9</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">But Esther hesitates, and not without seemingly good reason: “All the king’s servants . . . know,” she tells Mordecai, “that whoever, whether man or woman, comes to the king into the inner court who is not summoned, there is one law for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king shall hold out the golden scepter that he may live; but I have not been summoned to come to the king these thirty days.” Was the king angry with her? Had she displeased him in some way and so was no longer, or at least not for the time being, in his favor? Thirty days seemed like a long time to ignore his lovely queen.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950403/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Esther 4:11</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em></p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">But Mordecai firmly stands his ground: “Think not,” he sends word to Esther, “to yourself that you will escape inside the royal palace any more than all the rest of the Jews. For if you remain altogether silent at this time, then relief and deliverance will rise up for the Jews from another quarter, . . . and who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?” Appreciating his line of reasoning, Esther, with her trust in Jehovah, replies: “Go, assemble all the Jews that are to be found in Shushan and fast for me . . . three days. . . . I also and my maidens will likewise fast, and then I will go to the king, which is not according to the law; and if I perish, I perish.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950403/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Esther 4:13-16</a>, <em>An Amer. Trans.</em>) Without doubt, with the fasting went prayers to Jehovah for guidance and help.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">At the end of the three days Esther put on her royal robes—she was going to appear at her best—and then ventured into the king’s presence. When the king saw her she met with his favor and so he extended his scepter to her and inquired: “What is your wish, Queen Esther, and what is your request? It shall be given you even to the half of the kingdom.” Did Esther immediately blurt out all the facts regarding the dire straits she and all the Jews were in because of Haman’s foul conspiracy? No; urgent though the matter was, she showed tact, self-control and wisdom, appreciating that there was a time for everything, and so simply requested that the king and his grand vizier Haman come to a banquet she had prepared. First she would put the king in the best possible frame of mind, and by inviting Haman she not only would throw him off guard but would have him present at the time of his exposure.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950403/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Esther 5:1-4</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The king and Haman attend the banquet. At this she requests their presence at another banquet the following <span id="page175" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="175" data-before-text="175"></span>day, at which she would make known her petition. At the end of the second banquet she answers the king’s third request for her petition with the well-chosen words: “If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition and my people at my request; for we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold as male and female slaves, I would have held my peace, since the distress would not have been worth disturbing the king.” Coming at just this particular occasion, what a shock this news must have been to the king! No wonder he exclaimed in amazement: “Who is he, and where is he who dares presume in his heart to do so?” Where is he? Note here the wisdom of having Haman present at the banquet as she replies: “An adversary and an enemy, this wicked Haman.” Before the day was over Haman was hanging on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai, and Haman’s estate was given to the queen, who placed Mordecai in charge of it. Esther was well rewarded for her patience, courage, wisdom, and, above all, her trust in Jehovah.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1950403/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Esther 7:1-10</a>, <em>An Amer.

<strong>Purim</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>Purpose.</strong> While it is said by some commentators that the Festival of Purim as celebrated by the Jews in the present day has more of a secular than a religious nature and is sometimes accompanied by excesses, this was not so at the time of its institution and early celebration. Both Mordecai and Esther were servants of the true God Jehovah, and the festival was established to honor Him. The deliverance of the Jews at that time can be attributed to Jehovah God, because the issue arose by reason of Mordecai’s integrity in his course of exclusive worship of Jehovah. Haman was probably an Amalekite, whose nation Jehovah had specifically cursed and condemned to destruction. <span id="page717" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="717" data-before-text="717"></span>Mordecai respected God’s decree and refused to bow to Haman.

<strong>A Change from Mourning to a Good Day</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> Deeply moved by this command of Mordecai, Esther reminded him that according to the law of the Medes and the Persians anyone coming in before the king unbidden was to be put to death. Only in the case that the king would hold out to him the golden scepter would he stay alive. Besides, Esther informed Mordecai, she had not been called to come in to the king for thirty days. To do so now as Mordecai requested, without being bidden by the king, could mean her death. Mordecai, however, was adamant and replied to Esther: “Do not imagine within your own soul that the king’s household will escape any more than all the other Jews. For if you are altogether silent at this time, relief and deliverance themselves will stand up for the Jews from another place; but as for you and your father’s house, you people will perish. And who is there knowing whether it is for a time like this that you have attained to royal dignity?” Esther’s obedience to Mordecai and her love for her people won out. She replied: “Go, gather all the Jews that are to be found in Shushan and fast in my behalf and neither eat nor drink for three days, night and day. I too with my young women, I shall fast likewise, and upon that I shall come in to the king, which is not according to the law; and in case I must perish, I must perish.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971206/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Esther 4:1-17</a>.</p>

<strong>Subjection to Superior Authorities</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Not only could such prayers be pointed to by early Christians to prove they were innocent of the many charges of sedition brought against them, but also they could be used to possibly influence decisions <span id="page379" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="379" data-before-text="379"></span>rulers might make concerning gospel-preaching. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Luke 23:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Acts 17:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/24/2" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> 24:5</a>) Jesus warned his followers: “You will be haled before governors and kings for my sake for the purpose of a witness to them and the nations.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Matt. 10:18</a>, <em>NW</em>) The Christian would certainly pray to God before such appearances, and the prayer would concern the official before whom you were to appear, he being mentioned. The Christian might pray that the message be presented clearly and boldly and in understandable form for the official or judge, and that if it please God will he make this highly stationed one amenable to the message, unprejudiced, reasonable, so that he will see the justice of the Christian’s cause and rule in his favor, allowing him freedom of action for preaching, and not curbing such activity by imprisoning the minister.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">18.

When Queen Esther appeared unbidden before the Persian king Xerxes she put her life in jeopardy, so before she did this she sent word to Mordecai: “Go and gather all the Jews to be found in Susa, fast for me, eat and drink nothing for three days and three nights; I and my maids will fast as you do; and so I will go to the king, though it is against the law. If I perish, I perish.” Such fasting before God would certainly be accompanied by prayers and supplications for Esther’s safety, which means they would ask God to make the king view Esther with favor, for that was the point on which her safety hinged. The intercessions were successful, for Esther found favor with the king.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Esther 4:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 5:2</a>, <em>Mo.</em></p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">19.

Ah, let thy servant have success at this time, let him find favour in the sight of this man!” The man was the king, for whom Nehemiah was cupbearer. When Nehemiah appeared before the king he was asked: “What request have you to make?” Before ever answering Nehemiah did something, and he tells us what: “So I prayed to the God of heaven; then I said to the king.” The quick prayer came first, and brought results, for the request was granted. “This the king granted me, thanks to the kind favour of my God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Neh. 1:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/27/2" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> 2:4, 5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/27/3" data-bid="28-4" class="b"> 8</a>, <em>Mo</em>) It is quite evident that Nehemiah prayed for God to shape the king’s decision, and God answered that prayer, and Nehemiah gave God the credit for the favorable reply from the king.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">20.

These words of Paul concerning these rulers, if not a regular prayer, were in the nature of supplication or intercession, for they constituted a “wish to God”. No conversion of the high officials followed, but their decision was favorable to Paul: “This man practices nothing deserving death or bonds”; “This man could have been released if he had not <span id="page380" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="380" data-before-text="380"></span>appealed to Caesar.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Acts 26:28-32</a>, <em>NW</em>) In this particular case Paul was subsequently released by Caesar.</p>

A corridor led from the House of the Women to the inner court, and at the side of the court opposite the corridor was the hall, or throne room, of the palace. The throne was placed in the center of the farther wall, and from this vantage point the king could look over the screen that intervened and could see the queen waiting for an audience. Further details in the book show an intimate knowledge on the part of the writer with the palace. It is evident that objections to the book on the grounds of its being unhistorical and inaccurate as to Persian manners and customs are unfounded.</p>

<strong>She Stood Up for God’s People</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">ESTHER tried to calm her heart as she approached the courtyard in the palace at Shushan. It was not easy. Everything about the castle​—its multicolored relief sculptures of winged bulls, archers, and lions of glazed brickwork, its fluted stone columns and imposing statues, even its position atop huge platforms near the snowcapped Zagros Mountains and overlooking the pure waters of the river Choaspes—​was designed to remind each visitor of the immense power of the man whom she was going to see, the one who called himself “the great king.” He was also her husband.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Husband! How different Ahasuerus was from the kind of husband any faithful Jewish girl might have expected!<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2011734/0">a</a> He looked to no examples such as Abraham, a man who humbly accepted God’s direction to listen to Sarah, his wife. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011734/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 21:12</a>) The king knew little or nothing of Esther’s God, Jehovah, or of His Law. Ahasuerus knew Persian law, though, including a law forbidding the very thing that Esther was about to do. What was that? Well, the law said that anyone who appeared before the Persian monarch without first being summoned by the king was liable to death. Esther had not been summoned, but she was going to the king anyway. As she drew near to the inner courtyard, where she would be visible from the king’s throne, she may have felt that she was walking to her death.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011734/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Esther 4:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2011734/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 5:1</a>.</p>

<strong>Do My Clothes Reveal the Real Me?</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>The Benefits of Dressing Appropriately</strong></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The Bible tells of a time when Queen Esther needed to appear before her husband, the king. However, such an unbidden appearance could be a capital offense! No doubt Esther fervently prayed for God’s help. But she also paid attention to her appearance by “dressing up royally”​—in a manner suitable for the occasion! And “as soon as the king saw Esther the queen standing in the courtyard, she gained favor in his eyes.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1101989336/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Esther 5:1, 2</a>.</p>

<strong>Esther, Book of</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The account sets the time for its events during the reign of the Ahasuerus who ruled while the Persian Empire extended from India to Ethiopia and included 127 provinces or jurisdictional districts. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Esther 1:1</a>) These facts and its inclusion in the canon by Ezra confine its coverage to the period of the reign of one of the following three kings known to secular history: Darius I the Persian, Xerxes I and Artaxerxes Longimanus. However, both Darius I and Artaxerxes Longimanus are known to have favored the Jews before the twelfth year of their respective reigns, which does not fit the Ahasuerus of the book, as he apparently was not well acquainted with the Jews and their religion, nor inclined to favor them. Also, the fact that Xerxes I is known to have held a great feast and council of war in the third year of his reign before setting out against Greece tends to confirm the conclusion that the King Ahasuerus of the book of Esther must have been Xerxes I. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Esther 1:3</a>) <em>An American Translation</em> and Dr. James Moffatt’s translation even substitute Xerxes for Ahasuerus in the text. Xerxes I began to reign in 486 B.C.E., and according to the writings of Thucydides (of the fifth century B.C.E.), considered in conjunction with a table of chronology by Diodorus (of the first century B.C.E.), his reign terminated about 474 B.C.E. So he ruled about twelve years, probably into his thirteenth year, as indicated by <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Esther 3:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 9:1</a> and the events described in 9:15 to 10:3. Because the first events related in the book of Esther occurred in the third year of his reign, and the rest of the account covers the remainder of his reign, the book covers the <span id="page532" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="532" data-before-text="532"></span>period from about 484 to 474 B.C.E., approximately ten years.—See AHASUERUS No. 3.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Undoubtedly the book of Esther was committed to writing about 474 B.C.E., shortly after the events occurred. The book’s vivid style of writing suggests that the writer was an eyewitness. Moreover, the strong inference that the writer had access to governmental documents (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Esther 10:2</a>) makes it most likely that the book was written in Shushan in the province of Elam, which was then part of Persia. Its Persian and Chaldean words mixed in with Hebrew fit the above-mentioned time of writing as well as the land of Persia for the place of writing.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Ezra could have brought the book from Babylon to Jerusalem in 468 B.C.E., for the Great Synagogue of Jerusalem had it in the canon before its period ended about 300 B.C.E.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>AUTHENTICITY AND CANONICITY</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Canonical authority for the book of Esther is doubted by some, because it is not quoted or alluded to in the Christian Greek Scriptures. But this is no conclusive objection, for the same circumstance exists with other books of well-established canonicity, such as Ezra and Ecclesiastes. Melito of Sardis, Gregory of Nazianzus and Athanasius are among those who omitted it from their lists of canonical books. However, Jerome, Augustine and Origen refer to the book by name. It is in the Chester Beatty collection, the books of Ezekiel, Daniel and Esther being found in one codex, which was likely compiled in the first half of the third century C.E. It does not appear that its authority was ever doubted by the Jews or early Christians as a whole. In their Bibles the Jews place it after the Pentateuch and between the books of Joshua and Ecclesiastes, and sometimes among the Hagiographa (the Writings) between Ecclesiastes and Daniel.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Apocryphal additions were later inserted into the book. Some scholars date their origin at approximately 100 B.C.E., about 300 years after the canon of the Hebrew Scriptures was fixed, according to the traditional view.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The book of Esther is accused of exaggeration in its mention of a banquet lasting 180 days in the third year of the reign of Ahasuerus. (1:3, 4) However, it has been expressed that such a long feast may have been held to accommodate the numerous officials from the many provinces who could not, because of their duties, have been there for all of it and all at the same time. Actually, the text does not say the banquet lasted that long, but that the king showed them the riches and glory of his kingdom for 180 days. A banquet is mentioned at 1:3 and 1:5. It may be that two banquets are not meant, but that the seven-day banquet for all in the castle at the end of the great assembly is the one referred to in verse 3. (Keil and Delitzsch, <em>Commentaries on the Old Testament,</em> “Esther”) That such a great assembly and festival were held agrees with a statement of Herodotus about Xerxes beginning to make preparations for his expedition to Greece.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">In view of the book’s absence of any direct mention of God, it is charged with being irreligious. Nevertheless, it tells of fasting and a “cry for aid” on the part of the Jews, implying prayer. (4:3, 16; 9:31) Also, there is indication of God’s maneuvering of events in the sleeplessness of the king at the opportune time (6:1) and possible allusion to divine purpose in Esther’s attaining to the queenship. (4:14) Furthermore, the fact that Mordecai strictly refused to bow before God’s enemy Haman, who as an Agagite may have been a royal Amalekite, is evidence that Jehovah was worshiped by Mordecai.—3:1-6; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex. 17:14</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong><em>Evidence of history and archaeology</em></strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Historical and archaeological findings have added their voice in confirming the authenticity of the book of Esther. A few examples will suffice. The way Persians honored a man is described authentically. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Esther 6:8</a>) White and blue (or violet) were the royal Persian colors. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Esther 8:15</a> we read that Mordecai wore “royal apparel of blue and linen,” and a cloak of reddish purple.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Esther “took her stand in the inner courtyard of the king’s house opposite the king’s house, while the king was sitting on his royal throne in the royal house opposite the entrance of the house. And it came about that, as soon as the king saw Esther the queen standing in the courtyard, she gained favor in his eyes.” (5:1, 2) Excavations have revealed that the detail of the description is exact. A corridor led from the House of the Women to the inner court, and at the side of the court opposite to the corridor was the hall or throne room of the palace. The throne was placed in the center of the farther wall, and from this vantage point the king could look over the screen that intervened and could see the queen waiting for an audience. Further details in the book show an intimate knowledge on the part of the writer with the palace. It is evident that objections to the book on the grounds of being unhistorical and inaccurate as to Persian manners and customs are unfounded.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Very strong evidence for the book’s authenticity is the Festival of Purim, or “Lots,” commemorated by the Jews down to this day and on which anniversary the entire book is read in their synagogues. A cuneiform inscription found at Borsippa is said to refer to a Persian official by the name of <em>Mardukâ</em> (Mordecai?) who was at Susa (Shushan) at the end of the reign of Darius I or the beginning of the reign of Xerxes I.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>CONTENTS</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The book of Esther is a very moving drama that could be divided into three acts. However, it should be remembered that, far from being fictional, these acts are part of a real-life drama. After a brief description of the setting, chapter 1 presents a scene in the courtyard of the garden of the king’s palace, where a great banquet is being held for all the people of Shushan the castle. At the height of the merrymaking King Ahasuerus orders Vashti the queen to appear and show the people and princes her loveliness. At her persistent refusal, and on recommendation of his princes, he deposes her and makes announcement of this to all the peoples of the empire.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Scene 2 of the first act, described in chapter 2, takes us into the king’s house, where arrangements are being made to gather to the castle all the beautiful virgins of the empire and give them beauty treatments before presenting them to the king. From these the king is to select his new queen. The selection turns out to be Esther, a Jewish girl, the cousin of Mordecai her caretaker and a servant in the king’s gate.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">In the third scene, chapter 3 tells of the promotion of Haman and his success in obtaining authority from the king to issue a decree ordering the destruction of all the Jews in the empire.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Act 2 opens with a scene in front of the king’s gate, in which Mordecai counsels and exhorts Esther to intercede for her people even though she would be jeopardizing her life thereby.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Esther 4:2-17</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Scene 2 of this act is in the throne room of the palace. Esther appears uninvited before the king with the request that he and Haman be her guests at a banquet that day. After the banquet the scene shifts to Haman’s house, where Haman and a group of his friends are gathered. They decide on the erection of a fifty-cubit stake on which to hang Mordecai.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Esther 5:1-14</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">The king’s house is the setting for scene 4 of this act. Haman is approaching the king to ask for the hanging of Mordecai. The king, instead, has Haman honor Mordecai for his service in revealing a plot to take the king’s life. He is obliged to clothe Mordecai in royal apparel and lead him around the city square on horseback, calling out: “This is how it is done to <span id="page533" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="533" data-before-text="533"></span>the man in whose honor the king himself has taken a delight.” The act ends back in the house of Haman, to which Haman had rushed after this humiliating experience.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Esther 6:4-14</a>.</p>

The Christian might pray that the message be presented clearly and boldly and in understandable form for the official or judge, and that if it please God will he make this highly stationed one amenable to the message, unprejudiced, reasonable, so that he will see the justice of the Christian’s cause and rule in his favor, allowing him freedom of action for preaching, and not curbing such activity by imprisoning the minister.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">18.

When Queen Esther appeared unbidden before the Persian king Xerxes she put her life in jeopardy, so before she did this she sent word to Mordecai: “Go and gather all the Jews to be found in Susa, fast for me, eat and drink nothing for three days and three nights; I and my maids will fast as you do; and so I will go to the king, though it is against the law. If I perish, I perish.” Such fasting before God would certainly be accompanied by prayers and supplications for Esther’s safety, which means they would ask God to make the king view Esther with favor, for that was the point on which her safety hinged. The intercessions were successful, for Esther found favor with the king.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Esther 4:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/26/1" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 5:2</a>, <em>Mo.</em></p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">19.

Ah, let thy servant have success at this time, let him find favour in the sight of this man!” The man was the king, for whom Nehemiah was cupbearer. When Nehemiah appeared before the king he was asked: “What request have you to make?” Before ever answering Nehemiah did something, and he tells us what: “So I prayed to the God of heaven; then I said to the king.” The quick prayer came first, and brought results, for the request was granted. “This the king granted me, thanks to the kind favour of my God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Neh. 1:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/27/1" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/27/2" data-bid="28-3" class="b"> 2:4, 5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/27/3" data-bid="28-4" class="b"> 8</a>, <em>Mo</em>) It is quite evident that Nehemiah prayed for God to shape the king’s decision, and God answered that prayer, and Nehemiah gave God the credit for the favorable reply from the king.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">20.

These words of Paul concerning these rulers, if not a regular prayer, were in the nature of supplication or intercession, for they constituted a “wish to God”. No conversion of the high officials followed, but their decision was favorable to Paul: “This man practices nothing deserving death or bonds”; “This man could have been released if he had not <span id="page380" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="380" data-before-text="380"></span>appealed to Caesar.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952443/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Acts 26:28-32</a>, <em>NW</em>) In this particular case Paul was subsequently released by Caesar.</p>

<strong>Esther, Book of</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The account sets the time for its events during the reign of the Ahasuerus who ruled while the Persian Empire extended from India to Ethiopia and included 127 provinces or jurisdictional districts. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Esther 1:1</a>) These facts and its inclusion in the canon by Ezra confine its coverage to the period of the reign of one of the following three kings known to secular history: Darius I the Persian, Xerxes I and Artaxerxes Longimanus. However, both Darius I and Artaxerxes Longimanus are known to have favored the Jews before the twelfth year of their respective reigns, which does not fit the Ahasuerus of the book, as he apparently was not well acquainted with the Jews and their religion, nor inclined to favor them. Also, the fact that Xerxes I is known to have held a great feast and council of war in the third year of his reign before setting out against Greece tends to confirm the conclusion that the King Ahasuerus of the book of Esther must have been Xerxes I. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Esther 1:3</a>) <em>An American Translation</em> and Dr. James Moffatt’s translation even substitute Xerxes for Ahasuerus in the text. Xerxes I began to reign in 486 B.C.E., and according to the writings of Thucydides (of the fifth century B.C.E.), considered in conjunction with a table of chronology by Diodorus (of the first century B.C.E.), his reign terminated about 474 B.C.E. So he ruled about twelve years, probably into his thirteenth year, as indicated by <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Esther 3:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 9:1</a> and the events described in 9:15 to 10:3. Because the first events related in the book of Esther occurred in the third year of his reign, and the rest of the account covers the remainder of his reign, the book covers the <span id="page532" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="532" data-before-text="532"></span>period from about 484 to 474 B.C.E., approximately ten years.—See AHASUERUS No. 3.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Undoubtedly the book of Esther was committed to writing about 474 B.C.E., shortly after the events occurred. The book’s vivid style of writing suggests that the writer was an eyewitness. Moreover, the strong inference that the writer had access to governmental documents (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Esther 10:2</a>) makes it most likely that the book was written in Shushan in the province of Elam, which was then part of Persia. Its Persian and Chaldean words mixed in with Hebrew fit the above-mentioned time of writing as well as the land of Persia for the place of writing.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Ezra could have brought the book from Babylon to Jerusalem in 468 B.C.E., for the Great Synagogue of Jerusalem had it in the canon before its period ended about 300 B.C.E.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>AUTHENTICITY AND CANONICITY</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Canonical authority for the book of Esther is doubted by some, because it is not quoted or alluded to in the Christian Greek Scriptures. But this is no conclusive objection, for the same circumstance exists with other books of well-established canonicity, such as Ezra and Ecclesiastes. Melito of Sardis, Gregory of Nazianzus and Athanasius are among those who omitted it from their lists of canonical books. However, Jerome, Augustine and Origen refer to the book by name. It is in the Chester Beatty collection, the books of Ezekiel, Daniel and Esther being found in one codex, which was likely compiled in the first half of the third century C.E. It does not appear that its authority was ever doubted by the Jews or early Christians as a whole. In their Bibles the Jews place it after the Pentateuch and between the books of Joshua and Ecclesiastes, and sometimes among the Hagiographa (the Writings) between Ecclesiastes and Daniel.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Apocryphal additions were later inserted into the book. Some scholars date their origin at approximately 100 B.C.E., about 300 years after the canon of the Hebrew Scriptures was fixed, according to the traditional view.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The book of Esther is accused of exaggeration in its mention of a banquet lasting 180 days in the third year of the reign of Ahasuerus. (1:3, 4) However, it has been expressed that such a long feast may have been held to accommodate the numerous officials from the many provinces who could not, because of their duties, have been there for all of it and all at the same time. Actually, the text does not say the banquet lasted that long, but that the king showed them the riches and glory of his kingdom for 180 days. A banquet is mentioned at 1:3 and 1:5. It may be that two banquets are not meant, but that the seven-day banquet for all in the castle at the end of the great assembly is the one referred to in verse 3. (Keil and Delitzsch, <em>Commentaries on the Old Testament,</em> “Esther”) That such a great assembly and festival were held agrees with a statement of Herodotus about Xerxes beginning to make preparations for his expedition to Greece.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">In view of the book’s absence of any direct mention of God, it is charged with being irreligious. Nevertheless, it tells of fasting and a “cry for aid” on the part of the Jews, implying prayer. (4:3, 16; 9:31) Also, there is indication of God’s maneuvering of events in the sleeplessness of the king at the opportune time (6:1) and possible allusion to divine purpose in Esther’s attaining to the queenship. (4:14) Furthermore, the fact that Mordecai strictly refused to bow before God’s enemy Haman, who as an Agagite may have been a royal Amalekite, is evidence that Jehovah was worshiped by Mordecai.—3:1-6; <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex. 17:14</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong><em>Evidence of history and archaeology</em></strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Historical and archaeological findings have added their voice in confirming the authenticity of the book of Esther. A few examples will suffice. The way Persians honored a man is described authentically. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Esther 6:8</a>) White and blue (or violet) were the royal Persian colors. At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Esther 8:15</a> we read that Mordecai wore “royal apparel of blue and linen,” and a cloak of reddish purple.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Esther “took her stand in the inner courtyard of the king’s house opposite the king’s house, while the king was sitting on his royal throne in the royal house opposite the entrance of the house. And it came about that, as soon as the king saw Esther the queen standing in the courtyard, she gained favor in his eyes.” (5:1, 2) Excavations have revealed that the detail of the description is exact. A corridor led from the House of the Women to the inner court, and at the side of the court opposite to the corridor was the hall or throne room of the palace. The throne was placed in the center of the farther wall, and from this vantage point the king could look over the screen that intervened and could see the queen waiting for an audience. Further details in the book show an intimate knowledge on the part of the writer with the palace. It is evident that objections to the book on the grounds of being unhistorical and inaccurate as to Persian manners and customs are unfounded.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Very strong evidence for the book’s authenticity is the Festival of Purim, or “Lots,” commemorated by the Jews down to this day and on which anniversary the entire book is read in their synagogues. A cuneiform inscription found at Borsippa is said to refer to a Persian official by the name of <em>Mardukâ</em> (Mordecai?) who was at Susa (Shushan) at the end of the reign of Darius I or the beginning of the reign of Xerxes I.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>CONTENTS</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The book of Esther is a very moving drama that could be divided into three acts. However, it should be remembered that, far from being fictional, these acts are part of a real-life drama. After a brief description of the setting, chapter 1 presents a scene in the courtyard of the garden of the king’s palace, where a great banquet is being held for all the people of Shushan the castle. At the height of the merrymaking King Ahasuerus orders Vashti the queen to appear and show the people and princes her loveliness. At her persistent refusal, and on recommendation of his princes, he deposes her and makes announcement of this to all the peoples of the empire.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Scene 2 of the first act, described in chapter 2, takes us into the king’s house, where arrangements are being made to gather to the castle all the beautiful virgins of the empire and give them beauty treatments before presenting them to the king. From these the king is to select his new queen. The selection turns out to be Esther, a Jewish girl, the cousin of Mordecai her caretaker and a servant in the king’s gate.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">In the third scene, chapter 3 tells of the promotion of Haman and his success in obtaining authority from the king to issue a decree ordering the destruction of all the Jews in the empire.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Act 2 opens with a scene in front of the king’s gate, in which Mordecai counsels and exhorts Esther to intercede for her people even though she would be jeopardizing her life thereby.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Esther 4:2-17</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Scene 2 of this act is in the throne room of the palace. Esther appears uninvited before the king with the request that he and Haman be her guests at a banquet that day. After the banquet the scene shifts to Haman’s house, where Haman and a group of his friends are gathered. They decide on the erection of a fifty-cubit stake on which to hang Mordecai.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Esther 5:1-14</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">The king’s house is the setting for scene 4 of this act. Haman is approaching the king to ask for the hanging of Mordecai. The king, instead, has Haman honor Mordecai for his service in revealing a plot to take the king’s life. He is obliged to clothe Mordecai in royal apparel and lead him around the city square on horseback, calling out: “This is how it is done to <span id="page533" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="533" data-before-text="533"></span>the man in whose honor the king himself has taken a delight.” The act ends back in the house of Haman, to which Haman had rushed after this humiliating experience.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011389/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Esther 6:4-14</a>.</p>

The official named Haman became angry that Mordecai would not bow to him. Later Haman erroneously thought he would be favored. “Haman went out on that day joyful and merry of heart; but as soon as Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate and that he did not rise and did not quake on account of him, Haman was immediately filled with rage against Mordecai. However, Haman kept control of himself and came into his house.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993604/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Esther 5:9, 10</a>) He was quick to feel the emotion of joy. Yet he was also quick to feel rage at the mere sight of one against whom he held a grudge. Do you think that when the Bible says that Haman “kept control of himself” it meant he was exemplary in self-control? Hardly. For the time being, Haman controlled his actions and any show of emotion, but he failed to control his jealous rage. His emotions led him to plot murder.</p>
