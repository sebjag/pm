He sent prophets and judges to the nation of Israel. But he can provide wise correction even on an individual basis. One of Job’s false “comforters” had to acknowledge that Job had “corrected many.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981645/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 4:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1981645/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 16:2</a>) What a blessing it must have been to receive wise correction from Job, a man outstanding in godly devotion!

<strong>A Lesson in How to Handle Problems</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Well, they based practically all their counsel on an incorrect supposition: that suffering comes only to those who sin. In his first speech, Eliphaz said: “Who that is innocent has ever perished? And where have the upright ever been effaced? According to what I have seen, those devising what is hurtful and those sowing trouble will themselves reap it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995126/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 4:7, 8</a>) Eliphaz mistakenly believed that the innocent are immune to calamity. He reasoned that since Job was in severe straits, he must have sinned against God.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1995126/0">a</a> Both Bildad and Zophar likewise insisted that Job repent of his sins.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995126/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 8:5, 6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995126/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 11:13-15</a>.</p>

This will be done by taking each of the speeches of Job’s companions in turn and showing how the clergy of Christendom have spoken in the same <em>sibboleth</em> fashion as those ancient agents of Satan.

By them the Job-like anointed ones continue to be branded as the world’s No. 1 Religious Badmen to be avoided like poison.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966683/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 22:5</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>FALSE CHARGE OF BIAS</strong></p><p id="p101" data-pid="101" class="qu"> 3.

(Pp. 469-474) There overwhelming evidences were published proving beyond doubt that Jehovah’s witnesses not only are not biased in their <em>New World Translation,</em> but have honestly reproduced the sense and wording of the original-language texts.

Do you blame God?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">WHEN earthquakes and hurricanes kill and maim without respect for whether their victims are righteous or wicked, do you blame God? When you read that an innocent man spent years in prison for the offense of another, do you wonder why such injustices occur? What do you think when an upright, God-fearing Christian writhes with the pain of incurable cancer, while his loose-living, unprincipled neighbor prospers and enjoys excellent health? Does it cause you to wonder why the righteous suffer?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Some feel that a righteous person should be rewarded with freedom from suffering, that suffering is an evidence of one’s having committed unrighteous acts. That was the argument used by the three supposed friends of Job when they came to comfort him. Job was suffering indescribably from disease and pain. He had lost all his material possessions, including his ten lovely children. His brothers and intimate acquaintances, who had held him in high esteem, detested his very presence. Even his wife turned away from him and recommended that he curse God and die.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job, chaps. 1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Job 19:13-19</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">After Job’s three visitors had silently observed his excruciating pain and extreme humiliation for seven days and nights, finally one of them spoke, not comfortingly or sympathetically, but with stinging, cutting words that accused Job of unrighteous acts for which he was now suffering punishment. “Remember, please,” said Eliphaz: “Who that is innocent has ever perished? And where have the upright ever been effaced? According to what I have seen, those devising what is hurtful and those sowing trouble will themselves reap it. Through the breath of God they perish, and through the spirit of his anger they come to an end.” Yes, contended Eliphaz, God is punishing you for your sins, Job. That is why you are suffering.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 4:7-9</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Have you not heard people, even clergymen, use the same argument: that calamities are acts of God to punish people for their sins? However, the charge against Job was false. God was not punishing him because of some unrighteous acts he had committed. Job was righteous. That is why Jehovah said to Eliphaz the Temanite: “My anger has grown hot against you and your two companions, for you men have not spoken concerning me what is truthful as has my servant Job.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962321/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 42:7</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>GOD NOT TO BLAME</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Today human suffering is observed on every hand. Millions of people starve and <span id="page262" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="262" data-before-text="262"></span>live in extreme poverty. Unlike Job, who “did not sin or ascribe unseemliness to God,” many become embittered and blame God. This was especially true during World War II when bombs rained from the sky, spreading death and suffering to both good people and bad. Yet when men break God’s laws by hating and warring against one another, can they properly blame Him when suffering results? If a parent warns his children that they should not fight among themselves and they disregard the good counsel and assault one another with sticks and stones, is the parent responsible if bruises and injuries are suffered? He is no more responsible than God is for human suffering when people disregard his laws.</p>

<strong>Bones</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><strong>Figurative Usage.</strong> The Bible in its references to bones highlights how vital they are literally to the physical health of the individual and figuratively to his spiritual health. The bones are the interior supporting framework of the body, and as such are used in the Bible metaphorically to represent one’s being, especially as affected by deep feelings and emotions. Thus, the bones of a fearful individual are said to be “filled with dread.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000788/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Job 4:14</a>) One’s bones can shake because of extreme dejection or be “hot from dryness” because of disease.

<strong>Resist Wrong Thinking!</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>“In His Servants He Has No Faith”</strong></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In all three speeches, Eliphaz presented the idea that God is so exacting that nothing his servants do is good enough for him. “Look! In his servants he has no faith,” Eliphaz told Job, “and his angels he charges with faultiness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005687/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 4:18</a>, footnote) Eliphaz later said of God: “In his holy ones he has no faith, and the heavens themselves are actually not clean in his eyes.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005687/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 15:15</a>) And he asked: “Does the Almighty have any delight in that you are righteous?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005687/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Job 22:3</a>) Bildad was in agreement with this viewpoint, for he stated: “There is even the moon, and it is not bright; and the stars themselves have not proved clean in [God’s] eyes.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005687/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 25:5</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">We must be on guard against being influenced by such thinking. It can lead us to feel that God requires too much of us. This view attacks our very relationship with Jehovah. Moreover, if we succumb to this type of reasoning, how would we respond when we are given needed discipline? Rather than humbly accepting the correction, our heart may become “enraged against Jehovah himself,” and we may harbor resentment toward him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2005687/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Proverbs 19:3</a>) How spiritually disastrous that would be!</p>

<strong>A Lesson in How to Handle Problems</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">His three companions further disheartened Job by voicing personal ideas rather than godly wisdom. Eliphaz went so far as to say that ‘God has no faith in his servants’ and that it did not really matter to Jehovah whether Job was righteous or not. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995126/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 4:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995126/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 22:2, 3</a>) It is hard to imagine a more discouraging​—or more untruthful—​remark than that! Not surprisingly, Jehovah later rebuked Eliphaz and his companions for this blasphemy. “You men have not <span id="page28" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>spoken concerning me what is truthful,” he said. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995126/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 42:7</a>) But the most damaging assertion was yet to come.</p>

<strong>Do You Dignify Others When Offering Counsel?</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="ss"><strong>Dignify Others​—Oppose the Devil</strong></p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Satan’s tactics are designed to strip you of dignity, to produce feelings of disgrace, worthlessness, and despair. Notice how he used a human agent to stimulate negative emotions in faithful Job. Hypocritical Eliphaz claimed: “In his servants he [Jehovah] has no faith, and his messengers [holy angels] he charges with faultiness. How much more so with those dwelling in houses of clay [sinful humans], whose foundation is in the dust! One crushes them more quickly than a moth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994086/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Job 4:18, 19</a>) So according to him, Job was of no more value to God than a moth. Indeed, the counsel of Eliphaz and his companions, far from being upbuilding, would have left Job bereft of even the memory of better times. In their view his past faithfulness, family training, relationship with God, and gifts of mercy were worth nothing.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Likewise today, repentant wrongdoers are particularly susceptible to such feelings, and the danger exists of their being ‘swallowed up by being overly sad.’ Elders, when counseling such ones, “confirm your love” for them by allowing them to preserve a measure of dignity. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994086/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 2:7, 8</a>) “Being treated with a lack of dignity makes it difficult to accept counsel,” admits William. It is essential to strengthen their belief that they are valuable in God’s eyes. Remind them that Jehovah is “not unrighteous so as to forget [their] work and the love [they] showed for his name” during their past years of faithful service.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994086/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Hebrews 6:10</a>.</p>

<strong>Why Show Confidence in Others?</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">But does not even God on occasion distrust his servants? We do find that Eliphaz the Temanite attributed a distrustful disposition to the Creator, saying: “Look! In his servants he has no faith, and his messengers he charges with faultiness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977287/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 4:18</a>) Eliphaz acknowledged the source of that statement to have been a “spirit.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977287/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 4:15</a>) The fact that Jehovah God later reproved Eliphaz and his companions for having spoken untruth proves that this “spirit” was wicked, demonic.

<strong>Resist Satanic Propaganda</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>Their “Foundation Is in the Dust”</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Satan used Eliphaz, one of Job’s three visiting companions, to argue that men are hopelessly weak. Referring to humans as “those dwelling in houses of clay,” he told Job: “[Their] foundation is in the dust! One crushes them more quickly than a moth. From morning to evening they are crushed to pieces; without anyone’s taking it to heart they perish forever.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010126/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 4:19, 20</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Elsewhere in the Scriptures, we are likened to “earthen vessels”​—fragile pots made of clay.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010126/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12</a>) Left to ourselves, we are vulnerable to Satan’s attacks. But as Christians, we are not without help. Despite our weaknesses, we are precious in God’s eyes. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010126/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isa. 43:4</a>) Moreover, Jehovah gives holy spirit to those asking him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2010126/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Luke 11:13</a>) His spirit can give us “power beyond what is normal,” enabling us to cope with any adversity Satan inflicts on us.

<strong>Do You Dignify Others When Offering Counsel?</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="ss"><strong>Dignify Others​—Oppose the Devil</strong></p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Satan’s tactics are designed to strip you of dignity, to produce feelings of disgrace, worthlessness, and despair. Notice how he used a human agent to stimulate negative emotions in faithful Job. Hypocritical Eliphaz claimed: “In his servants he [Jehovah] has no faith, and his messengers [holy angels] he charges with faultiness. How much more so with those dwelling in houses of clay [sinful humans], whose foundation is in the dust! One crushes them more quickly than a moth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994086/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Job 4:18, 19</a>) So according to him, Job was of no more value to God than a moth. Indeed, the counsel of Eliphaz and his companions, far from being upbuilding, would have left Job bereft of even the memory of better times. In their view his past faithfulness, family training, relationship with God, and gifts of mercy were worth nothing.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Likewise today, repentant wrongdoers are particularly susceptible to such feelings, and the danger exists of their being ‘swallowed up by being overly sad.’ Elders, when counseling such ones, “confirm your love” for them by allowing them to preserve a measure of dignity. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994086/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 2:7, 8</a>) “Being treated with a lack of dignity makes it difficult to accept counsel,” admits William. It is essential to strengthen their belief that they are valuable in God’s eyes. Remind them that Jehovah is “not unrighteous so as to forget [their] work and the love [they] showed for his name” during their past years of faithful service.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1994086/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Hebrews 6:10</a>.</p>

<strong>Tent</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">It appears that in Bible times larger tents were usually divided into at least two compartments by means of hanging tent cloths.

Thus, Abraham is described as ‘dwelling in tents’ while he was “awaiting the city having real foundations.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014262/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Heb. 11:9, 10</a>) It seems that during their stay in Egypt the Israelites mainly lived in houses, not tents.

Even after the Israelites conquered the Promised Land tents were still used at times by shepherds or agricultural workers in the field.

Also, tents were used by military commanders and armies when on distant expeditions.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014262/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Sam. 17:54;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014262/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 7:7</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014262/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Daniel 11:45</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The long contact of the Israelites with tents undoubtedly gave rise to the poetic use of “tent” to refer to any habitation, even if it was a normal house.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014262/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ex. 12:23,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014262/16/1" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014262/16/2" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 1 Sam. 13:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014262/16/3" data-bid="17-4" class="b"> 1 Ki. 12:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014262/16/4" data-bid="17-5" class="b"> Ps. 78:51</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>FIGURATIVE USES</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">This familiarity with tents is also reflected in the Bible’s many figurative references to tents. Regarding the time he was approaching death, Hezekiah wrote: “My own habitation has been pulled out and removed from me like the tent of shepherds.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014262/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isa. 38:12</a>) As a tent occupying a spot could quickly be taken down and removed, the poles taken out and the pegs pulled up, so Hezekiah’s place in the land of the living seemed transitory and easily removed. Eliphaz likened death to pulling out the tent cord, which would make a tent collapse. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014262/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Job 4:21</a>) Somewhat similarly, Paul used the metaphor of a tent when speaking of the human bodies of spirit-begotten Christians. A collapsible tent is a more fragile and temporary dwelling than a normal house. Though existing on earth in a mortal body of flesh, the Christians having the spirit as a token of the heavenly life to come look forward to “a building from God,” a heavenly body that is everlasting, incorruptible.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014262/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:50-53;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014262/19/1" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 5:1-5</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014262/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Peter 1:13, 14</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">In portraying the destruction to come upon the Jews, Jeremiah used the figure of a tent.

Further emphasizing the pathetic condition, her sons were in exile, so there was no one remaining who could help her with the work of raising and stretching the tent. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014262/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Jer. 10:20</a>) When the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem, the city as a former collection of dwellings could be described as “the tent of the daughter of Zion” into which God had poured his rage.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014262/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Lam. 2:4</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">A “tent” also served in another figurative way in a number of instances. The tent of an individual was a place of rest and protection from the elements. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014262/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Gen. 18:1</a>) In view of the customs regarding hospitality, visitors had reason to believe that they would be cared for and respected when welcomed into someone’s tent. Consequently, when <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014262/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Revelation 7:15</a> says about the “great crowd” that God “will spread his tent over them” it suggests protective care and security. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014262/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ps. 61:3, 4</a>) Isaiah speaks of the preparations that God’s wife, Zion, is to make for the sons she will produce. She is told to “make the place of your tent more spacious.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014262/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Isa. 54:2</a>) Thus, she enlarges the protective place for her children.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014262/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Revelation 21:1-3</a>, God projected John’s vision into the thousand-year reign of Christ, and said: “Look! The tent of God is with mankind, and he will reside with them [or, tent with them].” In a way foreshadowed by the tent or tabernacle in the wilderness, God will dwell, not personally, but <em>representatively</em> with mankind as he deals with them through the “Lamb of God,” who is also the great High Priest.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014262/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ex. 25:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014262/29/1" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 33:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014262/29/2" data-bid="30-3" class="b"> John 1:29;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014262/29/3" data-bid="30-4" class="b"> Heb. 4:14</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"></p>

Samson’s feat of picking up the doors of the gate of Gaza along with its two side posts and bar and carrying them to the top of “the mountain that is in front of Hebron” was, in view of these factors, no mean accomplishment. It was done, of course, through the energizing power of Jehovah’s spirit.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Judg. 16:3</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>FUNCTION</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The “gates” of a city could refer to the city itself, since much of the official business took place there and transactions were recorded there (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Deut. 16:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> Ruth 4:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/14/3" data-bid="15-4" class="b"> Ps. 87:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/14/4" data-bid="15-5" class="b"> 122:2</a>), or, in the capital, at the gateway of the palace grounds.

No doubt they were well guarded. The tabernacle was in the camp’s center, with the Levites camping in close proximity, and the twelve tribes, three on a side, at a greater distance. This arrangement afforded ample protection for the camp.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Ex. 32:26, 27;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/41/1" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> Num. chap. 3</a>; see GATEKEEPER.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>GATES OF JERUSALEM</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">In dealing with the gates of Jerusalem it is well to remember that, from the time of its capture by David, the city developed and expanded, so that several walls or added portions of walls were built. We shall concern ourselves here mainly with the gates mentioned in the book of Nehemiah, which gives us the most complete description or listing. The gates named in Nehemiah’s record are gates in the wall that was built prior to the eighth century B.C.E. and in the wall surrounding the “second quarter.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">2 Ki. 22:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/42/1" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 34:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/42/2" data-bid="43-3" class="b"> Zeph. 1:10</a>) The “second quarter” was a part of the city bounded on the W and part of the N by Hezekiah’s wall (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:5</a>) and joined by Manasseh’s wall, which continued on the NE and E. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">2 Chron. 33:14</a>) This was N of the earlier city and wall, but apparently did not extend as far W as the earlier wall.—See accompanying map.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong><em>Nehemiah’s wall</em></strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">In his account of the reconstruction of the wall of the city (chap. 3), Nehemiah begins at the Sheep Gate, located in the NE part of the wall encompassing the second quarter, and proceeds in a counterclockwise direction. We shall follow this procedure in our listing below, inserting the gates not mentioned in the reconstruction account but named in the description of the inauguration procession (chap. 12), along with gates spoken of in other scriptures, some of which are merely other names for those in Nehemiah’s record.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong><em>Sheep Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The Sheep Gate was rebuilt by Eliashib the high priest and associate priests. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Neh. 3:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/45/1" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> 32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/45/2" data-bid="46-3" class="b"> 12:39</a>) This fact would indicate that it was near the Temple area. Its location was probably in the N wall of the second quarter, the part built by Manasseh (see “Fish Gate,” below), at or near the NE corner of the city. This gate may have been so named because through it were brought sheep and goats for sacrifice or perhaps for a market that was located nearby. It may also have been called the “Gate of Benjamin” (which see). The “sheepgate” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">John 5:2</a> is likely this Sheep Gate or a later gate corresponding to it, for it was located in the same vicinity, near the pool Bethzatha.</p>

<strong>Bible Truth Makes Free</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Bible itself is not a “charm” book or a “good luck” piece that by merely having it in one’s own possession will ward off disaster or usher in happiness. The Bible in simple language is God’s Word. And as such it is a sure guide to follow. There is nothing mythical or mysterious about it. Although it is a perfect guide for men, it cannot guide us unless we let it. That is, unless we let its principles influence our lives. Unless we believe and <span id="page202" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="202" data-before-text="202"></span>abide by its principles the Book itself is like any other book—inanimate. If we do make it a part of our living it becomes a freeing agent and a tremendous force for good. Its truths brighten our pathway, showing us danger zones and the proper decisions to make on the way to life. It is this truth that sets one free. Jesus emphasized this when he said: “If you remain in my word, you are really my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953242/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 8:32</a>, <em>NW</em>) Freedom then rests on two factors: knowing God’s Word and remaining in it. Israel’s conduct is a forceful illustration of this fact.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The nation of Israel had God’s Word of truth. They were familiar with its principles. Its kings and priests were obligated to keep it. As long as they remained in harmony with Bible principles they were free as a nation, but when they abandoned these principles for their own ways of doing things they lost this freedom and were reduced to slaves by their enemies. However, there were individuals within the nation of Israel, such as Jeremiah, Daniel, the three Hebrew children, and others, who remained free as individuals even though Israel was reduced to serfdom. They maintained their freedom by not compromising Bible principles. Theirs was a mental freedom. They had peace of mind and joy of heart, a token of God’s approval for integrity. The apostle Paul testifies to this fact, saying: “And the peace of God that excels all thought will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953242/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Phil. 4:7</a>, <em>NW</em>) It was because of this soothing, assuring, precious gift of peace, one that “excels all thought”, that Bible writers, supporters and proclaimers could say they were free even though they were languishing away in some filthy prison or exiled on some island for proclaiming its truth. It is this same peace that made them stand fearless before rulers and kings and in the face of death without wavering. This peace comes from knowing the truth of God’s Word, the Bible.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>FREEDOM TODAY</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">This same peace exists in the hearts of those who know the truth of God’s Word today, when men’s hearts are failing them for fear and the end of all things seems to be at hand. This truth with peace that “excels all thought” is still gathered from the same source, the Bible. It continues to make free.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">There is great need for Bible truth at this time, because truth is no longer accepted as such. Scientific theory, political philosophy and false religious traditions are the recognized authorities in the field of knowledge. Bible truth has been shelved as fiction. But men’s ways have not brought enlightenment; instead, darkness has settled over the whole earth. True to the prophet Job’s words, men “meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night”. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953242/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 5:14</a>) And as Isaiah stated: “Darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953242/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isa. 60:2</a>) Mankind’s groping in this mental darkness has caused great unrest and fear. Their only way out is God’s prescribed way, the Bible. They must recognize it to be the Word of God, study it in order to ascertain his direction, and remain in his direction until freedom is ultimately won. There are no short cuts. There is no other way out from this human impasse.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">But just how does the Bible free one who has been both mentally and physically enslaved to this world? By extending hope to such a one with its truthful message. “For all the things that were written aforetime were written for our instruction, that through our endurance and through the <span id="page203" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="203" data-before-text="203"></span>comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953242/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rom. 15:4</a>, <em>NW</em>) This hope is about the incoming new world of righteousness, wherein righteousness is to dwell. It is concerning God’s kingdom rule that is to do away with sickness, wars and death. A student of God’s Word is greatly relieved when he reads such promises as: “And he [God] will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be any more. The former things have passed away”; (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953242/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Rev. 21:4</a>, <em>NW</em>) and, “He shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.” And when he reads promises about mankind’s not laboring in vain, nor bringing forth for trouble; about this earth’s being made a glorious footstool under God’s feet; about people’s living on earth forever, never dying, but instead living in perfect health under a perfect government, such Bible truths energize the hearts of the righteous, creating hope and vision, freeing them from the darkness of this present old world and its dismal outlook to a new look that is a vision of the incoming new world with its attending blessings. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953242/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isa. 2:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953242/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 33:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1953242/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 2 Pet. 3:13</a>) This truth has a wholesome effect. Bible truth also frees in another way.</p>

<strong>What Does It Take to Make You Happy?</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>Accepting Divine Reproof</strong></p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Counsel, even reproof, is welcome when given in a spirit of love by a true friend. A professed friend of God’s servant Job once self-righteously told him: “Happy is the man whom God reproves.” Although the statement is true, what Eliphaz implied by these words​—that Job was guilty of serious wrongdoing—​was not true. What a ‘troublesome comforter’! When, though, Jehovah later reproved Job in a loving way, Job humbly accepted the reproof and put himself in the way of greater happiness.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993404/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Job 5:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993404/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 16:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993404/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 42:6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1993404/14/3" data-bid="15-4" class="b"> 10-17</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Today, God does not speak to his servants directly as he did to Job. Instead, he reproves them by means of his Word and his spirit-directed organization. Christians who pursue materialistic interests, however, often have neither the time, the strength, nor the inclination to study the Bible regularly and attend all the meetings Jehovah’s organization provides.</p>

<strong>Wheat</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The plant itself, when young, resembles grass and is bright green. Mature wheat, however, may measure from two to five feet (.6 to 1.5 meters) in height and is golden brown. Its leaves are long and slender, and the central stem terminates in a head of kernels. <span id="page1653" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1653" data-before-text="1653"></span>One variety of wheat cultivated in Egypt of old, and still encountered there, has several ears per stalk. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014493/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 41:22, 23</a>.) The varieties of wheat that have been commonly cultivated in Palestine in more recent years, and likely also in Bible times, are bearded, that is, having coarse, prickly hairs on the husks of the kernels.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">True to God’s promise, the Israelites found Palestine to be a land of wheat and barley. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014493/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Deut. 8:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014493/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 32:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014493/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Ps. 81:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014493/7/3" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> 147:14</a>) Not only did they have enough for themselves but they also were able to export grain. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014493/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Chron. 2:8-10,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014493/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 15</a>) In Ezekiel’s time, commodities from Judah and Israel, including “wheat of Minnith,” were being traded in Tyre.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014493/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ezek. 27:17</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Wheat was sown in Palestine about the same time as the barley, in the month of Bul (October-November), after the early fall rains had sufficiently softened the soil for plowing.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014493/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ex. 34:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014493/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Lev. 23:17</a>) After the wheat was threshed, winnowed and sifted, it was often stored in underground pits, a practice perhaps alluded to at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014493/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Jeremiah 41:8</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The Bible also makes illustrative reference to wheat.
