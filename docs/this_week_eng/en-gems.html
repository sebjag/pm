<strong>Thank Jehovah for His Loving-kindness</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> All the examples of loving-kindness expressed by humans are small indeed when compared to that of the One whose friendship is to be sought after and treasured above all others. To that One the psalmist sang: “O give thanks to Jehovah, you people, for he is good; for his loving-kindness is to time indefinite.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977125/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 107:1</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><span id="page113" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="113" data-before-text="113"></span><strong>A PRECIOUS QUALITY</strong></p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu">4, 5. (a) What is implied by the expression “loving-kindness”? (b) How is loving-kindness a mark of Jehovah? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977125/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ps. 86:15</a>)</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> What is this “loving-kindness” of Jehovah that is spoken of in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977125/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 107</a>? This quality involves love that takes an active interest in others. “Loving-kindness” translates the Hebrew word <em>hheʹsedh,</em> which carries the idea of kindness or regard motivated by love. But more is involved. Professor R. E. Perry observes that <em>hheʹsedh</em> “signifies an attitude of either God or man born out of mutual relationship,” and it “denotes ‘kindness’ or ‘help’ received from a superior. . . . The principal connotation of [<em>hheʹsedh</em>] is ‘loyal love.’” So there is fidelity involved in God’s loving-kindness. Thus the <em>Revised Standard Version</em> presents Solomon as speaking of God’s having “shown great and <em>steadfast love</em> [or, “loving-kindness”] to David my father.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977125/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Chron. 1:8</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977125/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Samuel 9:1-7</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Jehovah’s loving-kindness, then, is not a casual thing such as the favor of a capricious human king might be. Rather, there is solidarity and loyalty inherent in it. This quality is precious to Jehovah, something that he delights to display, particularly toward faithful individuals. It should also be precious to those who receive of it. Well could David write: “How precious your loving-kindness is, O God! And in the shadow of your wings the sons of men themselves take refuge.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977125/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 36:7</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 6. Why do we need to examine ourselves in relation to Jehovah’s loving-kindness?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> A fundamental law of the physical universe is that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. However, this is not automatically the case in spiritual matters. Each of us can ask: What is my reaction to God’s displays of loving-kindness? Many might find that question hard to answer, for the expression “loving-kindness” may seem rather abstract. Have you, though, ever reflected on concrete examples of how you have been affected by God’s loving-kindness? Doing this may greatly increase your appreciation for this loving-kindness, drawing you closer to him.</p>

Earth’s abounding wealth will be used, not for “space age” armaments or the conquest of space, but for subduing the earth and enriching it as man’s eternal home. Mankind will enjoy the fullness of mental and physical vigor, and he will make use of his powers to the praise of his Creator and for the upbuilding of his fellow man. Everyone will have an assigned field of endeavor and will be a master in that field, finding zest and enjoyment in the accomplishment <span id="page110" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="110" data-before-text="110"></span>of superlative workmanship. No sweat-house drudgery in Jehovah’s new world! Talented workers will construct homes of exquisite loveliness. The monumental wonders of nature will be supplemented by human artistry, as godly man tills and plants, transforming the entire globe into one breath-taking, beauteous landscape. Treasure upon treasure of divine wisdom will be revealed, as perfect man’s richly endowed mind pursues scientific studies for a peaceful purpose and to God’s glory.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 104:24,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 31</a>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 4.

Rejoice in the knowledge of God’s promises and hold fast your joy, for everlasting life! What a thrilling prospect! It should cause all mankind to exclaim with the psalmist: “O let people laud Jehovah for his loving-kindness and for his wonderful works to the sons of men.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 107:8</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>STUDY TO FIND LIFE</strong></p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 5. Why is continued, diligent study a necessity for all in the New World society today?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> All who love life and who desire the abundant life of God’s new world must study to know and obey the Word of God. This means diligent study, first to gain accurate knowledge of Jehovah’s purposes, and then to retain and build on that knowledge while one is advancing to Christian maturity. Let no one ever slow down on his theocratic studies! Even when the early Christians were “firmly set in the truth,” Peter found it necessary to keep ‘rousing them up by way of reminding them.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Pet. 1:12-15</a>) Review and further study is just as important today—even more important, as the Devil is now preparing his last-ditch attack against the New World society. Now, of all times, is the time to “pay more than the usual attention to the things heard by us, that we may never drift away.” To the anointed Christians Paul says: “For we actually become partakers of the Christ only if we make fast our hold on the confidence we had at the beginning firm to the end.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Heb. 2:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 3:14</a>) The same principle applies to all men of good will who seek life in the paradise earth.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 6. What profit results from daily study?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Keep drinking at the fountain of Bible truth! As Jesus promises: “Whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never get thirsty at all, but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water bubbling up to impart everlasting life.” The sayings of Jesus are ‘spirit and life.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 4:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 6:63</a>) The entire Word of God “is alive and exerts power.” “Read in it day and night,” so that you may find treasures of wisdom and discernment, and hold them fast for everlasting life. “Happy is the man that has found wisdom, and the man that gets discernment, for the gaining of it is better than the gaining of silver and the produce of it even than gold. It is more precious than corals, and all other delights of yours cannot be made equal to it. Length of days is in its right hand; in its left hand there are riches and glory. Its ways are ways of pleasantness, and all its roadways are peace. It is a tree of life to those taking hold of it, and those keeping fast hold of it are to be called happy.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Josh. 1:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/10/2" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> Prov. 3:13-18</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 7.

That “someone” is “the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan, who is misleading the entire inhabited earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rev. 12:9</a>) He it is who oversowed “weeds” of sectarianism <span id="page111" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="111" data-before-text="111"></span>in the true religion of life. His subtle ways are further described by Jesus Christ in his parable recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 8:4-15</a>. As the Great Sower sows the “right seed,” “the word of God,” receptive hearts “receive the word with joy.” However, the Devil tries to prevent the seed’s taking root, or he tries to choke it off before it grows into “a tree of life.” All who are desirous of holding fast to their initial joy must cultivate the good soil of their hearts by forming regular habits of study. They must resist the heat of old-world opposition that might dry up the tender plant of their newborn faith. In trial, and even in persecution, they must keep the vision of Jehovah’s glorious promises shining brightly before their eyes, so that they may never, never stray from the radiant path that it lights before them. They must study to participate in the conquest of faith. “Everything that has been born from God conquers the world. And this is the conquest that has conquered the world, our faith.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 John 5:4</a>.</p>

<strong>Do Not Resist Jehovah’s Counsel</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> The sort of persons that Jehovah wants in his new order are those who love him and who strive to obey him. These will not resist the counsel he gives through his Word and organization. They will not endanger their spirituality by trying to retard the advancement of his organization. Speaking about those who become disgruntled at counsel they receive and who turn from the organization or who turn from it because of advancing changes it makes, the apostle John says: “They went out from us, but they were not of our sort; for if they had been of our sort, they would have remained with us. But they <span id="page434" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="434" data-before-text="434"></span>went out that it might be shown up that not all are of our sort.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965523/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 John 2:19</a>) If they had been real lovers of Jehovah, they would have stayed close to his organization, permitting nothing to separate them from it.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">18. (a) Why is it wrong to argue against Jehovah’s counsel? (b) What, instead, should a person do?</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Another way Jehovah can be resisted is to argue against his counsel. A person may make a mistake or do something that is out of harmony with Jehovah’s Word. When it is brought to his attention and he strives to justify himself instead of admitting the obvious wrong, he is resisting Jehovah’s counsel. He is not humbling himself and acknowledging that he erred. He should confess his wrongdoing, especially when confronted with it by a judicial committee of the congregation that is investigating his conduct. We are told at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965523/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">James 5:16</a>: “Openly confess your sins to one another.” When sins are confessed, a person is not justifying what he did. To do so would be resisting what Jehovah has said is right and wrong.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">19, 20. How can a person resist Jehovah’s counsel without openly opposing it? Give examples of how this can be done.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> A person might not come right out and openly argue against Jehovah’s counsel, but he might resist it in another way, and that is by refusing to act on it. God counsels us on our daily living, for example, telling us to show love by being long-suffering, by not behaving indecently, by not looking out for our own interests, by not keeping account of injury. Do we heed that counsel? Or do we ignore it and thus resist it? His organization counsels us on the disciplining of our children, on our personal Bible study and on our doing secular work that is not compatible with being a pursuer of peace. Do we heed this counsel by applying it in our daily living? That was the reason why it was given. It does not benefit us if we ignore it.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> At times the organization will give counsel on avoiding wrong associations, on not marrying persons who are undedicated to God, on repeatedly coming late to congregational meetings, on regularity in the Christian ministry, and so on. Ignoring such counsel by not acting on it is just as much a resistance of Jehovah’s counsel as is arguing against it. That is what King Jeroboam did.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">21, 22. (a) Explain how Jeroboam resisted Jehovah’s counsel. (b) What was the attitude of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah toward Jehovah’s counsel, and how did Jehovah react to it?</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> Counsel was given to Jeroboam before the nation of Israel was split into northern and southern kingdoms. Because he resisted that counsel by not acting on it, he lost out on Jehovah’s blessing. Jehovah told him: “It must occur that, if you obey all that I shall command you, and you do walk in my ways and actually do what is right in my eyes by keeping my statutes and my commandments, just as David my servant did, I will also prove to be with you, and I will build you a lasting house.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965523/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Ki. 11:38</a>) Instead of being blessed, he was rejected by God because he did the opposite of what God told him. Most of the people in those two Israelite kingdoms proved to be like King Jeroboam. They refused to act upon Jehovah’s counsel. “For they had behaved rebelliously against the sayings of God; and the counsel of the Most High they had disrespected.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965523/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ps. 107:11</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> How can Jehovah have love for persons who resist his counsel by arguing against it or by refusing to act upon it? He takes delight in those who strive to do what he instructs them.

<strong>Commissioning of Witnesses in the Time of the End</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span id="page217" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="217" data-before-text="217"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> If, after these 31 years since 1919, Jehovah’s witnesses have not succeeded in winning Christendom to their side, they are not to be blamed and their work is not to be summed up as a failure. In the first century Jesus and his disciples did not win the people of Israel to Christianity; they won only a small percentage, a few thousand. But this does not spell failure for their work, but spells rather the exact fulfillment of Isaiah’s prophecy. Jehovah’s words at the temple sound as if his witnesses must command the people not to understand what they hear and not to perceive what they see; and as if his witnesses are commanded to make the people’s hearts fat, make their ears heavy and shut up or besmear their eyes. But Jehovah does not force the people this way; otherwise, he would be responsible for their dire fate. He merely makes the people hear and see his witnesses in action. Then by his prophecy he foretells the effect of it upon the people or how they will not respond favorably. In support, see how <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951243/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 13:14, 15</a> quotes it. (Page 216, ¶ 9)</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">11. How have the remnant been used to fulfill the commission?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> In the same way the remnant in this time of the end do not force the people of Christendom into this unfeeling, unresponsive spiritual state. What the remnant really do is, not make, but show up the people or prove the people to be just as Jehovah foretold at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951243/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Isaiah 6:9, 10</a>.<a id="footnotesource4" data-fnid="4" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1951243/3">d</a> So today, 31 years after Jehovah’s witnesses were revived and sent forth in 1919, how many people of Christendom see and hear and believe? Not the vast majority, by any means! Nor millions! Failure this? No! But surely cause for discouragement and quitting? Contrariwise, the prophecy of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951243/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isaiah 6:9, 10</a> has proved true. If Jehovah’s witnesses had compromised their message and tickled the people’s ears, they would not have realized the fulfillment of the prophecy toward their witness work.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">12. Had Christendom responded to the message, what would have resulted? But since not, what?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Had Christendom acted favorably upon their testimony she would have turned to Jehovah and his kingdom and had been healed. But today the conditions in Christendom show she has not received divine healing. She is in a most malignantly diseased condition, mentally, morally and spiritually. She faces a destruction and desolation as inescapable as that which came on ancient Jerusalem both in 607 B.C. and A.D. 70. It is not for failure on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses to tell his straightforward message. In sending his witnesses Jehovah had a kindly purpose, namely, to announce the Kingdom of salvation and to give advance warning of the evil to follow a rejection of that kingdom. This shows how vitally important the message we bear is. Rather than be healed by it, Christendom rebels against it and, like the rich man in Haʹdes, she feels tormented by it. Just as to Babylon, we can now say to her: ‘We would have healed Christendom, but she is not healed.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951243/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Jer. 51:9</a>) Doomed as surely as plagued King Uzziah, she hastens away from Jehovah God to her doleful death.</p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">13. Who get the good effect of the message? So what do they do?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> All the same, the message does have a good effect too, just as it is written: “He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951243/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 107:20</a>) The spiritual remnant themselves have been affected by the Word this way, and now, too, a great flock of “other sheep” <span id="page218" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="218" data-before-text="218"></span>of the Right Shepherd. With softened hearts they receive the message proclaimed by the witnesses. They let it sink deep into open ears of understanding, and with eyes of faith they see how Jehovah is using his witnesses to accomplish his work. So they abandon doomed Christendom, turn to Jehovah and associate with the theocratic organization of His witnesses and get healed.</p>

<strong>The More Important Healing</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> “For thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are broken down to make a defence against the mounds and against the sword; while men come to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in my wrath, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city: Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them; and I will reveal unto them abundance of peace and truth. And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, <span id="page303" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="303" data-before-text="303"></span>and will build them, as at the first. And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned against me, and whereby they have transgressed against me. And this city shall be to me for a name of joy, for a praise and for a glory, before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them, and shall fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that I procure unto it.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951362/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jer. 33:1-9</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu">11. How did the remnant come into a condition needing healing?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> During the years of the first world war, 1914 to 1918, the remnant of spiritual Israel came under Jehovah’s displeasure. His kingdom by his Christ had been born in the heavens in 1914, at the end of the “appointed times of the nations” that year; but, under the great stress of persecution, oppression and international opposition during those war years reaching a climax in 1918, God’s anointed witnesses failed and their organization experienced a breakup and they came under captivity to the world system of modern Babylon. But from 1919 on they came to a realization of their spiritual condition. They appealed for some divine restorative remedy. Their appeal was well worded by Jeremiah who foretold the captivity of spiritual Israel: “Heal me, O Jehovah, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved: for thou art my praise. Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of Jehovah? let it come now. As for me, I have not hastened from being a shepherd after thee.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951362/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jer. 17:14-16</a>, <em>AS</em>) The hearts of the remnant were broken because of God’s apparent disfavor and because, through fear and improper understanding, they had been forced out of his service.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu">12. How did he heal and revitalize the remnant? With what response?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> God heard the prayer of his repentant, brokenhearted remnant. He regathered them, repaired the breaches of their organization and reorganized them for more effective service than ever. He built them up on earth as the visible theocratic organization to represent his heavenly Jerusalem which was now radiant with Kingdom glory. Here, not physical cure of fleshly organisms, but spiritual cure of the remnant of his witnesses was needed, to recover them from unclean fear and from religious foolishness. “He sendeth his word, and healeth them, and delivereth them from their destructions.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951362/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 107:17-20</a>, <em>AS</em>) He opened their eyes and ears more fully to get Scriptural understanding. For a time they had been lying as dead under the world’s repressive laws and measures, but now they were revived by God’s spirit. Up they stood and engaged in free and fearless activity as his witnesses to tell all the nations the good news of His kingdom. A spiritual resurrection indeed! (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951362/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rev. 11:7-12</a>) So they were delivered from their captivity and were assembled into an unbreakable unity of faith and action. By all this Scriptural understanding and these joyful service privileges they were greatly comforted. Their tongues were loosed to sing: “Praise ye Jehovah; for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant, and praise is comely. Jehovah doth build up Jerusalem; he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel. He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951362/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 147:1-3</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu">13. So how has Jehovah’s city or organization become a joy, praise and glory before all nations, and with what illumination?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> In this way, by means of this restorative work of mercy to his anointed remnant, the great heavenly Physician performed a modern miracle of spiritual healing. It has astounded Christendom, but has also chagrined her. The restored organization of Jehovah’s people abounds <span id="page304" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="304" data-before-text="304"></span>with the peace, truth and spiritual prosperity with which he has filled it. By activating them in his witness work in all quarters of the earth He has made their organization become a praise and glory for him before all the nations, and the name of “Jehovah’s witnesses” has become a joy to numberless multitudes. For his visible theocratic organization this is a day of brightness amid the thickening gloom and darkness of the worldly nations. They have heavenly light day and night; and the light increases to the illumination of perfect day, the brightness of a week of days all concentrated into one. As it was predicted: “Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that Jehovah bindeth up the hurt of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1951362/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa. 30:26</a>, <em>AS</em>.</p>

Nor does it mean that he is omnipresent in the sense of being literally everywhere and in everything. This can be seen from the fact that Solomon also spoke of Jehovah as hearing “from the heavens, your established place of dwelling,” that is, the heavens of the spirit realm.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">1 Ki. 8:30,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/33/1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 39</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Thus, in the physical sense, the term “heavens” covers a wide range.

Thus, those aboard storm-tossed ships are said to “go up to the heavens, . . . down to the bottoms.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011899/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Ps. 107:26</a>) So, too, the builders of the Tower of Babel intended to put up a structure with its “top in the heavens,” a “skyscraper,” as it were.

Upon the Israelites’ return to their homeland, they entered into a new order of things. Over them there was the governorship of Zerubbabel (a descendant of David), aided by High Priest Joshua, at the city of Jerusalem. Through these individuals, the “heavens,” or the heavenly Sovereign Jehovah God, directed and supervised the subject people.

And they raised their voices and said: ‘Jesus, Instructor, have mercy on us!’ And when he got sight of them he said to them: ‘Go and show yourselves to the priests.’ Then as they were going off their cleansing occurred. One of them, when he saw <span id="page85" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="85" data-before-text="85"></span>he was healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice. And he fell upon his face at Jesus’ feet, thanking him; furthermore, he was a Samaritan. In reply Jesus said: ‘The ten were cleansed, were they not?

We have mentioned but a few. Among the many benefits experienced by Jehovah’s servants are truth, light and appreciation of Jehovah’s purposes. While the world gropes about in spiritual darkness Jehovah’s servants have guidance from his prophetic Word and know what is ahead. So they are not in fear. “Consequently we have the prophetic word made more sure; and you are doing well in paying attention to it as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until day dawns and a daystar rises, in your hearts. For you know this first, that no prophecy of Scripture springs from any private interpretation. For prophecy was at no time brought by man’s will, but men spoke from God as they were borne along by holy spirit.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969084/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">2 Pet. 1:19-21</a>.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">20-22.

When God’s laws are followed, good health results and care is taken of the body God has given. Also, by obeying what is right, there is a good conscience; there is improvement in family relationships. The importance of being separate from this system of things is made clear. All of this depends upon the use of God’s Word. It is a protection against getting involved in what is wrong. “But solid food belongs to mature people, to those who through use have their perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969084/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Heb. 5:14</a>) Those who do have appreciation of their spiritual needs gain happiness, as Jesus put it in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969084/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Matthew 5:3</a>.

<strong>Moab</strong><br/><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Later, when David himself ruled as king, there also was warfare between Israel and Moab. The Moabites were completely subdued and were made to pay tribute to David. Apparently at the end of the conflict two thirds of Moab’s fighting men were put to death. It seems that David had them lie down on the ground in a row and then measured this row to determine the two thirds to be put to death and the one third to be preserved alive. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">2Sa 8:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/42/1" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 11, 12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/42/2" data-bid="43-3" class="b"> 1Ch 18:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/42/3" data-bid="43-4" class="b"> 11</a>) Possibly in the course of the same conflict, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada “struck down the two sons of Ariel of Moab.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">2Sa 23:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/43/1" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> 1Ch 11:22</a>) David’s decisive victory over the Moabites was a fulfillment of Balaam’s prophetic words uttered over 400 years earlier: “A star will certainly step forth out of Jacob, and a scepter will indeed rise out of Israel. And he will certainly break apart the temples of Moab’s head and the cranium of all the sons of tumult of war.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Nu 24:17</a>) Also apparently with reference to this victory, the psalmist spoke of God’s regarding Moab as his “washing pot.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Ps 60:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003097/45/1" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> 108:9</a>.</p>

<strong>Sandal</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">By the expression “over Edom I shall throw my sandal” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003830/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps 60:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003830/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 108:9</a>) Jehovah may have meant that Edom would be brought under subjection. It possibly had reference to the custom of indicating the taking of possession by throwing one’s sandal on a piece of land. Or, it could have indicated contempt for Edom, since Moab is called “my washing pot” in the same text. In the Middle East today, throwing the sandal is a gesture of contempt.</p>

Following their God-given victories over this ruler and also King Og of Bashan, the Israelites encamped on the desert plains of Moab.

Although making no claim to the former Moabite territory taken by the Israelites from the Amorites, Balak did fear for his realm. He therefore consulted with the older men of Midian and then sent messengers, older men of both Moab and Midian, to hire the prophet Balaam to come and curse Israel.

Israel’s subservience to Moab continued for eighteen years until Ehud, a left-handed Benjamite, killed King Eglon while having a private audience with him. Ehud then led the Israelites against Moab, striking down about 10,000 Moabites and subduing them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Judg. 3:14-30</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">In this general period, when famine affected Judah, Elimelech, with his wife Naomi and their two sons, Mahlon and Chilion, emigrated to the more fertile land of Moab. There the sons married Moabite women, Orpah and Ruth. After the death of the three men in Moab and improvement of conditions in Israel, Naomi, accompanied by Ruth, returned to Bethlehem. There Boaz, a kinsman of Elimelech, married Ruth, who had abandoned the polytheism of the Moabites and had become a worshiper of Jehovah.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/41/0" data-bid="42-1" class="b">2 Sam. 8:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/41/1" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> 11, 12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/41/2" data-bid="42-3" class="b"> 1 Chron. 18:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/41/3" data-bid="42-4" class="b"> 11</a>) Possibly in the course of the same conflict, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada “struck down the two sons of Ariel of Moab.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">2 Sam. 23:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/42/1" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 11:22</a>) David’s decisive victory over the Moabites fulfilled Balaam’s prophetic words uttered over 400 years earlier: “A star will certainly step forth out of Jacob, and a scepter will indeed rise out of Israel. And he will certainly break apart the temples of Moab’s head and the cranium of all the sons of tumult of war.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Num. 24:17</a>) Also apparently with reference to this victory, the psalmist spoke of God’s regarding Moab as his “washing pot.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Ps. 60:8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/44/1" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> 108:9</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">David’s son Solomon, however, disregarded God’s law and married Moabite women who had not become worshipers of Jehovah. To please them Solomon built a high place to their god Chemosh. Not until some three centuries later, during Josiah’s reign, was this high place made unfit for worship.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">1 Ki. 11:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/45/1" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> 7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/45/2" data-bid="46-3" class="b"> 2 Ki. 23:13</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong><em>After the division of the kingdom until the Judean exile</em></strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Sometime after the secession of Israel from Judah the Moabites appear to have regained territory N of the Arnon. On the black basalt stele known as the Moabite Stone, Moab’s King Mesha speaks of Israel’s King Omri as taking possession of the region of Medeba. Since the tableland of Medeba was in the territory of Reuben (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Josh. 13:15, 16</a>), Israel had apparently lost this area to the Moabites so that Omri later had to recapture it.</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Evidently Moab remained under Israelite control during the reigns of Kings Omri and Ahab. But following the death of Ahab, Moab’s King Mesha, who “paid to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs and a hundred thousand unshorn male sheep,” revolted. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">2 Ki. 1:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/47/1" data-bid="48-2" class="b"> 3:4, 5</a>) The Moabite Stone memorializes this revolt. If correctly identified as being the same places mentioned in the Bible, eleven of the cities that King Mesha claims as subject to or captured or (re)built by him were definitely in Israelite territory N of the Arnon. These cities are Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, Kiriathaim, Nebo, Baal-meon (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Num. 32:34,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/48/1" data-bid="49-2" class="b"> 37, 38</a>), Medeba, Bamoth-baal, Beth-baal-meon, Jahaz (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/49/0" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Josh. 13:9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/49/1" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> 17-19</a>) and Bezer.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/50/0" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Josh. 20:8</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Unlike Mesha’s propagandistic inscription, the Scriptures report that the Moabites suffered humiliating defeat. Enlisting the aid of King Jehoshaphat of Judah and the king of Edom in putting down the Moabite revolt, Jehoram (who became king of Israel about two years after Ahab’s death) marched against Moab from the S, by way of the wilderness of Edom. But the allied armies and their animals almost perished for lack of water. The prophet Elisha’s aid was then sought and, in fulfillment of his prophecy that Jehovah would help on account of Jehoshaphat, the torrent valley became filled with water. The next morning the reflection of the sun upon the water made it look like blood to the Moabites. Wrongly concluding that the allied armies had slaughtered one another, the Moabites abandoned all caution and came to the Israelite camp, only to be put to flight. As the <span id="page1171" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1171" data-before-text="1171"></span>battle progressed Moabite cities were ruined, good tracts of land were filled with stones, trees were cut down and springs were stopped up. When King Mesha found himself penned up in the city of Kir-hareseth with the battle going against him, he, with seven hundred men, unsuccessfully tried to break through to the king of Edom. Finally he took his firstborn son and offered him up as a burnt sacrifice upon the wall. For this or some other reason there “came to be great indignation against Israel” and the siege was abandoned.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013028/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">2 Ki. 3:6-27</a>.</p>

<strong>Sanctuary</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The members of the Christian congregation, Christ’s body’ constitute a temple or sanctuary. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013739/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013739/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Eph. 2:21, 22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013739/17/2" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 1 Pet. 2:5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013739/17/3" data-bid="18-4" class="b"> 9</a>) This provides a basis for understanding the words directed to the apostle John: “Get up and measure the temple sanctuary of God and the altar and those worshiping in it. But as for the courtyard that is outside the temple sanctuary, cast it clear out and do not measure it, because it has been given to the nations, and they will trample the holy city underfoot for forty-two months.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013739/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Rev. 11:1, 2</a>) The temple here referred to could not be the one at Jerusalem, for that structure had been <span id="page1446" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1446" data-before-text="1446"></span>destroyed nearly three decades earlier. Being earthly, the nations could only be “given” a courtyard that was likewise on earth. Since this courtyard is associated with God’s sanctuary, it could reasonably represent prospective members of the heavenly sanctuary, those still on earth. Whereas it would be impossible for the nations to trample upon a location in the heavens, they could trample upon persons who were in line to receive a heavenly inheritance as members of Christ’s body, persons who were due to become ‘pillars in the temple of God.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013739/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Rev. 3:12</a>) Similarly, Daniel’s prophecy regarding the throwing down of the established place of the sanctuary (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013739/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Dan. 8:11</a>) and the profaning of the sanctuary (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013739/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Dan. 11:31</a>) appears to point to events in connection with those in line for membership in God’s spiritual temple.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Seed</strong><br/><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="sb">This spirit in them operates to generate a new birth as God’s sons. It is a force for cleanness, and produces the fruitage of the spirit, not the corrupt works of the flesh. The one having this reproductive seed in himself will therefore not follow a course of practicing the works of the flesh. The apostle Paul comments on this matter: “For God called us, not with allowance for <span id="page1467" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1467" data-before-text="1467"></span>uncleanness, but in connection with sanctification. So, then, the man that shows disregard is disregarding, not man, but God, who puts his holy spirit in you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013791/60/0" data-bid="61-1" class="b">1 Thess. 4:7, 8</a>.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sb">However, one of these spirit-begotten ones who constantly resists the spirit or ‘grieves’ it, ‘saddens’ it, ‘hurts’ it, will eventually cause God to withdraw his spirit.
