<strong>Bethzatha</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The location of the pool is indicated by the evident reference to the “sheepgate” (although in the original Greek the word “gate” must be supplied), which gate is generally held to have been in the north part of Jerusalem. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000716/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Nehemiah 3:1</a> shows that this gate was built by the priests, and hence it is assumed to have been an entrance near the temple area. Additionally, the name Bethzatha is associated with the section of ancient Jerusalem called Bezetha, located to the north of the temple area. In Jesus’ day this sector lay outside the city walls, but Herod Agrippa I (who died 44 C.E.) added a third northern wall to the city during the rule of Claudius (41-54 C.E.), and this placed Bezetha within the city walls, so that John could properly speak of the pool as being “in Jerusalem,” as he had known the city before its destruction in 70 C.E.</p>

<strong>Gate, Gateway</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><strong><em>Sheep Gate.</em></strong> The Sheep Gate was rebuilt by Eliashib the high priest and associate priests. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/47/0" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Ne 3:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/47/1" data-bid="48-2" class="b"> 32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/47/2" data-bid="48-3" class="b"> 12:39</a>) This fact would indicate that it was near the temple area. Its location was probably in the wall of the second quarter, the part built by Manasseh (see “Fish Gate” below), at or near the NE corner of the city. This gate may have been so named because through it were brought sheep and goats for sacrifice or perhaps for a market that was located nearby. “The sheepgate” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">John 5:2</a> is likely this Sheep Gate or a later gate corresponding to it, for it was located in the same vicinity, near the pool of Bethzatha.</p>

<strong>Tower</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>Jerusalem’s Towers.</strong> The <em>Tower of the Bake Ovens</em> was located on the NW side of the city near or at the Corner Gate.

It may have been one of the towers built by Uzziah, who reigned in Jerusalem from 829 to 778 B.C.E.

<strong>Beth-shittah</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A town mentioned in describing the line of flight followed by the Midianites after their rout in the low plain of Jezreel by Judge Gideon.

<strong>Gate, Gateway</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span id="page624" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="624" data-before-text="624"></span>The doors of the gates of a city were usually of wood sheathed with metal plating; otherwise they could be set on fire by the enemy. Some may have been made of iron, as was the case in the days of the apostles. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 12:10</a>) Babylon’s gateways are said to have had doors of copper and bars of iron. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isa. 45:2</a>; compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 107:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 16</a>.) Some gates were apparently locked with wooden bars.

Samson’s feat of picking up the doors of the gate of Gaza along with its two side posts and bar and carrying them to the top of “the mountain that is in front of Hebron” was, in view of these factors, no mean accomplishment. It was done, of course, through the energizing power of Jehovah’s spirit.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Judg. 16:3</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>FUNCTION</strong></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The “gates” of a city could refer to the city itself, since much of the official business took place there and transactions were recorded there (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Deut. 16:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/14/2" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> Ruth 4:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/14/3" data-bid="15-4" class="b"> Ps. 87:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/14/4" data-bid="15-5" class="b"> 122:2</a>), or, in the capital, at the gateway of the palace grounds.

Once controlling them, they would have access to the city. And so, to ‘get possession of the gates’ of the city meant to take the city.

We shall concern ourselves here mainly with the gates mentioned in the book of Nehemiah, which gives us the most complete description or listing. The gates named in Nehemiah’s record are gates in the wall that was built prior to the eighth century B.C.E. and in the wall surrounding the “second quarter.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">2 Ki. 22:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/42/1" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 34:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/42/2" data-bid="43-3" class="b"> Zeph. 1:10</a>) The “second quarter” was a part of the city bounded on the W and part of the N by Hezekiah’s wall (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:5</a>) and joined by Manasseh’s wall, which continued on the NE and E.

We shall follow this procedure in our listing below, inserting the gates not mentioned in the reconstruction account but named in the description of the inauguration procession (chap. 12), along with gates spoken of in other scriptures, some of which are merely other names for those in Nehemiah’s record.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong><em>Sheep Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The Sheep Gate was rebuilt by Eliashib the high priest and associate priests.

Its location was probably in the N wall of the second quarter, the part built by Manasseh (see “Fish Gate,” below), at or near the NE corner of the city. This gate may have been so named because through it were brought sheep and goats for sacrifice or perhaps for a market that was located nearby. It may also have been called the “Gate of Benjamin” (which see). The “sheepgate” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">John 5:2</a> is likely this Sheep Gate or a later gate corresponding to it, for it was located in the same vicinity, near the pool Bethzatha.</p>

<strong>Gate, Gateway</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Gates were the centers of public assembly and public life. Broad places, such as the public square before the Water Gate in Jerusalem, were usually provided near the gates.

So the gate was the place for meeting others.

Hence this would allow for the above-suggested identity of the First Gate with the Gate of the Old City. Others would connect the Gate of the Old City with the “Middle Gate” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Jeremiah 39:3</a>.</p>

However, note that the Bishop says that the omission of the definite article <em>the</em> before the Greek word <em>theós</em> makes the word <em>theós</em> like an adjective that “describes the nature of the Word” rather than identify his person. This fact accounts for it that some translators render it: “And the Word was divine.” That is not the same as saying that the Word was God and was identical with God. One grammarian would translate the passage: “And the Word was deity,” to bring out his view that the Word was not “all of God.”<a id="footnotesource5" data-fnid="5" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1962726/4">e</a> According to trinitarians the Word was only a third of God, a coequal Second Person in a three-in-one God. However, our consideration of all that John has written has proved how false such a teaching is, a teaching that even the trinitarians themselves cannot understand or explain. The Word is the Son of God, not the Second Person of God.</p><p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="qu">66, 67.

<strong>Bake, Baker</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Professional bakers were in business in the cities. While Jeremiah was in custody in the Courtyard of the Guard in Jerusalem during the time of scarcity prior to that city’s overthrow in 607 B.C.E., he was given a daily ration of a round loaf of bread “from the street of the bakers,” as long as the supply lasted. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000542/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Jer 37:21</a>) So, commercial bakers evidently occupied a particular street in Jerusalem. Years later, when Jerusalem’s walls were restored under Nehemiah’s supervision, “the Tower of the Bake Ovens” was also repaired. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000542/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ne 3:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000542/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 12:38</a>) Just how the tower came to be named is uncertain, but it is possible that it was given its unusual name because the ovens of commercial bakers were located there.</p>

Uzziah built a tower by this gate; whether or not it was the Tower of the Bake Ovens is not stated. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">2Ch 26:9</a>) Both Jeremiah and Zechariah appear to refer to the Corner Gate as being on the western edge of the city.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/62/0" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Jer 31:38;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/62/1" data-bid="63-2" class="b"> Zec 14:10</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">There is no other gate described as existing in the W wall from the Corner Gate to the Valley Gate in the SW wall, this no doubt being because of the steep slope of the Valley of Hinnom, making any other gate impractical. The Corner Gate does not appear in Nehemiah’s accounts; again the reason may be that it did not need extensive repairs. The account does speak of repairing the Tower of the Bake Ovens, which seems to have been a part of, or near, the Corner Gate.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/63/0" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Ne 3:11</a>.</p>

<strong>Bake, Baker</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Bread was generally baked in ovens in Bible times. (See OVEN.) Occasionally, however, baking was done by kindling a fire on stones that had been laid together. When they were well heated, the cinders were swept aside and dough was placed on the stones. After a while, the cake was turned and then left on the stones until the bread was thoroughly baked. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010540/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hos. 7:8</a>) Travelers might bake coarse bread in a shallow pit filled with hot pebbles, upon which a fire had been built. After the embers were removed, dough was laid on the heated stones, perhaps being turned several times while the bread was baking. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010540/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Ki. 19:6</a>) <span id="page182" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="182" data-before-text="182"></span>Bedouins still bake bread in this way, or do so on a heated iron disk, the Arabic <em>sadj.</em></p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Grain offerings made by the Israelites were often “something baked in the oven,” came “from off the griddle,” or from “out of the deep-fat kettle.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010540/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Lev. 2:4-7</a>) The griddle was a thick pottery plate having depressions (comparable to a modern waffle iron), though iron griddles were also used.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010540/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezek. 4:3</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Professional bakers were in business in the cities. While Jeremiah was in custody in the Courtyard of the Guard in Jerusalem during the time of scarcity prior to that city’s overthrow in 607 B.C.E., he was given a daily ration of a round loaf of bread “from the street of the bakers,” as long as the supply lasted. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010540/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jer. 37:21</a>) So, commercial bakers evidently occupied a particular street in Jerusalem. Years later, when Jerusalem’s walls were restored under Nehemiah’s supervision, the “Tower of the Bake Ovens” was also repaired. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010540/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Neh. 3:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010540/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 12:38</a>) Just how the tower came to be named is uncertain, but it is possible that it was given its unusual name because the ovens of commercial bakers were located there.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In modern times, the professional Oriental baker does not customarily prepare the dough. Instead, it is made by the house baker and is then sent to the public baker. So it is not uncommon to observe the baker’s boy walking along with trays of freshly baked bread balanced on his head, delivering the bread to customers’ homes. In Bible times, too, the professional baker may often have baked the dough (and even meat and vegetables) brought to him. After removing the bread or cakes from his oven with a long shovel, the baker at times greased them. The fine quality of bread baked in the larger oven of the Oriental commercial baker seems to be indicated by this proverb of the Arabs: “Send your bread to the oven of the baker, though he should eat the half of it.”</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Bakers in ancient Egypt had to render to the overseer of granaries strict accounts of the materials they had in stock. The Greek historian Herodotus of the fifth century B.C.E. spent some time in Egypt and provides a detailed account of Egyptian baking processes. He says the Egyptians kneaded bread with their feet, a procedure confirmed in a wall painting from the tomb of Ramses III.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The royal baker was evidently a man of some importance in ancient Egypt. The above-mentioned wall painting from Ramses III’s tomb in the Valley of the Kings at Thebes depicts an Egyptian royal bakery in full operation, showing such steps as the kneading of dough with the feet, the making of cakes of bread and the preparing of the oven. As reported in Genesis, one Egyptian royal baker gained particular notoriety because he sinned against the king and was cast into prison. There he had a dream in which he saw himself carrying three baskets of bread on his head, with fowls eating from the topmost basket. This “chief of the bakers” was taken out on the third day and “hung up,” thus fulfilling Joseph’s interpretation: “The three baskets are three days. In three days from now Pharaoh will lift up your head from off you and will certainly hang you upon a stake; and the fowls will certainly eat your flesh from off you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010540/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Gen. 40:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200010540/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 16-22</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Gate, Gateway</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The Gate of the Old City was located on the NW side of the city between the Fish Gate and the Gate of Ephraim. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Neh. 3:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/51/1" data-bid="52-2" class="b"> 12:39</a>) In Hebrew, the gate is called simply “Gate of the Old,” the word “city” being supplied by some translators. It is suggested that the name was derived from its having been the main N entrance to the old city. It may have been at the junction of the Broad Wall (that formed a N boundary of the old city) and the S end of the W wall of the second quarter. Some think that this gate is identical with the “First Gate” mentioned by Zechariah. He seemingly refers to the E-W limits of the city in saying “from [1] the gate of Benjamin <span id="page626" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="626" data-before-text="626"></span>all the way to the place of [2] the First Gate, all the way to [3] the Corner Gate,” and to the N-S limits in saying “from the Tower of Hananel all the way to the press vats of the king.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Zech. 14:10</a>) If so, this places the First Gate E of the Corner Gate, possibly naming, from E to W, (1) the gate in or near the E corner, (2) the gate at the angle where the walls of the second quarter and the old city meet, and (3) the gate in the NW corner of the old city wall. Hence this would allow for the above-suggested identity of the First Gate with the Gate of the Old City.

The Corner Gate does not appear in Nehemiah’s accounts; again the reason may be that it did not need extensive repairs. The account does speak of repairing the Tower of the Bake Ovens, which seems to have been a part of, or near, the Corner Gate.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Neh. 3:11</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="ss"><strong><em>Valley Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">At the SW corner of the city wall, the Valley Gate led to the Valley of Hinnom, and corresponds to the modern Jaffa Gate. Josephus’ “Gate of the Essenes” may have been located here or nearby. Uzziah, in his city-fortification program, built a tower by this gate.

Also, there may have been a potter’s industry near this gate, for there was clay nearby in the Valley of Hinnom as well as a water supply at the mouth of the Tyropean valley and at the spring En-rogel. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/70/0" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Jeremiah 18:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/70/1" data-bid="71-2" class="b"> 19:1, 2</a>.)

Probably it was at the S tip of the E hill of the city (that is, at the southern end of the “City of David”).

This gate was near Ophel, not far from the Temple area. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/73/0" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Neh. 3:26</a>) The Water Gate was where one of the groups of the inauguration procession left the wall, proceeding from there to the Temple, where they assembled with the other group, apparently not traversing that part of the city wall to the E of the Temple.

They reach this conclusion from the account of Athaliah’s execution, which reports that, on being led out of the Temple by the soldiers, “she came to the entry of the horse gate of the king’s house.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/77/0" data-bid="78-1" class="b">2 Chron. 23:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/77/1" data-bid="78-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 11:16</a>) However, this was likely an entry just to the precincts of the royal palace and not the Horse Gate through which the horses passed in and out of the city itself. Nehemiah definitely includes the Horse Gate in his reconstruction description, indicating that it was a gate in the city wall. It was probably located near the SE corner of the Temple-palace area.

<strong>Gate, Gateway</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The Gate of the Old City was located on the NW side of the city between the Fish Gate and the Gate of Ephraim. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Neh. 3:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/51/1" data-bid="52-2" class="b"> 12:39</a>) In Hebrew, the gate is called simply “Gate of the Old,” the word “city” being supplied by some translators. It is suggested that the name was derived from its having been the main N entrance to the old city. It may have been at the junction of the Broad Wall (that formed a N boundary of the old city) and the S end of the W wall of the second quarter. Some think that this gate is identical with the “First Gate” mentioned by Zechariah. He seemingly refers to the E-W limits of the city in saying “from [1] the gate of Benjamin <span id="page626" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="626" data-before-text="626"></span>all the way to the place of [2] the First Gate, all the way to [3] the Corner Gate,” and to the N-S limits in saying “from the Tower of Hananel all the way to the press vats of the king.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Zech. 14:10</a>) If so, this places the First Gate E of the Corner Gate, possibly naming, from E to W, (1) the gate in or near the E corner, (2) the gate at the angle where the walls of the second quarter and the old city meet, and (3) the gate in the NW corner of the old city wall. Hence this would allow for the above-suggested identity of the First Gate with the Gate of the Old City. Others would connect the Gate of the Old City with the “Middle Gate” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Jeremiah 39:3</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong><em>Gate of Ephraim</em></strong></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">The Gate of Ephraim was located in the Broad Wall 400 cubits (c. 583 feet [c. 178 meters]) E of the Corner Gate.

It, too, has been identified by some researchers with the Middle Gate (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Jer. 39:3</a>), by others with the First Gate.

There was a public square near the Gate of Ephraim, in which the people made booths to celebrate the Festival of Booths in Nehemiah’s time. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Neh. 8:16</a>) This gate is not named in Nehemiah’s reconstruction text, evidently because it did not need extensive repairs.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="ss"><strong><em>Corner Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">This gate was evidently located in the NW angle of the city wall, 400 cubits (c. 583 feet [c. 178 meters]) along the Broad Wall W of the Gate of Ephraim. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/58/0" data-bid="59-1" class="b">2 Ki. 14:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/58/1" data-bid="59-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 25:23</a>) It was on the E side of the Valley of Hinnom, apparently in the W wall of the old city at the point where it joined the Broad Wall. Uzziah built a tower by this gate; whether or not it was the Tower of the Bake Ovens is not stated. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:9</a>) Both Jeremiah and Zechariah appear to refer to the Corner Gate as being on the western edge of the city. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/60/0" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Jer. 31:38;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/60/1" data-bid="61-2" class="b"> Zech. 14:10</a>) Some think the Corner Gate is the same as the First Gate, but the statement in the book of Zechariah seems to weigh against this view as to its location, for, apparently describing the E-W limits, Zechariah wrote, “from the gate of Benjamin all the way to the place of the First Gate, all the way to the Corner Gate,” thus evidently placing the First Gate E of the Corner Gate.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">There is no other gate described as existing in the W wall from the Corner Gate to the Valley Gate at the S end, this no doubt being because of the steep slope of the Hinnom valley, making any other gate impractical. The Corner Gate does not appear in Nehemiah’s accounts; again the reason may be that it did not need extensive repairs. The account does speak of repairing the Tower of the Bake Ovens, which seems to have been a part of, or near, the Corner Gate.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Neh. 3:11</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="ss"><strong><em>Valley Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">At the SW corner of the city wall, the Valley Gate led to the Valley of Hinnom, and corresponds to the modern Jaffa Gate. Josephus’ “Gate of the Essenes” may have been located here or nearby. Uzziah, in his city-fortification program, built a tower by this gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/62/0" data-bid="63-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:9</a>) It was from the Valley Gate that Nehemiah went out for his inspection of the damaged wall, riding eastward through the Valley of Hinnom and then up the Kidron valley, finally reentering the city by the same gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/63/0" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Neh. 2:13-15</a>) Although not named as such, the Valley Gate appears to be the point at which the inauguration procession started, one group marching counterclockwise around the walls past the Gate of the Ash-heaps and the other clockwise past the Corner Gate and the Tower of the Bake Ovens.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Neh. 12:31-40</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="ss"><strong><em>Gate of the Ash-heaps</em></strong></p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">This gate is also known as the <em>Gate of the Potsherds,</em> and is usually called the <em>Dung Gate</em>. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/65/0" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Neh. 2:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/65/1" data-bid="66-2" class="b"> 12:31</a>) Nehemiah’s description seems to place it 1,000 cubits (c. 1,458 feet [c. 444 meters]) E of the Valley Gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/66/0" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Neh. 3:13, 14</a>) It was at the SE corner of the city wall, and led to the Valley of Hinnom near the point where it joined the Tyropean valley. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/67/0" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Jer. 19:2</a>) It was from this gate that Topheth in the Valley of Hinnom was reached by those idolatrously burning their children in the fire to Baal. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/68/0" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Jer. 19:5, 6</a>) It was also the gate through which Jeremiah led some of the older men and priests of Israel and proclaimed calamity to Jerusalem, breaking an earthenware flask to illustrate God’s breaking of the people for their serving of other gods.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/69/0" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Jer. 19:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/69/1" data-bid="70-2" class="b"> 10, 11</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">The name “Gate of the Potsherds” may have been given because fragments of pottery were thrown near there as refuse, or because fragments of pottery were ground there, the dust from which was used to make cement for plastering cisterns (as has been done in modern times near a pool at the SW corner of the city). Also, there may have been a potter’s industry near this gate, for there was clay nearby in the Valley of Hinnom as well as a water supply at the mouth of the Tyropean valley and at the spring En-rogel. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/70/0" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Jeremiah 18:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/70/1" data-bid="71-2" class="b"> 19:1, 2</a>.) The “potter’s field” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/71/0" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Matt. 27:7, 8</a>) has, since the fourth century C.E., been traditionally considered to be located on the S side of the Valley of Hinnom.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="ss"><strong><em>Fountain Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">This gate was so called because of its giving access to a spring or fountain nearby, perhaps En-rogel, which was below the junction of the Kidron Valley and the Valley of Hinnom. Probably it was at the S tip of the E hill of the city (that is, at the southern end of the “City of David”). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/72/0" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Neh. 2:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/72/1" data-bid="73-2" class="b"> 3:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/72/2" data-bid="73-3" class="b"> 12:37</a>) The Fountain Gate would afford convenient exit and access to En-rogel for those living in the City of David, while the Gate of the Ash-heaps, not far to the SW, would also lead out toward En-rogel and would likely be a better exit for the residents of the Tyropean valley and the SW hill of the city.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="ss"><strong><em>Water Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">The name of this gate may have been derived from its proximity, or at least its access, to the Spring of Gihon about midway up the E side of the city. This gate was near Ophel, not far from the Temple area. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/73/0" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Neh. 3:26</a>) The Water Gate was where one of the groups of the inauguration procession left the wall, proceeding from there to the Temple, where they assembled with the other group, apparently not traversing that part of the city wall to the E of the Temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/74/0" data-bid="75-1" class="b">Neh. 12:37-40</a>) There was a public square before this gate in which all the people gathered to hear Ezra read the Law, and where they afterward built booths to celebrate the Festival of Booths.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/75/0" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Neh. 8:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/75/1" data-bid="76-2" class="b"> 16</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="ss"><strong><em>Horse Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb">Repair work above the Horse Gate was done by the priests, which implies that its location was near the Temple. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/76/0" data-bid="77-1" class="b">Neh. 3:28</a>) Some have held that the Horse Gate was one providing communication between two parts of the Temple-palace quarter. They reach this conclusion from the account of Athaliah’s execution, which reports that, on being led out of the Temple by the soldiers, “she came to the entry of the horse gate of the king’s house.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/77/0" data-bid="78-1" class="b">2 Chron. 23:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/77/1" data-bid="78-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 11:16</a>) However, this was likely an entry just to the precincts of the royal palace and not the Horse Gate through which the horses passed in and out of the city itself. Nehemiah definitely includes the Horse Gate in his reconstruction description, indicating that it was a gate in the city wall. It was probably located near the SE corner of the Temple-palace area. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/78/0" data-bid="79-1" class="b">Neh. 3:28</a>) According to Jeremiah, there must have been a <span id="page627" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="627" data-before-text="627"></span>corner of the wall near this gate, probably as the wall turned toward the left as one comes up the Kidron valley, thereby following the valley’s contour (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/79/0" data-bid="80-1" class="b">Jer. 31:40</a>) The Horse Gate is omitted in the inauguration procession account, evidently because the two parts of the procession left off at the Water Gate and the Gate of the Guard, respectively, and did not walk over the section of the wall E of the Temple, where the Horse Gate and the Inspection Gate were located.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/80/0" data-bid="81-1" class="b">Neh. 12:37-40</a>.</p>

<strong>Garden</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The above-mentioned parklike gardens would usually be outside the city, except in the case of gardens of kings or very rich men. The King’s Garden, near the place where Zedekiah and his men tried to escape from Jerusalem during the Chaldean siege, was probably situated just outside the SE wall of that city.

<strong>Gate, Gateway</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb"><strong><em>Fountain Gate.</em></strong> This gate was so called because of its giving access to a spring or fountain nearby, perhaps En-rogel, which was below the junction of the Kidron Valley and the Valley of Hinnom. Probably the gate was at the S tip of the E hill of the city (that is, at the southern end of “the City of David”).

<strong>Gangrene</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The death of the tissues in a part of the body, such as a toe or a foot; mortification. In <em>dry gangrene,</em> where the arteries are blocked or occluded (as, for example, in arteriosclerosis), the affected part turns black and dry and loses all feeling. <span id="page622" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="622" data-before-text="622"></span><em>Moist gangrene</em> is a result of veins, rather than arteries, being occluded. The affected part undergoes putrefaction. Wounds, frostbite or other interference with the blood supply can bring about gangrene. The dead material is usually separated from the living tissue by a red line of demarcation and is cast off by a process of inflammation, or it becomes necessary to amputate by surgery. The bacteria associated with gangrene (especially in moist gangrene) can cause blood poisoning and a deadly spread of the infection if the affected part is not removed.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The apostle Paul uses the word figuratively of the teaching of false doctrine and of “empty speeches that violate what is holy.” He stresses the danger that such speech brings to the entire congregation, saying: “For they will advance to more and more ungodliness, and their word will spread like gangrene.” He then cites examples: “Hymenaeus and Philetus are of that number. These very men have deviated from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already occurred; and they are subverting the faith of some.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011570/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Tim. 2:16-18</a>) In view of Paul’s earlier symbolism, picturing the congregation as a body with many members—feet, hands, and so forth (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011570/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Cor. chap. 12</a>)—his figurative use of gangrene, with its danger to the human body, gives strong emphasis to the importance of eliminating false doctrine and ungodly speech from the Christian congregation.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Gate, Gateway</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The Gate of the Old City was located on the NW side of the city between the Fish Gate and the Gate of Ephraim. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Neh. 3:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/51/1" data-bid="52-2" class="b"> 12:39</a>) In Hebrew, the gate is called simply “Gate of the Old,” the word “city” being supplied by some translators. It is suggested that the name was derived from its having been the main N entrance to the old city. It may have been at the junction of the Broad Wall (that formed a N boundary of the old city) and the S end of the W wall of the second quarter. Some think that this gate is identical with the “First Gate” mentioned by Zechariah. He seemingly refers to the E-W limits of the city in saying “from [1] the gate of Benjamin <span id="page626" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="626" data-before-text="626"></span>all the way to the place of [2] the First Gate, all the way to [3] the Corner Gate,” and to the N-S limits in saying “from the Tower of Hananel all the way to the press vats of the king.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Zech. 14:10</a>) If so, this places the First Gate E of the Corner Gate, possibly naming, from E to W, (1) the gate in or near the E corner, (2) the gate at the angle where the walls of the second quarter and the old city meet, and (3) the gate in the NW corner of the old city wall. Hence this would allow for the above-suggested identity of the First Gate with the Gate of the Old City. Others would connect the Gate of the Old City with the “Middle Gate” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Jeremiah 39:3</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong><em>Gate of Ephraim</em></strong></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">The Gate of Ephraim was located in the Broad Wall 400 cubits (c. 583 feet [c. 178 meters]) E of the Corner Gate.

It, too, has been identified by some researchers with the Middle Gate (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Jer. 39:3</a>), by others with the First Gate.

There was a public square near the Gate of Ephraim, in which the people made booths to celebrate the Festival of Booths in Nehemiah’s time. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Neh. 8:16</a>) This gate is not named in Nehemiah’s reconstruction text, evidently because it did not need extensive repairs.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="ss"><strong><em>Corner Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">This gate was evidently located in the NW angle of the city wall, 400 cubits (c. 583 feet [c. 178 meters]) along the Broad Wall W of the Gate of Ephraim.

Uzziah built a tower by this gate; whether or not it was the Tower of the Bake Ovens is not stated. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:9</a>) Both Jeremiah and Zechariah appear to refer to the Corner Gate as being on the western edge of the city.

The Corner Gate does not appear in Nehemiah’s accounts; again the reason may be that it did not need extensive repairs. The account does speak of repairing the Tower of the Bake Ovens, which seems to have been a part of, or near, the Corner Gate.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Neh. 3:11</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="ss"><strong><em>Valley Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">At the SW corner of the city wall, the Valley Gate led to the Valley of Hinnom, and corresponds to the modern Jaffa Gate. Josephus’ “Gate of the Essenes” may have been located here or nearby. Uzziah, in his city-fortification program, built a tower by this gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/62/0" data-bid="63-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:9</a>) It was from the Valley Gate that Nehemiah went out for his inspection of the damaged wall, riding eastward through the Valley of Hinnom and then up the Kidron valley, finally reentering the city by the same gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/63/0" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Neh. 2:13-15</a>) Although not named as such, the Valley Gate appears to be the point at which the inauguration procession started, one group marching counterclockwise around the walls past the Gate of the Ash-heaps and the other clockwise past the Corner Gate and the Tower of the Bake Ovens.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Neh. 12:31-40</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="ss"><strong><em>Gate of the Ash-heaps</em></strong></p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">This gate is also known as the <em>Gate of the Potsherds,</em> and is usually called the <em>Dung Gate</em>.

Also, there may have been a potter’s industry near this gate, for there was clay nearby in the Valley of Hinnom as well as a water supply at the mouth of the Tyropean valley and at the spring En-rogel.

<strong>Burial, Burial Places</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The location of these royal burial places has not been determined.

A number of what appear to be ancient rock-cut tombs have been found in this area, their entrances being in the form of sunken rectangular shafts. However, no positive identification can be made; any effort at identification was complicated not only by the destruction of the city in the year 70 C.E. and again in 135 C.E. but also by the use of the southern part of the city by the Romans as a stone quarry. Hence, the above-mentioned tombs are in a greatly deteriorated state.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1200020016/29/0">ad 626</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Gate, Gateway</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The Gate of the Old City was located on the NW side of the city between the Fish Gate and the Gate of Ephraim. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Neh. 3:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/51/1" data-bid="52-2" class="b"> 12:39</a>) In Hebrew, the gate is called simply “Gate of the Old,” the word “city” being supplied by some translators. It is suggested that the name was derived from its having been the main N entrance to the old city. It may have been at the junction of the Broad Wall (that formed a N boundary of the old city) and the S end of the W wall of the second quarter. Some think that this gate is identical with the “First Gate” mentioned by Zechariah. He seemingly refers to the E-W limits of the city in saying “from [1] the gate of Benjamin <span id="page626" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="626" data-before-text="626"></span>all the way to the place of [2] the First Gate, all the way to [3] the Corner Gate,” and to the N-S limits in saying “from the Tower of Hananel all the way to the press vats of the king.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Zech. 14:10</a>) If so, this places the First Gate E of the Corner Gate, possibly naming, from E to W, (1) the gate in or near the E corner, (2) the gate at the angle where the walls of the second quarter and the old city meet, and (3) the gate in the NW corner of the old city wall. Hence this would allow for the above-suggested identity of the First Gate with the Gate of the Old City. Others would connect the Gate of the Old City with the “Middle Gate” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Jeremiah 39:3</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong><em>Gate of Ephraim</em></strong></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">The Gate of Ephraim was located in the Broad Wall 400 cubits (c. 583 feet [c. 178 meters]) E of the Corner Gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">2 Ki. 14:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/54/1" data-bid="55-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 25:23</a>) It was an exit N in the direction of the territory of Ephraim. It, too, has been identified by some researchers with the Middle Gate (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Jer. 39:3</a>), by others with the First Gate.

There was a public square near the Gate of Ephraim, in which the people made booths to celebrate the Festival of Booths in Nehemiah’s time. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Neh. 8:16</a>) This gate is not named in Nehemiah’s reconstruction text, evidently because it did not need extensive repairs.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="ss"><strong><em>Corner Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">This gate was evidently located in the NW angle of the city wall, 400 cubits (c. 583 feet [c. 178 meters]) along the Broad Wall W of the Gate of Ephraim. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/58/0" data-bid="59-1" class="b">2 Ki. 14:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/58/1" data-bid="59-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 25:23</a>) It was on the E side of the Valley of Hinnom, apparently in the W wall of the old city at the point where it joined the Broad Wall. Uzziah built a tower by this gate; whether or not it was the Tower of the Bake Ovens is not stated. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:9</a>) Both Jeremiah and Zechariah appear to refer to the Corner Gate as being on the western edge of the city. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/60/0" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Jer. 31:38;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/60/1" data-bid="61-2" class="b"> Zech. 14:10</a>) Some think the Corner Gate is the same as the First Gate, but the statement in the book of Zechariah seems to weigh against this view as to its location, for, apparently describing the E-W limits, Zechariah wrote, “from the gate of Benjamin all the way to the place of the First Gate, all the way to the Corner Gate,” thus evidently placing the First Gate E of the Corner Gate.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">There is no other gate described as existing in the W wall from the Corner Gate to the Valley Gate at the S end, this no doubt being because of the steep slope of the Hinnom valley, making any other gate impractical. The Corner Gate does not appear in Nehemiah’s accounts; again the reason may be that it did not need extensive repairs. The account does speak of repairing the Tower of the Bake Ovens, which seems to have been a part of, or near, the Corner Gate.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Neh. 3:11</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="ss"><strong><em>Valley Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">At the SW corner of the city wall, the Valley Gate led to the Valley of Hinnom, and corresponds to the modern Jaffa Gate. Josephus’ “Gate of the Essenes” may have been located here or nearby. Uzziah, in his city-fortification program, built a tower by this gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/62/0" data-bid="63-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:9</a>) It was from the Valley Gate that Nehemiah went out for his inspection of the damaged wall, riding eastward through the Valley of Hinnom and then up the Kidron valley, finally reentering the city by the same gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/63/0" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Neh. 2:13-15</a>) Although not named as such, the Valley Gate appears to be the point at which the inauguration procession started, one group marching counterclockwise around the walls past the Gate of the Ash-heaps and the other clockwise past the Corner Gate and the Tower of the Bake Ovens.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Neh. 12:31-40</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="ss"><strong><em>Gate of the Ash-heaps</em></strong></p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">This gate is also known as the <em>Gate of the Potsherds,</em> and is usually called the <em>Dung Gate</em>. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/65/0" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Neh. 2:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/65/1" data-bid="66-2" class="b"> 12:31</a>) Nehemiah’s description seems to place it 1,000 cubits (c. 1,458 feet [c. 444 meters]) E of the Valley Gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/66/0" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Neh. 3:13, 14</a>) It was at the SE corner of the city wall, and led to the Valley of Hinnom near the point where it joined the Tyropean valley. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/67/0" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Jer. 19:2</a>) It was from this gate that Topheth in the Valley of Hinnom was reached by those idolatrously burning their children in the fire to Baal.

Also, there may have been a potter’s industry near this gate, for there was clay nearby in the Valley of Hinnom as well as a water supply at the mouth of the Tyropean valley and at the spring En-rogel. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/70/0" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Jeremiah 18:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/70/1" data-bid="71-2" class="b"> 19:1, 2</a>.)

Probably it was at the S tip of the E hill of the city (that is, at the southern end of the “City of David”). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/72/0" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Neh. 2:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/72/1" data-bid="73-2" class="b"> 3:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/72/2" data-bid="73-3" class="b"> 12:37</a>) The Fountain Gate would afford convenient exit and access to En-rogel for those living in the City of David, while the Gate of the Ash-heaps, not far to the SW, would also lead out toward En-rogel and would likely be a better exit for the residents of the Tyropean valley and the SW hill of the city.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="ss"><strong><em>Water Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">The name of this gate may have been derived from its proximity, or at least its access, to the Spring of Gihon about midway up the E side of the city.

<strong>Gate, Gateway</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The Gate of the Old City was located on the NW side of the city between the Fish Gate and the Gate of Ephraim. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/51/0" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Neh. 3:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/51/1" data-bid="52-2" class="b"> 12:39</a>) In Hebrew, the gate is called simply “Gate of the Old,” the word “city” being supplied by some translators. It is suggested that the name was derived from its having been the main N entrance to the old city. It may have been at the junction of the Broad Wall (that formed a N boundary of the old city) and the S end of the W wall of the second quarter. Some think that this gate is identical with the “First Gate” mentioned by Zechariah. He seemingly refers to the E-W limits of the city in saying “from [1] the gate of Benjamin <span id="page626" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="626" data-before-text="626"></span>all the way to the place of [2] the First Gate, all the way to [3] the Corner Gate,” and to the N-S limits in saying “from the Tower of Hananel all the way to the press vats of the king.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/52/0" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Zech. 14:10</a>) If so, this places the First Gate E of the Corner Gate, possibly naming, from E to W, (1) the gate in or near the E corner, (2) the gate at the angle where the walls of the second quarter and the old city meet, and (3) the gate in the NW corner of the old city wall. Hence this would allow for the above-suggested identity of the First Gate with the Gate of the Old City. Others would connect the Gate of the Old City with the “Middle Gate” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Jeremiah 39:3</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong><em>Gate of Ephraim</em></strong></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">The Gate of Ephraim was located in the Broad Wall 400 cubits (c. 583 feet [c. 178 meters]) E of the Corner Gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">2 Ki. 14:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/54/1" data-bid="55-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 25:23</a>) It was an exit N in the direction of the territory of Ephraim. It, too, has been identified by some researchers with the Middle Gate (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Jer. 39:3</a>), by others with the First Gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/56/0" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Zech. 14:10</a>) It is thought to be (or correspond to) the Gennath or Garden Gate spoken of by the Jewish historian Josephus. There was a public square near the Gate of Ephraim, in which the people made booths to celebrate the Festival of Booths in Nehemiah’s time. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/57/0" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Neh. 8:16</a>) This gate is not named in Nehemiah’s reconstruction text, evidently because it did not need extensive repairs.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="ss"><strong><em>Corner Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">This gate was evidently located in the NW angle of the city wall, 400 cubits (c. 583 feet [c. 178 meters]) along the Broad Wall W of the Gate of Ephraim. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/58/0" data-bid="59-1" class="b">2 Ki. 14:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/58/1" data-bid="59-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 25:23</a>) It was on the E side of the Valley of Hinnom, apparently in the W wall of the old city at the point where it joined the Broad Wall. Uzziah built a tower by this gate; whether or not it was the Tower of the Bake Ovens is not stated. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/59/0" data-bid="60-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:9</a>) Both Jeremiah and Zechariah appear to refer to the Corner Gate as being on the western edge of the city. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/60/0" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Jer. 31:38;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/60/1" data-bid="61-2" class="b"> Zech. 14:10</a>) Some think the Corner Gate is the same as the First Gate, but the statement in the book of Zechariah seems to weigh against this view as to its location, for, apparently describing the E-W limits, Zechariah wrote, “from the gate of Benjamin all the way to the place of the First Gate, all the way to the Corner Gate,” thus evidently placing the First Gate E of the Corner Gate.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">There is no other gate described as existing in the W wall from the Corner Gate to the Valley Gate at the S end, this no doubt being because of the steep slope of the Hinnom valley, making any other gate impractical. The Corner Gate does not appear in Nehemiah’s accounts; again the reason may be that it did not need extensive repairs. The account does speak of repairing the Tower of the Bake Ovens, which seems to have been a part of, or near, the Corner Gate.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/61/0" data-bid="62-1" class="b">Neh. 3:11</a>.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="ss"><strong><em>Valley Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">At the SW corner of the city wall, the Valley Gate led to the Valley of Hinnom, and corresponds to the modern Jaffa Gate. Josephus’ “Gate of the Essenes” may have been located here or nearby. Uzziah, in his city-fortification program, built a tower by this gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/62/0" data-bid="63-1" class="b">2 Chron. 26:9</a>) It was from the Valley Gate that Nehemiah went out for his inspection of the damaged wall, riding eastward through the Valley of Hinnom and then up the Kidron valley, finally reentering the city by the same gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/63/0" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Neh. 2:13-15</a>) Although not named as such, the Valley Gate appears to be the point at which the inauguration procession started, one group marching counterclockwise around the walls past the Gate of the Ash-heaps and the other clockwise past the Corner Gate and the Tower of the Bake Ovens.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Neh. 12:31-40</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="ss"><strong><em>Gate of the Ash-heaps</em></strong></p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">This gate is also known as the <em>Gate of the Potsherds,</em> and is usually called the <em>Dung Gate</em>. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/65/0" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Neh. 2:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/65/1" data-bid="66-2" class="b"> 12:31</a>) Nehemiah’s description seems to place it 1,000 cubits (c. 1,458 feet [c. 444 meters]) E of the Valley Gate. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/66/0" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Neh. 3:13, 14</a>) It was at the SE corner of the city wall, and led to the Valley of Hinnom near the point where it joined the Tyropean valley. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/67/0" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Jer. 19:2</a>) It was from this gate that Topheth in the Valley of Hinnom was reached by those idolatrously burning their children in the fire to Baal. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/68/0" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Jer. 19:5, 6</a>) It was also the gate through which Jeremiah led some of the older men and priests of Israel and proclaimed calamity to Jerusalem, breaking an earthenware flask to illustrate God’s breaking of the people for their serving of other gods.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/69/0" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Jer. 19:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/69/1" data-bid="70-2" class="b"> 10, 11</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">The name “Gate of the Potsherds” may have been given because fragments of pottery were thrown near there as refuse, or because fragments of pottery were ground there, the dust from which was used to make cement for plastering cisterns (as has been done in modern times near a pool at the SW corner of the city). Also, there may have been a potter’s industry near this gate, for there was clay nearby in the Valley of Hinnom as well as a water supply at the mouth of the Tyropean valley and at the spring En-rogel. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/70/0" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Jeremiah 18:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/70/1" data-bid="71-2" class="b"> 19:1, 2</a>.) The “potter’s field” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/71/0" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Matt. 27:7, 8</a>) has, since the fourth century C.E., been traditionally considered to be located on the S side of the Valley of Hinnom.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="ss"><strong><em>Fountain Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">This gate was so called because of its giving access to a spring or fountain nearby, perhaps En-rogel, which was below the junction of the Kidron Valley and the Valley of Hinnom. Probably it was at the S tip of the E hill of the city (that is, at the southern end of the “City of David”). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/72/0" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Neh. 2:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/72/1" data-bid="73-2" class="b"> 3:15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/72/2" data-bid="73-3" class="b"> 12:37</a>) The Fountain Gate would afford convenient exit and access to En-rogel for those living in the City of David, while the Gate of the Ash-heaps, not far to the SW, would also lead out toward En-rogel and would likely be a better exit for the residents of the Tyropean valley and the SW hill of the city.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="ss"><strong><em>Water Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">The name of this gate may have been derived from its proximity, or at least its access, to the Spring of Gihon about midway up the E side of the city. This gate was near Ophel, not far from the Temple area. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/73/0" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Neh. 3:26</a>) The Water Gate was where one of the groups of the inauguration procession left the wall, proceeding from there to the Temple, where they assembled with the other group, apparently not traversing that part of the city wall to the E of the Temple.

Nehemiah definitely includes the Horse Gate in his reconstruction description, indicating that it was a gate in the city wall. It was probably located near the SE corner of the Temple-palace area.

Its mention by Nehemiah in his reconstruction account would seem to support the idea that it was a gate in the E wall of the city in front of the Temple area and N of the Horse Gate.

Probably the most likely is that it is identical with the Gate of the Old City, since this gate was at the convergence of the Broad Wall, the N wall of the old city, and the W wall of the second quarter, and would be a central or commanding position. However, some say that the Middle Gate may have been the Gate of Ephraim. Another suggestion is that it was the Fish Gate, another commanding position, because this gate stood at the point where the valley dividing the city into two parts entered the city.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="ss"><strong><em>Gate of Benjamin</em></strong></p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sb">Some identify the Gate of Benjamin with the Sheep Gate.

The latter identification seems less likely, although it would also have been possible for Jeremiah to travel toward his hometown Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin from the Inspection Gate. Another argument for the Sheep Gate as being another name for the Gate of Benjamin is that Zedekiah was sitting in the Gate of Benjamin when approached by Ebed-melech with a plea in Jeremiah’s behalf. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/87/0" data-bid="88-1" class="b">Jer. 38:7, 8</a>) It is suggested that the king would be near the point of greatest concern during the Babylonian siege. The Sheep Gate on the N of the city would be the most seriously threatened by the attacking Babylonians, not the Inspection Gate, which was apparently on the E side of the Temple area, and not in a particularly vulnerable position.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="ss"><strong><em>Other gates mentioned</em></strong></p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sb">When King Zedekiah fled from the Babylonians, he went out “by the way of the gate between the double wall that is by the king’s garden.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/88/0" data-bid="89-1" class="b">Jer. 52:7, 8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/88/1" data-bid="89-2" class="b"> 39:4</a>) There is much uncertainty as to the identity of the “double wall.” However, from present knowledge, either the Gate of the Ash-heaps or the Fountain Gate might fit the circumstances described in the Scriptures, both of these being near the king’s garden. Those supporting the Fountain Gate location say that the exit from the city through this gate led through a fifteen-meter- (c. 49-foot-) long corridor between two strong walls. On the other hand, Dr. J. Simons, who advocates the Gate of the Ash-heaps as Zedekiah’s place of exit, says that the lower part of the Central (Tyropean) valley was enclosed between a supposed SW wall of the city of David and a wall discovered by archaeologist J. Bliss (apparently an old S wall), in which was the Gate of the Ash-heaps. From either of those gates Zedekiah could have fled toward the Arabah and to “the desert plains of Jericho,” where the Babylonians caught him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/89/0" data-bid="90-1" class="b">2 Ki. 25:5</a>.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/90/0" data-bid="91-1" class="b">2 Kings 23:8</a> reference is made to the “high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua, the chief of the city, which was at the left as a person came into the gate of the city.” Here “gate of Joshua” is not the name of a city gate, but evidently is a gate within the city walls leading to the governor’s residence, which was at the left as a person entered the city gate.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="ss"><strong>TEMPLE GATES</strong></p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="sb"><em>East Gate</em>.

The East Gate may have been approximately in line with the Inspection Gate in the city wall.

Simons, who advocates the Gate of the Ash-heaps as Zedekiah’s place of exit, says that the lower part of the Central (Tyropean) valley was enclosed between a supposed SW wall of the city of David and a wall discovered by archaeologist J. Bliss (apparently an old S wall), in which was the Gate of the Ash-heaps. From either of those gates Zedekiah could have fled toward the Arabah and to “the desert plains of Jericho,” where the Babylonians caught him.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/89/0" data-bid="90-1" class="b">2 Ki. 25:5</a>.</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sb">At <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/90/0" data-bid="91-1" class="b">2 Kings 23:8</a> reference is made to the “high places of the gates that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua, the chief of the city, which was at the left as a person came into the gate of the city.” Here “gate of Joshua” is not the name of a city gate, but evidently is a gate within the city walls leading to the governor’s residence, which was at the left as a person entered the city gate.</p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="ss"><strong>TEMPLE GATES</strong></p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="sb"><em>East Gate</em>.

Its location was probably in the wall of the second quarter, the part built by Manasseh (see “Fish Gate” below), at or near the NE corner of the city. This gate may have been so named because through it were brought sheep and goats for sacrifice or perhaps for a market that was located nearby. “The sheepgate” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001617/48/0" data-bid="49-1" class="b">John 5:2</a> is likely this Sheep Gate or a later gate corresponding to it, for it was located in the same vicinity, near the pool of Bethzatha.</p>

The gates named in Nehemiah’s record are gates in the wall that was built prior to the eighth century B.C.E. and in the wall surrounding the “second quarter.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">2 Ki. 22:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/42/1" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 34:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/42/2" data-bid="43-3" class="b"> Zeph. 1:10</a>) The “second quarter” was a part of the city bounded on the W and part of the N by Hezekiah’s wall (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/43/0" data-bid="44-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:5</a>) and joined by Manasseh’s wall, which continued on the NE and E. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/44/0" data-bid="45-1" class="b">2 Chron. 33:14</a>) This was N of the earlier city and wall, but apparently did not extend as far W as the earlier wall.—See accompanying map.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong><em>Nehemiah’s wall</em></strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">In his account of the reconstruction of the wall of the city (chap. 3), Nehemiah begins at the Sheep Gate, located in the NE part of the wall encompassing the second quarter, and proceeds in a counterclockwise direction. We shall follow this procedure in our listing below, inserting the gates not mentioned in the reconstruction account but named in the description of the inauguration procession (chap. 12), along with gates spoken of in other scriptures, some of which are merely other names for those in Nehemiah’s record.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong><em>Sheep Gate</em></strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The Sheep Gate was rebuilt by Eliashib the high priest and associate priests. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/45/0" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Neh. 3:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/45/1" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> 32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/45/2" data-bid="46-3" class="b"> 12:39</a>) This fact would indicate that it was near the Temple area. Its location was probably in the N wall of the second quarter, the part built by Manasseh (see “Fish Gate,” below), at or near the NE corner of the city. This gate may have been so named because through it were brought sheep and goats for sacrifice or perhaps for a market that was located nearby. It may also have been called the “Gate of Benjamin” (which see). The “sheepgate” mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011580/46/0" data-bid="47-1" class="b">John 5:2</a> is likely this Sheep Gate or a later gate corresponding to it, for it was located in the same vicinity, near the pool Bethzatha.</p>

Thus, there was a Jewish colony in Elephantine (Egyptian, <em>Yeb</em>), an island in the Nile near Aswan, some 690 km (430 mi) S of Cairo. A valuable find of papyri reveals conditions prevailing there during the fifth century B.C.E., about the time when Ezra and Nehemiah were active in Jerusalem. These documents, in Aramaic, contain the name of Sanballat of Samaria (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001265/146/0" data-bid="147-1" class="b">Ne 4:1, 2</a>) and of Johanan the high priest.

<strong>Persia, Persians</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The Greek stories of the end of Xerxes’ reign revolve around marital difficulties, disorders in the harem, and a supposed dominance of Xerxes by certain of his courtiers. These traditional accounts may reflect, though in a very confused and twisted way, some of the basic facts of the book of Esther, including the deposing of Queen Vashti and her replacement by Esther, and also the ascension of Mordecai to a position of great authority in the realm. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Esther 2:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 10:3</a>) According to the secular accounts, Xerxes was assassinated by one of his courtiers. While most secular authorities present 466/465 B.C.E. <span id="page1295" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1295" data-before-text="1295"></span>as the date of his death, thereby giving him a rule of some twenty-one years, an earlier date of 475/474 B.C.E. accords with the Bible record and has creditable testimony in its favor from certain of the ancient secular historians.—See ARTAXERXES No. 3.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong><em>Artaxerxes (Longimanus) to Darius II</em></strong></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">The reign of Xerxes’ successor, Artaxerxes’ (Longimanus), is notable for his authorization of Ezra’s return to Jerusalem with a large contribution for the support of the temple there. This occurred in Artaxerxes, seventh year (469/468 B.C.E. according to the above-mentioned dating). (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ezra 7:1-26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/22/1" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 8:24-36</a>) Some have assumed the reference to “a stone wall in Judah and in Jerusalem” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ezra 9:9</a>) to mean that Ezra was commissioned by Artaxerxes to rebuild the city walls. However, the Hebrew term does not necessarily refer to a massive wall, such as surrounded a city, but often describes a wall such as encompassed a vineyard (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Num. 22:24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Isa. 5:5</a>) or lined a courtyard.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Neh. 13:6</a>) Historians date Artaxerxes’ death as of 424/423 B.C.E.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">An abortive rule by Xerxes II is considered to fit in between the rule of Artaxerxes and that of Darius II. Darius II, Artaxerxes’ son by a concubine, succeeded to the throne after Xerxes II was murdered. His original name was Ochus but he adopted the name Darius upon becoming king in 423 B.C.E., according to secular history. He seems to be the “Darius” referred to at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Nehemiah 12:22</a>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="ss"><strong><em>Papyrus documents of Biblical significance</em></strong></p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">A considerable number of papyrus documents were written in Aramaic by a Jewish colony in Elephantine, an island in the Nile River near Syene (Aswan) Egypt, and these have been recovered and are dated by secular historians as from the reign of Darius I (beginning about 521 B.C.E.) to at least the reign of Darius II (c. 423-404 B.C.E.). The names “Sanballat” and “Johanan” occur in them and are thought to refer to those persons bearing the same names mentioned at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Nehemiah 4:1 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/30/1" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 12:22</a>. These papyri demonstrate the accuracy with which the books of Ezra and Nehemiah depict conditions and official communications during the Persian rule. As Professor Wright states: “Now . . . we are able to see that the Aramaic of Ezra is precisely that of its age, while the government documents are of the general type which we have become accustomed to associate with the Persian regime.” (<em>Biblical Archaeology,</em> p. 208) One document, credited to Darius II, contains a royal order concerning the celebration of the Passover by the Jewish colony in Egypt.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="ss"><strong>DOWN TO THE FALL AND DIVISION OF THE EMPIRE</strong></p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">Following Darius II came Artaxerxes II (called Mnemon), during whose reign Egypt revolted and relations with Greece deteriorated. His reign (dated as from 404 to 358 B.C.E.) was followed by that of his son Artaxerxes III (also called Ochus), who is credited with some twenty-one years of rule (358-338/37 B.C.E.) and is said to be the most bloodthirsty of all the Persian rulers. His major feat was the reconquest of Egypt. Secular history then gives a two-year rule for Arses and a five-year rule for Darius III (Codomannus), during whose reign Philip of Macedonia was murdered (336 B.C.E.) and succeeded by his son Alexander. In 334 B.C.E. Alexander began his attack on the Persian Empire, defeating the Persian forces first at Granicus in the NW corner of Asia Minor and again at Issus at the opposite corner of Asia Minor (333 B.C.E.). Finally, after the Greeks had conquered Phoenicia and Egypt, the Persians’ last stand, at Gaugamela in 331 B.C.E., was crushed and the Persian Empire came to its end.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">Following Alexander’s death and the subsequent division of the empire, Seleucus Nicator obtained control of the major portion of the Asiatic territories with Persia as its central part. The Seleucid dynasty of kings, thus begun, continued until 64 B.C.E. Seleucus Nicator seems to be the one with whom the prophetic figure of the “king of the north” of Daniel’s prophecy first begins to manifest itself, opposing the Ptolemaic line of kings in Egypt, who initially appear to fill the role of the symbolic “king of the south.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Dan. 11:4-6</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">The Seleucid kings were restricted to the western part of their domain by the incursions of the Parthians, who conquered the territory of Persia proper during the third and second centuries B.C.E. They were defeated by the Sasanians in 226 C.E. and the Sasanian rule continued until the Arab conquest in 642.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">The prophecy of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Ezekiel (27:10</a>) includes Persians among the men of war serving in the military force of wealthy Tyre, and contributing to its splendor. Persia is also listed among those nations forming part of the hordes directed by the symbolic “Gog of the land of Magog” against Jehovah’s covenant people.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ezek. 38:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/33/1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 4, 5,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200013366/33/2" data-bid="34-3" class="b"> 8, 9</a>.</p>

<strong>Do Not Give Up in Doing What Is Fine</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> As an organization we can answer with a resounding NO! Our spiritual paradise has been fortified as with a wall built around it and the enemy will never be able to destroy it. But what about us <em>individually?</em> The records indicate that apparently some have need for greater balance, even as those Israelites of Nehemiah’s day worked with one hand and held a sword in the other. During the 1978 service year there were 37,487 who laid down the implements, so to speak, in the United States. They <span id="page7" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>became inactive so far as the spiritual building work is concerned and stopped going in field service. Additionally, 27.3 percent or 164,240 of the total publishers were irregular in service.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>A SOURCE OF HELP</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> It would seem that some of the builders in Nehemiah’s time were like that, too. They became fearful as a result of the pressures brought to bear on them. How were they helped to “have a heart for working” as they had displayed initially? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/201979202/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Neh. 4:6</a>) Nehemiah tells us: “When I saw their fear I immediately rose and said to the nobles and the deputy rulers and the rest of the people: ‘Do not be afraid on their account. Jehovah the great and the fear-inspiring One keep in your mind.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/201979202/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Neh. 4:14</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Can we help our inactive and irregular brothers and sisters today to “have a heart for working” in a similar way? Certainly! Elders, ministerial servants and, yes, “the rest of the people,” all of us, can help them to keep in mind this same great and fear-inspiring One. Sometimes all it takes is a word of encouragement, letting them know we love them and miss them. Giving encouragement is everyone’s job. The account says Nehemiah “immediately rose” and did this. Will you do the same? It may save the life of your brother or sister by helping that individual not to give up in doing what is fine.</p>

<strong>Loving Use of What We Are Given</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> If we can keep ourselves and others busy in the Kingdom ministry work with us it will be a protection from becoming involved in activities of this world, which is condemned by Jehovah. What would we think of a person who learns that the municipality in which he lives has condemned a building and is going to construct a highway after a demolition, but the individual buys the building, paints it, decorates it, makes it beautiful and spends a great deal of time in the repair work? Then the municipality comes along and destroys the building. The individual working on that building would be considered foolish. But this is the kind of thing a person does who begins to devote all his time to worldly activities and fails to maintain his ministry. He may believe he is doing something constructive in his community, building up something good, but what is he building on? If he is building on the old-world foundation he is working on a structure that is condemned to early demolition. Time that is put into it is going to be lost and the foolish builder may even lose his life. This is the way with pursuing worldly activities. Time and energy are consumed and nothing lasting is gained. But the Christian must keep his balance and remember that his vocation is the ministry. Paul counsels at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961403/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Colossians 4:5, 6</a>: “Go on walking in wisdom toward those on the outside, buying out the opportune time for yourselves. Let your utterance be always with graciousness, seasoned with salt, so as to know how you ought to give an answer to each one.” The more association one has with the world the greater are the chances that <span id="page339" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="339" data-before-text="339"></span>he will become involved with the world or even become morally unclean because of outside influences. In wisdom he should buy out as much time as he can to improve himself in his edifying speech and share in the active building program now being conducted under the direction of Christ.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">17. Because of Christian unity what is being accomplished world-wide, and who should take the lead in maintaining unity?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> In unity there is strength. By directing efforts unitedly toward the accomplishment of Jehovah’s will, Jehovah’s witnesses are sharing in the world-wide proclamation of the good news of the established kingdom of Jehovah. That kingdom is ruled by one God, who is the great Master Builder of it. He has placed Christ Jesus in the position of King to lovingly direct the activities of those who are sharers in the Kingdom. In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961403/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ephesians, chapter four</a>, Paul bids fellow Christians to walk worthily of their calling, to endure, to continue in love, and to maintain the oneness of the spirit in the uniting bond of peace. He draws attention to the fact that there are many responsibilities assigned to individual servants, such as missionaries, shepherds and teachers, and all of such have been appointed with a view to the training of ministers and for the building up of the body of Christ. No doubt is left that the overseers in the New World society today have the greatest responsibility in the building program. They must be trainers and teachers, setting good examples of leadership in the field and continually interested in young and old, men and women, yes, all the individuals making up the New World society today. Such spiritual giving leads to happiness. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961403/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>) Though in some lands there is opposition to the Christian building work, still it must continue and overseers have the example of Nehemiah in this respect. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961403/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Neh. 4:8, 9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961403/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961403/21/2" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> Titus 2:1-15</a>) Members in the congregations rightly look to the overseers to teach them how to edify others, and by the help of Jehovah’s organization today the overseers are well equipped for that service. May they give themselves willingly to that work.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961403/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Heb. 13:7</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">18. (a) Why must all in the New World society co-operate to maintain strength and unity? (b) In this connection, how can we lovingly use the truth that has been given to us by Jehovah?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Let all in the New World society today have a share in the responsibility for the spiritual building work. The spiritual building today is lasting building. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961403/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Eph. 2:21, 22</a>) Individuals are likened to spiritual stones built up in the body of Christ, and the bond that holds them together is love and consideration for one another. Obviously one or two stones scattered in the midst of a field would be no building, but a building is an organized arrangement of stones closely cemented together. Worshipers of Jehovah today are an organization, a New World structure. It is in unity that Jehovah has gathered them together in these last days of Satan’s rule and each individual must do his share to maintain a spiritually strong building, uniting closely together with others who go to make up the building. Spiritual strengthening of each stone will result in benefits to the others, for it will keep the whole structure strong. Thus in the great storm of Armageddon the building will not be toppled, though the evil one Satan and his hordes may dash against it. The unity and strength of the New World society, including those who are of the body of Christ, can safely be maintained by lovingly using the truth we have been given by Jehovah to build up one another: “But speaking the truth, let us by love grow up in all things into him who is the head, Christ. From him all the body, by being harmoniously joined together and being made to cooperate through every joint which gives what is needed, according to the functioning of each respective member in due measure, makes for the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961403/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Eph. 4:15, 16</a>.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb"></p>

Dealing with children who may not respond readily to Biblical counsel can create very real pressures; even our own weaknesses sometimes plague us.
