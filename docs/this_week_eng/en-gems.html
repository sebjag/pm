<strong>What Is Better than Life?</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In that wilderness consisting of smooth and rounded barren hills, no surface water flows, and no stream has its source. Think of how thirsty a person might get in such an area! Drawing on the effect of his being in this dry and barren region, David tells of his longing for his God. He compares his desire for fellowship with his God to a longing for water in a dry wilderness. We read: “O God, you are my God, I keep looking for you. My soul does thirst for you. For you my flesh has grown faint with longing in a land dry and exhausted, where there is no water.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979570/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 63:1</a>) Why did David look for his God? He wanted Jehovah’s favor, guidance and protection. So intense was David’s desire for help and refreshment from Jehovah that he spoke of this longing as wearing him out, causing him to grow faint.</p>

<strong>What Is Better than Life?</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Because of having to leave the location of Jehovah’s representative dwelling place, David recalled the past, when he had free access to the sanctuary. He said: “Thus I have beheld you in the holy place, at seeing your strength and your glory.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979570/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 63:2</a>) At the sanctuary David had a special awareness of God’s presence, seeing or beholding the Most High, as it were. It was there that Jehovah’s glory and strength were in evidence. The expressions of praise, thanksgiving and rejoicing that would be made by the worshipers glorified the Most High. Also, what was said and done extolled or magnified Jehovah as a God of saving acts. Through the heartfelt expressions made by the devoted worshipers, the strength of the Almighty was manifest.</p>

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001763/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Luke 12:15</a>) Some Christians have been confronted with the choice of renouncing Jehovah or facing death. That happened to many of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Nazi concentration camps during World War II. With very few exceptions, our Christian brothers chose to remain in God’s love, being willing to face death if necessary. Those who loyally remain in his love can be confident of receiving from God an everlasting future, something that the world cannot give us. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2001763/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Mark 8:34-36</a>) But even more is involved than everlasting life.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">18.

It would be empty, without true purpose. Jehovah has given his people satisfying work to do in these last days. So we can trust that when Jehovah, the Great Purposer, provides everlasting life, it will be filled with fascinating, worthwhile things for us to learn and to do.

<strong>Happiness Through a Precious Relationship</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="ss"><strong>Something “Better Than Life”</strong></p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">As precious as life is, however, there is something that is even better. ‘Is that possible?’ you might wonder. ‘What could be more precious than life itself?’</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">King David of ancient Israel supplied us with the answer. Addressing the Creator, Jehovah God, he said with deep appreciation: “Because your loving-kindness is better than life, my own lips will commend you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985241/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 63:3</a>) David’s heartfelt words show that to be the recipient of God’s loving-kindness, which is based on having a fine relationship with him, is even more precious than life itself. Why is this so?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>What Makes Life Possible</strong></p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Suppose you were given a gift, something that you really liked. Of course you would be very happy to receive the gift and perhaps get a great deal of enjoyment from using it. But you would be ungrateful, indeed, if your thoughts did not go beyond the gift to the giver. Was it not the personal relationship between you and the giver that prompted the gift? If that relationship did not exist, there would have been no gift and no enjoyment of it.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The same is true with life. Precious as it is, we must bear in mind where our life came from and how it has been sustained. Certainly we did not create it ourselves, nor can we sustain it independent of all the marvelous provisions Jehovah has made on earth. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985241/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 100:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985241/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Acts 14:17</a>) The very fact that we have life, and undoubtedly we are enjoying it in some measure, is an expression of loving-kindness on the part of the Grand Creator, Jehovah God. Can we not see why King David wholeheartedly felt that God’s “loving-kindness is better than life”?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">There is another reason why having an approved relationship with the Creator is more important than having life itself​—our future depends on it. Let us see how this is so.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><span id="page5" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>Do you not agree that life is transitory and full of uncertainties? A person may work very hard for many years in order to achieve some materialistic goal he considers worth while. Yet, death soon robs him of everything he has attained. It is just as wise King Solomon said: “What does a man come to have for all his hard work and for the striving of his heart with which he is working hard under the sun? For all his days his occupation means pains and vexation, also during the night his heart just does not lie down. This too is mere vanity.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985241/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 2:22, 23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985241/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> compare 2:3-11</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">In spite of this, it is the purpose of our loving Creator that all those who love and obey him will be liberated from the frustration and futility that is our lot today. Jehovah assures us with this wonderful promise: “They will not build and someone else have occupancy; they will not plant and someone else do the eating. For like the days of a tree will the days of my people be; and the work of their own hands my chosen ones will use to the full.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985241/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:22</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Is this expression of God’s loving-kindness not better than our present limited and uncertain life? To be the recipient of his loving-kindness, yes, to live in that <span id="page6" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>New Order and to enjoy life filled with purpose and meaning would certainly be a most worthwhile goal. To realize that happy prospect, one must gain Jehovah’s approval now and maintain a close relationship with him and his people.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>Short-Term Interest Versus Long-Term Benefit</strong></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">In view of the foregoing points, it certainly would be shortsighted and unwise for us to occupy ourselves solely with the pursuit of self-interest, be it fame, fortune, career, academic achievement, personal fulfillment, or anything else considered worth while in this system of things. While these goals may not be wrong in themselves, pursuing any one of them as the most important thing may very well cause us to neglect our responsibilities before our Creator. Ultimately, we may lose his approval and fail to gain “the real life.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985241/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Timothy 6:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985241/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Luke 9:24</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">To take such a course can be likened to a youngster who drops out of school and goes to work as an unskilled laborer just to get some spending money. He may feel that he is finally freed from the restrictions of school and is having a good time. But is he not sacrificing his long-term welfare for the sake of some doubtful short-term interest? Similarly, then, is a person not short-sighted when he neglects his relationship with the Creator because he is too busy pursuing some personal goal?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Busy as all of us are, we usually manage to find the time and energy to do the things we really consider important, do we not? Thus, with an unerring understanding of human nature, Jesus succinctly points out: “For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985241/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 6:21</a>.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">So on what sort of “treasure” have you set your heart? The glitter and tinsel of the world may seem very attractive. But ask yourself: How lasting are the supposed benefits gained from such things? Do they bring true happiness or just temporary pleasures, like a drug, leaving an undesirable or even painful aftermath?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>Make a Wise Choice</strong></p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">There is a valuable lesson to be learned from the people of Lot’s day. “They were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building,” said Jesus. In other words, they were busy pursuing what they considered important, without paying any attention to God’s will. The result? “On the day that Lot came out of Sodom it rained fire and sulphur from heaven and destroyed them all.” Then, for our benefit, Jesus added: “The same way it will be on that day when the Son of man is to be revealed.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985241/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Luke 17:28-30</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">All indications are that “that day” is upon us. Out of concern for our eternal welfare, Jehovah God has been issuing repeated calls through his Word and his organized people in all the nations. The invitation is to turn back from selfish pursuits and become reconciled to him. It would be truly unwise for us to let our personal interests occupy <em>all</em> our time and energy, so that we fail to respond to this loving call. Rather, as the apostle Paul put it, we should recognize the urgency of the times: “Look! Now is the especially acceptable time. Look! Now is the day of salvation.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985241/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 5:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985241/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 6:2</a>.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Will you be among those who are blessed with the happy prospect of surviving the end of the present wicked system of things into the righteous New Order of God’s promise? That depends on what you consider most important in your life now and what you do about gaining an approved relationship with God. The choice is yours!</p>

<strong>What Is Better than Life?</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Next David tells of his appreciation for having Jehovah as his God.

To the psalmist, Jehovah’s loving-kindness was better than life itself, for it was God’s loyal love expressed toward him that gave real meaning to his life. That is why David felt compelled to continue praising Jehovah. He was determined to bless or speak well of the Most High for the rest of his life. Lifting his hands in an attitude of prayer, David would thank Jehovah. Because of having experienced God’s love and care, he felt totally satisfied. He had received the best, the choicest part. Therefore, joyful praise to the Almighty would continue to flow from his lips.</p>

<strong>The Price for Breaking God’s Law</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Why is this so? Because man alone was created in God’s likeness, being endowed with a measure of those attributes that his Creator has in their infinity and perfection, namely, love, justice, wisdom and power. These qualities make man accountable to God, and so when man violates any of God’s laws he pays a price therefor in one or more ways. Thus when man breaks God’s law it makes for bad relations with his Creator, with his fellowman, with himself <span id="page358" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="358" data-before-text="358"></span>and even with the lower animals. Further, breaking God’s law results in pain, mental, physical or emotional; it results in harm to his personality and eventually it brings about his death.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">For an initial illustration let us take the very first instance, that of the first human pair, Adam and Eve. Some may object on the ground that the record is based on a myth. But note that Genesis is not the only Bible book that presents Adam as the primogenitor of the human race. The writer of the book of First Chronicles likewise gives him that distinction, even as do both the Gospel writer Luke and the apostle Paul. The disciple Jude implies the same thing in speaking of Enoch as “the seventh man in line from Adam.” And the Lord Jesus himself referred to the Genesis account concerning Adam and Eve as authoritative.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 3:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 1:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Luke 3:38;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/2/3" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 1 Cor. 15:45;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/2/4" data-bid="3-5" class="b"> 1 Tim. 2:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/2/5" data-bid="3-6" class="b"> Jude 14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/2/6" data-bid="3-7" class="b"> Matt. 19:4, 5</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>BAD RELATIONS WITH GOD AND WITH FELLOWMEN</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">What happened in the case of that first human couple? When Adam and Eve sinned they lost God’s favor, it brought about bad relations with their God. This is apparent from the very tone of the words God addressed to Adam and Eve upon their transgression: “From the tree from which I commanded you not to eat have you [Adam] eaten?” And, “What is this you [Eve] have done?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gen. 3:11,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 13</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">We cannot escape it. Breaking God’s laws brings with it bad relations with our Maker, Jehovah God, and especially so when there is negligence or even willfulness, as in the case of Adam and Eve. Well did the psalmist state: “You—fear-inspiring you are, and who can stand before you because of the strength of your anger?” It is the utmost folly to incur God’s anger, for “we are not stronger than he is, are we?” Wisdom dictates that we guard against breaking God’s law, so that we might be the recipients of his loving-kindness, his favor, which “is better than life.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 76:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 10:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Ps. 63:3</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Secondly, breaking God’s laws makes for bad relations with our fellowmen. How did Adam feel when he saw that Eve had taken from the fruit that was forbidden and was now forcing him to make a decision by offering him some of it? Evidently not very lovingly, as can be seen from his later remarks, referring to her as “the woman” and blaming her—”she gave me fruit from the tree and so I ate it.” And how must Eve have felt when she heard these words blaming her instead of hearing Adam stand up like a man and shoulder his own blame? Truly their mutual transgression had resulted in poor relations with each other.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Gen. 3:12</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">So it has been ever since. Transgressors of God’s laws often pay the price of bad relations with their fellowmen in that they get on one another’s nerves, or become bitter toward one another. Also, society or their particular group may take action against them as when they are fined, put in prison or are excommunicated. If not always such extreme penalties, there invariably is dishonor, shame or disgrace. The one breaking God’s laws may try to keep it secret, but in vain, for “there is nothing . . . secret that will not become known.” “Honor is what the wise ones,” who keep God’s law, “will come to possess, but the stupid ones are exalting dishonor.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 10:26;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Prov. 3:35</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>BAD RELATIONS WITH ONESELF AND WITH BEASTS</strong></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Bad relations with oneself in the form of a guilty conscience are a further price paid by the one breaking God’s law. Both Adam and Eve immediately had guilty <span id="page359" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="359" data-before-text="359"></span>consciences upon breaking God’s law; that is why they hid themselves. “All things are clean to clean persons,” but they no longer felt clean, due to their sin. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Titus 1:15</a>) When man knowingly breaks God’s laws he, in effect, rebels at the degree of freedom God grants him and goes beyond that, only to become a slave to a bad conscience, so having less freedom than before.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963441/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Gen. 3:7</a>.</p>

<strong>Do You Know the Time?</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In Bible times, it was customary to use watchmen. They were particularly needed during the night. Centuries before Jesus’ birth, the Israelites divided the night into three periods called watches. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018568/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 63:6</a>) <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018568/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Judges 7:19</a> mentions “the middle night watch.” By Jesus’ day, the Jews had adopted the Greek and Roman system of four watch periods during the night.</p>

<strong>Night</strong><br/><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>Hebrew Division.</strong> The Hebrews divided the night into watches. “When I have remembered you upon my lounge, during the night watches I meditate on you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003253/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps 63:6</a>) Since <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003253/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Judges 7:19</a> speaks of a “middle night watch,” it seems evident there were three of them in early times. It appears that each watch covered one third of the time between sundown and sunrise, or about four hours each, depending on the time of the year. The first watch would thus run from about 6:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. “The middle night watch” would begin about 10:00 p.m. and run until about 2:00 a.m. This was a strategic time for Gideon to make his surprise attack on the Midianite camp. The third watch was called “the morning watch,” lasting from about 2:00 a.m. till sunrise. It was during this morning watch that Jehovah caused the pursuing Egyptian armies to begin to experience grave difficulties in their attempted passage through the Red Sea.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003253/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ex 14:24-28</a>; see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003253/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1Sa 11:11</a>.</p>

<strong>Do You Meditate or Just Daydream?</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>“During the Night Watches”</strong></p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The psalmist points to at least one advantage of learning the Scriptures: “When I have remembered you upon my lounge, during the night watches I meditate on you.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984087/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 63:6</a>) Oftentimes, when sleep is elusive, one tends to lapse into reverie. How much better, however, for one to pray as did David: “Let the sayings of my mouth and the meditation of my heart become pleasurable before you, O Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984087/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 19:14</a>) One who knows Bible texts by heart can more easily act in harmony with this prayer.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Then, too, a person may wake up in the middle of the night feeling very depressed. But to repeat slowly and appreciatively some inspiring words from the Bible, such as those found at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984087/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Exodus 34:6</a>, can have an immediate, refreshing and beneficial effect: “Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and truth.” Or if deep anxiety keeps you awake, try recalling these comforting words: “Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God; and the peace of God that excels all thought will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1984087/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Philippians 4:6, 7</a>.</p>

The first ran from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m., the second, from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m., and the third, from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. The psalmist’s using periods of wakefulness during these night watches to think about Jehovah certainly reflected deep appreciation for the help that he had received when the Most High protected him as with wings. Thus safeguarded, David could give way to rejoicing.</p>

<strong>Fox</strong><br/><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">According to naturalists, the fox is not really as much of a poultry thief as he is purported to be. The animal’s diet includes insects, rodents and other small animals, birds, carrion, grass, and fruits. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001564/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ca 2:15</a>) The 18th-century naturalist F. Hasselquist reported that in the neighborhood of Bethlehem and elsewhere steps had to be taken to guard against the inroads of foxes upon the vineyards when the grapes were ripe. (<em>Voyages and Travels in the Levant,</em> London, 1766, p. 184) Many feel that the jackal is meant at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200001564/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 63:10</a>, where reference is made to foxes as having a portion of those slain. The rendering “foxes” is, however, not inappropriate when considering that foxes also feed on carrion.</p>

<strong>Fountain, Spring</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The importance of springs or fountains becomes apparent from the frequence of town names beginning with “En,” meaning “spring,” “fountain.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011520/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Josh. 15:62;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011520/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 17:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011520/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 1 Ki. 1:9</a>) Towns and villages were often built near springs, as most of Palestine’s “rivers” are actually torrent valleys that dry up in the summer months. For defensive purposes cities were generally built on elevated sites, and, therefore, the springs were often outside the city walls in the valley below. This made the protection of the water supply vitally important. Conduits were constructed to convey the water from its source right into the city. King Hezekiah built such a conduit to bring the waters of Gihon <span id="page607" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="607" data-before-text="607"></span>to the city of David.

On the occasion of the Assyrian invasion of Judah, Hezekiah stopped up the fountains outside Jerusalem so as to leave the invaders without a water supply.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011520/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Chron. 32:2-4</a>; see CANALS; FORTIFICATIONS; HEZEKIAH.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>FIGURATIVE USE</strong></p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Jehovah established the “fountains of the watery deep” in the cloud masses above the earth.

<strong>What Is Better than Life?</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">David’s confidence in Jehovah had not been misplaced. That trust is well expressed in the concluding verse of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979570/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 63</a>. It says: “And the king himself will rejoice in God.

Others who, like David, could swear in Jehovah’s name with sincerity could boast or take pride in this. Why? Because they were able to do so on account of having an approved standing with the Most High. But those who speak falsehood in God’s name, who have no approved relationship with him, will have their mouths silenced in death.</p>

<strong>Guard Against Harmful Gossip!</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> Still another reason not to spread harmful gossip is that it can be murderous. Yes, it can be deadly, destroying an innocent person’s good reputation. Some tongues are ‘sharp swords,’ and bitter words are like arrows shot at the blameless from ambush. David prayed: “May you [Jehovah] conceal me from the confidential talk of evildoers, from the tumult of practicers of hurtfulness, who have sharpened their tongue just like a sword, who have <span id="page14" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>aimed their arrow, bitter speech, to shoot from concealed places at someone blameless.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1989763/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Psalm 64:2-4</a>) Would you want to be responsible for saying such evil things about a fellow human to the point that he felt compelled to pray to God for relief, as did the psalmist? Do you want to be guilty of what amounts to murder?</p>

<h1 id="p1" data-pid="1"><span id="page29" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span><strong>“The Righteous One Will Rejoice in Jehovah”</strong></h1></header><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">DIANA is over 80 years old. Her husband suffered from Alzheimer’s disease and was in a nursing home for some years before his death. She also had to cope with the death of her two sons and endured a battle with breast cancer. Yet, when members of Diana’s congregation see her at the Kingdom Hall or in the ministry, they note that she is always joyful.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">John was a traveling overseer for over 43 years. He loved that form of service​—it was his life! However, he discontinued serving in the traveling work to care for a sick relative, and now he serves in a local congregation. When those who knew John in the past meet him at an assembly or a convention, it seems that he has not changed at all. He still radiates joy.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">How is it possible for Diana and John to have joy? How can someone suffering emotionally and physically be joyful? And how can a person who no longer has a cherished privilege still be happy? The Bible gives us insight, saying: “The righteous one will rejoice in Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018684/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 64:10</a>) We can understand this vital truth more fully if we discern what causes inner joy and what does not.</p><h2 id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>JOY THAT IS TEMPORARY</strong></h2><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">You certainly know that some things almost always bring joy. Think of a couple in love who are getting married. Or what of becoming a parent or receiving a theocratic privilege? Such things bring joy and rightly so, for those aspects of life originate with Jehovah. He instituted marriage, made it possible to procreate, and gives work assignments through the Christian congregation.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018684/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 2:18,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018684/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018684/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Ps. 127:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018684/1/3" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 1 Tim. 3:1</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">However, some causes for joy can be temporary. Sadly, a spouse can become unfaithful or die. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018684/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezek. 24:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018684/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Hos. 3:1</a>) Some children disobey their parents and God, perhaps even being disfellowshipped. Samuel’s sons did not serve Jehovah acceptably, and David’s actions caused him calamity from within his own house. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018684/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Sam. 8:1-3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018684/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2 Sam. 12:11</a>) <span id="page30" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="30" data-before-text="30"></span>Such events bring grief and distress. They surely do not bring us joy.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Similarly, privileges of service among God’s people can end, possibly because of poor health, family obligations, or theocratic adjustments. Many of those going through such changes have admitted that they miss the satisfaction their work brought them.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">We can easily see that to some extent such sources of joy can be relative or temporary. Hence, is there another kind of joy, one that remains even when circumstances take an unfavorable turn? There must be, for Samuel, David, and others maintained a measure of joy while experiencing trials.</p><h2 id="p10" data-pid="10"><strong>JOY THAT IS LASTING</strong></h2><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Jesus knew what joy really is. During his prehuman existence in heaven, when circumstances were certainly favorable, he “rejoiced before [Jehovah] all the time.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018684/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Prov. 8:30</a>) On earth, however, he was at times confronted with severe difficulties. Still, Jesus found delight in doing his Father’s will. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018684/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 4:34</a>) What of his final painful hours? We read: “For the joy that was set before him he endured a torture stake.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018684/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Heb. 12:2</a>) We thus have good reason to consider two of Jesus’ comments about real joy.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Once, 70 disciples returned to Jesus after a preaching assignment. They were joyful because they had performed powerful works, even expelling demons. Then Jesus said to them: “Do not rejoice because the spirits are made subject to you, but rejoice because your names have been written in the heavens.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018684/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Luke 10:1-9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018684/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 17,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018684/7/2" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 20</a>) Yes, more important than enjoying a certain special privilege was having Jehovah’s approval. He would favorably remember the faithful disciples​—a cause for much greater joy.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">On another occasion, Jesus was addressing a crowd. A Jewish woman expressed her feelings that the mother of this remarkable teacher, Jesus, must be very happy. But Jesus corrected her, saying: “No, rather, happy are those hearing the word of God and keeping it!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018684/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 11:27, 28</a>) Being a proud parent <span id="page31" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="31" data-before-text="31"></span>can be a wonderful experience; yet, having a relationship with Jehovah because of obedience is a much greater reason for joy.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Indeed, sensing Jehovah’s approval is the key to having deep inner joy. Trials, though not enjoyable in themselves, do not change this awareness. On the contrary, enduring them with integrity is a victory that results in a good heart condition. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018684/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rom. 5:3-5</a>) Additionally, Jehovah gives his spirit to those who trust in him, and joy is part of its fruitage. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018684/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gal. 5:22</a>) That helps us to understand why <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018684/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 64:10</a> aptly states: “The righteous one will rejoice in Jehovah.”</p><img src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/w18/2018/1216" data-img-small-src="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/mp/r1/lp-e/w18/2018/1215" alt="John reads the Bible" width="113" height="63" class="north_center" />
<br/><strong>Picture description:</strong> John reads the Bible
<figcaption class="figcaption"><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> What has helped John to continue to find deep joy?</p></figcaption><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">This explains why Diana and John, mentioned earlier, could maintain lasting joy when they dealt with difficult circumstances. Diana comments: “I have taken refuge in Jehovah, as a child would with a parent.” How does she sense God’s approval? “I feel that he has blessed me with the ability to continue to preach on a regular basis with a smile on my face.” John, who kept active in the ministry after the end of his cherished traveling work, explains what greatly helped him: “Since 1998 when I was assigned to teach Ministerial Training School, I have done more personal study than ever before.” Speaking for himself and his wife, he adds: “Our general attitude about serving Jehovah over the years in whatever capacity we could has made this adjustment relatively easy. We have done it with no regrets.”</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Many others have also experienced the truthfulness of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018684/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 64:10</a>. Take, for instance, a couple who served for over 30 years at Bethel in the United States. They were then assigned to the field as special pioneers. Realistically, they admitted: “Grief is a natural process when you lose something you love,” but they added: “You can’t grieve forever.” They quickly got involved in the ministry with the congregation. The couple also commented: “We prayed about some very specific things. Then seeing our prayers answered encouraged us and brought us joy. Soon after we arrived, others in the congregation started pioneering, and we were blessed with two progressive Bible studies.”</p><h2 id="p17" data-pid="17"><strong>“JOYFUL FOREVER”</strong></h2><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Admittedly, it is not always easy to be joyful, and there will be ups and downs. Yet, Jehovah inspired the reassuring words that we find at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018684/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 64:10</a>. Even at times when we are discouraged, we can trust that those who prove themselves ‘righteous ones’ by remaining faithful despite changes in their circumstances “will rejoice in Jehovah.” Moreover, we can look forward to the fulfillment of Jehovah’s promise of “new heavens and a new earth.” Then imperfection will be completely removed. All of God’s people will “exult and be joyful forever” in what he is creating and providing.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018684/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Isa. 65:17, 18</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Imagine what this will mean: enjoying perfect health and starting each day full of energy. No matter what deep emotional wounds there were in the past, painful memories of them will not remain. We are assured that “the former things will not be called to mind, nor will they come up into the heart.” The miracle of the resurrection will reunite loved ones. Countless millions will feel as did the parents whose 12-year-old girl Jesus brought back to life: “They were beside themselves with great ecstasy.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2018684/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Mark 5:42</a>) Ultimately, every person on earth will be a “righteous one” in the fullest sense of the word and, to all eternity, will “rejoice in Jehovah.”</p>

True, there are rare instances in which words are addressed to Jesus Christ in heaven. Stephen, when about to die, appealed to Jesus, saying, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ac 7:59</a>) However, the context reveals a circumstance giving basis for this exceptional expression. Stephen at that very time had a vision of “Jesus standing at God’s right hand,” and evidently reacting as if he were in Jesus’ personal presence, he felt free to speak this plea to the one whom he recognized as the head of <span id="page668" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="668" data-before-text="668"></span>the Christian congregation. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ac 7:55, 56;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Col 1:18</a>) Similarly, the apostle John, at the conclusion of the Revelation, says, “Amen!

There is nothing to indicate that Christian disciples so expressed themselves under other circumstances to Jesus after his ascension to heaven. Thus, the apostle Paul writes: “In <em>everything</em> by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known <em>to God.”</em>​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Php 4:6</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The article <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/tc/r1/lp-e/1200003543/0">APPROACH TO GOD</a> considers the position of Christ Jesus as the one <em>through</em> whom prayer is directed.

Similarly, the Sovereign Ruler of the universe has the option to determine the extent of his personal involvement in any matter. The Scriptures teach that God has chosen to involve himself personally in our prayers and therefore direct us to address these to him.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992281/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 66:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992281/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 69:13</a>.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">God’s choice in this matter reveals his personal interest in the prayers of his human servants. Rather than discourage his people from approaching him with every thought and care, he exhorts them: “Pray incessantly,” “persevere in prayer,” “throw your burden upon Jehovah himself,” “throw all your anxiety upon [God].”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992281/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 5:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992281/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Romans 12:12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992281/1/2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Psalm 55:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992281/1/3" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 1 Peter 5:7</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">If God did not want to give attention to his servants’ prayers, he would never have arranged for such access to him and encouraged free use of it. This, then, God’s choosing to make himself so approachable to his people, is one reason for confidence that he actually listens. Yes, he gives consideration to each of his servants’ prayers.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Not to be overlooked is the fact that the Bible plainly states that God listens to prayer. The apostle John, for example, writes: “This is the confidence that we have toward him, that, no matter what it is that we ask according to his will, he hears us.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992281/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 John 5:14</a>) King David referred to Jehovah God as the “Hearer of prayer” and confidently asserted: “He hears my voice.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992281/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 55:17;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1992281/3/1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 65:2</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">So while the act of praying doubtless has benefits in itself, the Scriptures show that much more is involved when a righteous person prays.

They do not consist of formulas repeated by rote. No, they do not contain virtually meaningless doxologies, insincere expressions of praise. Prayers of that sort abound in Christendom and the rest of Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion. But true Christians heed Jesus’ counsel: “When you pray you are not to be as the hypocrites are; for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and at the corners of the main streets, so that they may be visible to men . . . And in praying do not parrot off words like the heathen; for they [erroneously] think they will get themselves listened to by the quantity of what they say.

For instance, the English writer John Bunyan (1628-88) said: “Prayer is a sincere, sensible, affectionate pouring out of the soul to God, through Christ, in the strength and assistance of the Spirit, for such things as God has promised.” Puritan minister Thomas Brooks (1608-80) observed: “God looks not at the oratory of your prayers, how elegant they may be; nor at the geometry of your prayers, how long they may be; nor at the arithmetic of your prayers, how many they may be; not at logic of your prayers, how methodical they may be; but the sincerity of them he looks at.” To these comments may be added Bunyan’s remark: “In prayer it is better to have a heart without words, than words without a heart.” But if we are sincere and do meet divine requirements, how can we be sure that the King of eternity will hear our prayers?</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>Never Turned Away</strong></p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">15.

This was made clear in Jesus’ heartwarming words when his disciples requested instruction on prayer. In part he said: “Who of you will have a friend and will go to him at midnight and say to him, ‘Friend, loan me three loaves, because a friend of mine has just come to me on a journey and I have nothing to set before him’? And that one from inside says in reply, ‘Quit making me trouble. The door is already locked, and my young children are with me in bed; I cannot rise up and give you anything.’ I tell you, Although he will not rise up and give him anything because of being his friend, certainly because of his bold persistence he will get up and give him what things he needs.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1990362/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Luke 11:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1990362/24/1" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 5-8</a>) What was the point of this illustration?</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">16.

Thus, Jesus continued: “I say to you, Keep on asking, and it will be given you; keep on seeking, and you will find; keep on knocking, and it will be opened to you. For everyone asking receives, and everyone seeking finds, and to everyone knocking it will be opened.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1990362/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Luke 11:9, 10</a>) Surely, then, we should keep praying when we experience persecution, distress over some deeply rooted personal weakness, or any other trial.

Hence, Jesus continued: “Indeed, which father is there among you who, if his son asks for a fish, will perhaps hand him a serpent instead of a fish? Or if he also asks for an egg, will hand him a scorpion? Therefore, if you, although being wicked, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more so will the Father in heaven give holy spirit to those asking him!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1990362/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Luke 11:11-13</a>) <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1990362/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Matthew 7:9-11</a> speaks of giving a stone instead of bread. The force of Jesus’ words is increased if we realize that the bread of ancient Bible lands was of a size and shape like that of a flat, round stone. Some kinds of serpents resemble certain types of fish, and there is a small white scorpion that somewhat resembles an egg. But if asked for bread, a fish, or an egg, what kind of father would give his child a stone, a serpent, or a scorpion?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Jesus next compared the dealings of an earthly parent with the actions of God toward the members of His family of worshipers.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1990362/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Psalm 55:22;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1990362/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 121:1-3</a>) And when we, as his faithful dedicated servants, ask for his holy spirit, he gives it to us unstintingly. This is our loving God, and we can have full faith that he is the Hearer of our prayers.</p>

<strong>Why and How You Pray—Does It Matter?</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">But is this mighty Creator truly interested in the prayers of his human creation? Or is he indifferent to man’s plight as are the callous gods of so many religions? Notice this warm description: “O <em>Hearer of prayer,</em> even to you people of all flesh will come.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/101980803/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 65:2</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Thus the Bible describes Jehovah God as the great Hearer of prayer. He invites the sincere prayers of people of all cultures and backgrounds. ‘That sounds good,’ you might say. ‘But does the record bear out that description?’ Yes, indeed!</p>

Sometimes the need was urgent because of the relentless pressure from his enemies, as is shown at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979363/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 70:1-5</a>. At other times the need arose on account of his own weakness and errors, some of which were serious. If you yourself happen to feel unworthy to approach God in prayer on this account, thinking that he will not hear you, we recommend that you read and reread <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979363/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 51:1-12</a>.

<strong>Are You Truly Approachable?</strong><br/><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">JEHOVAH God highly values approachability on the part of those who serve him. We should expect this. For God himself has set a superb example of approachability, being accessible to the prayer of people of all kinds, at all times, under all manner of circumstances.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974444/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 65:2</a>.</p>

<strong>Jehovah God, the Hearer of Prayer</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> In line with our theme, note also David’s words recorded in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969603/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 65</a>. Showing that worship can be expressed by way of contrast, he prays: “For you there is praise—silence—, O God, in Zion; and to you the vow will be paid.” He then says: “O Hearer of prayer, even to you people <span id="page497" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="497" data-before-text="497"></span>of all flesh will come.” Does this mean an unconditional approach, that we can find God everywhere, anywhere, as some believe? By no means. Notice what David was next inspired to say: “Happy is the one you choose and cause to approach, that he may reside in your courtyards. He will certainly be satisfied with the goodness of your house, the holy place of your temple.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969603/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 65:1-4</a>.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 7.

He definitely said that to Jehovah, the “Hearer of prayer, even to you people of <em>all flesh</em> will come.” What a gracious invitation is implied in these words! In close harmony with this, how appealing and definite are the words recorded by Isaiah: “And the foreigners that have joined themselves to Jehovah to minister to him and to love the name of Jehovah, in order to become servants to him . . . I will also bring them to my holy mountain [Zion] and make them rejoice inside my house of prayer . . . For my own house will be called even a house of prayer for all the peoples.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969603/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isa. 56:6, 7</a>; see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969603/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 6:32, 33</a>.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 8. How has Jehovah shown great mercy, first to spiritual Israel, then also to many “foreigners”?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Do you see yourself as one of these “foreigners,” that is, not as a spiritual Israelite with the heavenly hope, yet rejoicing in coming to know Jehovah and to love and serve him? Have you responded to the invitation to join with other sincere worshipers and come to Jehovah’s house of prayer? Even those of spiritual Israel needed to be gathered in this way, for during the World War I period they incurred Jehovah’s anger and fell into a sick, dispersed condition. But Jehovah, in his great mercy, restored them to his favor, besides opening the way for a great crowd of sheeplike people to be gathered in close union with the remnant of spiritual Israel. Isaiah’s prophecy goes on to confirm this very clearly, saying: “The utterance of the Lord Jehovah, who is collecting together the dispersed ones of Israel, is: ‘I shall collect together to him <em>others</em> besides those already collected together of his.’”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969603/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isa. 56:8</a>; see also <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969603/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isaiah 12:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969603/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Revelation 7:13-15</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 9.

But who taught him? He must have responded well to his parents’ instruction and training. They carried out the commandment given through Moses, to “love Jehovah your God with all your heart and all your soul and all your vital force. And these words that I am commanding you today must prove to be on your heart; and you must inculcate them in your son” at all times. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969603/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Deut. 6:4-7</a>) Thus David learned to appreciate and to fulfill the primary requirements of first imbibing accurate knowledge from a reliable source, God’s written Word. He being teachable and having the right heart condition, this knowledge and understanding strengthened his faith, which, as we have seen, he was not slow to demonstrate from his early youth onward. Along with his faith, there was built up in him a great love and loyalty toward Jehovah, which nothing could break, even though once or twice he grievously erred.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">10. Is a course similar to David’s possible and necessary today, this leading to what question?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> You may not have the same advantages as David enjoyed from early infancy, but there is no other way. There is no shortcut. You can start by taking in accurate knowledge and gain a proper understanding of God’s will and purpose as revealed in his Word. This course must be maintained. You must keep searching and digging as for hid treasure, building a foundation that grows ever broader and <span id="page498" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="498" data-before-text="498"></span>deeper. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1969603/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Prov. 2:1-9</a>) This intake of knowledge and understanding must be responded to and acted on, allowing it to produce a strong faith in Jehovah and love for him, leading to dedication. It can be done. It has been done from earliest times, commencing with Abel. It is being done today by men and women and young folk of varying temperaments and from all walks of life, some with a poor and adverse background. Granted, we all need much help and encouragement, and this includes learning how to pray. However, like David, we can be greatly aided by maintaining close association with God’s city and God’s house. But where are these to be found today? Is it a literal city and a literal house?</p>

<strong>Why Expect God to Listen to Prayer?</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"><span id="page72" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="72" data-before-text="72"></span>When it comes to praying for God’s mercy and forgiveness of sin, God’s servants can use the fact of their inherited sin and imperfection. Thus David pleaded with Jehovah to forgive his sin against Uriah: “Look! With error I was brought forth with birth pains, and in sin my mother conceived me.” King Solomon took note of the same thing in his prayer at the dedication of the temple of Jehovah: “In case they sin against you (for there is no man that does not sin), and you have to be incensed at them and abandon them to the enemy, . . . and they indeed come to their senses . . . and they actually return and make request to you for favor . . . you must forgive your people who had sinned against you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 51:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 1 Ki. 8:46-50</a>.</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">In fact, Jehovah himself tells that he takes man’s inherited imperfection into consideration in dealing with him: “Never again shall I call down evil upon the ground on man’s account, because the inclination of the heart of man is bad from his youth up; and never again shall I deal every living thing a blow just as I have done.” God’s servants, therefore, have ample reason for expecting God to listen to their prayers when they ask for mercy and forgiveness on the basis of inherited weakness, because of the original sin of Adam.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Gen. 8:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Rom. 5:12</a>.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>JEHOVAH’S LOVING-KINDNESS</strong></p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">And lastly, God’s servants can always plead their cause with Jehovah, that is, expect him to listen to their prayers, on the basis of his being a God of loving-kindness and mercy. Thus, when Jehovah was ready to wipe out the Israelites because of their having rebelled, Moses pleaded, not only on the basis of Jehovah’s name as being involved, but also on the basis of his being a God of loving-kindness: “And now, please, let your power become great, O Jehovah, just as you have spoken, saying, ‘Jehovah, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness, pardoning error and transgression . . . Forgive, please, the error of this people according to the greatness of your loving-kindness.”’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Num. 14:17-19</a>) Yes, Jehovah had told Moses that He is a God of mercy and loving-kindness, when Moses had asked to see his glory, and so now Moses could properly remind Jehovah of that fact. King David pleaded on this basis (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ps. 51:1</a>) and so did the prophet Daniel on behalf of his people: “Incline your ear, O my God, and hear . . . for not according to our righteous acts are we letting our entreaties fall before you, but according to your many mercies.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Dan. 9:18</a>.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">No question about it, the Bible does not reveal an absentee-God such as the deist would have us believe that the great Creator is. No, he is interested in his creatures, and that for good reasons. He therefore invites them, yes, commands them to come to him in prayer, in praise, thanksgiving and with supplications. He welcomes their prayers on the basis of his name and because of their having kept integrity. Furthermore, he lets them plead on the basis of their human imperfection and inherited sin and also on the basis of his glorying in showing loving-kindness.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">The Bible speaks of God as the “Hearer of prayer.” But that does not mean he listens and favorably acts on all prayers, for, as is implicit in the foregoing, one must pray to the one true God and in the right manner and about right things to be heard by Him. Those meeting these conditions will find in their own lives that God is indeed the “Hearer of prayer,” that is, hearing in the sense of listening and answering prayer. Happy are those who thus pray!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 65:2</a>.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"></p>

Though your faith may not be strong to begin with, it must be true. “Jehovah is near . . . to all those who call upon him in trueness.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1979363/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 145:18</a>.</p>

In what way will <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965283/42/0" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Micah 4:3, 4</a> work out as a prophecy?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> In that peaceful, warless world the prophecy of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965283/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Micah 4:3, 4</a> will also work out in a literal way: “They will not lift up sword, nation against nation, neither will they learn war any more. And they will actually sit, each one under his vine and under his fig tree, and there will be no one making them tremble; for the very mouth of Jehovah of armies has spoken it.”</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>MORE THAN MATERIAL FOOD</strong></p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">12. Will the providing of material food be enough for mankind under God’s kingdom, and what did Jesus say about the means of living?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> More than just material food and drink will be provided for all the peoples who are favored with living under God’s kingdom by his Son Jesus Christ. Today the man that has everything that his heart could wish in the way of food and drink, including what the doctors of his health may prescribe, cannot keep himself alive forever. More than material food is needed <em>now;</em> more than natural food will be needed <em>then</em> under God’s kingdom. Jesus Christ, even at the end of a forty-day fast, quoted God’s own words and said: “It is written, ‘Man must live, not on bread alone, but on every utterance coming forth through Jehovah’s mouth.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965283/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 4:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965283/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Deut. 8:3</a>) Even more than material food, spiritual food is needed, and this spiritual food is the Word of God. His Word is his instructions and his commandments telling us what to do. Living in harmony with his Word and the doing of his will serve as real life-sustaining food and drink for mankind.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">13. What did Jesus say about his own food and about the inadequacy of material abundance as regards life?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> The greatest man ever on earth, namely, Jesus Christ, pointed out that fact. On another occasion when he was hungry, and before eating the natural food offered to him, he said: “My food is for me to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965283/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">John 4:34</a>) In a warning against becoming victims of materialism Jesus said: “Guard against every sort of covetousness, because even when a person has an abundance his life does not result from the things he possesses.” “For the soul is worth more than food and the body than clothing.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965283/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Luke 12:15,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965283/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 23</a>) There is the danger, especially for the hungry, to make material earthly food a god and to worship their belly as their god.</p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">14. In what form do hungry Indians want God to appear to them, but who else also can make their belly their god?</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Years ago the Indian saint, Mahatma Gandhi, pointed to the frantic urge of India’s underfed masses, living on one meal <span id="page246" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="246" data-before-text="246"></span>or less a day, to do this very thing. For publication he said: “To the millions who have to go without two meals a day the only acceptable form in which God dare appear is food.” Yet not only the starving masses but also the ones abundantly provided for can make bodily food one of their false gods and treat their belly as a god and ignore the true God and his provisions for everlasting life.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965283/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Phil. 3:19</a>; New York <em>Times Magazine,</em> December 20, 1959, page 28.</p>
