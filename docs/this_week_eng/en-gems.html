<strong>Walk in the Way of Integrity</strong><br/><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> While God’s sovereignty is not dependent on the integrity of his creatures, humans and spirit sons of God can demonstrate where they stand on this issue. How? By choosing to follow a course of integrity or not. An individual’s integrity, then, is a solid basis on which he or she can be judged.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 3. (a) What did Job and David want Jehovah to inspect and judge? (b) What questions arise about integrity?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> With confidence Job said: “[Jehovah] will weigh me in accurate scales and God will get to know my integrity.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004883/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 31:6</a>) Integrity is what King David of ancient Israel asked Jehovah to inspect when he prayed: <em>“Judge me, O Jehovah, for I myself have walked in my own integrity, and in Jehovah I have trusted, that I may not wobble.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004883/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 26:1</a>) How vital that we too walk in the way of integrity! But what is integrity, and what does it mean to walk in its way? What will help us stay on the course of integrity?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>‘I Have Walked in My Integrity’</strong></p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 4. What is integrity?</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Integrity carries the thought of being upright, blameless, righteous, and faultless. However, integrity involves more than doing what is right. It is moral soundness or completeness of heart devotion to God. Satan questioned Job’s motives when he told God: “For a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch as far as [Job’s] bone and his flesh and see whether he will not curse you to your very face.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004883/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 2:5</a>) Along with proper action, integrity requires right heart motivation.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 5. What shows that keeping integrity does not call for perfection on our part?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Keeping integrity, however, does not call for perfection. King David was imperfect and made several serious mistakes during his life. Yet, the Bible speaks of him as a man who walked “with integrity of heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004883/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Kings 9:4</a>) Why? Because David loved Jehovah. His heart was devoted to God. He willingly acknowledged his errors, accepted reproof, and corrected his ways. Indeed, David’s integrity is seen in his wholehearted devotion and love for his God, Jehovah.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004883/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:5, 6</a>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">6, 7. What does walking in integrity involve?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> Integrity is not restricted to a certain aspect of human behavior, such as religious devotion. It embraces our entire way of life. David “walked” in his integrity. “The verb ‘walk’ connotes ‘walk of life’ or ‘life-style,’” says <em>The New Interpreter’s Bible.</em> Speaking of those who are “faultless in their way,” the <span id="page14" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>psalmist sang: “Happy are those observing [God’s] reminders; with all the heart they keep searching for him. Really they have practiced no unrighteousness. In his ways they have walked.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004883/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 119:1-3</a>) Integrity calls for constantly searching to do God’s will and walking in his way.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Walking in integrity requires loyal attachment to God, even in unfavorable circumstances. When we bear up under trials, remain firm despite adversities, or resist temptations from the ungodly world, our integrity becomes evident. We ‘make Jehovah’s heart rejoice’ in that he is able to make a reply to the one who is taunting him. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004883/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Proverbs 27:11</a>) With good reason, then, we can resolve as Job did: “Until I expire I shall not take away my integrity from myself!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004883/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 27:5</a>) The 26th Psalm shows what will help us to walk in integrity.</p>

<strong>Are You a “Full-Grown” Christian?</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Growing to maturity also involves putting forth effort to keep your integrity. As recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000606/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 26:1</a>, David declared: “Judge me, O Jehovah, for I myself have walked in my own integrity.” Integrity is moral soundness, completeness. However, it does not mean perfection. David himself committed several serious sins. But because he accepted reproof and corrected his way, he demonstrated that his heart still retained genuine love for Jehovah God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000606/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 26:2, 3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000606/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 6,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000606/13/2" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000606/13/3" data-bid="14-4" class="b"> 11</a>) Integrity involves wholeness, or completeness, of heart devotion. David told his son Solomon: “Know the God of your father and serve him with a complete heart.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000606/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>.</p>

<strong>Our Spiritual Health and the Kidneys</strong><br/><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> Christians who are keeping their integrity toward Jehovah welcome examination by him. They plead for it, just as the psalmist David did. Said David: “Judge me [or, Do me justice], O Jehovah, for I myself have walked in my own integrity, and in Jehovah I have trusted, that I may not wobble. Examine me, O Jehovah, and put me to the test; refine my kidneys and my heart. For your loving-kindness is in front of my eyes, and I have walked in your truth.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977805/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ps. 26:1-3</a>, <em>NW; Rotherham.</em></p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">25. What was David asking for by requesting Jehovah to refine his kidneys, and with what confidence?</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"><sup>25</sup></span> In David’s case, walking in personal integrity and walking in God’s truth went together hand in hand. In our own case today, God’s truth is also needed for us to walk on in integrity toward Him. Along with being examined and tested, David wanted his kidneys to be refined. He wanted God to make a proof of him as a person with a fiery procedure such as a metal refiner would make when refining gold and silver. David was sure that, despite such a searching of him through and through, Jehovah would find no “dross” in him, no uncleanness, no spiritually diseased condition. He would not be found suffering, as it were, from kidney stones.</p>

Would you like to be able to say that about your life course? Would you like to be able to describe your life course as one of moral soundness, honesty, free from corrupting practices? These are some of the thoughts involved in the word “integrity” and that David doubtless had in mind when he made that statement.

Are you? Do you want to be able conscientiously to ask Jehovah to judge you, to examine you, to put you to the test, feeling that God will find you are a person of integrity? How wonderful it would be to be in such a position.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971643/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 26:1, 2</a>.</p>

<strong>Flee from Desires Incidental to Youth</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Youths, be a good influence for your generation. Talk to your friends about everlasting life in the new world. Show them that the Bible can be understood by young as well as old. Point out to your neighborhood associates and fellow school students that the most important things in life are not the latest dance step and the names of the latest television and movie stars, but that Jehovah God and Christ Jesus are the ones they should know and imitate. Prove to the world by your example and conduct that the only solution for delinquency of youth today is to teach them God’s Word and to serve Jehovah God, the Creator. So youths in the New World society must flee from the old-world <span id="page367" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="367" data-before-text="367"></span>amusements, its obscene talk, its jokes, its materialism, its immorality and other wrong desires that are nothing more than snares put there by the hater of youth, Satan the Devil. Look ahead to the most cherished ambition of obedient youths today, that of being a full-time minister of the good news. Being a Christian minister of Jehovah is the grandest career that today’s youths could occupy or be trained for. This is the course that leads to endless life and can be a channel through which others can also receive life. You young ministers, study diligently and work hard so that you can be better preachers and representatives of Jehovah’s New World society, all to the honor and praise of Jehovah’s name.</p>

<strong>Hold Fast Your Joy!</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> Do you humbly acknowledge your entire dependence upon Jehovah for life and its blessings? Then you should also humbly acknowledge your dependence on his earthly organization today. There is no place of real safety outside God’s New World society. All lovers of life must find their place, and hold their place, within that society, regularly attending the <em>Watchtower</em> study meeting, the service meeting and theocratic ministry school, listening attentively to the public Bible talks, and supporting the midweek congregation book study. Happy are all those that crowd all these meetings into a busy week, for in so doing they are crowding out the inconsequential things that the enemy would like to sow in their Christian lives. Happy, because they are conscious of their spiritual need! Happy, because they are pressing on to maturity with all of God’s people throughout the wide world! Happy, because they are building up strength to <span id="page115" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="115" data-before-text="115"></span>withstand the final assault from Satan’s world, which even now heaps scorn and persecutions on their heads! “Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you and lyingly say every kind of wicked thing against you for my [Jesus’] sake. Rejoice and leap for joy, since your reward is great in the heavens.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Matt. 5:11, 12</a>.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">20.

Remember how our German brothers maintained their entity of organization while they were being compelled to flee from the Sachsenhausen concentration camp at the climax of World War II. Amid shootings, machine-gunnings, pillagings and death by exhaustion, our 230 brothers marched out in theocratic order, the one group in all that confusion of death and warfare that trusted in Jehovah God. Did Jehovah answer their united prayer for guidance? Did he lead and protect that small group of his worshipers? The report says: “From our troop of about 230 brothers and sisters none, not even the weakest, was lying on the road, despite the fact that we had some brothers from 65 to 72 years of age. They were all standing faithfully.”<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1961122/0">a</a> During future trials, and through Armageddon’s battle itself, the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses expects to keep standing faithfully, in the one united, theocratic order. Now is the time to seek that association, so that you also may find joy in saying: “In Jehovah I have trusted, that I may not wobble. My own foot will certainly stand on a level place; among the congregated throngs I shall bless Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ps. 26:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/33/1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 12</a>.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">21.

What a lot the people of the old world are missing! They are also missing the opportunity for everlasting life. Make sure that <em>you</em> take a firm hold on the real life. Having found that joy, never let it go! “Always be rejoicing. Pray incessantly. In connection with everything give thanks.

<strong>The Confidence of the Upright</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> When David was a young man he was chosen by Jehovah to be king. From the time of his anointing by the prophet Samuel he had special responsibilities. He took care of them, always seeking Jehovah. After many trials and hardships he was placed on the throne of Jehovah over the nation of Israel. One of his great joys was the bringing of the sacred ark of the covenant to the holy city of Jerusalem and establishing the place of worship of Jehovah there. On Mount Zion Jehovah’s altar was built and all Israel praised Jehovah <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>there. Of this place he said: “O Jehovah, who will be a guest in your tent? Who will reside in your holy mountain?

Many prophets were sent to God’s chosen people after David’s death and their statements were written down in God’s Word for our admonition and learning. In addition to that we have the life of Christ and the Acts of the Apostles and the writings of the disciples, and now these many scriptures make up the complete Bible, the whole Word of God, for all mankind to follow. Thus equipped, Christians today should and could “practice righteousness and speak truth” and have confidence in their integrity toward Jehovah as David had! Studying and understanding God’s Word and living by it should assure one that he will not wobble.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>CHRISTENDOM WITHOUT CONFIDENCE</strong></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 5, 6.

Can these who are on the roll books of the various churches say confidently: ‘Examine me, O Jehovah, and put me to the test; refine my kidneys and my heart’? What is wrong? Where today are the men of integrity that David foreshadowed?”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> More such questions can be asked: Can Christendom stand to be examined? Can Jehovah find faith in her? Do the leaders of Christendom have as clear a conscience as David? Are they able to come to Jehovah in prayer and ask him to examine, test and refine them? Are they confident that they are living up to the standards that Jehovah has set out in his Word, the Holy Bible? Do they believe all its teachings? Can all the hundreds of millions of Christendom today who are taught by the clergy be just as confident in their integrity toward Jehovah God as David was? The answer to every query is No! But they should have the faith of David if they have made a dedication to do the will and the service of God. Christendom and its supporters claim faithfulness. They say they believe the Bible and they call themselves Christians—Christlike. Whether they ask for it or not, they are being examined before Jehovah God.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 7. How has Christendom repudiated God’s Word? In support of whom? How unlike Christ Jesus?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> There is no backing up and running away from the judgment of Jehovah the Almighty God. Christendom has repudiated God’s Word by her own teachings. She has gone with this wicked world in its politics, because she supports them. She certainly is not for God’s kingdom, because Christendom gives full support to the United Nations organization. Christendom is not like Jesus, who told Pilate: “My kingdom is no part of this world. If my kingdom were part of this world, my attendants would have fought that I should not be delivered up to the Jews. But, as it is, my kingdom is not from this source.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 18:36</a>) <span id="page10" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>No, Christendom, upon examination, cannot be refined. She has no real, good, worthwhile material in her. She has compromised with this wicked old world, from which God’s kingdom could not come. Listen to what David wrote: “O Jehovah, you have searched through me and you know [me]. You have examined my heart, you have made inspection by night, you have refined me; you will discover [that] I have not schemed.

This eagerness to <span id="page750" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="750" data-before-text="750"></span>be judged by the divine court shows itself in these words of David: “Judge me, O Jehovah, for I myself have walked in my own integrity, and in Jehovah I have trusted, that I may not wobble. Examine me, O Jehovah, and put me to the test; refine my kidneys [or, my deepest emotions] and my heart. For your loving-kindness is in front of my eyes, and I have walked in your truth.” Regardless of what other men did, regardless of the opposition and persecution by his enemies, King David was bent on going ahead in his wholeheartedness toward Jehovah God. Prayerfully he said: “As for me, in my integrity I shall walk. O redeem me and show me favor. My own foot will certainly stand on a level place; among the congregated throngs I shall bless Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 26:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 11, 12</a>, <em>margin</em>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 8.

Do we not owe integrity toward God, who is our Creator and who promises to be our everlasting Preserver in his upright new world? Yes, for he has given us our life and, according to his purposes that he has revealed in the Holy Bible, he has given us something to live for. What? That promised new world under the perfect government of his Son Jesus Christ. Our walking in integrity toward our Creator and Preserver can be done in no way other than walking according to the truth and the principles that He lays down for us in his written Word. We know that all his creation moves and operates according to laws that he laid down. So he must be a God of principle in all things. To win his favor for a happy life in his endless new world we must prove ourselves persons of integrity.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 9.

We must be people of God’s principles. By this we do not mean the elementary things, that is, the basic things or fundamental teachings of God’s written Word, such as those mentioned in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Hebrews 5:12</a>: “You again need someone to teach you from the beginning the first principles of the sacred pronouncements of God.”</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">10.

(<em>Webster</em>) Because a principle thus means an ordered life, James could say to the apostle Paul: “You are walking orderly, you yourself also keeping the Law.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 21:24</a>) Paul himself also could say to his brothers in Christ: “To what extent we have made progress, let us go on walking orderly in this same routine”; and, “all those who will walk orderly by this rule of conduct, upon them be peace and mercy, even upon the Israel of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Phil. 3:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Gal. 6:16</a>) To live according to God’s principles requires us to walk orderly, in harmony with the rules he has laid down for our guidance and government. His Son, Jesus Christ, while he was on earth, set us a perfect example of living according to the principles of Jehovah God, his Father. We are therefore warned against walking “according to the elementary things of the world and not according to Christ; because it is in him [Christ] that all the fullness of the divine quality dwells.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Col. 2:8, 9</a>.</p>

<strong>Kidneys</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Our Creator knows the makeup of man in the most thorough and intimate way. Therefore, Jehovah is said to test out “heart and kidneys,” even as his Son also searches “the kidneys and hearts.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002605/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps 7:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002605/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Re 2:23</a>) Just as one refines silver, Jehovah can “refine” the kidneys and heart of a person so he may become right before God, being made more sensitive to Jehovah’s ways.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002605/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps 26:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200002605/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 66:10</a>.</p>

Of course not! David, like all of us, was imperfect and unable to measure up perfectly to God’s standards. Because of his weaknesses, David committed several serious wrongs, but he nevertheless ‘walked with integrity of heart.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007603/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Kings 9:4</a>) How? By accepting reproof and correcting his way. He thereby showed that he genuinely loved Jehovah. His devotion to God was complete.</p>

Figuratively, the kidneys represent one’s deepest thoughts and emotions. And the figurative heart is the total inner person​—his motivation, feelings, and intellect.

It means that divine counsel reached the deepest parts of David’s being and settled there, correcting his innermost thoughts and emotions. So it can be with us if we appreciatively reflect on the counsel that we receive through God’s Word, his representatives, and his organization and allow it to settle deep within us. Regularly praying to Jehovah to refine us in this way will help us walk in integrity.</p>

	<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page219" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="219" data-before-text="219"></span><strong>The Kidneys—Why Used Symbolically</strong></p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THROUGHOUT the Bible, even as in everyday usage, the various parts of the human body are used in a symbolic or figurative way. Among these are the hands, the shoulders and the heart. Such figurative use of words not only is expressive and adds force to speech but often is quite enlightening. In particular is the heart used in a figurative way both in the Bible and in everyday language.</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">However, there are certain figurative expressions found in the Bible that have no counterpart in modern usage, at least not in English. Among these are the kidneys. In Biblical Hebrew the word for kidneys is <em>kelayoth.</em> Of the some thirty times it occurs in the Hebrew Scriptures about one-third of the times the reference is to kidneys in a figurative sense. Thus we read: “Examine me, O Jehovah, and put me to the test; refine my kidneys and my heart.” “Jehovah of armies is judging with righteousness; he is examining the kidneys and the heart.” “I, Jehovah, am searching the heart, examining the kidneys, even to give to each one according to his ways, according to the fruitage of his dealings.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 26:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/0/1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Jer. 11:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/0/2" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 17:10</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Why do the Scripture writers use the kidneys in a symbolic sense? For more than one reason. In cutting up animals for sacrifice—the kidneys are repeatedly mentioned in the Levitical code of sacrifices—the Israelites could not help noting that they came upon the kidneys last; they were buried the deepest. The kidneys would therefore well stand for or represent the deepest part of man, his inmost or deepest thoughts and feelings. That is why we read at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jeremiah 12:2</a>: “They keep going ahead; they have also produced fruit. You are near in their mouth, but far away from their kidneys,” far away from the inmost thoughts and feelings of such wicked ones.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">No doubt the kidneys were associated with the deepest emotions also because these emotions affect the kidneys. Thus authorities on psychosomatic medicine tell us that sustained emotional strain can well cause such disturbances as <em>diabetes insipidous,</em> in which the kidneys fail to function properly. (This should not be confused with <em>diabetes mellitus</em> or “sugar” diabetes.)—<em>Emotions and Bodily Changes,</em> Dunbar.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Because of this we find that various Bible dictionaries and commentaries have the following to say about the symbolic use of “kidneys”: “The kidneys were considered the seat of affections and emotions and the most vital and sensitive part of man.” “The kidneys, from the sensitiveness of that part of the person, were believed to be the seat of longing and desire.” “The Orientals regarded the kidneys as the seat of the desires and affections, and hence under them spoke of the soul in respect to its inmost purposes or cravings.” “The most secret workings and affections of the heart.”</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In keeping with all the foregoing we note that in the <em>New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures,</em> First Edition, whenever “kidneys” is used with this symbolic or figurative sense there is a footnote reading, “deepest emotions.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 7:9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 16:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/2" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 26:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/3" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> Prov. 23:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/4" data-bid="3-5" class="b"> Jer. 11:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/5" data-bid="3-6" class="b"> 12:2;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/6" data-bid="3-7" class="b"> 17:10;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/2/7" data-bid="3-8" class="b"> 20:12</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">As for the use of “kidneys” in the Christian Greek Scriptures, the Greek word for “kidneys,” <em>nephros,</em> is found only once, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 2:23</a>. There, in the <em>New World Translation</em> it is freely rendered “inmost thoughts.” “Her children I will kill with deadly plague, so that all the congregations will know that I am he who searches the <em>inmost thoughts</em> and hearts, and I will give to you individually according to your deeds.”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The word “kidneys” when used figuratively in the Scriptures has but the one meaning, that of deepest or inmost emotions or thoughts. Many modern translators render the Hebrew and Greek words for “kidneys” as “heart.” However, strictly speaking, “kidneys” used in a symbolic sense goes deeper than does “heart” when applied to the emotions, feelings. Thus both Job and Jeremiah spoke of being wounded in the kidneys, meaning a very deep wound.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 16:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Lam. 3:13</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Whenever we ask Jehovah God, as did David, to examine our “kidneys” we mean for him to make a most searching examination, one that takes in the deepest emotions, thoughts, feelings. Being omniscient and omnipotent, Jehovah God has no difficulty at all in making such an examination. “All things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of him.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965247/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Heb. 4:13</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"></p>

<strong>The Confidence of the Upright</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> When David was a young man he was chosen by Jehovah to be king. From the time of his anointing by the prophet Samuel he had special responsibilities. He took care of them, always seeking Jehovah. After many trials and hardships he was placed on the throne of Jehovah over the nation of Israel. One of his great joys was the bringing of the sacred ark of the covenant to the holy city of Jerusalem and establishing the place of worship of Jehovah there. On Mount Zion Jehovah’s altar was built and all Israel praised Jehovah <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>there. Of this place he said: “O Jehovah, who will be a guest in your tent? Who will reside in your holy mountain? He who is walking faultlessly and practicing righteousness and speaking the truth in his heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 15:1, 2</a>) David wanted to measure up to those requirements and to be strong, not weak or unsteady. So he had to trust in God. “In Jehovah I have trusted, that I may not wobble.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 26:1</a>) David’s reliance and faith in Jehovah were unshakable, undisturbed, calm, and there was no wavering on his part, for he was walking as one should who ‘loved the dwelling of Jehovah’s house.’</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 4. What helps true Christians today to be confident in their integrity, as David was?</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> Today true Christians, followers of Christ Jesus, believe in the same God of David and they too want to worship at “the place of the residence of [Jehovah’s] glory.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 26:8</a>) Christians have the same Word of God that David had, only more of it. Many prophets were sent to God’s chosen people after David’s death and their statements were written down in God’s Word for our admonition and learning. In addition to that we have the life of Christ and the Acts of the Apostles and the writings of the disciples, and now these many scriptures make up the complete Bible, the whole Word of God, for all mankind to follow. Thus equipped, Christians today should and could “practice righteousness and speak truth” and have confidence in their integrity toward Jehovah as David had! Studying and understanding God’s Word and living by it should assure one that he will not wobble.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>CHRISTENDOM WITHOUT CONFIDENCE</strong></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 5, 6.

Can these who are on the roll books of the various churches say confidently: ‘Examine me, O Jehovah, and put me to the test; refine my kidneys and my heart’? What is wrong? Where today are the men of integrity that David foreshadowed?”</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> More such questions can be asked: Can Christendom stand to be examined? Can Jehovah find faith in her? Do the leaders of Christendom have as clear a conscience as David? Are they able to come to Jehovah in prayer and ask him to examine, test and refine them? Are they confident that they are living up to the standards that Jehovah has set out in his Word, the Holy Bible? Do they believe all its teachings? Can all the hundreds of millions of Christendom today who are taught by the clergy be just as confident in their integrity toward Jehovah God as David was? The answer to every query is No! But they should have the faith of David if they have made a dedication to do the will and the service of God. Christendom and its supporters claim faithfulness. They say they believe the Bible and they call themselves Christians—Christlike. Whether they ask for it or not, they are being examined before Jehovah God.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 7. How has Christendom repudiated God’s Word? In support of whom? How unlike Christ Jesus?</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> There is no backing up and running away from the judgment of Jehovah the Almighty God. Christendom has repudiated God’s Word by her own teachings. She has gone with this wicked world in its politics, because she supports them. She certainly is not for God’s kingdom, because Christendom gives full support to the United Nations organization. Christendom is not like Jesus, who told Pilate: “My kingdom is no part of this world. If my kingdom were part of this world, my attendants would have fought that I should not be delivered up to the Jews. But, as it is, my kingdom is not from this source.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 18:36</a>) <span id="page10" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>No, Christendom, upon examination, cannot be refined. She has no real, good, worthwhile material in her. She has compromised with this wicked old world, from which God’s kingdom could not come. Listen to what David wrote: “O Jehovah, you have searched through me and you know [me]. You have examined my heart, you have made inspection by night, you have refined me; you will discover [that] I have not schemed. My mouth will not transgress.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 139:1;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 17:3</a>) Can Christendom say that?

<strong>Deliverance for Integrity Toward God</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> He was therefore willing to appear before God’s judgment throne and be examined as to his pure, honest intentions and his faithful efforts to worship Jehovah alone as God and to serve Him only as the Supreme Sovereign over all the universe. This eagerness to <span id="page750" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="750" data-before-text="750"></span>be judged by the divine court shows itself in these words of David: “Judge me, O Jehovah, for I myself have walked in my own integrity, and in Jehovah I have trusted, that I may not wobble. Examine me, O Jehovah, and put me to the test; refine my kidneys [or, my deepest emotions] and my heart. For your loving-kindness is in front of my eyes, and I have walked in your truth.” Regardless of what other men did, regardless of the opposition and persecution by his enemies, King David was bent on going ahead in his wholeheartedness toward Jehovah God. Prayerfully he said: “As for me, in my integrity I shall walk. O redeem me and show me favor. My own foot will certainly stand on a level place; among the congregated throngs I shall bless Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 26:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 11, 12</a>, <em>margin</em>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 8.

Do we not owe integrity toward God, who is our Creator and who promises to be our everlasting Preserver in his upright new world? Yes, for he has given us our life and, according to his purposes that he has revealed in the Holy Bible, he has given us something to live for. What? That promised new world under the perfect government of his Son Jesus Christ. Our walking in integrity toward our Creator and Preserver can be done in no way other than walking according to the truth and the principles that He lays down for us in his written Word. We know that all his creation moves and operates according to laws that he laid down. So he must be a God of principle in all things. To win his favor for a happy life in his endless new world we must prove ourselves persons of integrity.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 9.

(<em>Webster</em>) Because a principle thus means an ordered life, James could say to the apostle Paul: “You are walking orderly, you yourself also keeping the Law.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 21:24</a>) Paul himself also could say to his brothers in Christ: “To what extent we have made progress, let us go on walking orderly in this same routine”; and, “all those who will walk orderly by this rule of conduct, upon them be peace and mercy, even upon the Israel of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Phil. 3:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Gal. 6:16</a>) To live according to God’s principles requires us to walk orderly, in harmony with the rules he has laid down for our guidance and government. His Son, Jesus Christ, while he was on earth, set us a perfect example of living according to the principles of Jehovah God, his Father. We are therefore warned against walking “according to the elementary things of the world and not according to Christ; because it is in him [Christ] that all the fullness of the divine quality dwells.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Col. 2:8, 9</a>.</p>

What helped David to walk in God’s truth?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> <em>“Your loving-kindness is in front of my eyes,”</em> continued David, <em>“and I have walked</em> <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span><em>in your truth.”</em> (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004883/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 26:3</a>) David well knew God’s acts of loving-kindness, and he appreciatively meditated on them. “Bless Jehovah, O my soul,” he sang, “and do not forget all his doings.” Remembering one of God’s “doings,” David continued: “Jehovah is executing acts of righteousness and judicial decisions for all those being defrauded. He made known his ways to Moses, his dealings even to the sons of Israel.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004883/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Psalm 103:2,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004883/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 6, 7</a>) Perhaps David was thinking of the defrauding of the Israelites by the Egyptians in the days of Moses. If so, reflecting on how Jehovah made known his ways of deliverance to Moses must have touched David’s heart and strengthened his determination to walk in God’s truth.</p>

<strong>Our Spiritual Health and the Kidneys</strong><br/><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> Christians who are keeping their integrity toward Jehovah welcome examination by him. They plead for it, just as the psalmist David did. Said David: “Judge me [or, Do me justice], O Jehovah, for I myself have walked in my own integrity, and in Jehovah I have trusted, that I may not wobble. Examine me, O Jehovah, and put me to the test; refine my kidneys and my heart. For your loving-kindness is in front of my eyes, and I have walked in your truth.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977805/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Ps. 26:1-3</a>, <em>NW; Rotherham.</em></p><p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">25.

In our own case today, God’s truth is also needed for us to walk on in integrity toward Him. Along with being examined and tested, David wanted his kidneys to be refined. He wanted God to make a proof of him as a person with a fiery procedure such as a metal refiner would make when refining gold and silver. David was sure that, despite such a searching of him through and through, Jehovah would find no “dross” in him, no uncleanness, no spiritually diseased condition. He would not be found suffering, as it were, from kidney stones.</p>

<strong>Fortify Yourself So as to Maintain Integrity</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> As was mentioned at the outset, King David of Israel sought Jehovah’s judgment as to his integrity. We too should do so. To get Jehovah’s view on the matter of how to fortify our integrity, we can examine <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971643/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 26</a>, wherein David speaks of this subject in prayer to Jehovah.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">13. How is personal study involved with integrity?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> In <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971643/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps 26 verse 3</a> David says to God: “For your loving-kindness is in front of my eyes, and I have walked in your truth.” For this to be true of us, we need to be acquainted with Jehovah and his truth. That means we should be students of the Bible. So, then, one way to fortify ourselves is by personal study. Daily Bible reading is a fine practice in this connection. Then, too, we have the written material provided through Jehovah’s organization <span id="page528" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="528" data-before-text="528"></span>from which we can derive benefit. Many say they have more to read than they possibly can. But do we fail to read the publications of the Society because we really have no time? Or is it because we spend considerable time reading newspapers, worldly magazines and novels? Do these publications encourage us to pursue a course of faithfulness to Jehovah God? Why, even the advertising in newspapers and magazines nowadays can arouse immoral thoughts and desires. How much better it is to spend any time we can to reading information that will serve to strengthen us, build us up spiritually. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971643/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:58</a>) By our personal study, including preparation for the congregation meetings, we will be able to derive more benefits from the gatherings of Jehovah’s people and to give more for the assistance of others attending with us.</p>

<strong>Flee from Desires Incidental to Youth</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Youths, be a good influence for your generation. Talk to your friends about everlasting life in the new world. Show them that the Bible can be understood by young as well as old. Point out to your neighborhood associates and fellow school students that the most important things in life are not the latest dance step and the names of the latest television and movie stars, but that Jehovah God and Christ Jesus are the ones they should know and imitate. Prove to the world by your example and conduct that the only solution for delinquency of youth today is to teach them God’s Word and to serve Jehovah God, the Creator. So youths in the New World society must flee from the old-world <span id="page367" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="367" data-before-text="367"></span>amusements, its obscene talk, its jokes, its materialism, its immorality and other wrong desires that are nothing more than snares put there by the hater of youth, Satan the Devil. Look ahead to the most cherished ambition of obedient youths today, that of being a full-time minister of the good news. Being a Christian minister of Jehovah is the grandest career that today’s youths could occupy or be trained for. This is the course that leads to endless life and can be a channel through which others can also receive life. You young ministers, study diligently and work hard so that you can be better preachers and representatives of Jehovah’s New World society, all to the honor and praise of Jehovah’s name.</p>

<strong>The Confidence of the Upright</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Are you willing to be refined as gold in a smelter and have the dross taken off so that there remains only pure gold? Some have gone through the processing and received a final “well done, good and faithful slave.” Others are still being refined, as Malachi said they would be: “And he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi, and refine them as gold and silver; and they shall offer unto Jehovah offerings in righteousness. Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto Jehovah, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Mal. 3:3, 4</a>, <em>AS</em>) Thousands upon thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses have gone through a refining such as David mentioned and Malachi described, a real refining by scorching heat. Can you take the <span id="page11" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>heat like those suffering persecution under the communistic totalitarian rule in Russia, Poland, Czechoslovakia and elsewhere behind the Iron Curtain? Look at Jehovah’s witnesses in the Catholic-ruled Dominican Republic who have been beaten and tortured and thrown into prison because of preaching God’s kingdom and taking their stand as Jehovah’s witnesses. Others have maintained and are still maintaining their integrity in Germany, Italy, Norway and other countries that were overrun by the crushing hordes of Nazi and Fascist lords. It is not easy to be a real Christian, no matter where one lives in this world. Enemy efforts to break our integrity can be brought to bear in many ways.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">11. What serves to make our confidence in our integrity firm today?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Long ago David invited his Father to examine him, to test him, to refine him. Today is our confidence in our own uprightness, our own integrity, that firm? It should be if we see matters like David and we are walking in the footsteps of Christ Jesus. Then we would say: “For your loving-kindness is in front of my eyes, and I have walked in your truth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 26:3</a>) When one gets to appreciate the works of Jehovah God, the purposes he has in mind, what he has done, is doing and will do for the blessing of all those who love him, then one can truly appreciate His loving-kindness. Look how loving he has been in sending his only-begotten Son, Christ Jesus, from heaven to earth to redeem mankind. But Jesus Christ did more. He vindicated Jehovah’s name by maintaining his integrity and he was made King of the new world of righteousness. You can live in that new world if you want to. How? By getting acquainted with the Bible, reading its truths carefully and living by them. That is necessary in order to get life in the kingdom of God that millions of Christendom have prayed for: “Let your kingdom come. Let your will come to pass, as in heaven, also upon earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 6:10</a>) Keep Jehovah’s kingdom in front of your eyes and walk in the truth and you will enjoy life in God’s new world.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">12, 13. In order to remain innocent before Jehovah, with whom will we associate and whom will we shun?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> Preach and teach the good news of the Kingdom whenever and wherever you can. Associate with those persons who are doing that. Then you will stay away from the wicked people because you are busy maintaining your integrity. All who learn the truth and take a right path, dedicating their lives to Jehovah’s service thereafter, do as David said he did: “For I have not sat with men of untruth, and with those who conceal what they are I do not come in. I have hated the congregation of evildoers, and with the wicked ones I do not sit. I shall wash my hands in innocency itself, and I will march around your altar, O Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 26:4-6</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> Christians of integrity have set their course. They will not sit with men of untruth. They will not have prolonged discussions with men of this world except to preach the Kingdom. The interests of this world have not become the interests of Jehovah’s witnesses. They have a bigger and more important work to do. Those who sit in the counsel of wicked men and support their schemes always end up in ruin and misery. “Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked ones, and in the way of sinners has not stood and in the seat of ridiculers has not sat. But his delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1, 2</a>) Have you likewise set your course? Which way will you walk? Let it be one of integrity.</p>

<strong>Deliverance for Integrity Toward God</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> He was therefore willing to appear before God’s judgment throne and be examined as to his pure, honest intentions and his faithful efforts to worship Jehovah alone as God and to serve Him only as the Supreme Sovereign over all the universe. This eagerness to <span id="page750" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="750" data-before-text="750"></span>be judged by the divine court shows itself in these words of David: “Judge me, O Jehovah, for I myself have walked in my own integrity, and in Jehovah I have trusted, that I may not wobble. Examine me, O Jehovah, and put me to the test; refine my kidneys [or, my deepest emotions] and my heart. For your loving-kindness is in front of my eyes, and I have walked in your truth.” Regardless of what other men did, regardless of the opposition and persecution by his enemies, King David was bent on going ahead in his wholeheartedness toward Jehovah God. Prayerfully he said: “As for me, in my integrity I shall walk. O redeem me and show me favor. My own foot will certainly stand on a level place; among the congregated throngs I shall bless Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 26:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 11, 12</a>, <em>margin</em>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 8.

Do we not owe integrity toward God, who is our Creator and who promises to be our everlasting Preserver in his upright new world? Yes, for he has given us our life and, according to his purposes that he has revealed in the Holy Bible, he has given us something to live for. What? That promised new world under the perfect government of his Son Jesus Christ. Our walking in integrity toward our Creator and Preserver can be done in no way other than walking according to the truth and the principles that He lays down for us in his written Word. We know that all his creation moves and operates according to laws that he laid down. So he must be a God of principle in all things. To win his favor for a happy life in his endless new world we must prove ourselves persons of integrity.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 9. We must therefore be persons of what principles?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> However, to do this we cannot be persons of our own established principles. We must be people of God’s principles. By this we do not mean the elementary things, that is, the basic things or fundamental teachings of God’s written Word, such as those mentioned in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Hebrews 5:12</a>: “You again need someone to teach you from the beginning the first principles of the sacred pronouncements of God.”</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">10. (a) What do we specially mean by “principle” here? (b) From this standpoint, what did James and Paul say to Christians?</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> We must remember that a principle is also a settled rule of action, a governing law of conduct, a rule of conduct consistently directing one’s action, a belief or attitude that exercises a directing influence on the life and behavior. (<em>Webster</em>) Because a principle thus means an ordered life, James could say to the apostle Paul: “You are walking orderly, you yourself also keeping the Law.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 21:24</a>) Paul himself also could say to his brothers in Christ: “To what extent we have made progress, let us go on walking orderly in this same routine”; and, “all those who will walk orderly by this rule of conduct, upon them be peace and mercy, even upon the Israel of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Phil. 3:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Gal. 6:16</a>) To live according to God’s principles requires us to walk orderly, in harmony with the rules he has laid down for our guidance and government. His Son, Jesus Christ, while he was on earth, set us a perfect example of living according to the principles of Jehovah God, his Father. We are therefore warned against walking “according to the elementary things of the world and not according to Christ; because it is in him [Christ] that all the fullness of the divine quality dwells.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Col. 2:8, 9</a>.</p>

<strong>Examples of Keepers of Integrity</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Immediately after Jesus was baptized in water he was led out into the wilderness by the operation of God’s spirit that had come down upon him, anointing him. There he was put to the test by Satan the Devil. Satan was the symbolic Dragon that had caused the wild beast to come up out of the sea and that gave to the wild beast “its power and its throne and great authority.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rev. 13:1, 2</a>) Under temptation by this Dragon, Jesus did not act like that wild beast, but kept in harmony with God’s purpose concerning the kingdom of God, the kingdom of the heavens. To tempt Jesus, the Devil showed him “all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth in an instant of time” and said: “I will give you all this authority and the glory of them, because it has been delivered to me and to whomever I wish I give it. You, therefore, if you do an act of worship before me, it will all be yours.” Rather than grab after the kingdoms of this old world, like the “wild beast” without understanding, Jesus held to the principle of Jehovah’s worship and stuck to God’s kingdom of the heavens. As the Leader of Christianity, Jesus answered the “god of this system of <span id="page760" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="760" data-before-text="760"></span>things” straight and declared the special principle that governs his conduct and also our conduct, if we are Christians: “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 4:5-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Deut. 6:13</a>.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">12.

He foretold the destruction of natural Israel and he let it be destroyed by the armies of the Roman Caesar at the downfall of Jerusalem and its temple A.D. 70. Why? Because Jesus was for spiritual Israel. The kingdom he was after was the spiritual kingdom of the heavens, the kingdom that he preached and that he commanded his true followers to preach about in this time of the end of the old world.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">13.

For I have not sat with men of untruth, and with those who conceal what they are I do not come in. I have hated the congregation of evildoers, and with the wicked ones I do not sit. I shall wash my hands in innocency itself, and I will march around your altar, O Jehovah, to cause thanksgiving to be heard aloud, and to declare all your wonderful works. Do not take away my soul along with sinners, nor my life along with bloodguilty men, in whose hands there is loose conduct and whose right hand is full of bribery.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 26:3-7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 9, 10</a>) King David did not want to be associated with such persons during his lifetime. He did not want to be found even dead with them, whether rulers or political officials or plain citizens. With this desire in his heart he shunned them during his life and kept away from untruth and hypocrisy, from bloodguilt and loose conduct, and from accepting or demanding bribes. On the basis of this he could implore God not to take away his soul and his life along with the sinful and the blood guilty men. He wanted to be delivered from the destruction that would come up on such sinners and bloodstained men from God’s hand. Although the theocratic kingdom of Israel of which he was ruler was in the midst of the world there in the Middle East, yet King David did not want his kingdom to be a part of this world.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">16.

We, if claiming to be his followers, must avoid associating with this old world now so full of men like those whom David avoided. Because we are flesh and blood like other humans, we have to live in this world during its “time of the end.” But we cannot be of this old world and also be of God’s new world which we preach. Jesus himself stated this principle in these words: “If you were part of the world, the world would be fond of what is its own. Now because you are no part of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, on this account the world hates you.” According to this same principle Jesus prayed to God and said: “I have given your word to them, but the world has hated them, because they are no part of the world just as I am no part of the world. I request you, not to take them out of the world, but to watch over them because of the wicked one.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">John 15:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 17:14, 15</a>.</p>

Each one contains an important principle regarding our choice of associates: “I have not sat with men of untruth; and with those who hide what they are I do not come in.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012523/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 26:4</a>) “He that is walking with wise persons will become wise, but he that is having dealings with the stupid ones will fare badly.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012523/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Prov. 13:20</a>) “Bad associations spoil useful habits.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012523/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:33</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><strong><sup>12</sup></strong></span> What valuable lessons can we learn from those texts? (1) Jehovah wants us to be selective about our associates. He wants to protect us morally and spiritually. (2) We are influenced for good or for bad by the people with whom we associate; that is simply a fact of life. The way the verses above are worded shows that Jehovah is appealing to our heart. How so? Notice that none of the verses are set out as rules, such as “you must not . . .” Rather, they are written as plain statements of truth. In effect, Jehovah is saying to us: ‘Here are the facts. How will you respond? What is in your heart?’</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><strong><sup>13</sup></strong></span> Finally, because the three verses are set out as basic truths, they are timeless and have a very broad application. To illustrate, ask yourself such questions as: How can I avoid associating with individuals “who hide what they are”? In what situations might I come in contact with such ones? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012523/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Prov. 3:32;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012523/21/1" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 6:12</a>) Who are the “wise persons” with whom Jehovah wants me to associate?

Do we stay away from those who hide what they are? Some at school or at our place of employment may feign friendship with us for devious purposes. Do we really want to develop close ties with those who do not walk in God’s truth? Behind claims of sincerity, apostates may also hide their intent to draw us away from serving Jehovah. What if there are some in the Christian congregation who live double lives? They too conceal what they truly are. Jayson, now serving as a ministerial servant, had friends like that in his youth. About them, he says: “One day one of them said to me: ‘It doesn’t matter what we do now because when the new system comes, we’re just going to be dead. We’re not going to know that we missed anything.’ That kind of talk came as a wake-up call for me. I do not want to be dead when the new system comes.” Jayson wisely cut off his association with such ones. “Do not be misled,” warned the apostle Paul. “Bad associations spoil useful habits.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004883/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>) How vital that we avoid bad associations!</p>

<strong>Youths—Will You Pass the Test of Christian Loyalty?</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>Leading a Double Life</strong></p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">While committing a gross wrong such as fornication is in itself a very serious matter, some youths compound their difficulties. They are like the “men of untruth,” spoken of at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991444/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 26:4</a>, “who hide what they are.” Such youths lead a double life, acting one way while in the company of their parents or other mature Christians and another way when in the company of their peers.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Leading a double life, however, is self-defeating and dangerous. Wrong acts unchecked almost always lead to other wrong acts. And while one’s conscience may be bothered at first, the longer one persists in wrongdoing, the less one’s conscience reacts to wrongdoing. One may literally ‘cease feeling pain’ over doing wrong.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991444/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:19</a>, <em>Kingdom Interlinear.</em></p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">At this point it becomes extremely difficult to confess one’s wrongdoing and get help. This is particularly so if other Christian youths are involved in the wrong. A misguided sense of loyalty often prevails. The youth quoted at the outset explained: “You realize what you’re doing, and you know that it’s wrong. In order for the other individuals involved not to get in trouble, you agree not to tell anyone.”</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">While a person may ‘hide what he is’ from his parents or the congregation, he cannot hide from Jehovah. “There is not a creation that is not manifest to his sight, but all things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of him with whom we have an accounting.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991444/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:13</a>) The Bible assures us: “He that is covering over his transgressions will not succeed.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991444/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Proverbs 28:13</a>) In time the wrong will be exposed. One simply cannot outsmart Jehovah. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991444/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:7</a> says: “Do not become wise in your own eyes. Fear Jehovah and turn away from bad.” Remember, too, that “the eyes of Jehovah are in every place, keeping watch upon the bad ones and the good ones.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1991444/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:3</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The aforementioned youth, along with several others involved in the secret wrongdoing, was thus found out, and he and his companions had to be expelled from the Christian congregation. They later recovered spiritually and were reinstated. Still, what a hard way to learn the meaning of loyalty!</p>

<strong>Youths—Your Part in a Happy, United Family</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> “Trueness” creates intimacy, since trust is essential to any close relationship. Do not be like the “men of untruth” who hid what kind of persons they were. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986806/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 26:4</a>) You may be tempted to live, in effect, two lives​—one when around your Christian parents and another when out of their sight. Such a course can lead to tragedy, especially when you face a serious problem and are ill-equipped to handle it by yourself. Think, too, of the breakdown in trust when a course of falsehood is uncovered. “My parents know <span id="page18" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>much more than I think they know,” said one young Christian. “If I try to hide something from them, I am only kidding myself and trying to fool Jehovah.” Yes, be determined to develop an inward truthfulness. But is manifesting trueness limited only to avoiding ‘crooked’ speech and deeds?​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986806/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Proverbs 4:20,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986806/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 24;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986806/13/2" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 10:9</a>.</p>

<strong>Do Not Share in the Sins of Others</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Yet, suppose we have encouraged a wrongdoer to seek God’s forgiveness and confess to the elders, but he keeps putting this off or sees no need to take these steps. Can we just drop the matter? Some might reason that they do not want to become involved. They may not want to risk losing the friendship of the erring one. And they may not want to be thought of as persons who betray a confidence by telling the elders. But this is faulty reasoning. The psalmist David said: “I have not sat with men of untruth; and with those who hide what they are I do not come in.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1985846/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 26:4</a>) Surely, then, we would not want to become accomplices of “those who hide what they are.”</p>

<strong>Fortify Yourself So as to Maintain Integrity</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> “For I have not sat with men of untruth; and with those who hide what they are I do not come in. I have hated the congregation of evildoers, and with the wicked ones I do not sit,” continued David in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971643/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ps 26 verses 4 and 5</a>, pointing out another aspect of fortifying ourselves, that is, avoiding bad associations. The type of individuals David was talking about he mentions further in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971643/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ps 26 verses 9 and 10</a>, where he refers to them as “bloodguilty men, in whose hands there is loose conduct, and whose right hand is full of bribery.” For us to stay loyal to Jehovah we must avoid being friends with people such as these, avoid associating with such ones unnecessarily, apart, of course, from preaching the good news of God’s kingdom to them. In fact, preaching to these often assists in avoiding their bad association. To illustrate this point, consider the following: One individual who was studying the Bible for just a few months, and who had been living the life of a “hippie” for some years prior to this study, said: “Sometimes people that we used to be friendly with look us up or write. They are generally very surprised at us, since we very quickly begin to tell them the good news [of the Kingdom]. Needless to say, it’s not good news to them, and surprise turns to dislike and they make hasty exits from our trailer and we don’t hear from them again. But sometimes, too, seeds fall on good soil and there is some interest generated.” Yes, faithfully speaking about our God and his kingdom helps us to avoid bad company.</p>

<strong>Make Friends for Yourselves</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> The right kind of friend, then, should be one that encourages the Christian in being loyal to the Most High God. Only lovers of Jehovah can do this. Let us learn a lesson from the mistake made by King Jehoshaphat of Judah. This king, upon whom Jehovah had bestowed his friendship, made the mistake of associating with one who was no friend of God, King Ahab of Israel. This wicked king asked Jehoshaphat to join him in an expedition for the recovery of Ramoth-gilead. Jehoshaphat agreed. Though the prophets of Baal predicted success for the expedition, Micaiah, the only prophet of Jehovah obtainable, <span id="page106" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="106" data-before-text="106"></span>foretold the death of Ahab. Going into battle, Ahab disguised himself; but he had proposed that the king of Judah should put on his royal robes, thus becoming a mark for every missile. In the thick of the battle royally attired Jehoshaphat found every warrior of Syria turned against him, thinking him to be the king of Israel. “Jehoshaphat began to cry for aid, and Jehovah himself helped him, and God at once allured them away from him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Chron. 18:31</a>) True to the words of Jehovah’s prophet, Ahab met his doom, a certain man bending his bow in his innocence and shooting an arrow into the king of Israel, so that he died. When the king of Judah returned to Jerusalem, Jehu the son of Hanani the visionary said to King Jehoshaphat: “Is it to the wicked that help is to be given, and is it for those hating Jehovah that you should have love? And for this there is indignation against you from the person of Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Chron. 19:2</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 8, 9.

In selecting friends, the Christian does well to keep those words of the prophet in mind: “Is it for those hating Jehovah that you should have love?” How the servant of God must guard against improper friendships! Whether we will receive God’s favor or his indignation against us depends to a large extent on the kind of friendships we form. It should not surprise us that the Most High God views any of his servants as guilty who associate with persons of whom he does not approve. We cannot associate with those whom God does not approve and gain his friendship.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> The corrupting influence of bad friends is something that removes one from the realm of dependability, for it is something that will inevitably produce adverse results: “He that is walking with wise persons will become wise, but he that is having dealings with the stupid ones will fare badly.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Prov. 13:20</a>) Had it not been for God’s intervention, Jehoshaphat’s dealings with stupid Ahab probably would have cost him his life.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu">10.

The divine rule is inflexible: “Do you not know that the friendship with the world is enmity with God?

<strong>The Confidence of the Upright</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Are you willing to be refined as gold in a smelter and have the dross taken off so that there remains only pure gold? Some have gone through the processing and received a final “well done, good and faithful slave.” Others are still being refined, as Malachi said they would be: “And he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi, and refine them as gold and silver; and they shall offer unto Jehovah offerings in righteousness. Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto Jehovah, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Mal. 3:3, 4</a>, <em>AS</em>) Thousands upon thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses have gone through a refining such as David mentioned and Malachi described, a real refining by scorching heat. Can you take the <span id="page11" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>heat like those suffering persecution under the communistic totalitarian rule in Russia, Poland, Czechoslovakia and elsewhere behind the Iron Curtain? Look at Jehovah’s witnesses in the Catholic-ruled Dominican Republic who have been beaten and tortured and thrown into prison because of preaching God’s kingdom and taking their stand as Jehovah’s witnesses. Others have maintained and are still maintaining their integrity in Germany, Italy, Norway and other countries that were overrun by the crushing hordes of Nazi and Fascist lords. It is not easy to be a real Christian, no matter where one lives in this world. Enemy efforts to break our integrity can be brought to bear in many ways.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">11.

Today is our confidence in our own uprightness, our own integrity, that firm? It should be if we see matters like David and we are walking in the footsteps of Christ Jesus. Then we would say: “For your loving-kindness is in front of my eyes, and I have walked in your truth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 26:3</a>) When one gets to appreciate the works of Jehovah God, the purposes he has in mind, what he has done, is doing and will do for the blessing of all those who love him, then one can truly appreciate His loving-kindness. Look how loving he has been in sending his only-begotten Son, Christ Jesus, from heaven to earth to redeem mankind. But Jesus Christ did more. He vindicated Jehovah’s name by maintaining his integrity and he was made King of the new world of righteousness. You can live in that new world if you want to. How? By getting acquainted with the Bible, reading its truths carefully and living by them. That is necessary in order to get life in the kingdom of God that millions of Christendom have prayed for: “Let your kingdom come. Let your will come to pass, as in heaven, also upon earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 6:10</a>) Keep Jehovah’s kingdom in front of your eyes and walk in the truth and you will enjoy life in God’s new world.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">12, 13.

I have hated the congregation of evildoers, and with the wicked ones I do not sit.

They will not sit with men of untruth. They will not have prolonged discussions with men of this world except to preach the Kingdom. The interests of this world have not become the interests of Jehovah’s witnesses. They have a bigger and more important work to do. Those who sit in the counsel of wicked men and support their schemes always end up in ruin and misery. “Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked ones, and in the way of sinners has not stood and in the seat of ridiculers has not sat. But his delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1, 2</a>) Have you likewise set your course?

<strong>Examples of Keepers of Integrity</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Immediately after Jesus was baptized in water he was led out into the wilderness by the operation of God’s spirit that had come down upon him, anointing him. There he was put to the test by Satan the Devil. Satan was the symbolic Dragon that had caused the wild beast to come up out of the sea and that gave to the wild beast “its power and its throne and great authority.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rev. 13:1, 2</a>) Under temptation by this Dragon, Jesus did not act like that wild beast, but kept in harmony with God’s purpose concerning the kingdom of God, the kingdom of the heavens. To tempt Jesus, the Devil showed him “all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth in an instant of time” and said: “I will give you all this authority and the glory of them, because it has been delivered to me and to whomever I wish I give it. You, therefore, if you do an act of worship before me, it will all be yours.” Rather than grab after the kingdoms of this old world, like the “wild beast” without understanding, Jesus held to the principle of Jehovah’s worship and stuck to God’s kingdom of the heavens. As the Leader of Christianity, Jesus answered the “god of this system of <span id="page760" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="760" data-before-text="760"></span>things” straight and declared the special principle that governs his conduct and also our conduct, if we are Christians: “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 4:5-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Deut. 6:13</a>.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">12.

His kingdom was not of the same source as Caesar’s or as that of the symbolic wild beast. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">John 18:36</a>) Jesus gathered no army to free ancient Israel from Caesar’s taxation and control or to establish a political State on earth. He foretold the destruction of natural Israel and he let it be destroyed by the armies of the Roman Caesar at the downfall of Jerusalem and its temple A.D. 70. Why? Because Jesus was for spiritual Israel. The kingdom he was after was the spiritual kingdom of the heavens, the kingdom that he preached and that he commanded his true followers to preach about in this time of the end of the old world.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">13.

I shall wash my hands in innocency itself, and I will march around your altar, O Jehovah, to cause thanksgiving to be heard aloud, and to declare all your wonderful works.

He did not want to be found even dead with them, whether rulers or political officials or plain citizens. With this desire in his heart he shunned them during his life and kept away from untruth and hypocrisy, from bloodguilt and loose conduct, and from accepting or demanding bribes. On the basis of this he could implore God not to take away his soul and his life along with the sinful and the blood guilty men. He wanted to be delivered from the destruction that would come up on such sinners and bloodstained men from God’s hand. Although the theocratic kingdom of Israel of which he was ruler was in the midst of the world there in the Middle East, yet King David did not want his kingdom to be a part of this world.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">16.

We, if claiming to be his followers, must avoid associating with this old world now so full of men like those whom David avoided. Because we are flesh and blood like other humans, we have to live in this world during its “time of the end.” But we cannot be of this old world and also be of God’s new world which we preach. Jesus himself stated this principle in these words: “If you were part of the world, the world would be fond of what is its own. Now because you are no part of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, on this account the world hates you.” According to this same principle Jesus prayed to God and said: “I have given your word to them, but the world has hated them, because they are no part of the world just as I am no part of the world. I request you, not to take them out of the world, but to watch over them because of the wicked one.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">John 15:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 17:14, 15</a>.</p>

Do we stay away from those who hide what they are? Some at school or at our place of employment may feign friendship with us for devious purposes. Do we really want to develop close ties with those who do not walk in God’s truth? Behind claims of sincerity, apostates may also hide their intent to draw us away from serving Jehovah. What if there are some in the Christian congregation who live double lives? They too conceal what they truly are. Jayson, now serving as a ministerial servant, had friends like that in his youth. About them, he says: “One day one of them said to me: ‘It doesn’t matter what we do now because when the new system comes, we’re just going to be dead. We’re not going to know that we missed anything.’ That kind of talk came as a wake-up call for me. I do not want to be dead when the new system comes.” Jayson wisely cut off his association with such ones. “Do not be misled,” warned the apostle Paul. “Bad associations spoil useful habits.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2004883/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>) How vital that we avoid bad associations!</p>

<strong>Light on Life’s Roadway from the Psalms</strong><br/><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Wisely the Psalms show us the need to concern ourselves with the law of God, with the other parts of God’s Word as well: “Happy is the man” whose “delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.” “I shall certainly meditate on all your activity, and with your dealings I will concern myself.” “How I do love your law! <span id="page552" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="552" data-before-text="552"></span>All day long it is my concern.”—1:1, 2; 77:12; 119:97.</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">While such admonition, either direct or indirect, either explicit or implied, is to be expected in the book of the Psalms, what is often overlooked is that it is also filled with wise admonition as to daily conduct. For example, time and again its writers show that they appreciate that “bad associations spoil useful habits.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962681/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:33</a>) “I have hated the congregation of evildoers, and with the wicked ones I do not sit.” “In his eyes anyone contemptible is certainly rejected.” “Anyone of haughty eyes and of arrogant heart, him I cannot endure.” “Get away from me, you evildoers, that I may observe the commandments of my God.”—26:5; 15:4; 101:5; 119:115.</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">The Psalms also throw light on life’s roadway by their wise counsel as to what should be our attitude when we see the wicked prosper: “Be agitated, but do not sin. Have your say in your heart, upon your bed, and keep silent. Sacrifice the sacrifices of righteousness, and trust in Jehovah.” “Do not show yourself heated up because of the evildoers. Do not be envious of those doing unrighteousness. For evildoers themselves will be cut off, but those hoping in Jehovah are the ones that will possess the earth.”—4:4, 5; 37:1, 9.</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Then again, the Psalms enlighten by showing what God approves and what he disapproves: “O Jehovah, who will be a guest in your tent? . . . He who is walking faultlessly and practicing righteousness and speaking the truth in his heart. He has not slandered with his tongue. To his companion he has done nothing bad, and no reproach has he taken up against his intimate acquaintance. . . . A bribe against the innocent one he has not taken.” (15:1-3, 5) “Safeguard your tongue against what is bad, and your lips against speaking deception. Turn away from what is bad, and do what is good; seek to find peace, and pursue it.” “Lovers of Jehovah, hate what is bad.”—34:13, 14; 97:10.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">We have further light on our roadway by the very things the psalmist prays for: “Mistakes—who can discern? From concealed sins pronounce me innocent. Also from presumptuous acts hold your servant back; do not let them dominate me. In that case I shall be complete, and I shall have remained innocent from much transgression. Let the sayings of my mouth and the meditation of my heart become pleasurable before you, O Jehovah.” (19:12-14) “O Jehovah, my heart has not been haughty, nor have my eyes been lofty.” “Do set a guard, O Jehovah, for my mouth; do set a watch over the door of my lips. Should the righteous one strike me, it would be a loving-kindness; and should he reprove me, it would be oil upon the head, which my head would not want to refuse.”—131:1; 141:3, 5.</p><p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">Truly, today there is need of light, spiritual light for guidance on life’s roadway. Such light certainly is to be found in the book of Psalms, along with other books of the Bible, for the Psalms contain much history, many prophecies, right doctrine and an abundance of fine admonition in addition to its many songs of praise to and expressions of trust in Jehovah God. “Make melody to God, make melody. Make melody to our King, make melody. For God is King of all the earth; make melody, <em>acting with discretion.”</em>—47:6, 7.</p><p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb"></p>

<strong>Make Friends for Yourselves</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> The right kind of friend, then, should be one that encourages the Christian in being loyal to the Most High God. Only lovers of Jehovah can do this. Let us learn a lesson from the mistake made by King Jehoshaphat of Judah. This king, upon whom Jehovah had bestowed his friendship, made the mistake of associating with one who was no friend of God, King Ahab of Israel. This wicked king asked Jehoshaphat to join him in an expedition for the recovery of Ramoth-gilead. Jehoshaphat agreed. Though the prophets of Baal predicted success for the expedition, Micaiah, the only prophet of Jehovah obtainable, <span id="page106" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="106" data-before-text="106"></span>foretold the death of Ahab. Going into battle, Ahab disguised himself; but he had proposed that the king of Judah should put on his royal robes, thus becoming a mark for every missile. In the thick of the battle royally attired Jehoshaphat found every warrior of Syria turned against him, thinking him to be the king of Israel. “Jehoshaphat began to cry for aid, and Jehovah himself helped him, and God at once allured them away from him.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Chron. 18:31</a>) True to the words of Jehovah’s prophet, Ahab met his doom, a certain man bending his bow in his innocence and shooting an arrow into the king of Israel, so that he died. When the king of Judah returned to Jerusalem, Jehu the son of Hanani the visionary said to King Jehoshaphat: “Is it to the wicked that help is to be given, and is it for those hating Jehovah that you should have love? And for this there is indignation against you from the person of Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Chron. 19:2</a>.</p><p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 8, 9. How can the Christian benefit from Jehoshaphat’s mistake, and why should God’s disfavor toward a person arise out of wrong friendships?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Jehoshaphat made a bad mistake, cultivating a friendship with and giving aid to one who hated Jehovah God. In selecting friends, the Christian does well to keep those words of the prophet in mind: “Is it for those hating Jehovah that you should have love?” How the servant of God must guard against improper friendships! Whether we will receive God’s favor or his indignation against us depends to a large extent on the kind of friendships we form. It should not surprise us that the Most High God views any of his servants as guilty who associate with persons of whom he does not approve. We cannot associate with those whom God does not approve and gain his friendship.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> The corrupting influence of bad friends is something that removes one from the realm of dependability, for it is something that will inevitably produce adverse results: “He that is walking with wise persons will become wise, but he that is having dealings with the stupid ones will fare badly.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Prov. 13:20</a>) Had it not been for God’s intervention, Jehoshaphat’s dealings with stupid Ahab probably would have cost him his life.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu">10. What example did David set for the servant of God?</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Besides benefiting from the mistake Jehoshaphat made, we can also learn from the good example set by David, who could say: “I have not sat with men of untruth; and with those who hide what they are I do not come in. I have hated the congregation of evildoers, and with the wicked ones I do not sit. I shall wash my hands in innocency itself, and I will march around your altar, O Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ps. 26:4-6</a>) David speaks as if he were on the witness stand, giving testimony as to his private life to show his innocence in regard to friendships. He declares his innocency as to associating with those who have no love for God and his righteous commandments. May every true worshiper of Almighty God Jehovah be able to affirm similar innocency as to his friendships!</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>SELECTING THE RIGHT SLAVE-MASTER AS FRIEND</strong></p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">11. (a) Besides persons, what other improper friendships must we guard against? How did Jesus set the right example? (b) Why is it folly for a Christian to make the world his friend?</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> We must be careful not only in selecting individual persons as friends, but we must also guard against improper friendships with groups, clubs and organizations that do not encourage us in the worship of Jehovah but rather foster slavery to the god of this world, Satan the Devil. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:4</a>) Jesus Christ therefore turned down a democratic draft to become a local political ruler. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">John 6:15</a>) Indeed, Jesus not only turned down local kingship but world kingship of Satan’s organization! The Devil “showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory, and he said to him: <span id="page107" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="107" data-before-text="107"></span>‘All these things I will give you if you fall down and do an act of worship to me.’” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 4:8, 9</a>) Jesus rejected all such worldly offers, for he prized God’s friendship above all things. To have accepted the Devil’s offer would have made Jesus God’s enemy. It is asking for Jehovah’s enmity if we cultivate friendship with the world. The divine rule is inflexible: “Do you not know that the friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever, therefore, wants to be a friend of the world is constituting himself an enemy of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962122/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Jas. 4:4</a>) This wicked world is doomed to destruction at God’s war of Armageddon, and the friends of this world will pass away with it.

<strong>The Confidence of the Upright</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="10"><sup>10</sup></span> Are you willing to be refined as gold in a smelter and have the dross taken off so that there remains only pure gold? Some have gone through the processing and received a final “well done, good and faithful slave.” Others are still being refined, as Malachi said they would be: “And he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi, and refine them as gold and silver; and they shall offer unto Jehovah offerings in righteousness. Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto Jehovah, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Mal. 3:3, 4</a>, <em>AS</em>) Thousands upon thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses have gone through a refining such as David mentioned and Malachi described, a real refining by scorching heat. Can you take the <span id="page11" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>heat like those suffering persecution under the communistic totalitarian rule in Russia, Poland, Czechoslovakia and elsewhere behind the Iron Curtain? Look at Jehovah’s witnesses in the Catholic-ruled Dominican Republic who have been beaten and tortured and thrown into prison because of preaching God’s kingdom and taking their stand as Jehovah’s witnesses. Others have maintained and are still maintaining their integrity in Germany, Italy, Norway and other countries that were overrun by the crushing hordes of Nazi and Fascist lords. It is not easy to be a real Christian, no matter where one lives in this world. Enemy efforts to break our integrity can be brought to bear in many ways.</p><p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">11. What serves to make our confidence in our integrity firm today?</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Long ago David invited his Father to examine him, to test him, to refine him. Today is our confidence in our own uprightness, our own integrity, that firm? It should be if we see matters like David and we are walking in the footsteps of Christ Jesus. Then we would say: “For your loving-kindness is in front of my eyes, and I have walked in your truth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 26:3</a>) When one gets to appreciate the works of Jehovah God, the purposes he has in mind, what he has done, is doing and will do for the blessing of all those who love him, then one can truly appreciate His loving-kindness. Look how loving he has been in sending his only-begotten Son, Christ Jesus, from heaven to earth to redeem mankind. But Jesus Christ did more. He vindicated Jehovah’s name by maintaining his integrity and he was made King of the new world of righteousness. You can live in that new world if you want to. How? By getting acquainted with the Bible, reading its truths carefully and living by them. That is necessary in order to get life in the kingdom of God that millions of Christendom have prayed for: “Let your kingdom come. Let your will come to pass, as in heaven, also upon earth.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 6:10</a>) Keep Jehovah’s kingdom in front of your eyes and walk in the truth and you will enjoy life in God’s new world.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">12, 13.

Associate with those persons who are doing that. Then you will stay away from the wicked people because you are busy maintaining your integrity. All who learn the truth and take a right path, dedicating their lives to Jehovah’s service thereafter, do as David said he did: “For I have not sat with men of untruth, and with those who conceal what they are I do not come in. I have hated the congregation of evildoers, and with the wicked ones I do not sit. I shall wash my hands in innocency itself, and I will march around your altar, O Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 26:4-6</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> Christians of integrity have set their course. They will not sit with men of untruth. They will not have prolonged discussions with men of this world except to preach the Kingdom. The interests of this world have not become the interests of Jehovah’s witnesses. They have a bigger and more important work to do. Those who sit in the counsel of wicked men and support their schemes always end up in ruin and misery. “Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked ones, and in the way of sinners has not stood and in the seat of ridiculers has not sat. But his delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1, 2</a>) Have you likewise set your course?

<strong>Examples of Keepers of Integrity</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Immediately after Jesus was baptized in water he was led out into the wilderness by the operation of God’s spirit that had come down upon him, anointing him. There he was put to the test by Satan the Devil. Satan was the symbolic Dragon that had caused the wild beast to come up out of the sea and that gave to the wild beast “its power and its throne and great authority.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rev. 13:1, 2</a>) Under temptation by this Dragon, Jesus did not act like that wild beast, but kept in harmony with God’s purpose concerning the kingdom of God, the kingdom of the heavens. To tempt Jesus, the Devil showed him “all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth in an instant of time” and said: “I will give you all this authority and the glory of them, because it has been delivered to me and to whomever I wish I give it. You, therefore, if you do an act of worship before me, it will all be yours.” Rather than grab after the kingdoms of this old world, like the “wild beast” without understanding, Jesus held to the principle of Jehovah’s worship and stuck to God’s kingdom of the heavens. As the Leader of Christianity, Jesus answered the “god of this system of <span id="page760" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="760" data-before-text="760"></span>things” straight and declared the special principle that governs his conduct and also our conduct, if we are Christians: “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 4:5-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Deut. 6:13</a>.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">12.

His kingdom was not of the same source as Caesar’s or as that of the symbolic wild beast. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">John 18:36</a>) Jesus gathered no army to free ancient Israel from Caesar’s taxation and control or to establish a political State on earth. He foretold the destruction of natural Israel and he let it be destroyed by the armies of the Roman Caesar at the downfall of Jerusalem and its temple A.D. 70. Why? Because Jesus was for spiritual Israel. The kingdom he was after was the spiritual kingdom of the heavens, the kingdom that he preached and that he commanded his true followers to preach about in this time of the end of the old world.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">13.

For I have not sat with men of untruth, and with those who conceal what they are I do not come in. I have hated the congregation of evildoers, and with the wicked ones I do not sit. I shall wash my hands in innocency itself, and I will march around your altar, O Jehovah, to cause thanksgiving to be heard aloud, and to declare all your wonderful works. Do not take away my soul along with sinners, nor my life along with bloodguilty men, in whose hands there is loose conduct and whose right hand is full of bribery.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 26:3-7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 9, 10</a>) King David did not want to be associated with such persons during his lifetime. He did not want to be found even dead with them, whether rulers or political officials or plain citizens. With this desire in his heart he shunned them during his life and kept away from untruth and hypocrisy, from bloodguilt and loose conduct, and from accepting or demanding bribes. On the basis of this he could implore God not to take away his soul and his life along with the sinful and the blood guilty men. He wanted to be delivered from the destruction that would come up on such sinners and bloodstained men from God’s hand. Although the theocratic kingdom of Israel of which he was ruler was in the midst of the world there in the Middle East, yet King David did not want his kingdom to be a part of this world.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">16.

We, if claiming to be his followers, must avoid associating with this old world now so full of men like those whom David avoided. Because we are flesh and blood like other humans, we have to live in this world during its “time of the end.” But we cannot be of this old world and also be of God’s new world which we preach. Jesus himself stated this principle in these words: “If you were part of the world, the world would be fond of what is its own. Now because you are no part of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, on this account the world hates you.” According to this same principle Jesus prayed to God and said: “I have given your word to them, but the world has hated them, because they are no part of the world just as I am no part of the world. I request you, not to take them out of the world, but to watch over them because of the wicked one.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">John 15:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 17:14, 15</a>.</p>

<strong>Fortify Yourself So as to Maintain Integrity</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> “For I have not sat with men of untruth; and with those who hide what they are I do not come in. I have hated the congregation of evildoers, and with the wicked ones I do not sit,” continued David in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971643/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ps 26 verses 4 and 5</a>, pointing out another aspect of fortifying ourselves, that is, avoiding bad associations. The type of individuals David was talking about he mentions further in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971643/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ps 26 verses 9 and 10</a>, where he refers to them as “bloodguilty men, in whose hands there is loose conduct, and whose right hand is full of bribery.” For us to stay loyal to Jehovah we must avoid being friends with people such as these, avoid associating with such ones unnecessarily, apart, of course, from preaching the good news of God’s kingdom to them. In fact, preaching to these often assists in avoiding their bad association. To illustrate this point, consider the following: One individual who was studying the Bible for just a few months, and who had been living the life of a “hippie” for some years prior to this study, said: “Sometimes people that we used to be friendly with look us up or write. They are generally very surprised at us, since we very quickly begin to tell them the good news [of the Kingdom]. Needless to say, it’s not good news to them, and surprise turns to dislike and they make hasty exits from our trailer and we don’t hear from them again. But sometimes, too, seeds fall on good soil and there is some interest generated.” Yes, faithfully speaking about our God and his kingdom helps us to avoid bad company.</p>

<strong>Bathing</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Ceremonial bathing on the part of the Israelites in general was required for various reasons. Anyone who recovered from leprosy, anyone who contacted things touched by those with “a running discharge,” a man who had an emission of semen, a woman after menstruation or hemorrhaging, or anyone having sexual intercourse was “unclean” and had to bathe.

If anyone refused to comply with this regulation, he “must be cut off from the midst of the congregation, because it is Jehovah’s sanctuary that he has defiled.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200000579/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Nu 19:20</a>) Appropriately, then, washing is used figuratively to denote a clean standing before Jehovah.

Why, though, would he “march around” Jehovah’s altar, and in what sense?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">For David, the center of Jehovah’s worship was the tabernacle with its copper-covered altar of sacrifice, which during his reign was located at Gibeon, to the north of Jerusalem. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000329/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Kings 3:4</a>) The altar was only about seven feet <strong>[2.2 m]</strong> square, much smaller than the magnificent altar that would be erected in the courtyard of Solomon’s temple.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/2000329/0">a</a> Still, David found great delight in the tabernacle with its altar, which was the center of pure worship in Israel.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000329/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 26:8</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Burnt offerings, communion sacrifices, and guilt offerings were made on the altar, and the annual Atonement Day featured sacrifices offered in behalf of the nation. The altar and its sacrifices have meaning for Christians today. The apostle Paul explained that the altar represented God’s will, according to which He accepted an appropriate sacrifice for the redemption of mankind. Paul said: “By the said ‘will’ we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all time.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000329/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:5-10</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">When about to minister at the altar, priests customarily washed their hands in water to cleanse themselves. Appropriately then, King David washed his hands “in innocency itself” before ‘walking around the altar.’ He acted “with integrity of heart and with uprightness.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000329/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Kings 9:4</a>) If he had not washed his hands in this way, his worship​—his ‘walking around the altar’—​would not have been acceptable. Of course, David was not a Levite and did not have the privilege of performing priestly service at the altar. Although a king, he was not even allowed in the courtyard of the tabernacle. Still, as a faithful Israelite, he obeyed the Mosaic Law and regularly brought his offerings for presentation on the altar. He walked around the altar in the sense of centering his life on pure worship.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Can we today follow David’s example? Yes. We too can wash our hands in innocency and march around God’s altar if we exercise faith in Jesus’ sacrifice and, ‘innocent in hands and pure in heart,’ wholeheartedly serve Jehovah.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2000329/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 24:4</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sf"><strong>[Footnote]</strong></p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="se"><strong>[Picture on page 23]</strong></p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sc"><strong>Box content:</strong> The altar pictured Jehovah’s will, by which he accepts a proper sacrifice for the redemption of mankind</p>

But before performing this act of worship, the priests were required to wash their hands and feet. This was no minor detail. Failure to take this preliminary step could cost a priest his life!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996049/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Exodus 30:18-21</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Figurative washing results in spiritual and moral cleanness.

But he requires that we do so with clean hands—as David put it, hands that are washed “in innocency itself.” This is no trivial requirement, for those who practice uncleanness will not inherit God’s Kingdom. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996049/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Galatians 5:19-21</a>) A life in godly works does not give one license to engage in immoral conduct. Thus the apostle Paul wrote: “I pummel my body and lead it as a slave, that, after I have preached to others, I myself should not become disapproved somehow.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1996049/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Those who seek divine approval and true happiness must serve Jehovah with clean hands.

<strong>Caring for Yourself Physically</strong><br/><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">While not going to extremes (as some persons do in this matter), God’s Word the Bible encourages and teaches cleanliness. Clean hands and freshly bathed bodies are often used to stand for one’s being spiritually clean and pure. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972486/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 26:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972486/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Isa. 1:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972486/4/2" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Heb. 10:22</a>) The apostle Paul exhorted: “Let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in God’s fear.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972486/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Cor. 7:1</a>) Are we clean inside, in our hearts and minds?

<strong>Fortify Yourself So as to Maintain Integrity</strong><br/><p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> Attending meetings with others who are anxious to do God’s will is another step in the fortification program of which David speaks. He says: “I shall wash my hands in innocency itself, and I will march around your altar, O Jehovah . . . Jehovah, I have loved the dwelling of your house and the place of the residing of your glory.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971643/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps 26 Verses 6 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971643/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 8</a>) We too should love Jehovah’s house. Today we could look <span id="page529" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="529" data-before-text="529"></span>upon Jehovah’s house as the place where knowledge of him is given. Meetings with Christians of like precious faith “incite to love and fine works,” and this will help us to maintain integrity. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971643/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Heb. 10:24</a>) We will be built up by the good association and by the fine spiritual discussions we hear and can take part in. Getting to these meetings on time too is important to get the full benefit of the program. In this connection an experience reported from an African country is of interest: A riot occurred between two tribal groups just after the brothers began their meeting. Two brothers who were late saw the fighting in town and returned to their homes. One stood in the doorway of his home with a spear in his hand for protection, as he was afraid the fighting would reach his house. When the soldiers came upon him, they mistook him for one of those engaged in the fighting and refused to release him. In fact, they said: “He is not one of Jehovah’s witnesses; all of Jehovah’s witnesses were at their meeting studying the Bible, but he was not there.” And the other brother who was late? He was kidnapped and killed.</p>

In his expression: “I shall wash my hands in innocency itself, and I will march around your altar, O Jehovah,” he must have had in mind the copper basin that was set near the altar and that was used by the priests for washing their hands and feet. Concerning them God’s law said: “When they go into the tent of meeting they will wash with water that they may not die, or when they go near the altar to minister in order to make an offering made by fire smoke to Jehovah. And they must wash their hands and their feet that they may not die, and it must serve as a regulation to time indefinite for them, for him and his offspring throughout their generations.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Ex. 30:19-21</a>) David, however, wanted to have hands morally clean, cleansed by God’s truth.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">19. How, today, do true Christians wash their hands in innocency?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> Today anyone that comes to the place of worship, pictured by Jehovah’s altar, must be clean. He cannot be contaminated with old-world living and its sordid activity. What Jehovah’s priests did back there true Christians must do in reality now. Speaking to the Hebrew Christians about cleanness, Paul said: “Let us approach with sincere hearts in the full assurance of faith, having had our hearts sprinkled from a wicked conscience and our bodies washed with clean water. Let us hold fast the public declaration of our hope without wavering, for he is faithful that promised. And let us consider one another to incite to love and right works, not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and all the more so as you behold the day drawing near.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Heb. 10:22-25</a>) Christians must assemble in these last days, but must always be clean in their worship, which includes their lifelong and daily activities.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">20. In what ways do Jehovah’s witnesses continue in an upright and clean course?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> Worship by Jehovah’s witnesses is not confined to meeting together and inciting one another to love and right works just once a week. All day long and every day they must be worshipers of God, whether they be in meetings or away from their Kingdom Hall. After becoming a Christian one must keep clean, as he has already been washed clean by the blood of Christ Jesus. Christ is not going to die a second time to give one a second washing. Many who become Christians have walked with the wicked in fornication, idolatry, greed and drunkenness, but as Paul said to the Corinthian congregation: “But you have been washed clean, but you have been sanctified, but you have been declared righteous in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and with the spirit of our God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 Cor. 6:11</a>) Like David we must wash our hands in innocency, show everyone that we are clean and separate from the Devil’s organization and devoted to true worship. We are in the world but are no part of it, and we cannot have upon us the stain of its guilt. Even Pilate did not want the responsibility of the death of Christ Jesus upon him. Before the great crowd of angry <span id="page14" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>Jews Pilate laid all the guilt on the clergy of his day by taking water and washing his hands before the lovers of unrighteousness, saying: “I am innocent of the blood of this man. You must see to it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Matt. 27:24</a>) But he really could not wash his hands in innocency like David.</p>

<strong>Examples of Keepers of Integrity</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Immediately after Jesus was baptized in water he was led out into the wilderness by the operation of God’s spirit that had come down upon him, anointing him. There he was put to the test by Satan the Devil. Satan was the symbolic Dragon that had caused the wild beast to come up out of the sea and that gave to the wild beast “its power and its throne and great authority.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rev. 13:1, 2</a>) Under temptation by this Dragon, Jesus did not act like that wild beast, but kept in harmony with God’s purpose concerning the kingdom of God, the kingdom of the heavens. To tempt Jesus, the Devil showed him “all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth in an instant of time” and said: “I will give you all this authority and the glory of them, because it has been delivered to me and to whomever I wish I give it. You, therefore, if you do an act of worship before me, it will all be yours.” Rather than grab after the kingdoms of this old world, like the “wild beast” without understanding, Jesus held to the principle of Jehovah’s worship and stuck to God’s kingdom of the heavens. As the Leader of Christianity, Jesus answered the “god of this system of <span id="page760" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="760" data-before-text="760"></span>things” straight and declared the special principle that governs his conduct and also our conduct, if we are Christians: “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 4:5-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Deut. 6:13</a>.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">12.

His kingdom was not of the same source as Caesar’s or as that of the symbolic wild beast. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">John 18:36</a>) Jesus gathered no army to free ancient Israel from Caesar’s taxation and control or to establish a political State on earth. He foretold the destruction of natural Israel and he let it be destroyed by the armies of the Roman Caesar at the downfall of Jerusalem and its temple A.D. 70. Why? Because Jesus was for spiritual Israel. The kingdom he was after was the spiritual kingdom of the heavens, the kingdom that he preached and that he commanded his true followers to preach about in this time of the end of the old world.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">13.

For I have not sat with men of untruth, and with those who conceal what they are I do not come in. I have hated the congregation of evildoers, and with the wicked ones I do not sit. I shall wash my hands in innocency itself, and I will march around your altar, O Jehovah, to cause thanksgiving to be heard aloud, and to declare all your wonderful works. Do not take away my soul along with sinners, nor my life along with bloodguilty men, in whose hands there is loose conduct and whose right hand is full of bribery.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 26:3-7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 9, 10</a>) King David did not want to be associated with such persons during his lifetime. He did not want to be found even dead with them, whether rulers or political officials or plain citizens. With this desire in his heart he shunned them during his life and kept away from untruth and hypocrisy, from bloodguilt and loose conduct, and from accepting or demanding bribes. On the basis of this he could implore God not to take away his soul and his life along with the sinful and the blood guilty men. He wanted to be delivered from the destruction that would come up on such sinners and bloodstained men from God’s hand. Although the theocratic kingdom of Israel of which he was ruler was in the midst of the world there in the Middle East, yet King David did not want his kingdom to be a part of this world.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">16.

We, if claiming to be his followers, must avoid associating with this old world now so full of men like those whom David avoided. Because we are flesh and blood like other humans, we have to live in this world during its “time of the end.” But we cannot be of this old world and also be of God’s new world which we preach. Jesus himself stated this principle in these words: “If you were part of the world, the world would be fond of what is its own. Now because you are no part of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, on this account the world hates you.” According to this same principle Jesus prayed to God and said: “I have given your word to them, but the world has hated them, because they are no part of the world just as I am no part of the world. I request you, not to take them out of the world, but to watch over them because of the wicked one.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">John 15:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 17:14, 15</a>.</p>

<strong>The Confidence of the Upright</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> Worship by Jehovah’s witnesses is not confined to meeting together and inciting one another to love and right works just once a week. All day long and every day they must be worshipers of God, whether they be in meetings or away from their Kingdom Hall. After becoming a Christian one must keep clean, as he has already been washed clean by the blood of Christ Jesus. Christ is not going to die a second time to give one a second washing. Many who become Christians have walked with the wicked in fornication, idolatry, greed and drunkenness, but as Paul said to the Corinthian congregation: “But you have been washed clean, but you have been sanctified, but you have been declared righteous in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and with the spirit of our God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 Cor. 6:11</a>) Like David we must wash our hands in innocency, show everyone that we are clean and separate from the Devil’s organization and devoted to true worship. We are in the world but are no part of it, and we cannot have upon us the stain of its guilt. Even Pilate did not want the responsibility of the death of Christ Jesus upon him. Before the great crowd of angry <span id="page14" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>Jews Pilate laid all the guilt on the clergy of his day by taking water and washing his hands before the lovers of unrighteousness, saying: “I am innocent of the blood of this man. You must see to it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Matt. 27:24</a>) But he really could not wash his hands in innocency like David.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">21. Who is it that stands alone today in emulating the works of Christ Jesus, and what is their message?</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> Christendom too must take the whole load of responsibility for defiling Jehovah’s worship through their wicked and unclean lives. But as for Jehovah’s witnesses, they will wash their hands and stand alone as true Christians separate from every branch of Christendom. They must take this stand to be acceptable for true worship of Jehovah. Our separation from the false worshipers makes it possible “to cause thanksgiving to be heard aloud, and to declare all your wonderful works. Jehovah, I have loved the dwelling of your house and the place of the residence of your glory.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Ps. 26:7, 8</a>) With thanksgiving in their hearts Jehovah’s witnesses thrill to make known the wonderful works of Jehovah from the creation of man in the garden of Eden to the restoration of all humankind in the paradise earth. As Christ Jesus stood alone, separate from all religions, in declaring that the kingdom of the heavens is at hand, so Jehovah’s witnesses today are all alone in their announcement of God’s kingdom. They are telling the world that we are living in the last days of this wicked organization and there is about to begin a new government that will rule in righteousness. To let all persons of good will know the good news it takes a great deal of preaching in the homes of the people, and teaching too, using the householder’s own Bible. Why not study with them and ‘cause their thanksgiving to be heard aloud’?</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong>TO ESCAPE BEING TAKEN AWAY WITH SINNERS</strong></p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">22.

He did it before in the catastrophe of Noah’s day when he destroyed all the depraved ones by the flood because of their sinfulness. He wiped out those in Sodom and Gomorrah. God condemned in judgment the scribes and Pharisees of Jesus’ day because they were bloodguilty men. Judas was condemned to Gehenna because his right hand was full of bribery. Later Ananias was struck dead because of lying, and Jude wrote of “ungodly men, turning the undeserved kindness of our God into an excuse for loose conduct.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Jude 4</a>) Today the sacredness of life is no longer held in high esteem by most of the peoples or their rulers. While the clergy and the politicians backed up by big business cry, Peace, peace! they prepare for war on an even greater scale. Destruction of mankind is their theme of the day. To have anything to do with such a system of things is not wise, for “he that is having dealings with the stupid ones will fare badly.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Prov. 13:20</a>) The end of such bloodguilty, loose-living, bribe-loving men will be destruction at the battle of Armageddon!</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">23. On the other hand, what is the promise to those confident in uprightness?</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> On the other hand, those confident in their uprightness are like David and true dedicated followers of Christ Jesus. They can say: “As for me, in my integrity I shall walk. O redeem me and show me favor.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Ps. 26:11</a>) This is like saying, Deliver me from the wicked and show me favor. Through Moses God delivered the children of Israel, or redeemed them from <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>Egypt, leading them to the Promised Land. Jehovah gave mankind the Greater Moses, Christ Jesus, the Redeemer of all mankind, if they accept him as Jehovah’s gift for their redemption. When we see the miracles that Christ performed while on earth it makes us think of the fuller complete life men will enjoy under the Kingdom arrangements. If on earth he healed the sick, opened blind eyes, even raised the dead, surely with all power in heaven and earth he can build a perfect new world of righteousness according to his Father’s will.</p>

<strong>Examples of Keepers of Integrity</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Immediately after Jesus was baptized in water he was led out into the wilderness by the operation of God’s spirit that had come down upon him, anointing him. There he was put to the test by Satan the Devil. Satan was the symbolic Dragon that had caused the wild beast to come up out of the sea and that gave to the wild beast “its power and its throne and great authority.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rev. 13:1, 2</a>) Under temptation by this Dragon, Jesus did not act like that wild beast, but kept in harmony with God’s purpose concerning the kingdom of God, the kingdom of the heavens. To tempt Jesus, the Devil showed him “all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth in an instant of time” and said: “I will give you all this authority and the glory of them, because it has been delivered to me and to whomever I wish I give it. You, therefore, if you do an act of worship before me, it will all be yours.” Rather than grab after the kingdoms of this old world, like the “wild beast” without understanding, Jesus held to the principle of Jehovah’s worship and stuck to God’s kingdom of the heavens. As the Leader of Christianity, Jesus answered the “god of this system of <span id="page760" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="760" data-before-text="760"></span>things” straight and declared the special principle that governs his conduct and also our conduct, if we are Christians: “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 4:5-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Deut. 6:13</a>.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">12.

His kingdom was not of the same source as Caesar’s or as that of the symbolic wild beast. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">John 18:36</a>) Jesus gathered no army to free ancient Israel from Caesar’s taxation and control or to establish a political State on earth. He foretold the destruction of natural Israel and he let it be destroyed by the armies of the Roman Caesar at the downfall of Jerusalem and its temple A.D. 70. Why? Because Jesus was for spiritual Israel. The kingdom he was after was the spiritual kingdom of the heavens, the kingdom that he preached and that he commanded his true followers to preach about in this time of the end of the old world.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">13.

For I have not sat with men of untruth, and with those who conceal what they are I do not come in. I have hated the congregation of evildoers, and with the wicked ones I do not sit. I shall wash my hands in innocency itself, and I will march around your altar, O Jehovah, to cause thanksgiving to be heard aloud, and to declare all your wonderful works. Do not take away my soul along with sinners, nor my life along with bloodguilty men, in whose hands there is loose conduct and whose right hand is full of bribery.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 26:3-7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 9, 10</a>) King David did not want to be associated with such persons during his lifetime. He did not want to be found even dead with them, whether rulers or political officials or plain citizens. With this desire in his heart he shunned them during his life and kept away from untruth and hypocrisy, from bloodguilt and loose conduct, and from accepting or demanding bribes. On the basis of this he could implore God not to take away his soul and his life along with the sinful and the blood guilty men. He wanted to be delivered from the destruction that would come up on such sinners and bloodstained men from God’s hand. Although the theocratic kingdom of Israel of which he was ruler was in the midst of the world there in the Middle East, yet King David did not want his kingdom to be a part of this world.</p><p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">16. Accordingly, with whom must we as followers of the Greater David keep from associating, and this according to what principle stated by Jesus?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> This points up the principle that must guide us who follow the Greater David, namely, Jesus Christ, who was David’s son <span id="page761" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="761" data-before-text="761"></span>according to the flesh, but who is now David’s Lord according to the spirit life he enjoys in heaven. We, if claiming to be his followers, must avoid associating with this old world now so full of men like those whom David avoided. Because we are flesh and blood like other humans, we have to live in this world during its “time of the end.” But we cannot be of this old world and also be of God’s new world which we preach. Jesus himself stated this principle in these words: “If you were part of the world, the world would be fond of what is its own. Now because you are no part of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, on this account the world hates you.” According to this same principle Jesus prayed to God and said: “I have given your word to them, but the world has hated them, because they are no part of the world just as I am no part of the world. I request you, not to take them out of the world, but to watch over them because of the wicked one.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/18/0" data-bid="19-1" class="b">John 15:19;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/18/1" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 17:14, 15</a>.</p>

Jehovah, I have loved the dwelling of your house and the place of the residing of your glory.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971643/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps 26 Verses 6 and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971643/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 8</a>) We too should love Jehovah’s house. Today we could look <span id="page529" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="529" data-before-text="529"></span>upon Jehovah’s house as the place where knowledge of him is given. Meetings with Christians of like precious faith “incite to love and fine works,” and this will help us to maintain integrity.

Getting to these meetings on time too is important to get the full benefit of the program. In this connection an experience reported from an African country is of interest: A riot occurred between two tribal groups just after the brothers began their meeting. Two brothers who were late saw the fighting in town and returned to their homes. One stood in the doorway of his home with a spear in his hand for protection, as he was afraid the fighting would reach his house. When the soldiers came upon him, they mistook him for one of those engaged in the fighting and refused to release him. In fact, they said: “He is not one of Jehovah’s witnesses; all of Jehovah’s witnesses were at their meeting studying the Bible, but he was not there.” And the other brother who was late? He was kidnapped and killed.</p>

<strong>God’s Service—A Cause for Joy</strong><br/><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Another way that God can be served is by obeying his commands. The importance of this was brought home to the Israelites whenever they were disobedient, and God caused them to suffer for it. In the Promised Land disobedience often resulted in his giving them into the hands of their enemies. By being obedient they could show that their worship of Jehovah was from the heart and was not empty formalism. For this reason the prophet Samuel said to their first king, Saul: “Does Jehovah have as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of Jehovah? Look! To obey is better than a sacrifice, to pay attention than the fat of rams.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966402/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Sam. 15:22</a>) <span id="page331" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="331" data-before-text="331"></span>By obeying Jehovah’s righteous commands a person can serve him, even as a humble servant does his master. Such service of God means that he is walking in the way that pleases the Most High, and it becomes a source of joy as long as he continues in that way. For this reason it is wisely written: “Happy are the ones faultless in their way, the ones walking in the law of Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966402/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 119:1</a>.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">8, 9.

In the case of the Levites, their God-given work assignment was in connection with the services at the tabernacle. Jehovah’s presence was represented there in miraculous ways, impressing upon all the importance and the privilege of serving there. So valuable was this privilege of service that it became the Levite inheritance instead of a landholding as in the case of the other tribes. To them Jehovah said: “I am your share and your inheritance in the midst of the sons of Israel.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966402/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Num. 18:20</a>) This was a distinctive service privilege over which the Levites could rejoice.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> One’s being close to God’s house where the miraculous shekinah light shone in the Most Holy, symbolizing his presence, was a delight. Serving the great God of the universe here was something to be desired. Expressing his love for this place that was so closely associated with Jehovah’s worship, David said: “Jehovah, I have loved the dwelling of your house and the place of the residing of your glory.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966402/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 26:8</a>) Levites that maintained the same attitude found great joy in serving Jehovah God at this place.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>SERVICE FOR ALL</strong></p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">10, 11.

One such opportunity was when the tabernacle was about to be constructed. The people were privileged to make contributions for its construction, and by making such contributions they had the joy of sharing in something that was very important in their worship of the true God. That they found joy in this service privilege is indicated by their overwhelming generosity. The men in charge of receiving the contributions came to Moses and said: “The people are bringing much more than what the service needs for the work that Jehovah has commanded to be done.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966402/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ex. 36:5</a>) The joy of serving God with valuable things was manifested again by this nation hundreds of years later when contributions were made for the constructing of Jehovah’s temple in Jerusalem.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> When David made known to the people the plans for building a temple during the reign of his son Solomon, he asked: “Who is there volunteering to fill his hand today with a gift for Jehovah?” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966402/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:5</a>) Their answer was a flood of contributions—gold, silver, precious stones and copper. They rejoiced at this opportunity to serve Jehovah in an active manner. “The people gave way to rejoicing over their making voluntary offerings, for it was with a complete heart that they made voluntary offerings to Jehovah; and even David the king himself rejoiced with great joy.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1966402/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:9</a>) But there were other ways that the twelve tribes could serve God with actions.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">12.

They had to remove from the land the pagan squatters on it and destroy the false gods that those people worshiped. The victories they experienced with Jehovah’s help as they carried out this divine purpose were a cause for joy. They were happy in serving Jehovah God even though they were risking their lives in doing it. And then after they had conquered the land, they were able to serve him actively by coming to Jerusalem three times a year for the festivals God commanded them to observe. This required a great effort on their part, especially for those living a great distance from Jerusalem. Their participating in these festivals was an active service of God that was inseparably linked with their worship of him. Although these were joyous occasions, they were not times for drunken revelry and gluttony, as was the case with the festivals observed by pagans. In a holy manner the Israelites were to observe the festivals of God.</p>

What is more, he has put the oversight of the building in the hands of the best, most skillful Master Worker, one who has unnumbered years in the service of this great Sovereign.

<strong>The Confidence of the Upright</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> When David was a young man he was chosen by Jehovah to be king. From the time of his anointing by the prophet Samuel he had special responsibilities. He took care of them, always seeking Jehovah. After many trials and hardships he was placed on the throne of Jehovah over the nation of Israel. One of his great joys was the bringing of the sacred ark of the covenant to the holy city of Jerusalem and establishing the place of worship of Jehovah there. On Mount Zion Jehovah’s altar was built and all Israel praised Jehovah <span id="page9" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>there. Of this place he said: “O Jehovah, who will be a guest in your tent? Who will reside in your holy mountain? He who is walking faultlessly and practicing righteousness and speaking the truth in his heart.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 15:1, 2</a>) David wanted to measure up to those requirements and to be strong, not weak or unsteady. So he had to trust in God. “In Jehovah I have trusted, that I may not wobble.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 26:1</a>) David’s reliance and faith in Jehovah were unshakable, undisturbed, calm, and there was no wavering on his part, for he was walking as one should who ‘loved the dwelling of Jehovah’s house.’</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 4.

Many prophets were sent to God’s chosen people after David’s death and their statements were written down in God’s Word for our admonition and learning. In addition to that we have the life of Christ and the Acts of the Apostles and the writings of the disciples, and now these many scriptures make up the complete Bible, the whole Word of God, for all mankind to follow. Thus equipped, Christians today should and could “practice righteousness and speak truth” and have confidence in their integrity toward Jehovah as David had!

Can Jehovah find faith in her? Do the leaders of Christendom have as clear a conscience as David? Are they able to come to Jehovah in prayer and ask him to examine, test and refine them? Are they confident that they are living up to the standards that Jehovah has set out in his Word, the Holy Bible? Do they believe all its teachings? Can all the hundreds of millions of Christendom today who are taught by the clergy be just as confident in their integrity toward Jehovah God as David was? The answer to every query is No! But they should have the faith of David if they have made a dedication to do the will and the service of God. Christendom and its supporters claim faithfulness. They say they believe the Bible and they call themselves Christians—Christlike. Whether they ask for it or not, they are being examined before Jehovah God.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 7. How has Christendom repudiated God’s Word? In support of whom?

Christendom has repudiated God’s Word by her own teachings. She has gone with this wicked world in its politics, because she supports them. She certainly is not for God’s kingdom, because Christendom gives full support to the United Nations organization. Christendom is not like Jesus, who told Pilate: “My kingdom is no part of this world.

But as for Jehovah’s witnesses, they will wash their hands and stand alone as true Christians separate from every branch of Christendom. They must take this stand to be acceptable for true worship of Jehovah. Our separation from the false worshipers makes it possible “to cause thanksgiving to be heard aloud, and to declare all your wonderful works. Jehovah, I have loved the dwelling of your house and the place of the residence of your glory.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Ps. 26:7, 8</a>) With thanksgiving in their hearts Jehovah’s witnesses thrill to make known the wonderful works of Jehovah from the creation of man in the garden of Eden to the restoration of all humankind in the paradise earth. As Christ Jesus stood alone, separate from all religions, in declaring that the kingdom of the heavens is at hand, so Jehovah’s witnesses today are all alone in their announcement of God’s kingdom. They are telling the world that we are living in the last days of this wicked organization and there is about to begin a new government that will rule in righteousness. To let all persons of good will know the good news it takes a great deal of preaching in the homes of the people, and teaching too, using the householder’s own Bible. Why not study with them and ‘cause their thanksgiving to be heard aloud’?</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong>TO ESCAPE BEING TAKEN AWAY WITH SINNERS</strong></p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">22.

He did it before in the catastrophe of Noah’s day when he destroyed all the depraved ones by the flood because of their sinfulness. He wiped out those in Sodom and Gomorrah. God condemned in judgment the scribes and Pharisees of Jesus’ day because they were bloodguilty men. Judas was condemned to Gehenna because his right hand was full of bribery. Later Ananias was struck dead because of lying, and Jude wrote of “ungodly men, turning the undeserved kindness of our God into an excuse for loose conduct.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Jude 4</a>) Today the sacredness of life is no longer held in high esteem by most of the peoples or their rulers. While the clergy and the politicians backed up by big business cry, Peace, peace! they prepare for war on an even greater scale. Destruction of mankind is their theme of the day. To have anything to do with such a system of things is not wise, for “he that is having dealings with the stupid ones will fare badly.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Prov. 13:20</a>) The end of such bloodguilty, loose-living, bribe-loving men will be destruction at the battle of Armageddon!</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">23.

They can say: “As for me, in my integrity I shall walk.

Through Moses God delivered the children of Israel, or redeemed them from <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>Egypt, leading them to the Promised Land. Jehovah gave mankind the Greater Moses, Christ Jesus, the Redeemer of all mankind, if they accept him as Jehovah’s gift for their redemption. When we see the miracles that Christ performed while on earth it makes us think of the fuller complete life men will enjoy under the Kingdom arrangements. If on earth he healed the sick, opened blind eyes, even raised the dead, surely with all power in heaven and earth he can build a perfect new world of righteousness according to his Father’s will.</p>

<strong>Examples of Keepers of Integrity</strong><br/><p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> Long ago King David acted on that principle at the same time that he prayed to be spared execution with the wicked ones and to be redeemed and shown favor by Jehovah God. This was why he preferred Jehovah’s house of worship to the companionship and association with the wicked. He said: “Jehovah, I have loved the dwelling of your house and the place of the residence of your glory.” Worship <span id="page762" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="762" data-before-text="762"></span>at God’s house provided him with the opportunity to march around God’s altar of sacrifice, to cause thanksgiving to be heard aloud and to declare all of Jehovah’s wonderful works. With this as his purpose David closed the twenty-sixth psalm, saying: “Among the congregated throngs I shall bless Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 26:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 12</a>) The public declaration that David made and then put down in written psalms worked for his own salvation to God’s new world and works also for the salvation of Christians who read David’s psalms.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">21. What is done to make us fail in our obligation and right to preach the good news, and why did Paul not bribe but appeal his case?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> Never may we dedicated Christians fail in our obligation and right to preach the good news of the Kingdom as Christ commanded. He and his disciples warned us that the political and religious powers of this world would try to take away our God-given right to preach, to put the quietus on the message, if not also to kill us and silence our voices. As regards this right the apostle Paul did not compromise. Religious persons, including men who professed to worship the Lord God, stirred up opposition to Paul at Philippi, at Thessalonica, at Beroea and finally at Jerusalem. It was in no sense of compromise that Paul finally appealed to Caesar to put a stop to this interference by religionists and to establish legally the right to preach God’s kingdom. Why, then, did Paul appeal? In order to carry the fight on to the very finish, to the highest court of the Roman empire, asking no quarter of the enemy and giving none. Even the laws of Caesar did not authorize the religionists of that time to interfere with preaching God’s kingdom. Moreover, God’s laws were all for this preaching. So Paul fought with all the weapons he had a right to use. Even for his own personal convenience Paul used no underhanded means, which would leave the issue still undecided, still unestablished legally. Hence he refused to bribe Governor Felix to let him out of prison.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Acts 24:26, 27</a>.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">22. To what purpose was Paul committed in this connection?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> As a Roman citizen Paul dignified the Kingdom message by appealing to the highest earthly judicial authority of that day, Caesar, to whom Paul as a Christian paid tax. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Acts 25:10-12</a>) Paul was entirely committed to the “defending and legally establishing of the [right to preach the] good news.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Phil. 1:7</a>) This course worked toward the fulfilling of Jesus’ prophecy in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Matthew 10:18</a>.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">23. So, like Paul, how do Jehovah’s witnesses proceed where not banned and where banned, looking for salvation from whom?</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> Today we stand upon the rightness of the principle that the Christian apostle Paul followed. Where bans do not exist against Jehovah’s witnesses, we as tax-paying citizens appeal to the modern-day Caesar, to estop the foes of the Kingdom preaching by Caesar’s own laws. Where bans do exist, Jehovah’s witnesses under the ban cannot appeal to Caesar inside his own territory. But as regards Jehovah’s command to His witnesses to preach his kingdom, they obey God as Ruler rather than the ban by men who are fighters against God and who will perish now no later than at the universal war of Armageddon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Isa. 51:12</a>) Salvation to eternal life in God’s new world will come, not through Caesar, who shortly must perish, but by God Jehovah and through Jesus Christ his reigning King.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">24. How, then, will we act just as stated by David in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 26</a>, and how, therefore, will our prayers be answered?</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="24"><sup>24</sup></span> Like King David, we, the remnant of the heirs of God’s kingdom and also the great crowd of companions of good will toward God’s kingdom, love the dwelling of Jehovah’s house and this place where his glory resides. Here we will continue to worship him in a loving adherence to the principles that he has laid out in his written <span id="page763" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="763" data-before-text="763"></span>Word for guiding and governing our Christian conduct. Here among the congregated throngs of his worshipers we will now and forever bless Jehovah. To the end of this old world we will conscientiously walk on in our Scripturally defined integrity toward God. Since we do so, our prayers will be acceptable to him and he will redeem us through Christ. When he takes away the soul and life of the sinners and bloodstained men of this world, he will preserve us amidst their catastrophic end. As a rewarder of those earnestly seeking him he will deliver us into that promised new world of his, a world of godly principle and integrity.</p>

Youths especially are susceptible to such influences. In some lands, dating is a custom, and teenagers are pressured into thinking that they must date.

<strong>Fortify Yourself So as to Maintain Integrity</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> “For I have not sat with men of untruth; and with those who hide what they are I do not come in. I have hated the congregation of evildoers, and with the wicked ones I do not sit,” continued David in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971643/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ps 26 verses 4 and 5</a>, pointing out another aspect of fortifying ourselves, that is, avoiding bad associations.

In fact, preaching to these often assists in avoiding their bad association. To illustrate this point, consider the following: One individual who was studying the Bible for just a few months, and who had been living the life of a “hippie” for some years prior to this study, said: “Sometimes people that we used to be friendly with look us up or write. They are generally very surprised at us, since we very quickly begin to tell them the good news [of the Kingdom]. Needless to say, it’s not good news to them, and surprise turns to dislike and they make hasty exits from our trailer and we don’t hear from them again. But sometimes, too, seeds fall on good soil and there is some interest generated.” Yes, faithfully speaking about our God and his kingdom helps us to avoid bad company.</p>

<strong>Examples of Keepers of Integrity</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Immediately after Jesus was baptized in water he was led out into the wilderness by the operation of God’s spirit that had come down upon him, anointing him. There he was put to the test by Satan the Devil. Satan was the symbolic Dragon that had caused the wild beast to come up out of the sea and that gave to the wild beast “its power and its throne and great authority.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rev. 13:1, 2</a>) Under temptation by this Dragon, Jesus did not act like that wild beast, but kept in harmony with God’s purpose concerning the kingdom of God, the kingdom of the heavens. To tempt Jesus, the Devil showed him “all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth in an instant of time” and said: “I will give you all this authority and the glory of them, because it has been delivered to me and to whomever I wish I give it. You, therefore, if you do an act of worship before me, it will all be yours.” Rather than grab after the kingdoms of this old world, like the “wild beast” without understanding, Jesus held to the principle of Jehovah’s worship and stuck to God’s kingdom of the heavens. As the Leader of Christianity, Jesus answered the “god of this system of <span id="page760" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="760" data-before-text="760"></span>things” straight and declared the special principle that governs his conduct and also our conduct, if we are Christians: “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 4:5-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Deut. 6:13</a>.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">12.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">John 18:36</a>) Jesus gathered no army to free ancient Israel from Caesar’s taxation and control or to establish a political State on earth. He foretold the destruction of natural Israel and he let it be destroyed by the armies of the Roman Caesar at the downfall of Jerusalem and its temple A.D. 70. Why? Because Jesus was for spiritual Israel. The kingdom he was after was the spiritual kingdom of the heavens, the kingdom that he preached and that he commanded his true followers to preach about in this time of the end of the old world.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">13.

Do not take away my soul along with sinners, nor my life along with bloodguilty men, in whose hands there is loose conduct and whose right hand is full of bribery.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 26:3-7,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 9, 10</a>) King David did not want to be associated with such persons during his lifetime. He did not want to be found even dead with them, whether rulers or political officials or plain citizens. With this desire in his heart he shunned them during his life and kept away from untruth and hypocrisy, from bloodguilt and loose conduct, and from accepting or demanding bribes. On the basis of this he could implore God not to take away his soul and his life along with the sinful and the blood guilty men. He wanted to be delivered from the destruction that would come up on such sinners and bloodstained men from God’s hand.

Youths especially are susceptible to such influences. In some lands, dating is a custom, and teenagers are pressured into thinking that they must date. Many youths become romantically involved, even though they are too young to marry. To satisfy the sexual desires that are building up inside of them, they soon become involved in immoral conduct to the point of committing fornication.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> Adults are by no means immune to bad influences.

<strong>Fortify Yourself So as to Maintain Integrity</strong><br/><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> “For I have not sat with men of untruth; and with those who hide what they are I do not come in. I have hated the congregation of evildoers, and with the wicked ones I do not sit,” continued David in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971643/21/0" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ps 26 verses 4 and 5</a>, pointing out another aspect of fortifying ourselves, that is, avoiding bad associations. The type of individuals David was talking about he mentions further in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971643/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ps 26 verses 9 and 10</a>, where he refers to them as “bloodguilty men, in whose hands there is loose conduct, and whose right hand is full of bribery.” For us to stay loyal to Jehovah we must avoid being friends with people such as these, avoid associating with such ones unnecessarily, apart, of course, from preaching the good news of God’s kingdom to them. In fact, preaching to these often assists in avoiding their bad association. To illustrate this point, consider the following: One individual who was studying the Bible for just a few months, and who had been living the life of a “hippie” for some years prior to this study, said: “Sometimes people that we used to be friendly with look us up or write. They are generally very surprised at us, since we very quickly begin to tell them the good news [of the Kingdom]. Needless to say, it’s not good news to them, and surprise turns to dislike and they make hasty exits from our trailer and we don’t hear from them again. But sometimes, too, seeds fall on good soil and there is some interest generated.” Yes, faithfully speaking about our God and his kingdom helps us to avoid bad company.</p>

<strong>Examples of Keepers of Integrity</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> Immediately after Jesus was baptized in water he was led out into the wilderness by the operation of God’s spirit that had come down upon him, anointing him. There he was put to the test by Satan the Devil. Satan was the symbolic Dragon that had caused the wild beast to come up out of the sea and that gave to the wild beast “its power and its throne and great authority.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rev. 13:1, 2</a>) Under temptation by this Dragon, Jesus did not act like that wild beast, but kept in harmony with God’s purpose concerning the kingdom of God, the kingdom of the heavens. To tempt Jesus, the Devil showed him “all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth in an instant of time” and said: “I will give you all this authority and the glory of them, because it has been delivered to me and to whomever I wish I give it. You, therefore, if you do an act of worship before me, it will all be yours.” Rather than grab after the kingdoms of this old world, like the “wild beast” without understanding, Jesus held to the principle of Jehovah’s worship and stuck to God’s kingdom of the heavens. As the Leader of Christianity, Jesus answered the “god of this system of <span id="page760" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="760" data-before-text="760"></span>things” straight and declared the special principle that governs his conduct and also our conduct, if we are Christians: “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Luke 4:5-8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/12/1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Deut. 6:13</a>.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">12.

His kingdom was not of the same source as Caesar’s or as that of the symbolic wild beast. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">John 18:36</a>) Jesus gathered no army to free ancient Israel from Caesar’s taxation and control or to establish a political State on earth. He foretold the destruction of natural Israel and he let it be destroyed by the armies of the Roman Caesar at the downfall of Jerusalem and its temple A.D. 70. Why? Because Jesus was for spiritual Israel. The kingdom he was after was the spiritual kingdom of the heavens, the kingdom that he preached and that he commanded his true followers to preach about in this time of the end of the old world.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">13.

<strong>God’s Word a Sure Guide</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Consider a few of the fields in which God’s Word gives sure guidance. It is a guide in matters of marriage. When Israel entered Canaan they were told concerning the heathen: “You must not intermarry with them, neither giving your daughters in marriage to their sons, nor receiving their daughters for your sons; for they would turn your sons from following me to serving alien gods.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952044/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Deut. 7:3, 4</a>, <em>AT</em>) To Christians the same prohibition was carried over when they were told to marry “only in the Lord”. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952044/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:39</a>, <em>NW</em>) Of course, there are always some headstrong ones who resent any interference in their personal affairs, even from God’s Word. Solomon was one of such. He married women not in the truth, probably reasoning that they were nice girls, and that he could get them into the truth after marriage. Instead, they got him out of the truth. God’s guiding Word was right, and Solomon’s rejection of it was so wrong it cost <span id="page50" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="50" data-before-text="50"></span>him eternal life. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952044/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Ki. 11:1-11</a>) It still happens today.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">After marriage and children come, God’s Word guides in rearing them. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952044/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:6, 7</a> (<em>AT</em>) states: “These instructions that I am giving you today are to be fixed in your mind; you must impress them on your children, and talk about them when you are sitting at home, and when you go off on a journey, when you lie down and when you get up.” Christian parents are instructed to raise their children “in the discipline and authoritative advice of Jehovah”. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952044/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Eph. 6:4</a>, <em>NW</em>) This does not say to wait until the child is old enough to decide for itself, to democratically cast its vote on whether it wishes to be brought up “in the discipline and authoritative advice of Jehovah”, by attendance at Kingdom Hall, etc. This would not be theocratic order in the family circle. God instructs the parent on how to rear the child, and the child does not carry any veto power over the divine command. The theocratic order is for the parent to raise the child, not the child the parent.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952044/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Prov. 22:6</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Rulers over men and nations could find good guidance in the Bible, just as the kings of Israel were commanded to find it: “As soon as he has taken his seat on his royal throne, he must write for himself in a book a copy of this code as approved by the Levitical priests; he must keep it with him, and peruse it all the days of his life, that he may learn to stand in awe of the LORD his God, by being careful to observe all the provisions of this code and these statutes, that he may not consider himself more exempt than his fellow-countrymen.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952044/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Deut. 17:18-20</a>, <em>AT.</em></p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">No special privilege for ruler or party members of a political machine. No bribes either, for <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952044/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 26:10</a> condemns those whose “right hand is filled with bribes”. (<em>Margin</em>) This word “bribe”, it is a nasty word and its use makes certain politicians nervous and fidgety. To escape this uncomfortable feeling and soothe nerves and calm fidgetings, today bribes are often called gifts. But that is out too, for <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952044/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 16:19</a> says to officials: “Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons, neither take a gift: for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.” In these days when the accepting of gifts for political favors is so common that the president of the United States suggests that public officials list all gifts received from their business connections, this Bible rule could be applied with profit to the people.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">There are many other fields in which the Bible sets forth good guidance. It guides in eating, not so much in what we eat as in how much, forbidding gluttony. It guides in drinking, not so much in what we drink as in how much, forbidding drunkenness. It would steer us out of the present moral collapse, forbidding lying and fornication and adultery. It would reduce bickering and quarreling, advising that soft answers turn away wrath. It forbids that great troublemaker in human relations, the gossiper and the talebearer. It would halt much evil at its inception, telling us to render evil for evil to no man. It would silence the guns and bombs of war, forbidding killing. It would eliminate racial prejudice, reminding us that all men came from one man, Adam, and that all can be made one in or under Christ. All class distinctions and false standards set up by vain humans would vanish under the Bible’s guidance. This old world would be changed beyond recognition if it but followed a few of the Bible’s guiding principles.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Most important of all, the Bible guides in true worship of the Creator. It explains his purposes toward the earth and us, instructs us about Christ’s kingdom, commands us to preach this kingdom. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952044/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952044/14/1" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 2 Tim. 4:2</a>) Its prophecies show us <span id="page51" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="51" data-before-text="51"></span>the sign that announces the nearness of Armageddon, the divine battle that sweeps wickedness from the earth to make room for a clean new world of righteousness. In symbol this battle is spoken of as winter, and we should see the sign of this symbolical winter’s approach. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952044/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 24:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952044/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Rev. 16:14,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1952044/15/2" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 16</a>) God-given instinct guides the animals and birds to react to the sign of literal winter’s approach and make the necessary preparations to pass through alive; God-given intelligence should make mankind react to God’s Word and the sign it gives of Armageddon’s approach and make us prepare for surviving it.</p>

<strong>Fortify Yourself So as to Maintain Integrity</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Still another aspect of fortifying ourselves is prayer. David was very conscious of this. While all of <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971643/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 26</a> is in fact a prayer, note <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971643/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Ps 26 verse 11</a>: “As for me, in my integrity I shall walk. O redeem me and show me favor.” We too should promise Jehovah that we will walk in integrity, take advantage of the arrangement he has made for our redemption, and show our appreciation for this by thanking Jehovah and by our course of action, showing him our appreciation by our works. We should keep the lines of communication with Jehovah open. We should talk to him regularly, many times each day, telling him about our love for him and our desire to do his will, talking to him about our problems and desires, seeking his guidance in all aspects of our lives. The more that prayer becomes a habit the easier it will be for us to maintain integrity. When some temptation or wrong course is presented to us, we will automatically take Jehovah into consideration. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1971643/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Prov. 2:7</a>) In fact, we will often find that in the process of talking to Jehovah in prayer about a matter or a decision we must make, Scriptural passages will come to mind that bear on the subject, thus helping us to understand Jehovah’s view on the matter.</p><p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">19. To sum up the matter of maintaining integrity, what five things can we do to fortify ourselves?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span id="page530" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="530" data-before-text="530"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> To sum up matters, what are some things that we can do to fortify ourselves so as to maintain integrity? We should personally read and study the Bible and the Bible study aids that Jehovah provides through his organization. We should avoid bad associations. We should attend meetings of those interested in Jehovah’s will and purposes. We should share in the preaching and teaching work foretold for these evil times in which we live. And we should pray regularly to Jehovah to maintain a close relationship with him and dependence on him. But what results from keeping integrity? We will leave the answer to the succeeding article.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/903/0">6/15/1963, pp. 367-369</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Maintaining Personal Integrity</strong><br/><p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> There was more than one reason why King David thought it was important to walk in God’s ways. It was not just because his own life was involved that he <span id="page368" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="368" data-before-text="368"></span>was so interested in keeping integrity, nor just for the good example that he would set for the Israelite nation over whom he was king. Nor was it only because he wanted to obtain a good report from the heathen nations around him. The primary reason was that the name of the God whom he loved and served was involved. David said: “O magnify Jehovah with me, you people, and let us exalt his name together.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 34:3</a>) Regardless of what other men thought, regardless of the opposition of his enemies, David was determined to serve Jehovah wholeheartedly. Prayerfully he said: “As for me, in my integrity I shall walk. . . . Among the congregated throngs I shall bless Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 26:11, 12</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 5. Why do we owe Jehovah our wholehearted devotion?</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="5"><sup>5</sup></span> Do we not owe our pure worship to Jehovah, who is our Creator and who promises to be our everlasting Preserver in his new world of righteousness that is so near at hand? We answer yes, because not only has God given us the life that we have at present, but he has given us the promise of life in the future. The apostle Paul had faith in this promise as a reward for serving Jehovah, because, when he wrote to Timothy, he said: “I have fought the fine fight, I have run the course to the finish, I have observed the faith. From this time on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Tim. 4:7, 8;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Rom. 6:23</a>.</p><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 6, 7. (a) Does organizational integrity guarantee personal integrity? (b) How is this demonstrated in the case of Achan?</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="6"><sup>6</sup></span> To maintain personal integrity one must appreciate that Jehovah will judge the person or the individual. It is true that today Jehovah deals with us through his visible organization. He teaches us through that organization. He corrects and chastises us through that organization. The good news of the Kingdom is being preached throughout the world by means of that organization. But, while he promises that the integrity of the organization will be preserved and maintained, this does not guarantee that just because we are associated with that organization we will maintain personal integrity.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45-47</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Achan was a part of a whole nation that was faithful to God and was then keeping national integrity. But his being born into the nation of God’s people, and his being associated with the nation that had just conquered the city of Jericho and was moving into the land of Canaan to possess it by means of God’s spirit, did not guarantee for him that God would overlook his sin of covetous disobedience and bless him in that promised land of milk and honey. Achan had failed to keep personal integrity by stealing and then lying about it, and he suffered the penalty of being tracked down, exposed, humiliated and finally permanently disfellowshiped in being stoned to death.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Josh. 7:1-26</a>.</p><p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 8.

Like these integrity-keepers, we are interested in magnifying Jehovah’s name by our conduct and example to the world before our fellow Christians, just as the Thessalonians were good examples to the believers in Macedonia. Paul wrote concerning them: “You came to be an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Thess. 1:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Matt. 24:1-15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1963443/8/2" data-bid="9-3" class="b">1 Tim. 3:7</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>HOW TO MAINTAIN PERSONAL INTEGRITY</strong></p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 9.

To be helped, we must be able to see ourselves spiritually as Jehovah God and others see us. To see how we appear to others physically we will stand in front of a mirror. That mirror will reflect to us in detail just exactly how we appear to others. We cannot be fooled in maintaining our personal appearance, because we have something to reflect to us what needs correction and by that reflection we are able to improve any defects or flaws.</p>

<strong>The Confidence of the Upright</strong><br/><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> Worship by Jehovah’s witnesses is not confined to meeting together and inciting one another to love and right works just once a week. All day long and every day they must be worshipers of God, whether they be in meetings or away from their Kingdom Hall. After becoming a Christian one must keep clean, as he has already been washed clean by the blood of Christ Jesus. Christ is not going to die a second time to give one a second washing. Many who become Christians have walked with the wicked in fornication, idolatry, greed and drunkenness, but as Paul said to the Corinthian congregation: “But you have been washed clean, but you have been sanctified, but you have been declared righteous in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and with the spirit of our God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 Cor. 6:11</a>) Like David we must wash our hands in innocency, show everyone that we are clean and separate from the Devil’s organization and devoted to true worship. We are in the world but are no part of it, and we cannot have upon us the stain of its guilt. Even Pilate did not want the responsibility of the death of Christ Jesus upon him. Before the great crowd of angry <span id="page14" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>Jews Pilate laid all the guilt on the clergy of his day by taking water and washing his hands before the lovers of unrighteousness, saying: “I am innocent of the blood of this man. You must see to it.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Matt. 27:24</a>) But he really could not wash his hands in innocency like David.</p><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">21. Who is it that stands alone today in emulating the works of Christ Jesus, and what is their message?</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> Christendom too must take the whole load of responsibility for defiling Jehovah’s worship through their wicked and unclean lives. But as for Jehovah’s witnesses, they will wash their hands and stand alone as true Christians separate from every branch of Christendom. They must take this stand to be acceptable for true worship of Jehovah. Our separation from the false worshipers makes it possible “to cause thanksgiving to be heard aloud, and to declare all your wonderful works. Jehovah, I have loved the dwelling of your house and the place of the residence of your glory.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Ps. 26:7, 8</a>) With thanksgiving in their hearts Jehovah’s witnesses thrill to make known the wonderful works of Jehovah from the creation of man in the garden of Eden to the restoration of all humankind in the paradise earth. As Christ Jesus stood alone, separate from all religions, in declaring that the kingdom of the heavens is at hand, so Jehovah’s witnesses today are all alone in their announcement of God’s kingdom. They are telling the world that we are living in the last days of this wicked organization and there is about to begin a new government that will rule in righteousness. To let all persons of good will know the good news it takes a great deal of preaching in the homes of the people, and teaching too, using the householder’s own Bible. Why not study with them and ‘cause their thanksgiving to be heard aloud’?</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><strong>TO ESCAPE BEING TAKEN AWAY WITH SINNERS</strong></p><p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">22. What is the fate of sinners, and how does Bible history bear this out?</p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> David said: “Do not take away my soul along with sinners, nor my life along with bloodguilty men, in whose hands there is loose conduct and whose right hand is full of bribery.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ps. 26:9, 10</a>) A student of the Scriptures can clearly see that Jehovah is going to destroy the wicked. He did it before in the catastrophe of Noah’s day when he destroyed all the depraved ones by the flood because of their sinfulness. He wiped out those in Sodom and Gomorrah. God condemned in judgment the scribes and Pharisees of Jesus’ day because they were bloodguilty men. Judas was condemned to Gehenna because his right hand was full of bribery. Later Ananias was struck dead because of lying, and Jude wrote of “ungodly men, turning the undeserved kindness of our God into an excuse for loose conduct.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Jude 4</a>) Today the sacredness of life is no longer held in high esteem by most of the peoples or their rulers. While the clergy and the politicians backed up by big business cry, Peace, peace! they prepare for war on an even greater scale. Destruction of mankind is their theme of the day. To have anything to do with such a system of things is not wise, for “he that is having dealings with the stupid ones will fare badly.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Prov. 13:20</a>) The end of such bloodguilty, loose-living, bribe-loving men will be destruction at the battle of Armageddon!</p><p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">23.

They can say: “As for me, in my integrity I shall walk. O redeem me and show me favor.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Ps. 26:11</a>) This is like saying, Deliver me from the wicked and show me favor. Through Moses God delivered the children of Israel, or redeemed them from <span id="page15" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>Egypt, leading them to the Promised Land. Jehovah gave mankind the Greater Moses, Christ Jesus, the Redeemer of all mankind, if they accept him as Jehovah’s gift for their redemption. When we see the miracles that Christ performed while on earth it makes us think of the fuller complete life men will enjoy under the Kingdom arrangements. If on earth he healed the sick, opened blind eyes, even raised the dead, surely with all power in heaven and earth he can build a perfect new world of righteousness according to his Father’s will.</p>

<strong>Deliverance for Integrity Toward God</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> He was therefore willing to appear before God’s judgment throne and be examined as to his pure, honest intentions and his faithful efforts to worship Jehovah alone as God and to serve Him only as the Supreme Sovereign over all the universe. This eagerness to <span id="page750" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="750" data-before-text="750"></span>be judged by the divine court shows itself in these words of David: “Judge me, O Jehovah, for I myself have walked in my own integrity, and in Jehovah I have trusted, that I may not wobble. Examine me, O Jehovah, and put me to the test; refine my kidneys [or, my deepest emotions] and my heart. For your loving-kindness is in front of my eyes, and I have walked in your truth.” Regardless of what other men did, regardless of the opposition and persecution by his enemies, King David was bent on going ahead in his wholeheartedness toward Jehovah God. Prayerfully he said: “As for me, in my integrity I shall walk. O redeem me and show me favor. My own foot will certainly stand on a level place; among the congregated throngs I shall bless Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 26:1-3,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 11, 12</a>, <em>margin</em>.</p><p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 8.

Do we not owe integrity toward God, who is our Creator and who promises to be our everlasting Preserver in his upright new world? Yes, for he has given us our life and, according to his purposes that he has revealed in the Holy Bible, he has given us something to live for. What? That promised new world under the perfect government of his Son Jesus Christ. Our walking in integrity toward our Creator and Preserver can be done in no way other than walking according to the truth and the principles that He lays down for us in his written Word. We know that all his creation moves and operates according to laws that he laid down. So he must be a God of principle in all things. To win his favor for a happy life in his endless new world we must prove ourselves persons of integrity.</p><p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 9. We must therefore be persons of what principles?</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> However, to do this we cannot be persons of our own established principles. We must be people of God’s principles. By this we do not mean the elementary things, that is, the basic things or fundamental teachings of God’s written Word, such as those mentioned in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Hebrews 5:12</a>: “You again need someone to teach you from the beginning the first principles of the sacred pronouncements of God.”</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">10.

(<em>Webster</em>) Because a principle thus means an ordered life, James could say to the apostle Paul: “You are walking orderly, you yourself also keeping the Law.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 21:24</a>) Paul himself also could say to his brothers in Christ: “To what extent we have made progress, let us go on walking orderly in this same routine”; and, “all those who will walk orderly by this rule of conduct, upon them be peace and mercy, even upon the Israel of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Phil. 3:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Gal. 6:16</a>) To live according to God’s principles requires us to walk orderly, in harmony with the rules he has laid down for our guidance and government. His Son, Jesus Christ, while he was on earth, set us a perfect example of living according to the principles of Jehovah God, his Father. We are therefore warned against walking “according to the elementary things of the world and not according to Christ; because it is in him [Christ] that all the fullness of the divine quality dwells.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Col. 2:8, 9</a>.</p>

Yet Jehovah has separated his people from this world by his truth, which has made them free, and by his organization of them that they may all act together in doing his one will for them. In this day of Jehovah he has brought forth his nation of spiritual Israel, a nation not captive to any of the nations of this world. He has given them a spiritual position before him, a theocratic position occupied by no others on earth, so that he has, as it were, caused a ‘land to be born’ in this great day of Jehovah for their residence.

As we go out to our territory to bear witness publicly and from house to house, he gives us his triumphant message today. Women and not just the men who ordinarily do the fighting are to join in this triumphal proclamation. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/69/0" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Psalm 68:11, 12</a> has come true in this respect: “Jehovah himself gives the saying; the women telling the good news are a large army. <span id="page638" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="638" data-before-text="638"></span>Even the kings of armies flee, they flee.

The Hebrew Scriptures contain the commands of Jehovah laid upon his ancient people Israel to meet together to observe special events during the year. It was obligatory in many cases for the people so to meet. Besides, it was to their blessing and benefit. The obligation to have meetings for worship was passed along to the Christian congregation of God’s people. Basically, <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1974687/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:24, 25</a> calls upon Christians to meet together and not to forget doing so.

Individually each one in the group must observe this commandment if there is to be a ‘congregated throng.’ To practice the truth as a group, each one must listen to the commandments of Jehovah. It might be argued that there is no specific command in the Scriptures that we must meet together five hours a week, as is customary among Jehovah’s people on earth. That is true. But should we not be grateful that our God is generous, abundantly supplying us with spiritual good things? We are benefited spiritually by every meeting that we attend. Our faith is strengthened. When we meet with fellow Christians we are aided to observe Jehovah’s commandments, to practice the truth. Is that not what we want to do?</p>

<strong>The Responsibility of Inciting Others to Life</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> “But, I am so worn out I can’t drag myself out, let alone go by to pick up anyone or get the family ready to go to the meetings tonight,” is heard many times. In fact, fatigue takes its steady toll and interferes many times with our Kingdom service. This can be set straight by meditating on our dedication and our determination to fit everything into its proper place to support that dedication. An interesting observation is made by Mr. Hutschnecher in his book entitled “The Will to Live”: “Everywhere, every day, people go about their tasks without weariness if they are supported by enthusiasm and belief in what they are doing.” Further, the <em>U.S. News and World Report,</em> <span id="page499" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="499" data-before-text="499"></span>January 18, 1957, reports on research findings on fatigue: “One study shows a single difference between a group of industrial workers completely ‘fagged’ and another group full of ‘bounce’ after equal tasks—the lively ones were looking forward to some sort of evening activity.” If we have in our mind not only the benefits of the meetings to ourselves but also the things we want our brothers to gain, we will be as busy as Paul in this never-ending privilege. He said: “But we desire each one of you to show the same industriousness so as to have the full assurance of the hope down to the end.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962604/22/0" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Heb. 6:11</a>) We become so absorbed in helping others and training our families that the tiredness gives way to a feeling of usefulness to Jehovah and his organization. Really, then, this kind of activity is a measuring rod of our maturity. It is putting a magnifying glass on our growth.</p><p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu">17, 18. (a) Is the getting of new ones and our families to the meetings the end of stirring up others? (b) In this regard, what family arrangement is most helpful?</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> This inciting of others to life takes in another facet of teaching, that of showing them how to comment at meetings. We can go over the lesson together and prepare portions to comment on at the meetings. Here again the progress of our student will reflect our teaching, the regularity of our help and whether we follow a definite plan or not. The counsel at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962604/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:23</a>: “Let us hold fast the public declaration of our hope without wavering, for he is faithful that promised,” will apply to both of us in this regard. Setting a good example in making public declaration will cause them to appreciate more fully <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962604/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Psalm 26:12</a>: “Among the congregated throngs I shall bless Jehovah.”</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="18"><sup>18</sup></span> Parents, arrange a family study to equip members of the family to speak up freely at the congregation meeting. Those not privileged to associate with such a family arrangement can always discuss these important truths with another brother or sister regularly every week. If we have the idea in our mind we shall be able to express it with practice. Talking will deepen the impression, and that is most essential in ‘holding fast the public declaration of our hope.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962604/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Heb. 10:23</a>) Quietness induces sleep; so why doze off at the meetings and then find that you “freeze” when someone asks you a question concerning your hope?</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">19.

Like food it strengthens us, enabling us to work hard. We are alive and healthy, taking a great interest in the preaching work. Explaining these newfound truths to others stimulates us as it did the brothers in Jesus’ time. Read <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962604/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Luke 24:13-31</a> and then notice what <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962604/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Lu 24 verse 32</a> discloses, namely: “They said to each other: ‘Were not our hearts burning as he was speaking to us on the road, as he was fully opening up the Scriptures to us?’” Very essential to remaining awake in Jehovah’s service is our discussing the many wonderful things we learn in our studies and discussing the responsibility we have to use this means to incite our brothers to life. This kind of growth comes by regularly feeding on the food providing strength. Remember that the scripture already considered at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962604/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:23,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962604/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 25</a> specifically mentions “wavering” and a “custom” of “forsaking” association with Jehovah’s people.</p><p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">20. How is our teaching put to the test?</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="20"><sup>20</sup></span> The source of strength is further identified at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962604/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">2 Timothy 2:1, 2</a>: “Keep on acquiring power in the undeserved kindness that is in connection with Christ Jesus, and the things you heard from me with the support of many witnesses, these things commit to faithful men, who, in turn, will be adequately qualified to teach others.” Our talking is not just to get something <span id="page500" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="500" data-before-text="500"></span>“off our mind.” It is more than that. We speak so the hearer can tell still others. The effect and forcefulness of their speech is going to reflect our maturity.

<strong>Hold Fast Your Joy!</strong><br/><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="19"><sup>19</sup></span> Do you humbly acknowledge your entire dependence upon Jehovah for life and its blessings? Then you should also humbly acknowledge your dependence on his earthly organization today. There is no place of real safety outside God’s New World society. All lovers of life must find their place, and hold their place, within that society, regularly attending the <em>Watchtower</em> study meeting, the service meeting and theocratic ministry school, listening attentively to the public Bible talks, and supporting the midweek congregation book study. Happy are all those that crowd all these meetings into a busy week, for in so doing they are crowding out the inconsequential things that the enemy would like to sow in their Christian lives. Happy, because they are conscious of their spiritual need! Happy, because they are pressing on to maturity with all of God’s people throughout the wide world! Happy, because they are building up strength to <span id="page115" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="115" data-before-text="115"></span>withstand the final assault from Satan’s world, which even now heaps scorn and persecutions on their heads! “Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you and lyingly say every kind of wicked thing against you for my [Jesus’] sake. Rejoice and leap for joy, since your reward is great in the heavens.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Matt. 5:11, 12</a>.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">20.

Remember how our German brothers maintained their entity of organization while they were being compelled to flee from the Sachsenhausen concentration camp at the climax of World War II. Amid shootings, machine-gunnings, pillagings and death by exhaustion, our 230 brothers marched out in theocratic order, the one group in all that confusion of death and warfare that trusted in Jehovah God. Did Jehovah answer their united prayer for guidance? Did he lead and protect that small group of his worshipers? The report says: “From our troop of about 230 brothers and sisters none, not even the weakest, was lying on the road, despite the fact that we had some brothers from 65 to 72 years of age. They were all standing faithfully.”<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1961122/0">a</a> During future trials, and through Armageddon’s battle itself, the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses expects to keep standing faithfully, in the one united, theocratic order. Now is the time to seek that association, so that you also may find joy in saying: “In Jehovah I have trusted, that I may not wobble. My own foot will certainly stand on a level place; among the congregated throngs I shall bless Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Ps. 26:1,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961122/33/1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 12</a>.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">21.

What a lot the people of the old world are missing! They are also missing the opportunity for everlasting life. Make sure that <em>you</em> take a firm hold on the real life. Having found that joy, never let it go! “Always be rejoicing. Pray incessantly. In connection with everything give thanks.

<strong>The Confidence of the Upright</strong><br/><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> On the other hand, those confident in their uprightness are like David and true dedicated followers of Christ Jesus.

Jehovah gave mankind the Greater Moses, Christ Jesus, the Redeemer of all mankind, if they accept him as Jehovah’s gift for their redemption. When we see the miracles that Christ performed while on earth it makes us think of the fuller complete life men will enjoy under the Kingdom arrangements.

God’s servants of integrity today feel just like Nehemiah, because we are living in the time of the purifying of God’s people. Nehemiah said: “Do remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not blot out my acts of loving-kindness that I have performed in connection with the house of my God and the guardianship of it.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1958003/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Neh. 13:14</a>.</p><p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="25"><sup>25</sup></span> All the true servants of God want to continue in right worship and maintain integrity and be redeemed or delivered through the battle of Armageddon. They want to see the time come when there will be no more discord, wars, selfishness, corruption and when everyone will be praising Jehovah God and blessing him. That will be seen in completion after the battle of the great day of God the Almighty—Armageddon. By faith all true Christians look to and work for that happy day, but they start living by the standards of that day now.</p><p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">26.

Why cannot man see that color of skin, language of tongue or stature of body does not make him any different from his neighbor? We all have one Maker, we are all brothers, descendants of Adam and Eve, and destined to worship only one God. We must find him! We can if we read about him in his Word, the Bible. Jehovah’s witnesses are sincerely trying to acquaint people with Jehovah, and if they can do so it will mean for those getting to know God a happy and new life in a new world not far distant.</p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">27.

Examine me, O Jehovah, and put me to the test; refine my kidneys [or, my deepest emotions] and my heart. For your loving-kindness is in front of my eyes, and I have walked in your truth.” Regardless of what other men did, regardless of the opposition and persecution by his enemies, King David was bent on going ahead in his wholeheartedness toward Jehovah God.

Yes, for he has given us our life and, according to his purposes that he has revealed in the Holy Bible, he has given us something to live for. What? That promised new world under the perfect government of his Son Jesus Christ. Our walking in integrity toward our Creator and Preserver can be done in no way other than walking according to the truth and the principles that He lays down for us in his written Word. We know that all his creation moves and operates according to laws that he laid down. So he must be a God of principle in all things.

(<em>Webster</em>) Because a principle thus means an ordered life, James could say to the apostle Paul: “You are walking orderly, you yourself also keeping the Law.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 21:24</a>) Paul himself also could say to his brothers in Christ: “To what extent we have made progress, let us go on walking orderly in this same routine”; and, “all those who will walk orderly by this rule of conduct, upon them be peace and mercy, even upon the Israel of God.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Phil. 3:16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Gal. 6:16</a>) To live according to God’s principles requires us to walk orderly, in harmony with the rules he has laid down for our guidance and government. His Son, Jesus Christ, while he was on earth, set us a perfect example of living according to the principles of Jehovah God, his Father. We are therefore warned against walking “according to the elementary things of the world and not according to Christ; because it is in him [Christ] that all the fullness of the divine quality dwells.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957924/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Col. 2:8, 9</a>.</p>

With this as his purpose David closed the twenty-sixth psalm, saying: “Among the congregated throngs I shall bless Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/23/0" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 26:8,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/23/1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 12</a>) The public declaration that David made and then put down in written psalms worked for his own salvation to God’s new world and works also for the salvation of Christians who read David’s psalms.</p><p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">21. What is done to make us fail in our obligation and right to preach the good news, and why did Paul not bribe but appeal his case?</p><p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="21"><sup>21</sup></span> Never may we dedicated Christians fail in our obligation and right to preach the good news of the Kingdom as Christ commanded. He and his disciples warned us that the political and religious powers of this world would try to take away our God-given right to preach, to put the quietus on the message, if not also to kill us and silence our voices. As regards this right the apostle Paul did not compromise. Religious persons, including men who professed to worship the Lord God, stirred up opposition to Paul at Philippi, at Thessalonica, at Beroea and finally at Jerusalem. It was in no sense of compromise that Paul finally appealed to Caesar to put a stop to this interference by religionists and to establish legally the right to preach God’s kingdom. Why, then, did Paul appeal? In order to carry the fight on to the very finish, to the highest court of the Roman empire, asking no quarter of the enemy and giving none. Even the laws of Caesar did not authorize the religionists of that time to interfere with preaching God’s kingdom. Moreover, God’s laws were all for this preaching. So Paul fought with all the weapons he had a right to use. Even for his own personal convenience Paul used no underhanded means, which would leave the issue still undecided, still unestablished legally. Hence he refused to bribe Governor Felix to let him out of prison.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/24/0" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Acts 24:26, 27</a>.</p><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">22. To what purpose was Paul committed in this connection?</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> As a Roman citizen Paul dignified the Kingdom message by appealing to the highest earthly judicial authority of that day, Caesar, to whom Paul as a Christian paid tax. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Acts 25:10-12</a>) Paul was entirely committed to the “defending and legally establishing of the [right to preach the] good news.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Phil. 1:7</a>) This course worked toward the fulfilling of Jesus’ prophecy in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Matthew 10:18</a>.</p><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">23.

Where bans do not exist against Jehovah’s witnesses, we as tax-paying citizens appeal to the modern-day Caesar, to estop the foes of the Kingdom preaching by Caesar’s own laws. Where bans do exist, Jehovah’s witnesses under the ban cannot appeal to Caesar inside his own territory. But as regards Jehovah’s command to His witnesses to preach his kingdom, they obey God as Ruler rather than the ban by men who are fighters against God and who will perish now no later than at the universal war of Armageddon. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957925/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Isa. 51:12</a>) Salvation to eternal life in God’s new world will come, not through Caesar, who shortly must perish, but by God Jehovah and through Jesus Christ his reigning King.</p><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">24.

As we approach the day of days when Jehovah will make wars to cease to the extremity of the earth, breaking the enemy armaments to pieces and setting astonishing events in the earth, we need to keep united as his people and to meet together as often as can be arranged. “Look! how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity!” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/64/0" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Ps. 133:1</a>) To promote that goodness and pleasantness of unitedly dwelling together we should take hold of the opportunity and build one another up as fellow believers <span id="page637" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="637" data-before-text="637"></span>and fellow servants. We meet, not only to praise the universal Sovereign and his kingdom, but to help one another to praise him before people on the outside who need salvation. Our determination should be: “As for me, in my integrity I shall walk. O redeem me and show me favor. My own foot will certainly stand on a level place; among the congregated throngs I shall bless Jehovah.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/65/0" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Ps. 26:11, 12</a>) “I will laud you in the big congregation; among a numerous people I shall praise you.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/66/0" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Ps. 35:18</a>.</p><p id="p101" data-pid="101" class="qu">41.

We dwell scattered around the earth in the midst of worldly peoples, whose ungodly practices and beliefs and nationalistic pride and ambitions we must resist. Yet Jehovah has separated his people from this world by his truth, which has made them free, and by his organization of them that they may all act together in doing his one will for them. In this day of Jehovah he has brought forth his nation of spiritual Israel, a nation not captive to any of the nations of this world. He has given them a spiritual position before him, a theocratic position occupied by no others on earth, so that he has, as it were, caused a ‘land to be born’ in this great day of Jehovah for their residence. There he has brought the spiritual children of his woman Zion, and there he has gathered to them hundreds of thousands of temporary residents of good will.</p><p id="p103" data-pid="103" class="qu">43.

There is the suitable place to talk about the God who has made us his organized people. There before and with our brothers in the faith we should express our joy in Jehovah, who has become our King since 1914. The blessing from this to us will be a deepening of our love for him and his Christ and for our brothers, and a strengthening of our tie to one another to stick together against all the world that is united against Jehovah and us as his witnesses.</p><p id="p104" data-pid="104" class="qu">44.

By faith, in the light of prophecy, we see his victory and we can rejoice because of what that victory will mean for his own universal sovereignty and for the blessing of all who love and serve him. As we go out to our territory to bear witness publicly and from house to house, he gives us his triumphant message today. Women and not just the men who ordinarily do the fighting are to join in this triumphal proclamation. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1957767/69/0" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Psalm 68:11, 12</a> has come true in this respect: “Jehovah himself gives the saying; the women telling the good news are a large army. <span id="page638" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="638" data-before-text="638"></span>Even the kings of armies flee, they flee.

Well, David the son of Jesse of the little town of Bethlehem had such magnificent courage, and for it he gained the victory over wild beast and beastlike giant.

It was because of his being a faithful worshiper of this God and a full believer in Him that David was inspired with victorious courage. In this he was a right example for us. To the end of his life he never lost his courage. Why? Because he never let go of his God. To his credit Jehovah speaks of him as “my servant David, who kept my commandments and who walked after me with all his heart by doing only what was right in my eyes.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961921/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Ki. 14:8</a>.</p><p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">10.

Of whom shall I be in fear? Jehovah is the stronghold of my life. Of whom shall I be in dread?” So David was not afraid of the giant Goliath or of Goliath’s gods. David was not disappointed in his own God, for Jehovah won the battle with the false gods. David’s reliance upon God in the face of odds was the secret of his courage.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>“MY LIGHT AND MY SALVATION”</strong></p><p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">11.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961921/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Eccl. 11:7</a>) Today’s international system of things lies in the power of a wicked god, Satan the Devil, and it is nearing its destruction. But why should any lover of the light of life go down into the darkness of destruction of this old world? No one today needs to walk on in the darkness of this world’s uncertainty and perplexity, with no salvation by human means in sight. Being in the dark as to how the oncoming universal conflict of Armageddon will turn out makes men feel insecure. It inspires fear, and fear causes weakness. O if men would only turn to the psalmist David’s God, Jehovah! Then God would become to them what he was to David, a “light” to show the way to go and to remove all fear of the future, yes, a “salvation” that delivers us from destruction with this world. That salvation comes through the kingdom of God’s dear Son, Jesus Christ, who was foreshadowed by David but who has become a heavenly King greater than David.</p>

Among Jehovah’s witnesses freedom from fear results from what?</p><p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[17]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>JEHOVAH’S witnesses are filled with confidence in Jehovah, the living God. They see his direction of them and they observe how he aids them in their service. They appreciate that they are backed up by his holy spirit or active force. They see the strength in the unity of Jehovah’s organization and they rejoice in sticking together in performing his purposes. Knowing that Jehovah is with them, Jehovah’s witnesses are not afraid. The psalmist says: “Jehovah is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? Jehovah is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? When evil-doers came upon me to eat up my flesh, even mine adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell. Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, even then will I be confident. One thing have I asked of Jehovah, that will I seek after: That I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of Jehovah, and to inquire in his temple.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1955005/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 27:1-4</a>, AS) Every one of Jehovah’s witnesses wants to dwell in the house of Jehovah forever. They have dedicated themselves as Jehovah’s slaves and they are fully cognizant of Jehovah’s will concerning them. They know what he wants them to do despite any outside influences. Knowing that the taking in of more knowledge of him and his purposes is the right thing to do and the way to life eternal, and knowing that they want to live so they can serve Jehovah, they certainly will not be fearful of anyone else. So they ask: “Whom shall I fear?” If they fear man, then they fall into man’s snare. If they are afraid of evildoers and any hurt that may come upon them, they will fall into a snare. But by their staying wholly on Jehovah’s side and in his organization and close to the congregation of his people they will continually observe their adversaries falling and stumbling, and eventually vanishing permanently in the battle of Armageddon, now near.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="qu"> 2. How are activities of Jehovah’s witnesses affected by communism’s organized opposition?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[18]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> Even though the entire communistic organization globally lines itself up against Jehovah’s people, as it now does behind its “iron curtain,” the hearts of Jehovah’s witnesses will not fear. As the 1954 report shows, those fearless ones behind the “Iron Curtain” are not ceasing their service to Jehovah God. They still remain his obedient slaves and preach Jehovah’s kingdom, not communism. Even though war were to rise up against them, still they would be confident that Jehovah God would protect them.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="qu"> 3. What desire and determination underlie the fearless behavior of Jehovah’s witnesses?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[19]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> Having studied Jehovah’s Word day by day, privately and congregationally, a true witness of Jehovah God will always seek his Father in heaven and worship him and will want to bless him every day. He will not only <em>want</em> to do it, he <em>will</em> do it, as Jehovah’s witnesses have been doing for the past many years, and especially so during the 1954 service year of the Watch<span id="page25" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>Tower Society. This you can prove as you study the chart on pages 27 to 29. You do not see Jehovah’s witnesses running for cover and trying to seek safety within the worldly governments of the Devil’s organization. These governments, with their religious false shepherds, their high and mighty political shepherds, and their powerful business organizations cannot give life to man. Jehovah’s witnesses know that, and because of their careful study of God’s Word they see that life comes through knowledge of the Sovereign Ruler of the universe and of his Son Christ Jesus, and that life is a gift of God to them because of their obedience to his commands. Why should they seek anything less than life eternal?</p>

Those spiritual children of God’s holy organization who still remain on earth but who are called to reign with Jesus Christ in his heavenly kingdom for the preserving and blessing of the human race.

They can consume our thoughts, sap our strength, and affect our very outlook on life. King David of ancient Israel was beset by many hardships. How did he face them? In a touching psalm, David answers: “With my voice I call to Jehovah for help; with my voice I plead with Jehovah for favor. Before him I pour out my concern; before him I tell about my distress when my spirit fails within me. Then you watch my roadway.” Yes, David humbly prayed to God for help.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2014128/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 142:1-3</a>.</p>

It was David himself who made arrangements for the elaborate temple structure that was to be built by his son Solomon. Centuries later, Jesus revealed that rendering acceptable worship to Jehovah would no longer be contingent on having one grand structure that was blessed by God. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012524/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">John 4:21-23</a>) The apostle Paul indicated in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2012524/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Hebrews chapters 8 to 10</a> that a great spiritual temple came into existence at Jesus’ baptism in 29 C.E., when he presented himself to do Jehovah’s will.

How do we worship there? By praying “with true hearts in the full assurance of faith”; by declaring our hope publicly without wavering; and by considering, inciting, and encouraging fellow worshippers when we assemble together at our congregation meetings and during family worship.

For example, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007086/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 27:4</a>, he wrote: “One thing I have asked from Jehovah​—it is what I shall look for, that I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, to behold the pleasantness of Jehovah and to look with appreciation upon his temple.” In the original Hebrew, the expression “to look with appreciation” means to linger in contemplation, to scrutinize, to see with pleasure, delight, admiration. Clearly, David was a man of spiritual depth who truly appreciated Jehovah’s spiritual provisions and relished every morsel of spiritual truth that God revealed. His example of appreciation is worthy of imitation.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/2007086/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 19:7-11</a>.</p>

It pleased David greatly to be among Jehovah’s worshipers at God’s sanctuary. He declared: “One thing I have asked from Jehovah​—it is what I shall look for, that I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, to behold the pleasantness of Jehovah and to look with appreciation upon his temple.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973484/19/0" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 27:4</a>) If we truly appreciate Jehovah’s earthly organization, we will long to be at Christian meetings and assemblies.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973484/20/0" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 84:1-4</a>.</p>

<strong>Make Jehovah Your Delight</strong><br/><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> King David had a great desire. He set his heart on it as a longed-for delight. This is how he expressed himself about it: “One thing I have asked from Jehovah​—it is what I shall look for, that I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, to behold the pleasantness of Jehovah and to look with appreciation upon his temple.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1972204/25/0" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ps. 27:4</a>) Other versions render the last expression: “to inquire in his temple,” but David desired more than this. The Hebrew verb, <em>baqar</em>, basically, means to slit; to divide. It took on the meaning of scrutinizing.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1972204/0">a</a> The psalmist uses it in the sense of seeing with pleasure or delight. For an example of contemplating, how do sea gulls regard a field that is being cultivated? If near the sea, there is often an excited crowd of these birds closely following the plow, regardless of a noisy tractor. The air is filled with their wings and sharp cries. Those birds surely “look with appreciation” on every worm and grub that is made to appear.</p><p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">14.

Being of the tribe of Judah, he could never render priestly or Levitical service at the temple. In fact, it was not even built during his reign, though it seems that the tent housing the Ark was at times called a temple.

What a fine example he set for all servants of Jehovah today!—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962486/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 27:4</a>.<a id="footnotesource1" data-fnid="1" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1962486/0">a</a></p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In David’s day Jehovah’s house was the tabernacle originally constructed in the wilderness. However, it was termed a temple here by David and by Samuel, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962486/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Samuel 1:9</a>, because it was indeed Jehovah’s glorious palace, which is the literal meaning of the Hebrew word <em>heykhal,</em> here rendered “temple.” Not being of the tribe of Levi, David could not, of course, literally dwell at Jehovah’s house or temple. But he could be at that place on every suitable occasion to join with his fellow Israelites in the worship of their God Jehovah.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">After the day of Pentecost Jehovah no longer recognized that literal house in Jerusalem. From then on the Greater Solomon, Jesus Christ, began building a spiritual house or temple, and for many centuries worship at that temple was limited to “the congregation of the first-born who have been enrolled in the heavens.” Today, however, the prophecy of Isaiah regarding that house in a special way is being fulfilled: “My own house will be called even a house of prayer for all the peoples.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962486/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb. 12:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962486/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Isa. 56:7</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The prayer of David at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962486/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 27:4</a> should be the prayer of each one of God’s servants today. How does one prove that this prayer does indeed express the sentiments of his heart? First of all by dedicating himself to Jehovah to do his will.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962486/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 40:7, 8</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">But that step marks only the beginning. One shows that he has asked Jehovah for this grand blessing of dwelling at his house all the days of his life by taking advantage of all opportunities to assemble with Jehovah’s congregation. That means he will put forth diligent efforts to attend all congregational meetings not being easily discouraged because of much and arduous travel, because of bad weather or because it may displease worldly relatives or acquaintances.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Additionally, one proves that David’s words are his sentiments by going from house to house inviting men of goodwill likewise to dwell at Jehovah’s house.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962486/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isa. 2:3</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In all such ways Jehovah’s servants prove that the sentiments of David’s prayer are indeed theirs. Thereby they will get to behold, to know and to feel the pleasantness of Jehovah, just what a loving and glorious God he truly is.</p>

Hence when that final phase of the war by the dragon, Satan the Devil, rises against them, the remnant and their God-fearing companions will do like the psalmist David, keep trusting in Jehovah their Light and their Salvation.<a id="footnotesource2" data-fnid="2" class="fn" href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/fn/r1/lp-e/1961921/1">b</a></p><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="ss"><strong>THE “ONE THING” ASKED FOR</strong></p><p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu">22. As expressed by the psalmist David, what is the one big thing that we ask and look for and that is really behind our prayer for deliverance from the wicked one?</p><p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[67]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="22"><sup>22</sup></span> If we pray the Lord’s Prayer as taught by Jesus Christ, we pray: “Deliver us from the wicked one.” It is true that when we thus pray we ask to be saved from the temptations and warfare by Satan the Devil. But there is another thing that we ask and want given us, which makes us ask for such deliverance from the wicked Devil. That other thing, that all-absorbing thing, is suggested in the first part of the Lord’s Prayer, namely: “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961921/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 6:9,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961921/13/1" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 13</a>) This one all-dominating thing is well stated by the psalmist David in these beautiful words: “One thing I have asked from Jehovah—it is what I shall look for, that I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, to behold the pleasantness of Jehovah and to look with appreciation upon his temple.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961921/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 27:4</a>.</p><p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="qu">23, 24. (a) Why was what David wanted to behold called the “pleasantness of Jehovah”? (b) How did Jesus describe just how pleasant Jehovah is?</p><p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[68]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="23"><sup>23</sup></span> This “one thing” was the heart or essence of all David’s prayers. It was nothing <span id="page747" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="747" data-before-text="747"></span>political or materialistic or fleshly. It was something spiritual. He desired to have direct, personal contact with Jehovah’s temple of worship. It was because he admired Jehovah as the living God. His personal acquaintance with Jehovah by reading the Holy Scriptures and by his experience with Jehovah’s dealings stirred him to a worshipful attitude. Especially at the temple David felt near to his God, for it was there that Jehovah’s priests and Levites offered up sacrifices and sang psalms of praise to Jehovah and conducted prayers to Him and read aloud portions of his written Word. At the temple David felt the brotherhood with all his fellow worshipers.</p>

From the Bible, Victoria showed the soldier Jehovah’s promise of a new world. Impressed with her integrity, the soldier gave Victoria a considerable reward from the recovered funds. Indeed, implicit faith in Jehovah’s ability to provide has given Jehovah’s Witnesses an impeccable reputation for honesty.</p>

He started working as a teacher in a secondary school, but he could not receive his salary for nearly one year until the paperwork was final. What was the last requirement Thomas had to meet before receiving his salary and back pay? An interview with the school administrator​—a priest. The priest explained that the beliefs of Jehovah’s Witnesses were not compatible with those of the institute. He insisted that Thomas choose between his job and his Bible-based beliefs. Quitting that job and forfeiting nearly a year’s salary, Thomas found other work, repairing radios and mobile phones. As this and numerous similar examples show, fear of privation may be the object of other people’s dread, but it is no match for our well-founded trust in the Creator of all things and Protector of his people.</p>

People, especially in the worst-hit areas, do not have to be told that we are living in the last days; they see the conditions all around them.” A missionary serving for over 12 years in a land where every publisher conducts, on average, more than three Bible studies writes: “Since many of the publishers have a simple lifestyle with few distractions, they generally have more time for the field ministry and Bible study work.”</p>

<strong>The Truth Transforms Lives</strong><br/><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>A New Family</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">One day Luis, a full-time evangelizer of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Argentina, was introduced to a young man who had a sad history. Abandoned by his parents at birth, he was brought up in various institutions. When he was about 20 years old, he learned the whereabouts of his mother and decided to live near her. He worked hard, saved up a lot of money, and traveled to the city where his mother was. She let him stay with her until his money ran out and then asked him to leave. This rejection made him suicidal.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">However, Luis was able to share Bible truth with this young man. That truth includes the assurance: “In case my own father <span id="page5" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>and my own mother did leave me, even Jehovah himself would take me up.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1998000/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 27:10</a>) The young man found that he had a heavenly Father who would never abandon him. He is now happy to be part of a new family, Jehovah’s family.</p>

<strong>When Children Become Wayward</strong><br/><p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Even if one’s own children were to become disloyal, Jehovah God would never abandon his devoted servants. As the Most High sustained David in time of trial and grief, so he will strengthen his people today to bear distress, including the pain resulting when children become delinquent. In fact, if all bonds of natural affection were to break down, the individual would still not be alone, hopelessly forsaken. Said David: “In case my own father and my own mother did leave me, even Jehovah himself would take me up.”​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1978764/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 27:10</a>.</p>

Courageously dwelling in Jehovah’s house all our days on earth during just the existence of this old world is not all there is to the matter. Christians who are spiritual “living stones” will, by a resurrection from the dead, be transferred to the heavens to make up Jehovah’s completed temple up there with the Corner Foundation Stone Jesus Christ. The hundreds of thousands of other dedicated worshipers who are today coming to Jehovah’s temple will continue to dwell in His house all the days of their lives in the endless new world by carrying on His pure worship on the paradise earth.</p><p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="qu"> 2.

So even with the prospect of forever dwelling in the house of Jehovah in the future after Armageddon, we want to dwell there also now before Armageddon. Hence, despite all the tribulation and persecution that we undergo in this world, Jehovah makes it possible for us to enjoy this privilege now. In a number of lands both behind and outside the Communist Iron Curtain Jehovah’s witnesses are banned and are forbidden to meet together in Bible study, and they run great dangers in trying to do so. Yet with great courage they succeed in doing so, underground. By this they show what they want for the future.</p><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="qu"> 3, 4.

Despite it we must take courage and attempt to meet together as David did under the hostile fire of the enemy. He trusted in Jehovah’s protection and in His help and deliverance to enable him to resume dwelling in God’s house. Hence David said:</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[25]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> “For he will hide me in his covert in the day of calamity; he will conceal me in the secret place of his tent; high on a rock he will put me.

Hear, O Jehovah, when I call with my voice, and show me favor and answer me. Concerning you my heart has said: ‘Seek to find my face, you people.’ Your face, O Jehovah, I shall seek to find. Do not conceal your face from me. Do not in anger turn your servant away. My assistance you must become. Do not forsake me and do not leave me, O my God of salvation.

Even calamity would not affect David spiritually, for he was hid in Jehovah’s covert place of safety, concealed in the unreachable “secret place” of Jehovah’s sacred tent, as if on a high rock unscalable by all his enemies. God would raise David’s head high in victory over the enemies of true worship. He would again have free access to God’s altar at his tent of worship in order to offer sacrifices and to sing and make melody in a public display of thanksgiving to Jehovah, who is loyal to his worshipers.</p>

<strong>Helping Youths Escape the “Death Culture”</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Young people who get no spiritual guidance from their parents can gain strength from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/102000483/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 27:10</a>, which says: “In case my own father and my own mother did leave me, even Jehovah himself would take me up.” How does Jehovah, the Father of tender mercies, help young people? The congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses have been a refuge where many have found the affection of other people and have resolved their doubts. Josías, a young man who found that to be true, comments: “Jehovah’s organization fills a vital role. I felt that life was not worthwhile. I lived without purpose, without hope. To know that one is not alone changed my life completely. I saw in the brothers in the congregation the family that I had lost. The elders and the families in the congregation are like an anchor in an emotional sense.”</p>

<strong>What is Your Heart’s Desire?</strong><br/><p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">A sister from Portugal relates her experience: “I was the only child and therefore the center of attention. But I realized that most of my time was being spent at my secular job. My parents did not depend on me financially. The more I thought about it, the more I became convinced that the time spent at my secretarial job could be much better used in the pioneer service. No sooner had I made my decision to be a pioneer than problems arose. I received a tempting offer as a secretary for another firm at double the salary I was then earning. When my father, who is not in the truth, learned of my decision to be a pioneer, he said he would never talk to me again and even threatened to take his life. But I stuck to my decision. Immediately my father ordered me out of the home.</p><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">“During those trying times my mother constantly encouraged me. Also, I will never be able to forget how my loving brothers and sisters so kindly filled that vacuum of love I needed. I will always be grateful to them. The offers for meals were more than the number of meals in a day. The brothers wanted me to keep healthy and even put on some weight so that my father would not think that I was suffering. When I went to Jehovah in prayer, I especially felt the strength and courage to continue in the pioneer service. Then one day, nine months later, I met my father on the street. He found it hard to say ‘hello,’ but I felt he was glad to see me. To my surprise, shortly afterward I received word to come back and live at home and carry on my pioneer service. After my spending more than five years as a pioneer, my father has decided to go to his first convention. I can fully agree with the words recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/201973165/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 27:10</a>: ‘In case my own father and my own mother did leave me, even Jehovah himself would take me up.’”</p>

Many who have rid themselves of needless debt can testify that applying wise counsel to simplify their life has benefited them during the recent economic crises. Rather than finding themselves burdened with possessions they can no longer afford, they are free to expand their ministry.

God’s own unchangeable time schedule calls for that in the near future. Therefore, we as his dedicated people are facing the most faith-testing experience in all the history of Jehovah’s witnesses from the time of Abel the first martyr for Jehovah down to the present “conclusion of the system of things.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961922/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rev. 16:14-16;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961922/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Matt. 24:3;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961922/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 28:20</a>) The world <span id="page754" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="754" data-before-text="754"></span>population is increasing far faster than we are finding the “lost sheep” and bringing them into the safety of Almighty God’s organization.

The Devil’s aim in this is to enable them to accuse us of lawbreaking, since they are unable to find a pretext to take action against us except they find it against us in the law of our God. As in Daniel’s case, they know we will not break God’s law even if man’s law is contrary to it.

The prayer of the persecuted, hated David is most suitable for us to offer now: “Instruct me, O Jehovah, in your way, and lead me in the path of uprightness on account of my foes. Do not give me over to the soul of my adversaries; for against me false witnesses have risen up, and he who launches forth violence.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961922/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 27:11, 12</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">15, 16.

Surely there is no better way to follow than it.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960649/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 27:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960649/1/1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Prov. 3:13-18</a>.</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Following Jehovah’s way, however, is not following the line of least resistance. Far from it! Jesus told us that it is a narrow and cramped way, consequently a way that few find. But it is not so difficult that any, even those who are aged or of tender years, infirm or unlearned, cannot walk in it if they sincerely wish to do so.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960649/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 7:13, 14</a>.</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Note also that Jehovah has only one way, not many different, conflicting and confusing ways. He is a God of order, so he requires that all his servants on earth follow his one way, that they may all be at unity and speak in agreement.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960649/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Cor. 1:10</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">What does it take, what do we need to follow Jehovah’s way? We need, first of all, the right heart condition, the right mental disposition, one of humility, sincerity and mildness. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960649/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 25:9</a>) We also need knowledge, for ignorance will lead us only blindly into the ditch of destruction. We must therefore ‘rove about’ in God’s Word and in the helps he has provided, so as to ‘make our true knowledge abundant.’ We may not be content with knowing merely the first or elemental things about Jehovah’s pure worship but must progress to maturity.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960649/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Dan. 12:4;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960649/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Heb. 6:1</a>.</p><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Today, even as in times past, Jehovah has a visible organization upon the earth. One of its chief purposes is to help Christians to follow Jehovah’s way; so we must avail ourselves of all its provisions. Scripturally identified as the “faithful and discreet slave” class, it provides servants, pastors, teachers and missionaries as well as printed publications. We also need God’s holy spirit, which he provides generously to all who ask him in sincerity and truth.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960649/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45-47;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960649/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Eph. 4:11, 12</a>.</p><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">What does it mean to follow Jehovah’s way in his name? It means to serve as his representatives, bearing his name as his witnesses. It means following his righteous example and being exclusively devoted to the vindication of his name, even as he is. It means following the many instructions he has set forth in his Word. That means we must show a willing spirit and put the interests of his kingdom first in our lives. We may not follow our own whims or inclinations, nor may we content ourselves with haphazard service. It also means learning to work in harmony with his earthly organization and with those dedicated Christians with whom we are associated. There is much work to be done and a short time in which to do it; only by fully cooperating with one another can we work effectively and efficiently. It means working hard to make a success of every assignment given us, whether an assignment for a part in a meeting program or in the training program.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Knowing Jehovah’s way, it would be sin for us to fail to follow it, as well as folly. Let us wisely follow it, for it is the way of happiness and life.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960649/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Jer. 7:23;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960649/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Jas. 4:17</a>.</p>

Walk in it, you people,’ in case you people should go to the right or in case you should go to the left.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959642/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 30:21</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="qu"> 1. How can we come to know God? And what questions need an answer?</p><p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[20]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>ONLY by coming to know Jehovah, the Great Life-giver, do we have hope of lasting life. We must know his directions for us, what he requires of us, the way he wants us to go. That is why the psalmist David said: “Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959642/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 27:11</a>, <em>AV</em>) Although for many the ways of God are obscure and perplexing, to a person who sincerely and humbly inquires for knowledge God’s way becomes a plain, clearly marked way to follow. We can inquire of Jehovah by an examination of the universe and the world we live in, and we see Jehovah to be a creative God, a God of illimitable power, a God of wisdom and knowledge. But what is his name? What is the destiny of man? Why do troubles and unhappiness continue on earth? Are these things from God? Answers to such questions concerning the way before us we can find only by turning to his revealed Word, the Bible.</p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="qu"> 2. (a) What kind of God is Jehovah? (b) What attitude should we have?</p><p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[21]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> Through his Word Jehovah reveals himself to us as the Almighty One, the Ruler of the universe, all powerful, yet merciful, loving and kindly. Besides being a creative God, a God of action and work, he is found to be an accurate timekeeper, as revealed in divine prophecy. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959642/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:17</a>) He is not a God who hides his ways from us, one who wishes to remain hidden from men, but, rather, he desires us to know him and what he requires for us to gain everlasting life. As Peter said: “He is patient with you because he does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959642/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:9</a>) So as we try to learn of Jehovah he will assist us and guide us to the right path when we stray to the right or to the left. Our attitude should be that of a child toward his parents, asking for understanding, and following the right guidance we receive. Just as a child tries to imitate his father and mother, so we should closely imitate the right principles of Jehovah and his wifely organization. As we do so we will find that Jehovah’s way is not only a plain way, a way made clear for us to follow, but also a way of righteousness. Thus the <em>New World Translation</em> shows David’s prayer at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959642/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 27:11</a> to read: “Instruct me, O Jehovah, in your way, and lead me in the path of uprightness on account of my foes.”</p><p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="qu"> 3. Why are we wise to trust in Jehovah?</p><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[22]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> As our Creator, Jehovah knows what is in our best interests. His viewpoint is a far higher and loftier one than ours. He is in position to see the pitfalls and dangers long before we can. His wisdom is not based on the limited wisdom and experience that men can accumulate in a mere fifty years or so, but on the divine wisdom of the ages. Therefore Jehovah God rightly takes the position as our Judge, our Lawgiver and our King. As his inferiors and as being dependent on Jehovah for life, we should certainly take a keen interest in pleasing him by doing all things his way. We can <span id="page521" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="521" data-before-text="521"></span>do this with the confidence that Jehovah will direct us in a way that will not only bring blessings to us but also honor to his name. This should be our goal in life, that in some way we can actively serve our God and honor him. As <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959642/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 23</a> tells us, “Jehovah is my Shepherd. . . . He leads me in the tracks of righteousness for his name’s sake.” We do well to follow that lead willingly under the direction of the Great Shepherd, just as sheep follow the wise and sure guide of a shepherd. As <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1959642/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:5-7</a> says: “Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding. In all your ways take notice of him, and he himself will make your paths straight. Do not become wise in your own eyes. Fear Jehovah and turn away from bad.”</p>

God’s own unchangeable time schedule calls for that in the near future.

The prayer of the persecuted, hated David is most suitable for us to offer now: “Instruct me, O Jehovah, in your way, and lead me in the path of uprightness on account of my foes.

Even if our earthly father and mother abandon us religiously and will not give us such instruction and leading, God will. The prayer of the persecuted, hated David is most suitable for us to offer now: “Instruct me, O Jehovah, in your way, and lead me in the path of uprightness on account of my foes.

They want to break down our faith in the ultimate fulfillment of God’s good promises for the future beyond this world of tribulation. That was how hard they made it for David, who was a prophetic type of Jesus Christ, the Son of David. Under the circumstances did David furnish us a good and correct example? He did.

It was. Despite many hard battles and trials David reigned for forty years and got ready the temple materials and turned his throne over to the temple builder, his beloved son, wise Solomon. But even while he was in the midst of a faith-testing situation he urged us to keep on hoping in Jehovah. By advising others to do so, he proved that he himself was doing so when such hoping was needed to uphold him in his godly integrity. He kept courageous.</p>

<strong>Hope in Jehovah, and Be Courageous</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> King David points to the connection between hope and courage, saying: “Hope in Jehovah; be courageous and let your heart be strong.

Doing so will help us to imitate Jesus in manifesting courage and zeal as we share in the work he commissioned his disciples to do.

<strong>Can You Wait upon Jehovah?</strong><br/><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">At times we come up against situations that are beyond our human capacity to resolve. What then? Wait upon Jehovah​—yes, “Hope in Jehovah”! Not by sitting idly by, but by earnestly praying to Jehovah to direct matters and then leaving the outcome confidently in his hands.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973566/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 27:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1973566/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Prov. 20:22</a>.</p><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">It is vital to recognize that, while Jehovah knows we need certain things, he does not always open the way for us to have all things hoped for right away.

<strong>The Scarlet-colored Beast</strong><br/><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">What about this scarlet-arrayed woman that is shown riding this beast of similar scarlet color? Throughout the Scriptures, from <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962889/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a> to <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962889/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 22:17</a>, a woman is used to picture an organization, and especially a religious organization. Thus unfaithful Jerusalem is described as a prostitute, and the faithful Christian congregation as a chaste virgin. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962889/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 1:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962889/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 11:2</a>) This woman would therefore well picture false religion and, in particular, apostate Christendom, which professes to be espoused to Jesus Christ but has proved unfaithful to him as seen by her <span id="page734" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="734" data-before-text="734"></span>consorting with and making common cause with the governments of this world instead of waiting for Christ’s kingdom. To her the words of condemnation apply: “Babylon the Great, the mother of the harlots and of the disgusting things of the earth.” It is worthy of note that, whereas the King of kings, Jesus Christ, is shown as executing judgment against the various beasts, it is the ten horns or kings of the scarlet-colored beast that are shown bringing about the destruction of this false religious system, a precursor of which is seen in the avowed opposition of communism to all things religious.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962889/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rev. 17:5</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Obviously, this thumbnail sketch, as it were, of the beasts of Revelation, could not touch on all the minute details. These, however, upon study will be found to be consistent with the foregoing, even as noted elsewhere in the publications of the Watch Tower Society.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Surely Jehovah God is causing light to shine upon his prophecies long ago recorded, in keeping with his promise that the path of his servants would grow ever lighter. Such is indeed reason for all his servants to have increased faith that He at all times has full control of world affairs and that the Bible is his inspired Word. It should strengthen their hope in the ultimate triumph of righteousness and assist them in serving God with the “form of worship that is clean and undefiled from the standpoint of our God and Father,” keeping themselves without spot from the world.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962889/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jas. 1:27</a>.</p>

That disciple was known to the high priest, and he went in with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest, but Peter was standing outside at the door. Therefore the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper and brought Peter in.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962001/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">John 18:15, 16</a>) But did these two disciples have enough courage to stand up for Jesus Christ then? Did they have the faith and strength necessary to stand alone as Jesus was now standing alone before the Jewish religious leaders and later before Roman rulers? It was going to come to that test for them. Jesus was then undergoing a supreme test of his courage. He had a full comprehension of the fight that was then on between Satan and himself. Jesus was trusting in Jehovah! He was setting the right example for all lovers of life to follow. He could say: “Be courageous and let your heart be strong. Yes, hope in Jehovah.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962001/13/0" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 27:14</a>.</p><p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Previously that same night, Nisan 14, Jesus had said to his eleven faithful disciples: “You are the ones that have stuck with me in my trials; and I make a covenant with you, just as my Father has made a covenant with me, for a kingdom.” Then Jesus addressed his words to Peter and said: “Simon, Simon, look! Satan has demanded to have you men to sift you as wheat. But I have made supplication for you that your faith may not give out; and you, when once you have returned, strengthen your brothers.” Then Peter said to him: “Lord, I am ready to go with you both into prison and into death.” But Jesus said: “I tell you, Peter, A cock will not crow today until you have three times denied knowing me.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962001/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Luke 22:28-34</a>) Jesus knew that Satan would try to sift all Christians as wheat, and therefore they all needed more faith. They needed a helper, the holy spirit, from God, and this Jesus promised them. He said: “I am telling you the truth, It is for your benefit I am going away. For if I do not go away, the helper will by no means come to you; but if I do go my way, I will send him to you. And when that one arrives he will give the world convincing evidence concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962001/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">John 16:7, 8</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>AN AID TO COURAGE</strong></p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 8.

Peter emphatically stated: “This Jesus God resurrected, of which fact we are all witnesses. Therefore because he was exalted to the right hand of God and received the promised holy spirit from the Father, he has poured out this which you see and hear.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962001/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Acts 2:17,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1962001/17/1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 32, 33</a>) On that festival day of Pentecost “about three thousand souls were added” to the Christian congregation.

God’s own unchangeable time schedule calls for that in the near future.

(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961922/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 94:20;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961922/10/1" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Dan. 6:5-9</a>) Will our God leave us and give us over to the soulful desire of our adversaries who now wield authority? Not if we refuse to compromise, not if we keep his way even at cost of suffering.</p><p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu">14. As expressed by David, for what do we have urgent need, and why?</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Our urgent need is for continued instruction in the principles of God’s righteous way, that we may have his leading in the way in which our foes cannot rightly accuse us of lawbreaking toward God. Even if our earthly father and mother abandon us religiously and will not give us such instruction and leading, God will. The prayer of the persecuted, hated David is most suitable for us to offer now: “Instruct me, O Jehovah, in your way, and lead me in the path of uprightness on account of my foes. Do not give me over to the soul of my adversaries; for against me false witnesses have risen up, and he who launches forth violence.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961922/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 27:11, 12</a>.</p><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">15, 16.

They will try to make it so hard for us that the ordinary person of this old world would lose all hope for the future. They want to break down our faith in the ultimate fulfillment of God’s good promises for the future beyond this world of tribulation. That was how hard they made it for David, who was a prophetic type of Jesus Christ, the Son of David. Under the circumstances did David furnish us a good and correct example? He did. What did he say for himself and then say to each one of us as fellow witnesses of Jehovah? This:</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> “If I had not had faith in seeing the goodness of Jehovah in the land of those alive—!

It was. Despite many hard battles and trials David reigned for forty years and got ready the temple materials and turned his throne over to the temple builder, his beloved son, wise Solomon. But even while he was in the midst of a faith-testing situation he urged us to keep on hoping in Jehovah. By advising others to do so, he proved that he himself was doing so when such hoping was needed to uphold him in his godly integrity. He kept courageous.</p>

<p><strong>[ <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1204408/962/0">1/1/1995, pp. 28-29</a> ]</strong></p>
<strong>Determining Weakness, Wickedness, and Repentance</strong><br/><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>Practicing What Is Bad</strong></p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">In the book of Psalms, there are many references to wicked people. Such scriptures can further help elders to discern whether a person is basically wicked or weak. For example, consider the inspired prayer of King David: “Do not draw me along with wicked people and with practicers of what is hurtful, those who are speaking peace with their companions but in whose hearts is what is bad.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995003/14/0" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 28:3</a>) Notice that wicked people are mentioned in parallel with “practicers of what is hurtful.” A person who sins because of fleshly weakness is likely to stop as soon as he comes to his senses. If, though, someone <span id="page29" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>‘practices’ what is bad so that it becomes a part of his life, this could be evidence of a wicked heart.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">David mentioned another characteristic of wickedness in that verse. Like Ananias and Sapphira, the wicked person speaks good things with his mouth but has bad things in his heart. He may be a hypocrite​—like the Pharisees of Jesus’ day who ‘outwardly indeed appeared righteous to men but inside were full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.’ (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995003/15/0" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 23:28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995003/15/1" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Luke 11:39</a>) Jehovah hates hypocrisy. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1995003/16/0" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Proverbs 6:16-19</a>) If someone hypocritically tries to deny his serious sins even when speaking with the judicial committee, or grudgingly admits only what is already known by others, refusing to confess fully, this could well be evidence of a wicked heart.</p>
