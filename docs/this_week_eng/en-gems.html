<strong>Why Expect God to Listen to Prayer?</strong><br/><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The fact that God commands us to pray and fills his Word, the Bible, with examples of his servants praying should suffice to show that they can expect God to listen to prayers. But, it may be asked, Why? Why should this great Eternal One, the Most High and Universal Sovereign, listen to the prayers of his servants? One overriding or compelling reason is that the reputation of his name is involved. Thus Moses repeatedly pleaded with God successfully on the basis of God’s name and fame being involved: “Why, O Jehovah, should your anger blaze against your people. . . ? Why should the Egyptians say, ‘With evil intent he brought them out in order to kill them’?” “Were you to put this people to death as one man, then the <span id="page71" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="71" data-before-text="71"></span>nations who have heard of your fame would certainly say this, ‘Because of Jehovah’s not being able to bring this people into the land about which he swore to them he proceeded to slaughter them in the wilderness.”’—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex. 32:11, 12;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/4/1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Num. 14:15, 16</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Thus also Jehovah listened to Joshua when, after the defeat at Ai, he prayed: “Excuse me, O Jehovah, but what can I say after Israel has turned his back before his enemies? And the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and they will certainly surround us and cut our name off from the earth; and what will you do for your great name?” The same was true of the prayer that Hezekiah, faithful king of the two-tribe kingdom of Judah, offered when confronted with the taunts of the sneering king of Assyria, Sennacherib: “And now, O Jehovah our God, save us, please, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, O Jehovah, are God alone.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Josh. 7:8, 9;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 2 Ki. 19:19</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Then again, at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 79:9</a>, we read the prayer: “Help us, O God of our salvation, for the sake of the glory of your name.” And so did Daniel pray, as recorded at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Daniel 9:19</a>: “O Jehovah, do hear. . . . Do not delay, for your own sake, O my God, for your own name has been called upon your city and upon your people.” Many more examples could be given, but these should be sufficient to show that Jehovah God can be expected to listen to prayer, particularly when it is related to the vindication of his name.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>BECAUSE OF HAVING KEPT INTEGRITY</strong></p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Another reason why God’s servants can expect God to listen to their prayers is his love of righteousness: “Jehovah is righteous; he does love righteous acts.” Because of this we read: “Jehovah is far away from the wicked ones, but the prayer of the righteous ones he hears.” Those who follow an upright course can come to God on the basis of their having kept integrity with God.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 11:7;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Prov. 15:29</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Thus Job made an eloquent plea to God on the basis of his having followed a righteous course. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job Chapters 29-31</a>) Likewise King David, in praying for God’s blessing at the time of gathering materials for the building of the temple, said: “I well know, O my God, that you are an examiner of the heart, and that it is in rectitude that you take pleasure. I, for my part, in the uprightness of my heart have voluntarily offered all these things.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/10/0" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Chron. 29:17</a>.</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">In the same vein we find Nehemiah praying: “Do remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my acts of loving-kindness that I have performed in connection with the house of my God and the guardianship of it.” The writer of the letter to the Hebrews, doubtless the apostle Paul, likewise shows the connection between purposeful prayer and right conduct: “Carry on prayer for us, for we trust we have an honest conscience, as we wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things.” In fact, this very same principle is implied in the model prayer Jesus gave his disciples: “Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.” Yes, because of Jehovah’s love for righteousness all who are lovers of God’s righteousness and seek to practice it can expect God to listen to their prayers.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/11/0" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Neh. 13:14;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/11/1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Heb. 13:18;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/11/2" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> Matt. 6:12</a>.</p><p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>PRAYING ON THE BASIS OF INHERITED SIN</strong></p><p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">One of the basic requests imperfect creatures can make in their prayers is that God may forgive them their sins. As the apostle John expresses it: “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous so as to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1965081/12/0" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 John 1:9</a>.</p>

<strong>Repentance That Counts with God</strong><br/><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Also involved in the teaching of repentance is the fact that man is a sinner, and <span id="page398" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="398" data-before-text="398"></span>not only that, but that there are extenuating circumstances that he can plead that justify God’s extending to him the mercy of forgiveness. As King David pleaded when overtaken in a grievous sin: “Look! with error I was brought forth with birth pains, and in sin my mother conceived me.” Were there no extenuating circumstances, no true repentance could be possible and then neither could nor would God forgive. Thus we read: “For if we practice sin willfully after having received the accurate knowledge of the truth, there is no longer any sacrifice for sins left, but there is a certain fearful expectation of judgment.” That is why repentance was not possible for Adam nor for Judas.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 51:5;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/2/1" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Heb. 10:26, 27</a>.</p><p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Scriptural repentance further requires that there be some provision by which or some basis upon which God can uphold the majesty of his law and yet take cognizance of repentance, for he is not given to change. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mal. 3:6</a>) Were his forgiveness to be indiscriminate, all fear and respect for him and his laws would disappear. This provision the Bible shows to be the sacrifice of God’s only-begotten Son: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and it is as a free gift that they are being declared righteous by his undeserved kindness through the release by the ransom paid by Christ Jesus. . . . that he might be righteous even when declaring righteous the man that has faith in Jesus.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rom. 3:23-26</a>.</p><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">And finally, the provision for repentance that counts with God involves the issue, Who is supreme? Jehovah God or Satan the Devil? Scriptural testimony, such as that at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/5/0" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job, chapters one and</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/5/1" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> two</a>, shows that one of the chief ways in which this issue will be determined is on the basis of man’s keeping integrity. To enable lovers of righteousness to keep integrity—and thereby prove the Devil a liar when he boasted that he could turn all men away from God—provision needed to be made for their repentance and forgiveness. That God’s servants appreciated the relationship between forgiveness and the honor of His name the Scriptures repeatedly show: “For your name’s sake, O Jehovah, you must even forgive my error, for it is considerable.” “Help us, O God of our salvation, for the sake of the glory of your name, and deliver us and cover over our sins on account of your name.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/6/0" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 25:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/6/1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 79:9</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>WHAT IT MEANS TO REPENT</strong></p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">For many centuries Jehovah God overlooked the sins of ignorance of the nations, but beginning with the conversion of Cornelius and in a special way in our day “he is telling mankind that they should all everywhere repent. Because he has set a day in which he purposes to judge the inhabited earth in righteousness by” Jesus Christ. Particularly pertinent to our day are also the words of the apostle Peter: “Jehovah is not slow respecting his promise, as some people consider slowness, but he is patient with you because he does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/7/0" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 17:30, 31;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/7/1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2 Pet. 3:9</a>.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">For us to approach God and win his good pleasure by sincere repentance we must “believe that he is and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.” More than that, we must also take in knowledge of his righteous requirements, which are summed up in this way: “What doth Jehovah require of thee, but to do justly, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with thy God?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/8/0" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Heb. 11:6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/8/1" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Mic. 6:8</a>, <em>AS.</em></p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">As we come to know God and his righteous requirements we must become ‘conscious of our spiritual need,’ acutely aware of our sinful, undone condition and feel <span id="page399" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="399" data-before-text="399"></span>truly sorry about our sins. We must feel deeply, as did the tax collector going up to the temple to pray, who, “standing at a distance was not willing even to raise his eyes heavenward, but kept beating his chest, saying: ‘O God, be gracious to me a sinner.’” Like sincere repentance was also expressed by Ezra, on behalf of the erring returned exiles, and by the apostle Peter after he had denied Jesus.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/9/0" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 18:13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/9/1" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Ezra 9:3-15;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1960483/9/2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Matt. 26:75</a>.</p>

Yes! This was indicated by Isaiah’s next words: “All sighing due to her I have caused to cease.” These are really the words of “Jehovah of armies,” the Sovereign Lord of the universe. By his use of Elam and Media as his agencies he caused “all sighing” due to oppressive Babylon to cease.

Upon that ark there were two golden cherubs with wings stretched out toward one another, and, centered above, there appeared the so-called Shekinah light that represented the presence of Jehovah God at his temple. In a miraculous vision of the interior of the temple the prophet Isaiah saw Jehovah on his throne and attended by spirit creatures called seraphs.

When Samson’s parents asked the name of the angel that had appeared to them, he rebuked them, saying: “Just why should you ask about my name, when it is a wonderful one?”—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961047/17/0" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Judg. 13:18</a>.</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Angels are generally represented as males, because God and his Son are spoken of as males. They are, however, without sex, for Jesus told that those who come forth upon earth in the resurrection will not marry, because they will be like angels. It was the pleasures of sex that caused <span id="page58" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="58" data-before-text="58"></span>certain angels to leave their heavenly positions in Noah’s day.

But Jehovah’s spirit entered in, and my wife suggested that maybe she could get a job. <span id="page447" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="447" data-before-text="447"></span>This she was able to do, and while her salary would not meet all expenses and pay for the trip, it did give us something. So she took up her pad and pencil as a secretary, and I took up her apron and saved my voice. With a contribution from the congregation to fill the gap, I am, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, able to attend the Kingdom Ministry School.”</p><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">A congregation servant from Brooklyn, New York, says that on three separate occasions he approached his employer to ask for time off to attend the Kingdom Ministry School. All three times he was turned down, and the third time the response was an angry one. Three days later it was time to leave for school, so the brother approached his employer again, this time requesting his pay in full, since he was going to have to say Good-by. On this occasion, after a long conversation in which the purpose of the school was again explained, leave of absence was granted.</p><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Some who have attended the school have lost their secular work when doing so, but even these do not feel as if the Lord had let them down. Not at all! He blessed them far beyond their expectations with good things at the Kingdom Ministry School. Nor will He fail to hear their prayer in the days to come, when they ask: “Give us our bread for the day according to the day’s requirement.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961527/0/0" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 11:3</a>) As Jesus himself assured, those who earnestly seek first the kingdom of God will find that all the other things necessary to life are added to them.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961527/1/0" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 6:33</a>.</p><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The example of these overseers in putting the Kingdom interests first is a fine one. They are, as the apostle Peter said they should be: “examples to the flock.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961527/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:3</a>) Others associated with the New World society will emulate their good example. When confronted with circumstances in which secular work might make it impossible to attend a convention of Jehovah’s people or when secular work begins to crowd out congregation meetings, they will remember the counsel found at <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1961527/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:7</a>: “Remember those who are governing you, who have spoken the word of God to you, and as you contemplate how their conduct turns out imitate their faith.”</p><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"></p>

So the Roman “penny” or (literally) denarius began to circulate throughout the land, this denarius equaling about eight pence and two farthings in British money in the days of King James I of England or 17 cents American money. In Jesus’ day this amount of money had such a value that it was paid as a wage for the work of a day of twelve hours.

Jehovah God mentioned this at the time that he proposed this Law covenant to the forefathers of the Jews of Jesus’ day, for God said: “Now if you will strictly obey my voice and will indeed keep my covenant, then you will certainly become my special property out of all other peoples, because the whole earth belongs to me.

For his keeping that Law covenant perfectly, he deserved to be a king and priest in an earthly way. Because, by birth, he belonged to the Jewish “vineyard” planted by Jehovah God, it was quite appropriate for Jesus to compare his heavenly Father, Jehovah God, to a vine cultivator, saying to his apostles: “I am the true vine, and my Father is the cultivator.

(Note <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977363/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Judges 9:15</a>.) No man planted those tall wide-spreading cedars there. Cedar trees were already on site before the confusion of the human language at the Tower of Babel scattered the builders in all directions from ancient Babylon on the Euphrates River, in the second century after the global flood. The Creator of heaven and earth takes the credit for planting those cedars. So <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977363/3/0" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 80:10</a> speaks of them as “the cedars of God,” and <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1977363/4/0" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 104:16</a> calls them “the cedars of Lebanon that he [Jehovah] planted.”</p>

The snout of the wild boar is specially suited to rooting for food amid forest undergrowth. The tusks, especially those of the male, constitute a formidable weapon, with which it can easily rip up a horse. This animal is not only dangerous but also destructive, it being said that a group of them can ruin an entire vineyard in one night. Its diet, although basically vegetarian, includes a great variety of foods such as roots, grain, earthworms, snails, small animals, birds’ eggs, and the like.</p>

It appears that <em>shoh·pharʹ</em> trumpets were also blown at this time as well as on the other new moons, as indicated by <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200011468/2/0" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 81:3</a>.

<strong>Throne</strong><br/><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Jehovah covenanted that the throne of David’s seed should “itself become one lasting to time indefinite.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014291/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">1 Chron. 17:11-14</a>) In announcing the fulfillment of this promise, the angel Gabriel said to Mary: “Jehovah God will give [Jesus] the throne of David his father, and he will rule as king over the house of Jacob forever, and there will be no end of his kingdom.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014291/30/0" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Luke 1:32, 33</a>) Not only would there be an inheritance of an earthly dominion on Jesus’ part, but he would share Jehovah’s throne, which is universal. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014291/31/0" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Rev. 3:21;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014291/31/1" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> Isa. 66:1</a>) In turn, Jesus promised to share his throne of kingly authority with all those who, like his faithful apostles, <span id="page1597" class="pageNum" aria-hidden="true" data-no="1597" data-before-text="1597"></span>were in the new covenant with his Father, and who would conquer the world as Jesus had done. This would be granted to them in the “re-creation,” during Jesus’ second presence.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014291/32/0" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Matt. 19:28;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014291/32/1" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> Luke 22:20,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014291/32/2" data-bid="33-3" class="b"> 28-30;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014291/32/3" data-bid="33-4" class="b"> Rev. 3:21</a>.</p><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">In harmony with Jehovah’s prophecy through Zechariah that the man named “Sprout,” the builder of the future temple for Jehovah, “must become a priest upon his throne,” Paul records concerning Jesus: “We have such a high priest as [Melchizedek, a king-priest], and he has sat down at the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014291/33/0" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Zech. 6:11-13;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014291/33/1" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> Heb. 8:1</a>) In addition to Christ Jesus, John saw the whole spiritual house or sanctuary of God, the faithful Christian congregation, enthroned as king-priests to rule for a thousand years.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014291/34/0" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Rev. 20:4,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014291/34/1" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 6;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014291/34/2" data-bid="35-3" class="b"> 1 Pet. 2:5</a>.</p><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">As foretold in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014291/35/0" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Psalm 45:6</a>, and applied by Paul in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014291/36/0" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:8</a>, Jesus’ throne, his office or authority as sovereign, has its source in Jehovah: “God is your throne forever.” On the other hand, the Devil, too, provides basis or authority for his organizations to rule, as emphasized in <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014291/37/0" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Revelation 13:1, 2</a>, with respect to the ‘wild beast that came out of the sea’: “The dragon gave the beast its power and its throne and great authority.” When Satan offered similar power and authority to Jesus Christ, his price was stated: “If you do an act of worship before me, it will all be yours.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014291/38/0" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Luke 4:5-7</a>) Correspondingly, the grant of a throne or authority to the “wild beast” must have been on the condition of its serving Satan.</p><p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">In discussing Jesus’ position as God’s Master Worker, Paul mentions that through Christ “thrones” were created. The term appears to refer to positions of official authority, both visible and invisible, within God’s administrative arrangement.—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1200014291/39/0" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Col. 1:16</a>.</p><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"></p>

<strong>“Bless Jehovah”—Why?</strong><br/><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><strong><em>Lesson for Us:</em></strong> That Jehovah <em>richly</em> rewards those who obey him is indicated by reference to the “fat of the wheat.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986928/26/0" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Psalm 81:16</a>) Here the word “fat” is used figuratively to connote the best. (Compare <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986928/27/0" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Psalm 63:5</a>.) If the Israelites had ‘listened to Jehovah’s voice,’ he would have blessed them with “the fat of the wheat”​—the best, the choicest of things. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986928/28/0" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 81:11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986928/28/1" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> Deuteronomy 32:13, 14</a>) Similarly, if we ‘listen to Jehovah’s voice,’ he will richly bless us.​—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1986928/29/0" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Proverbs 10:22</a>.</p>
